investors sentiments,Sell-off erases Trump Media shares' 2024 gains,2024-09-15,2024-09-04,Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93p2v72dpdo,"Donald Trump's media company was hit by a fresh round of selling on Wednesday, wiping out gains the share price had enjoyed this year alongside the rising political fortunes of its namesake. Shares fell more than 6% to less than $17, which is less than what they were worth at the start of 2024.  The share price, which hit a peak in April during the former president's criminal trial, has fallen more than 70% from its high.  The firm, operator of the social media platform Truth Social, still boasts a market value of more than $3.3bn - a hefty sum for a small company with shrinking revenue and growing losses.  Mr Trump's victory in the January Republican primary had helped to stoke interest in the Trump Media at the start of the year. Buyers snapped up shares of Digital World Acquisition Corp., a publicly-traded shell company, which was created to buy Trump Media and was seen on Wall Street as a proxy for the firm.  Demand jumped farther around the time the merger was formally completed in March. The price has swung wildly in the months since.  Its most recent high came in July, after Trump survived an assassination attempt and before President Joe Biden bowed out of the race, but the price has slid lower in recent weeks.  The falls come as the company approaches the date at which Trump and other early investors will be free to start selling their shares. Mr Trump's stake is currently worth about $2bn, down from more than $6bn a few months ago.  Analysts had warned investors to expect big swings in value, describing it as a ""meme stock"", propelled by sentiment rather than its financial characteristics."
investors sentiments,Allegations mount against India market regulator,2024-09-15,2024-09-09,Nikhil Inamdar & Archana Shukla,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3kvzp317o,"India’s market regulator is facing a threat to its credibility after a barrage of allegations against its chief, top fund managers have told the BBC. Multiple charges, mostly around conflict of interest, have surfaced against Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), from at least four different corners over the past month. She has denied most of them and not publicly responded to some. This comes amid a bull run in India’s equity markets, which are among the world’s best performing this year. Foreign investors have pumped in over $6bn (£4.5bn), while millions of new mom-and-pop investors have opened electronic accounts to invest in a mutual funds and initial public offering (IPO) frenzy. Trouble for Ms Buch began in August when US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research accused her and her husband of holding investments in an offshore fund used by the Adani Group, implying it was why Sebi was dragging its feet on an investigation against Adani over allegations of accounting fraud and market manipulation. Since then a number of other accusations have come to the fore. The main opposition Congress party has accused Ms Buch of receiving rental income from a company she was investigating. It has also alleged that she held an ""office of profit"" at ICICI Bank, one of India’s largest private lenders, continuing to earn large sums of money through Employee Stock Ownership Plans (Esops) long after her stint with them was over. Subhash Chandra Goyal, the chairman emeritus of media giant Zee Entertainment Enterprises, blamed her for the collapse of a merger between his company and Sony Enterprises, stating ""I am convinced that the Sebi chairperson is corrupt"" and calling her ""vindictive"" in a press conference. He is currently facing regulatory action, charges of fund diversion and is barred from holding key posts in listed firms. But perhaps most damaging of all is growing internal dissent within Sebi, which has now spilled out into the public domain. On 5 September, furious staff members staged a rare protest outside the regulator’s headquarters demanding Ms Buch’s resignation. Around 1,000 employees had reportedly complained of a toxic work culture in a letter to the finance ministry earlier, local media reported. They complained of ""immense pressure"" and ""shouting, scolding and public humiliation” becoming a norm in meetings. Sebi has publicly rejected the claims as “misplaced”, adding that “junior officers have been misguided, perhaps by external elements”. However, protesters on Thursday called for an immediate retraction of this statement. “This is unprecedented,” says Hemindra Hazari, an independent business analyst. “Until yesterday it was allegations from the outside, now internal problems have become public. Something is seriously wrong.” Ms Buch has strongly defended herself, denying any conflict of interest claims in the Hindenburg case, while ICICI Bank has denied paying her a salary or Esops and said she only received her retirement benefits after she left the bank. The Sebi chief has so far not made a public statement on protesting employees or the criticisms levelled at her by Mr Chandra. Sebi didn't respond to the BBC's request for comment. An alumnus of India’s premier management school, Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, Ms Buch is a trailblazer in many ways. The youngest and first female chairperson to lead Sebi, she became the first chief to have come from a private corporate background. Despite being credited for reforming Sebi with stricter insider trading rules and auditing frameworks, allegations of a lack of transparency in her own financial affairs raise serious concerns about whether Sebi holds its top officials to the same standards it expects from public companies, experts say. “The crux of the issue is about disclosure rules governing the senior-most officials at regulatory bodies, given their access to unpublished price-sensitive information. Their orders and decisions can dramatically impact stock prices, raising the stakes for stringent disclosure and compliance norms,” writes Sucheta Dalal, a veteran financial journalist, in a column for Moneylife magazine. Standards for heads of regulators are much more stringent in developed countries where they are required to, for instance, “divest from direct holdings in entities that could post conflict of interest”, says Ms Dalal, adding that certain discrepancies in the statement put out by ICICI Bank about its Esop policy have complicated rather than clarified matters. Regulators like Sebi typically have political appointees and lateral hires from the private sector. Sebi is run by a board with members from the finance ministry, the central bank and others nominated by the federal government. The Buch episode is a “learning” not just for Sebi, but also for other Indian regulators like the insurance watchdog or the Competition Commission to apply more robust disclosure processes, says Shriram Subramanian of the proxy advisory firm InGovern Research. “It will bring more transparency,” Mr Subramanian adds. For the moment, investors seem unperturbed by the events of the past month. “Global investors already pay a regulatory risk premium when they invest in India, they will ignore this,” said a veteran trader. But things could take a turn for the worse if the controversy snowballs further, says Mr Hazari. “Institutional money can flee if internal warnings go out around compliance issues. And then retail investors will slowly start pulling out of the market,” he adds. With pressure mounting from both outside and inside Sebi, some say Ms Buch is now faced with the very real question of leaving her post. Her position was ""untenable"" a few weeks ago, but has become increasingly ""unsustainable"" now, Subhash Garg, a former finance secretary, told journalist Barkha Dutt on Mojo Story, a digital outlet. A resignation or a suspension would be seen as an admission of guilt, which neither Ms Buch nor the government would want. At least three market experts the BBC spoke with said the most likely outcome of the controversy will be that Ms Buch's appointment won’t be renewed. Her current three-year tenure as chairperson ends in February 2025. “For me what’s most astounding is that the government has been totally silent. They need to step in now. When serious allegations are made against the head of a regulator, the government or the judiciary are the only higher authorities which can authorise a credible investigation,” said Mr Hazari. Others have also called for the board of Sebi to step in and publicly address the allegations. An executive at a foreign fund house who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity said global investors will watch the way the government handles the matter, and how swiftly it acts.  “This will affect investor sentiment going forward,” he said."
investors sentiments,Slowest US inflation since 2021 raises rate cut hope,2024-09-15,2024-08-14,Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy3wy522dyo,"Consumer prices in the US rose at the slowest pace in more than three years last month, bolstering the case for the central bank to start cutting interest rates. Overall, prices rose 2.9% over the 12 months to July, the smallest annual increase since March 2021 and down from 3% in June, the Labor Department said.  The monthly inflation report was being closely watched after signs of weaker-than-expected jobs growth in July sparked stock market turmoil and recession fears earlier this month.  Analysts said the figures should help convince the Federal Reserve that high borrowing costs are working to return inflation back to normal, despite upticks in housing and food costs. The Federal Reserve has held its key lending rate at 5.3% - a roughly two-decade high - since July 2023, a move that has hit the public in the form of higher rates for mortgages, credit cards and other loans.  By keeping rates high, the bank is hoping to discourage borrowing and cool the demand pressures that were helping drive up prices of homes, cars and other items. But the central bank is under pressure to cut rates as inflation, which tracks the pace of price increases, has started to move closer to its 2% target rate, helped by lower oil prices and resolution of Covid-era supply chain crunches.  The three major stock indexes in the US were little changed after the report, which came in roughly as expected. Julian Howard, chief multi-asset investment strategist at GAM Investments, said a rate cut in September now looked ""all but certain"". But he said he thought the Fed would remain cautious about signalling the path ahead, pointing to last month's uptick in inflation in the UK, where the Bank of England recently cut rates. ""While the UK's higher-than-2% figure, was to an extent expected, it is still slightly jarring when inflation comes in higher than the target after a recent rate cut,"" he said.  ""Whatever the Fed does in September, it will be very keen to convey ongoing data dependency from one meeting to the next, rather than setting out a trajectory that might fail to materialise."" Inflation in the US has already receded significantly since June 2022, when it hit 9.1%. Over the past year, prices for appliances and cars have fallen, along with prices for other items such as airline tickets and furniture.  Petrol prices - a key determinant of economic sentiment in the US - have dropped 2.2%. But rising prices for household staples such as groceries have kept political pressure on the White House during a presidential election year, weighing on Democrats. Housing has accounted for more than 70% of inflation over the past year, as rents jumped more than 5%. Grocery prices also rose 1.1%, while car insurance has soared more than 18%. In a statement, President Joe Biden said the report showed ""progress fighting inflation and lowering costs for American households"", while the Trump campaign focused on the 20% rise in prices since 2021, calling the phenomenon ""Kamalanonics"", after election rival vice-president Kamala Harris. On Wall Street, the figures left investors divided about how much the Fed should cut rates in September - whether by 0.25 percentage points or more. Wells Fargo analysts said they were betting on the Fed moving more aggressively to cut rates, despite the acceleration in rents in July. ""Through the see-saw ride of recent monthly prints, the moderation in core inflation has broadened beyond goods, with services inflation—most notably housing—also cooling over the past year,"" economists led by Sarah House wrote.  ""The continued steady slowdown in inflation, when paired with the rise in the unemployment rate and deterioration in other labor market indicators, leads us to believe the [Fed] will want to move quickly."""
investors sentiments,China's rhetoric turns dangerously real for Taiwanese,2024-09-15,2024-08-15,Rupert Wingfield-Hayes,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8dy437pdno,"Calls to denounce “die hard"" Taiwanese secessionists, a tipline to report them and punishments that include the death penalty for “ringleaders” –  Beijing’s familiar rhetoric against Taiwan is turning dangerously real. The democratically-governed island has grown used to China’s claims. Even the planes and ships that test its defences have become a routine provocation. But the recent moves to criminalise support for it are unnerving Taiwanese who live and work in China, and those back home. “I am currently planning to speed up my departure,” a Taiwanese businesswoman based in China said – this was soon after the Supreme Court ushered in changes allowing life imprisonment and even the death penalty for those guilty of advocating for Taiwanese independence. “I don’t think that is making a mountain out of a molehill. The line is now very unclear,” says Prof Chen Yu-Jie, a legal scholar at Taiwan’s Academia Sinica. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office was quick to assure the 23 million Taiwanese that this is not targeted at them, but at an “extremely small number of hard-line independence activists”. The “vast majority of Taiwanese compatriots have nothing to fear,” the office said. But wary Taiwanese say they don’t want to test that claim. The BBC has spoken to several Taiwanese who live and work in China who said they were either planning to leave soon or had already left. Few were willing to be interviewed on record; none wanted to be named. “Any statement you make now could be misinterpreted and you could be reported. Even before this new law China was already encouraging people to report on others,” the businesswoman said. That was made official last week when Chinese authorities launched a website identifying Taiwanese public figures deemed “die hard” separatists. The site included an email address where people could send “clues and crimes” about those who had been named, or anyone else they suspected. Scholars believe Beijing hopes to emulate the success of Hong Kong’s national security laws, which it said were necessary for stability - but they have crushed the city’s pro-democracy movement as former lawmakers, activists and ordinary citizens critical of the government have been jailed under them. By making pro-Taiwanese sentiments a matter of national security, Beijing hopes to “cut off the movement’s ties with the outside world and to divide society in Taiwan between those who support Taiwan independence and those who do not”, Prof Chen says. She believes the guidance from the Supreme Court will almost certainly result in prosecutions of some Taiwanese living in China. “This opinion has been sent to all levels of law enforcement nationwide. So this is a way of saying to them – we want to see more cases like this being prosecuted, so go and find one.” “We must be even more cautious,” said a Taiwanese man based in Macau. He said he had always been prepared for threats, but the new legal guidance had made his friends “express concern” about his future in the Chinese city. “In recent years, patriotic education has become prevalent in Macau, with more assertive statements on Taiwan creating a more tense atmosphere compared to pre-pandemic times,” he added. Taiwan, which has powerful allies in the US, the EU and Japan, rejects Beijing’s plans for “reunification” – but fears have been growing that China’s Xi Jinping has sped up the timeline to take the island, an avowed goal of the Chinese Communist Party. For more than 30 years Taiwanese companies - iPhone-maker Foxconn, advanced chips giant TSMC and electronics behemoth Acer – have played a key role in China’s growth. The prosperity also brought Taiwanese from across the strait who were in search of jobs and brighter prospects. “I absolutely loved Shanghai when I first moved there. It felt so much bigger, more exciting, more cosmopolitan than Taipei,” says Zoe Chu*. She spent more than a decade in Shanghai managing foreign musicians who were in high demand from clubs and venues in cities across China. This was the mid-2000s when China was booming, drawing money and people from across the globe. Shanghai was at the heart of it - bigger, shinier and trendier than any other Chinese city. “My Shanghainese friends were dismissive of Beijing. They called it the big northern village,” Ms Chu recalls. “Shanghai was the place to be. It had the best restaurants, the best nightclubs, the coolest people. I felt like such a country bumpkin, but I learned fast.” By the end of that decade – in 2009 - more than 400,000 Taiwanese lived in China. By 2022, that number had plummeted to 177,000, according to official figures from Taiwan. “China had changed,” says Ms Chu, who left Shanghai in 2019. She now works for a medical company in Taipei and has no plans to return. “I am Taiwanese,” she explains. “It’s no longer safe for us there.” The Taiwanese exodus has been driven by the same things that have pushed huge numbers of foreigners to leave China – a sluggish economy, growing hostility between Beijing and Washington and, most of all, the sudden and sweeping lockdowns during the Covid pandemic. But Taiwanese in China have also been worried because the government doesn’t see them as “foreigners”, which makes them especially vulnerable to state repression. Senior Taiwanese officials have told the BBC that 15 Taiwanese nationals are currently being held in China for various alleged crimes, “including violations of the anti-secession law”. In 2019, China jailed a Taiwanese businessman for espionage after he was caught taking photos of police officers in Shenzen – a charge he denied. He was only released last year. In April 2023, China confirmed that it had arrested a Taiwan-based publisher for “endangering national security”. He still remains in custody. Amy Hsu*, who once lived and worked in China, says she is now scared to even visit because of her job. After returning to Taiwan, she began volunteering at an NGO which helped people who had fled Hong Kong to settle in Taiwan. “It is definitely more dangerous for me now,” she says.  “In 2018, they began using surveillance cameras to fine people for jaywalking and the system could identify your face and send the fine directly to your address.” She says the extent of surveillance disturbed her – and she worries it can be used to go after even visitors, especially those on a list of potential offenders. “Oh I am definitely on the list. I am a hardline pro-independence [guy] with lots of ideas,” chuckles Robert Tsao, a 77-year-old tech billionaire, who founded one of Taiwan’s largest chip-makers, United Micro-electronics Corporation (UMC). Mr Tsao was born in Beijing, but today he supports Taiwan independence and avoids not just China, but also Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand and even Singapore. Mr Tsao was not always hostile to China. He was one of the first Taiwanese investors to set up advanced chip-making factories in China. But he says the crackdown in Hong Kong changed his mind: “It was so free and vibrant and now it’s gone. And they want to do the same to us here.” “This new ruling is actually helping people like me,” he says. He believes it will backfire, increasing the resolve of Taiwanese people to resist China. “They say the new law will only affect a few hard-line independence supporters like me, but so many Taiwanese people either support independence or the status quo [keep things as they are], which is the same thing, so we have all become criminals.” * Names changed on request of contributors "
investors sentiments,Global stocks climb as US recession fears ease,2024-09-15,2024-08-09,Michael Race & João da Silva,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dpm9n2g6go,"The stock index of the UK's biggest publicly-listed companies edged higher on Friday after concerns eased over the state of the US economy.  The FTSE 100, which is made up of the country's biggest businesses including banks, airlines and housebuilders, rose in early trading. It follows stronger trading in the US where stock markets had their best day in almost two years on Thursday. Global financial markets have been spooked in the past seven days over fears that world's biggest economy could be heading for a slowdown. But on Thursday, official data revealed US unemployment claims rose by less than expected. The benchmark S&P 500 index ended the day 2.3% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.8%, and the Nasdaq jumped 2.9%. In London, the FTSE 100 ticked up 0.7%. Stock markets indexes in Paris and Frankfurt followed a similar path. Stocks in Asia made modest gains, recovering some of the losses after Japanese indexes had their worst day since 1987 earlier in the week. ""The [US] latest jobless claims data, though not normally a major market event, supports the view that recent pessimism may have been overdone,"" said UBS Global Wealth Management. Official figures from the US Labor Department showed first-time claims for unemployment benefits in the US had fallen more than expected to 233,000 last week. But despite the apparent recovery in global markets, analysts warn that trading will likely remain choppy for the time being. ""The market volatility is creating trading opportunities for investors over the short term,"" said Peter McGuire from trading platform XM.com. ""It will be a bumpy ride over the election season and we all await the [US Federal Reserve] policy decision in September."" The Federal Reserve held off cutting interest rates last week - something that typically boosts growth - in contrast to other central banks such as the Bank of England. But, this week's market upheaval stoked further speculation about when - and by how much - the Fed will cut borrowing costs. ""[The] Fed is now likely to cut rates up to 50bps in September which in turn supports expanding valuation for the market,"" said Jun Bei Liu, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners."
investors sentiments,Tinder parent company cuts jobs as subscriber numbers slump,2024-09-15,2024-07-31,Liv McMahon,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0xj08l9055o,"Tinder's parent company, Match Group Inc, plans to cut 6% of its global workforce amid a continued slump in users paying for its most popular dating app. The dating app giant, which also owns Hinge, Plenty of Fish and OKCupid, has revealed an 8% fall in the number of paying Tinder users. It said job cuts would largely stem from shutting down its live-streaming app Hakuna and removing live-streaming features available in some of its dating apps. Match has now reported declines in Tinder subscriber numbers for several consecutive quarters - though it remains the world's most popular dating app, and the latest dip was less than some investors anticipated. The company said in a letter to shareholders on Tuesday that its latest fall in subscribers was an ""improvement"" on a 9% dip in the previous quarter. Tinder is increasingly being challenged by rival dating apps such as Bumble, which reported an increase in its number of paying users last quarter. “Despite owning some of the best-known brands in the dating market, Match Group has been struggling with intense competition,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""A lack of innovation seems to be a key bugbear and activists are putting pressure on the company to come up with some new ideas to drive up user numbers."" Some Match Group investors have called on the company to improve its performance and deliver more value for shareholders - for whom the company's stock price has been trading down at more than 60% on its 2021 peak. Match Group told shareholders in its letter that Tinder's growth had previously been driven by its ""engaging and fun user experience"" - key to which has been the convenience of swiping left or right on potential matches. But it said that what users want from dating apps has since changed. ""Sentiment has shifted as users seek a lower-pressure experience with greater authenticity that more easily delivers desired connections,"" it said. ""We expect Tinder to begin testing new lower pressure forms of discovery in the coming quarters, including more ways for users to use Tinder with friends."" Tinder has recently rolled out new ways for people to meet people on the app - including letting friends and family members play matchmaker - and artificial intelligence (AI) features helping users pick the best images to use on their profiles. Meanwhile, Mr Mould added that Tinder's slowed decline in paying users, along with the growth of Hinge, presented a ""glimmer of hope"" for its parent company. The number of people paying for the app - which Match says is ""designed to be deleted"" - has increased sharply, with the revenues it generates rising by 48% compared to the same period in 2023. Tinder, comparatively, saw its direct revenue grow by just 1% across the same period. Match Group's share price rose by nearly 10% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after reporting its results. "
investors sentiments,The real California scandal that led to Chinatown,2024-09-15,2024-06-21,Adam Scovell,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240620-the-real-life-california-scandal-that-inspired-the-iconic-los-angeles-thriller,"Now 50 years old, Chinatown is one of the all-time great crime films – and that's partly because of a potent story based on the real history of California's so-called ""water wars"". ""Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown…"" is one of the most famous lines in film history. The dialogue closes a lynchpin of post-war US cinema: Roman Polanski's Chinatown (1974). The 1930s-set neo-noir, which turned 50 this week, is still a regular talking point in popular culture, for everything from its celebrated screenplay by Robert Towne (for which it won its sole Oscar) to its phenomenal score by Jerry Goldsmith, its astonishing lead performances by Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston, to the subsequent disgrace of its criminally convicted, fugitive director. Polanski and Towne's story was part of a particular trend in crime cinema of the period. While Watergate-inflected thrillers like Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation (1974) and Alan J Pakula's The Parallax View (1972), and hyper-aggressive cop flicks like Don Siegel's Dirty Harry (1971) and William Friedkin's The French Connection (1971), were all caught up in present day issues, a new alternative to gritty procedurals and paranoid political thrillers was becoming popular – namely the lavish period crime film. Arguably peaking with Coppola's The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather Part II (1974), the movement was really kickstarted by the success of Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967), and also resulted in the likes of Dick Richards' Farewell, My Lovely (1975), Bernardo Bertolucci's The Conformist (1970) and Jacques Deray's Borsalino (1970), to name a few. Essentially, these films denied the nostalgic draw of the past to instead explore its dark underbelly – and like a number of them, Chinatown expressed this resistance by actually building on real history.   The film looked back to the dirty dealings behind Los Angeles's transformation into a major urban centre, taking inspiration from the original California ""water wars"" that erupted at the turn of the 20th Century. These occurred when the Los Angeles water department bought up a swathe of land in east California in order to divert water to sate its growing population, to the detriment of the rural community it was taking supply away from. What's more, Chinatown borrows some aspects of the life of civil engineer William Mulholland, the controversial figure  who was the first superintendent of the Los Angeles water system and tasked with creating the aqueduct to ensure the city had sufficient water supply; all this aided the film's sense of authenticity to the point where its dark fictions have influenced the perception of the city's real history. Chinatown begins with a quintessential film noir set-up. In 1930s Los Angeles, private detective JJ Gittes (Nicholson) is hired by a woman who goes by the name of Evelyn Mulwray to prove her husband's infidelity. Believing it's a simple case, he investigates the woman's husband, Hollis (Darrell Zwerling), obtaining photo proof of him meeting a woman. However, things get complicated when these pictures of Hollis and his apparent mistress are splashed in the newspaper, and it turns out that the woman who hired him was only pretending to be Evelyn. The real Evelyn (Faye Dunaway) turns up at Gittes' office and threatens to sue him for the scandal. Gittes learns that Hollis is a senior engineer at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and Evelyn's father is Noah Cross (Huston) – the former co-owner of the department with Hollis, who is determined for the city's latest dam scheme to go ahead. From there, he is drawn into a world of corruption, violence and murder. Hollis soon turns up dead in a water reserve, and Evelyn is hiding an even darker secret that may just explain the violence that comes Gittes's way as he searches for the woman who he first saw Hollis meet (at both Evelyn's and Noah's separate and competing requests). When quizzed about his work in 2001, Towne suggested that he was initially drawn to journalism before screenwriting. ""What I thought,"" he recalled, ""was that I was going be a journalist. I've always thought screenwriting is very well served by knowledge of the world. And journalists do nothing so much as report stories… Their eye for telling detail is perfect for screenwriters."" Towne took a somewhat journalistic approach to Chinatown, drawing detail from real life but running with it into fictional realms. The history that the film looked back to specifically concerned the issue of the clean water-supply of Los Angeles as it grew in size during the early 1900s, although the film's narrative translates this to the 1930s. Meanwhile where the real-life ""water wars"" took place over water diverted from Owens Valley, east of the Sierra Nevada mountains, with an aqueduct built by Mulholland and team in 1913, the action in Chinatown concerns water in the San Fernando valley, an area much closer to LA, which was subsequently incorporated into the city limits. But while it doesn't replicate the ""water wars"" exactly, the scheme at the centre of Chinatown still feels believable – and certainly expands on the exploitation. ""The real history lent itself to Chandler-esque noir plotting,"" says Professor John Walton of UC Davis's Department of Sociology, who researched the real-life history of the ""water wars"" for his book Western Times and Water Wars: State, Culture and Rebellion in California. ""The aqueduct was a plan fashioned by a small group of wealthy promoters; the project was a mystery to the public in its early stages; money and power drove it; the 'little guy' was in the dark about his or her exploitation; intrigue enveloped city-valley dealings."" In Chinatown, the water department, under the influence of Cross, is behind a plan to secretly dump water from a vital reservoir in the San Fernando valley at night during a drought, so that the local agricultural land becomes unusable, and is devalued – allowing the department and Cross to buy it off cheaply from those forced out. Gittes finds that the land is changing ownership to random names taken from the residents (some recently deceased) of a local retirement home to hide the insider investors' identity. Handily, too, Cross's desired new dam would solve the problem of the lack of water supply, ensuring a vast profit from the subsequent increase in value of the cheaply acquired land once properly supplied with water again. More like this: • Why The Conversation is more relevant than ever • How 1971 became an extraordinary film year • The film that changed the way we see war When it came to the real-life water supply project, it quickly inspired disillusionment. ""By the early 1920s any hope of shared benefits [from the Los Angeles water department buying up Owens Valley] evaporated with a drought and increased groundwater pumping to maintain the supply delivered by the aqueduct to the city,"" Walton tells the BBC. ""Ranchers and small-town domestic users saw the local water table drop and their wells run dry."" This was the situation that was foreseen by the project's opponents, leading to attempts to destroy it. ""After many unsuccessful efforts to gain a share of the diminishing supply, local citizens staged a rebellion, initially by dynamiting the aqueduct and in 1924 occupying the Alabama Hills spill gates, which were opened, allowing the city's supply to flow on to the valley floor."" Clearly, Towne was more interested in using this history as a jumping-off point rather than offering up a dramatic exposé. ""Towne's story is highly fictionalised,"" continues Walton, ""reconstructed as a Raymond Chandler mystery for history that was no mystery. The central events of the aqueduct construction and water expropriation took place roughly from 1905 to 1924, not in 1937. They took place in the distant Owens Valley, not in the San Fernando Valley. [And] in the insurgency, later labelled a 'water war', no one was murdered or even seriously injured."" But for all these differences, Chinatown does reflect how powerful figures in Los Angeles's fight to control natural resources led to the lives and livelihoods of ordinary people, including farmers, being destroyed. When Gittes visits an orange grove affected by Cross's water dumping, he's given a far from warm welcome by the orange farmers, who think he is a water department agent, and beat him up as he attempts to escape. It's not inconceivable that the real Mulholland would have received an equally aggressive welcome in Owens Valley. As for Mulholland, though he was not alone in his endeavours, he's undeniably the single figure that most inspired aspects of Chinatown. Interestingly, however, he's not present in the film as one person. As author Vincent Brook writes in his book Land of Smoke and Mirrors (2013), Mulholland was split across characters to account for the different sides of the real man's legacy. ""William Mulholland is split into noble Water and Power chief Hollis Mulwray… and mobster muscle Claude Mulvihill (Roy Jensen)."" This reflects the fact that Mulholland did essential work to allow Los Angeles to survive and grow, and enabled this to be used for personal and corrupt gain. Hollis Mulwray's name is another throwback to Mulholland, though the character is ironically the engineer most opposed to the film's water-supply scheme, objecting to the dam plan due to the instability of the ground in the area. This is what gets him murdered. His opposition echoes the real Mulholland only in that, sometime after the original ""water wars"", the engineer was involved in an actual dam disaster. In 1928, Mulholland inspected the St Francis Dam in San Francisquito Canyon only hours before its subsequent break, resulting in a flood that killed over 400 people. It more than finished Mulholland's career. The character of Hollis feels from a parallel world where Mulholland was given a second chance and has a newly found caution over potentially risky projects. In some ways, the portrayal of Hollis, principled victim as he is, may have brightened Mulholland's subsequent reputation, such is the belief that Hollis is a fictional cipher. He was, however, certainly no angel, happily leading a water supply scheme that not only devastated the farmers of Owens Valley, but also enriched various business people through insider land deals equivalent to the ones in Chinatown. Indeed, Mulholland clearly shared some characteristics with Cross too – and on top of that Cross's style and look in the film was also closely inspired by photos of the real Mulholland, further muddying the water. In fact, the machinations surrounding the city's water supply are, by the film's conclusion, moot. As it turns out, Cross's grab for resources has been dark symbolism for his most evil abuse of power – the rape of Evelyn, his own daughter, and the incestuous child born of it. In Morrow Mayo's 1933 history book Los Angeles, the chapter dealing with the real Owens Valley project was infamously called The Rape of Owens Valley. Though a controversial and contested characterisation since, it expresses a sentiment about the powerful's unchecked assault on human lives that is taken to its most horrifically literal ends with Chinatown's climactic narrative revelations. Polanski and Towne's script may not have aimed for documentary recreation, but their borrowing and reshaping of real history allowed the work to stand out from its more fictional peers. So convincing is it in its detail that, Walton concludes, Chinatown is misunderstood by many ""as the true history of the Los Angeles water wars, the popular culture understanding of what really happened"". Fiction it may be, but Chinatown is one of the great noirs precisely because it authentically captures how politics and business can mix easily with crime and corruption, and how the striving for power of those at the top can leave many victims down below in the dust. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

investors sentiments,Is Nigeria on the right track after a year of Tinubu?,2024-09-15,2024-05-29,Mansur Abubakar,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrrv2p85l1o,"Nigerians love their football but it is no longer the main topic of conversation for many. On the first anniversary of the Bola Tinubu presidency, Abubakar Sheka, who sells bread on the streets of the northern city of Kano, says that his customers’ primary focus is now on what they can afford to buy. “Football talk is only sweet when the tummy is full but at the moment a lot of Nigerians are finding it difficult to feed, which makes people always talk about the economy when they meet,” the 36-year-old tells the BBC above the noise of the morning traffic. He has also noticed that fewer people are buying bread as the price has more than doubled since last May, reflecting the increase in the cost of flour, cutting off many families from one of the country’s basic staples. Inflation, coupled with the falling value of the currency, the naira, has been the major theme for many of the past 12 months. Though Nigeria has been hit by the same harsh economic winds as much of the rest of the world, some of what has happened is a direct result of the policies of President Tinubu, sworn in to office exactly a year ago. The new president, 71 at the time, had won a bruising election with 37% of the vote – a result that was then disputed in court. His task was to bring the country back together. He also faced a challenging financial situation, along with concerns about kidnapping and corruption. Amid the pomp and lofty sentiments on inauguration day, the president let slip a major announcement. “Fuel subsidy is gone,” he told Nigerians without giving a timetable for when the policy would be in place, or any measures that might cushion the inevitable blow. The decades-old subsidy was costing the nation huge sums of money which Mr Tinubu argued would be better spent elsewhere. “President Bola Tinubu’s inauguration speech began at around 10:00 and by 11:00 there are already fuel queues across Nigeria,” public affairs analyst Hashim Abubakar says. “That statement sent prices of fuel and other items skyrocketing immediately.” Annual inflation was already at an 18-year high of 22% and, partly as a result of getting rid of the fuel subsidy, it has risen to nearly 34%. Wages have not kept up. The government has also ended the policy of pegging the value of the naira to the US dollar, allowing it to dramatically depreciate. Whereas 10,000 naira would have bought $22 last May, it will now only purchase $6.80. This has made anything that is imported more expensive. And all this has pushed more people into poverty. Abubakar Ameer hands out food to those in need in Kano. He said that over the past year the number of people coming for help has more than doubled. “We had to reduce the ration we normally give to others so that everyone can get something to eat,” he tells the BBC. The government has given cash transfers amounting to $54 (£42) over three months to the very poorest families, but this has not helped everyone. Mr Tinubu’s ministers are aware of the hardships that many are now experiencing. Last week, Minister of Economic Planning Atiku Bagudu apologised “for the pains that [the policies] may occasion”, but, he added, “they are necessary”. He characterised the measures as part of an overdue economic restructuring which would result in long-term stability. The hugely expensive fuel subsidy and the over-valued naira was damaging the economy, it is argued. “This administration has implemented significant economic reforms aimed at stabilising our economy and fostering sustainable growth,” an official in the Tinubu administration, George Akume, said when presenting the government’s one-year progress report. The reforms were also aimed at boosting the confidence of foreign investors. The amount of investment money flowing into the country reached a peak just over a decade ago and has been relatively low since then. “I believe things are beginning to pick up in terms of foreign investment in the country due to the government’s economic policies,” says Victor Aluyi, senior vice-president of financial firm Sankore. “The improvements are not massive but there are improvements nonetheless compared to when things were really low in the past years.” One of the other big challenges facing the president in his first year in power was security, with violent attacks and abductions plaguing parts of the country under his predecessor. When it came to kidnapping, the north-west of the country was particularly badly hit. But from a peak at the beginning of last year up to March, the number of incidents of abductions fell in the region, according to Acled, which monitors conflict and violence. Nevertheless, two high-profile mass abductions in March and another one last week in different parts of the country have shown that more needs to be done to ensure people’s safety. The government has defended its record. Defence Minister Mohammed Badaru recently said that security forces had killed over 9,300 ""bandits"" and insurgents while 7,000 had been arrested in the past year. As for the battle against corruption, the president has come in for some praise. ""So far, the Tinubu-led administration, has not been quiet over the issue and has displayed the political will to confront the hydra-headed monster,” says Kola Adeyemi chairman of NGO Anti-Corruption Awareness. The suspension in January of Humanitarian Affairs Minister Betta Edu over the alleged diversion of public money was seen as a bold move. An investigation is under way and the minister has denied any wrongdoing. A former top official from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, speaking to the BBC on condition of anonymity, says that the president needs to do more despite good early signs. “Corruption has been a huge problem for decades so it will be unfair to score him based on a year in office - a lot needs to be done to wipe it out.” In all areas of policy, the administration will insist that more time is needed for the people to feel the benefits if its policies. But for Mr Sheka the bread-seller, time is running out. “If things don’t improve economically then I’ll either get something else alongside this to bring in more money or abandon bread-selling altogether and find something else to do as there are needs to take care of.” Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

investors sentiments,Is China's bubble tea bubble about to burst?,2024-09-15,2024-05-16,João da Silva,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw4rp8ejevlo,"From its origins in 1980s Taiwan to today's global craze, bubble tea or boba, has come a long way. Ask people under the age of 40 anywhere in the world whether they have ever tried the milky tea and tapioca ball concoction and there's a pretty good chance that they have. Bubble tea has certainly hit a sweet spot with its many fans but it has left some investors with a bitter taste. Stock market debuts of two China-based chains have already flopped. And there are at least two more share sales in the pipeline. Despite these hiccups, it's undeniable that boba has become a global phenomenon after its popularity spread from Asia to the West. From London to Helsinki and Buenos Aires to Cape Town, it's almost impossible to find a major city where it isn't on sale. There are now an estimated half a million bubble tea shops in China alone - a huge market for the drink, and one not too far from its origins in Taiwan. Thirty-something university lecturer Lili, who lives in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, first began drinking it while she was in primary school.  Today she cannot go long without her fix. ""Bubble tea is an easy-to-get pleasure so I drink it quite often,"" she says. Tina, an office worker from Beijing also in her 30s, tells a similar story. She first tried boba when she was a child and now drinks it several times a week. She often makes group orders with co-workers and friends from a wide variety of well-known shops. Lili, Tina and millions of others like them have helped China's bubble tea businesses grow into a nationwide industry that last year was worth about 145 billion yuan ($20bn; £15.9bn), according to estimates by the China Chain Store & Franchise Association. Innovation has been a key to its success ""with new flavours and recipes constantly being launched"", according to Jason Yu at consumer research group Kantar Worldpanel.  It's a strategy that resonates with Lili who says ""promotion campaigns, brand collaborations and new flavours"" have kept her going back for more. That approach has also helped bubble tea chains expand beyond China's major cities, Mr Yu says. This success story has continued even at a time when China's economy is slowing and consumers are tightening their belts. Bubble tea ""provides very much an affordable pleasure to consumers in China"", said Mr Yu, pointing to the ""wide price range"" of products being offered by different bubble tea chains. Some investors, however, have not shown the same level of enthusiasm. Seeking to cash in on the craze, several Chinese tea chains have looked to sell shares to the public in recent years. Last month, China's third largest bubble tea chain, Sichuan Baicha Baidao Industrial, known as Chabaidao, made its stock market debut. The shares plunged on their first day of trade and have yet to recover. That followed another disappointing debut by Shenzhen-based Nayuki. Its shares have lost more than 80% of their value since their launch in Hong Kong almost three years ago. Analysts point to a number of reasons for these weak performances, including concerns about the Hong Kong stock market as a whole. The amount raised from new listings in the city since the start of this year has dropped to levels not seen since 2009, according to consultancy firm Deloitte. But this hasn't discouraged other bubble tea chains from planning their own share sales. Earlier this year, China's first and second largest chains by number of shops - Mixue Group and Guming Holdings - submitted applications to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. ""Persisting weak market sentiment in Hong Kong is the primary reason"" for Chabaidao's market blunder, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis. He believes the city will struggle to attract new listings until there ""is a clear sign of China’s pivot to growth and lower US interest rates"". Others, however, say investors are focusing on problems within the bubble tea industry itself.   It ""has relatively low barriers to entry, leading to increased competition,"" said Kenny Ng, Securities Strategist of Everbright Securities International. ""Many companies rely on opening new stores to sustain revenue growth. However, this expansion strategy can lead to a decline in gross profit margins as companies face higher costs associated with store operations and management.""  For bubble tea fans, growing competition has its advantages. Han is a regular boba drinker from Beijing who used to stay away from certain premium brands because she found them too expensive.  That has changed. She says price has become less of a factor when choosing between different brands because ""they have a lot of discounts and vouchers"". But for bubble tea makers and their potential investors, lower prices and higher costs could prove to be an unattractive recipe. ""The Chabaidao case highlights the risks and does not bode well for the listings of other bubble tea chains,"" warned Gary Ng. Lili and Han say there is another far more important risk associated with the often sugar-packed drink that is holding them back from ordering more - putting on weight."
investors sentiments,Apple sales fall in nearly all countries,2024-09-15,2024-05-02,Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99zxzjqw2ko,"Apple sales have fallen in almost every market across the globe, according to the latest results from the tech giant. The company said that demand for its smartphones dropped by more than 10% in the first three months of this year, while overall sales fell in every geographic region except for Europe. Apple said that overall, revenues across the company declined by 4% to $90.8bn (£72.5bn), which was the biggest drop for more than a year.   Nevertheless, the results were not as bad as expected and Apple's share price rose in after-hours trading in New York.  The company said the figures were distorted by Covid-related supply disruptions, which led to unusually strong sales during the same period last year.  It said it expected sales to return to growth in the months ahead, noting upcoming product launches and investments in artificial intelligence (AI).  Overall sales in the critical greater China market dropped by 8%. Mr Cook attempted to reassure investors about the state of the business in the world's second largest economy, noting that iPhone sales were actually up in ""mainland"" China.   ""I maintain a great view of China in the long term,"" he said.  Competition in that market has been intensifying from local rivals such Huawei. Gil Luria, senior software analyst at DA Davidson, said companies such as Huawei do well in China because ""it is the homegrown brand"". ""But in terms of features, functionality and prestige, iPhone still has an advantage over any other handset,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""So any time consumers get the choice and have the resources they’re going to buy an iPhone – that’s not any different in China."" Struggles at the company - which has endured a streak of sales declines for five of the last six quarters - marked a contrast with the wider market. Globally, smartphone shipments rose 10% in the first three months of the year, expanding after a long lacklustre period, according to research firm Canalys.  Mr Luria said that for Apple, there hasn't been ""significant improvements to the handset"" since the iPhone 12 was launched almost four years ago ""when Apple introduced 5G connectivity which compelled a lot of consumers to upgrade the phone"". He added: ""What they’re hoping for now is that they can introduce enough new AI features into the iPhone 16 which will come out later this year in order to finally drive a big iPhone upgrade cycle.” Apple is also facing legal battles with regulators in the US and Europe over its app store fees. A separate anti-monopoly lawsuit in the US against Google threatens the lucrative payments Apple receives from the search giant in exchange for making Google the default search engine on Safari, Apple's internet browser. According to court filings, those payments amounted to about $20bn in 2022, a sum that helped lift Apple profits. Pre-tax profit for the three months was flat at $28bn and the company announced that it was setting aside $110bn to buy back shares. Finance chief Luca Maestri said Apple sales were expected to rise in the ""low single digits"" in the three months to June.  He added that the firm expected double digit growth in its services business, offering more guidance than the company typically provides. Looking ahead, Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said: ""China is holding up better than expected and there are a host of upcoming events/catalysts on the horizon that could improve investor sentiment."""
investors sentiments,Meta AI spending plans cause share price slump,2024-09-15,2024-04-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl40v5x483yo,"Shares in Meta - the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram - fell sharply after it announced higher than expected spending on artificial intelligence (AI). They went down more than 15% in after-hours trading in New York despite the tech giant revealing strong earnings figures. Boss Mark Zuckerberg said it would take some time before its huge AI investment increased revenues. Meta also said its X rival, Threads, now has more than 150 million monthly active users, increasing the pressure on the Elon Musk-owned platform. ""Threads is well on its way to beating X by becoming the Twitter alternative users and advertisers are longing for,"" said Mike Proulx, from analysts Forrester. He also said Meta stood to gain from TikTok's possible sale or ban in the US - a development the app has vowed to fight. Meta has been updating its ad-buying products with AI tools to boost earnings growth. It has also been introducing more AI features on its social media platforms such as chat assistants. The firm said it now expected to spend between $35bn and $40bn, (£28bn-32bn) in 2024, up from an earlier prediction of $30-$37bn. For investors, that outweighed the positive news on earnings. First quarter revenue rose 27% to $36.46bn, while analysts had expected earnings of $36.16bn. Analysts though said there was a logic to Meta's approach. Sophie Lund-Yates, from Hargreaves Lansdown, said Meta's ""substantial investment"" in AI has helped it get people to spend time on its platforms, so advertisers were willing to spend more money ""in a time when digital advertising uncertainty remains rife"". More than 50 countries are due to have elections this year, she said, ""which hugely increases uncertainty"" and can spook advertisers. Ms Lund-Yates said that ""looking further ahead, the biggest risk [for Meta] remains regulatory"". Last year, Meta was fined €1.2bn (£1bn) by Ireland's data authorities for mishandling people's data when transferring it between Europe and the US. And in February of this year, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg faced blistering criticism from US lawmakers and was pushed to apologise to families of victims of child sexual exploitation. Ms Lund-Yates added that the firm has ""more than enough resources to throw at legal challenges, but that doesn’t rule out the risks of ups and downs in market sentiment""."
investors sentiments,Asia stock markets continue global fallout,2024-09-15,2020-09-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54230742,"Stock markets in Asia suffered on Tuesday from the fallout from UK and US investors worried about a rise in coronavirus cases. Australia, Hong Kong, China and South Korea stock markets were all down. Investors were also rattled by dimming hopes for more financial support for the US economy. However, European markets opened slightly higher on Tuesday and London's 100 share index was up 0.4% at 5826.24 points. Earlier, Australia's All Ordinaries ended down 0.7% at 5,973.50, Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1% to 23,720.06, the Shanghai Composite fell 1.3% to 3,274.30 while South Korea's Kospi dropped by 2.38%, to end at 2,332.59.  Japan's markets were closed for a public holiday. On Monday, UK and US stock markets suffered heavy losses over fears that a renewed rise in coronavirus cases will blight economic prospects. More than £50bn was wiped off UK shares, and caused similar falls across European and US stock markets.  The negative sentiment then spread into Asia, which has previously been the focus of optimism from China's continued economic recovery. Australian shares were dragged to their lowest level since mid-June, under pressure by its mining and energy stocks. Major mining firms BHP Group and Rio Tinto both fell around 2%.  ""The biggest issue for local markets is how the battle for tech sector super dominance plays out between the US and China, which is getting viewed through the lens of the ByteDance /Oracle -Walmart deal,"" said Stephen Innes, a market strategist at Sydney-based financial firm AxiCorp. ""Election risk is also coming to the fore with the first US election debate on the 29th, which is compounding things,"" he added. In Europe, banking shares were affected by an extra set of concerns as allegations of money-laundering surfaced in leaked filesand those falls carried on into Asian trading. HSBC, the bank at the centre of the scandal, saw its share price fall 5.3% in London on Monday, but the revelations dragged down the entire sector, with other big banks dropping by a similar amount. HSBC's shares have hit a 25-year low and they continued to slide in Hong Kong on Tuesday,falling another 2%. Shares in UK-based bank Standard Chartered, which was also named in the leaked papers, fell another 2.6% on Tuesday to hit an 18-year low on the Hong Kong market."
investors sentiments,Unfinished business for the next first minister,2024-09-15,2023-02-20,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-64712806,"In the weeks before Nicola Sturgeon hands back the Great Seal of Scotland and boxes up her books at Bute House, there is unfinished business. A lot of it has to do with, well, business. A budget to pass on Tuesday. And the economy.  And it's likely that the low profile given to growing the economy under Ms Sturgeon's leadership might be something Kate Forbes and perhaps others will wish to change. When she's not being required to explain her Christian faith, that seems to be one part of the turf where the finance and economy secretary intends to pitch her leadership campaign tent. Her main rival, Humza Yousaf, has less of a track record in economic roles, either as a minister or outside politics.  As transport secretary for two years, he was on the ministerial bridge while Ferguson shipyard was heading for the rocks, and his record on ScotRail was to shift the points in the direction of public ownership. Benny Higgins, the former banker who was given the task of drawing up an economic recovery plan a few months after the first Covid lockdown, does not sound impressed by progress on his report or others. He told the Financial Times this weekend that there remains ""a tendency to announce a new study or a new group, when actually there are a lot of things that are staring you in the face and you just need to tackle"". It's perceived that social justice and health has taken priority on Nicola Sturgeon's watch. And even where the outgoing First Minister has set out goals which could boost the economy, there's disappointment at the track record of following up. There's a huge business opportunity, for instance, in insulating and re-fuelling Scotland's heating systems. The WWF environment group reports on the slow progress there.  The Scottish government said it would introduce ways that tied its budget in with its commitment to reaching net zero. That hasn't gone well either, according to the Fraser of Allander Institute.  The economists were asked by the Scottish government to assess how it's doing. The response - published in a blog last week - was harsh. The easy thing is to point to hardware. But if the boring bit about budget and decision processes isn't right, or isn't even there, the targets will be missed. The Allander people found that there's a ""significant gap"" between government intentions and reality - across project planning, impact on equalities or islanders, for instance, and on which project options provide the best social outcomes, let alone economic ones. The economists concluded: ""This is hugely concerning given the importance of these processes to setting clear objectives, identifying value for money, supporting evidence-based policymaking, documenting information and ensuring policy matches the overarching strategic goals of Government.  ""These processes appear to be regularly missing key components, insufficient in quality, performed too late to genuinely influence how decisions are made, or missing entirely."" It's suggested the Scottish government is merely ""tinkering around the edges"", and as such, it's not taking its environmental targets seriously. ""Decisions being made now are locking in emissions many years in the future, and government-wide change is a slow process,"" conclude the Strathclyde University economists.  They quote the Committee on Climate Change, an adviser to the Scottish government, saying in December that 'Scotland's climate targets are in danger of becoming meaningless'.  And they write: ""Our project has found that integration of climate targets into internal processes is severely lacking and so we echo this sentiment. Immediate action is required if the Government wishes for its climate targets to remain rooted in reality."" Ouch. The Scottish government response is to confirm that this net zero challenge is complex and on a big scale. It says it's doing work on its budget and that it remains ""continually ambitious"".  That may all be true, but it's not to the point. So what about growing business?  You might have expected Nicola Sturgeon to ensure at least that women would get a helping hand in starting up business.  And yet it took until the week after she announced her departure for that issue has been addressed by a further review. This one was launched by the First Minister with small tech firms in Midlothian, as the leadership contest was being fired up elsewhere. Its co-author, investment specialist Ana Stewart, commented on the support for women starting up in business: ""I'm shocked myself by the scale of the chasm, really. ""Only one in five businesses in Scotland are female-led, and that hasn't changed in the last 10 years. ""So despite people thinking progress is being made, nothing in statistics that we've looked at - and they're very robust statistics - is telling us the progress is being made."" So there are 31 recommendations - not all for government, of course. It is in the finance sector that bigger challenges lie, while women get only 2% of the start-up funding made available by institutional investors. Other business lobby groups are more interested in seeing where the SNP leadership candidates will go with measures that are in the pipeline to do with health and the environment and which carry a new regulatory burden, particularly for the hospitality sector - on advertising alcohol, marketing food and recycling drink containers. As they're all agreed that independence is a good thing (they know the electorate in this contest), is that where they'll differentiate themselves from each other, and from Nicola Sturgeon?"
investors sentiments,US markets mixed after turbulent week,2024-09-15,2018-12-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46699288,"US financial markets were mixed on Friday after a choppy trading session that bounced between gains and losses. The Dow Jones index sank 0.3% and the S&P 500 fell about 0.1%, but the Nasdaq gained almost 0.1%. The moves marked a relatively calm end to a wild week of trade, in which US indexes rallied sharply after plunging on Monday. European markets built on those gains on Friday. The FTSE 100 share index closed up more than 2.2% at 6,733.97. In Germany, the DAX gained about 1.7%, while France's CAC index also rose about 1.7%. Many markets have had a dismal year, as investor sentiment soured on fears of decelerating global growth, trade tensions and rising interest rates. Japan's Nikkei suffered its first annual loss in seven years, while Germany's Dax index closed the year down about 18% - the biggest annual loss in a decade. On Friday, Japan's Nikkei 225 ended 0.31% lower at 20,014.77, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed flat, at 25,504.20. In the US, Friday's declines were fairly widespread. However, they spared the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers such as Amazon. Amazon shares jumped more than 1% on Friday, days after the  e-commerce giant told investors it had a ""record-breaking"" holiday season. Analysts cautioned that movements were exacerbated by the lower dealing levels seen during holiday trading. US shares have been hit this week by weaker than expected home sales and consumer confidence data. Concerns about US-China trade tensions also resurfaced, with reports saying US President Donald Trump is considering an executive order banning the use of Chinese technology. "
investors sentiments,Zuckerberg pressed to face breach concerns,2024-09-15,2018-03-19,By Dave Lee,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43456390,"Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is facing intensified calls to appear in person at investigations into the social network's conduct. His company has been accused of failing to properly inform users that their profile information may have been obtained and kept by Cambridge Analytica, a data firm widely-credited with helping Donald Trump win the 2016 US presidential election. Facebook said on Friday it had blocked Cambridge Analytica from Facebook while it investigated claims the London-based firm did not, as promised, delete data that was allegedly obtained using methods that were in violation of Facebook's policies. Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny any wrongdoing. Despite pledging that in 2018 he would ""fix"" his company, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has managed to avoid engaging with the site's growing number of critics - instead sending lawyers or policy bosses to various committee hearings. The 33-year-old's recent remarks on some of Facebook's controversies have been communicated in the relatively safe space of a blog post or video message published on his Facebook page. With the building row over how Facebook data may have been used to fuel highly-targeted political propaganda, several influential figures on both side of the Atlantic this weekend said it was time for Mr Zuckerberg to step up to publicly defend - or at least justify - his creation. Some called for investigations into whether Mr Zuckerberg's company may have violated laws governing disclosure of a data breach - and also rules on properly obtaining a user's consent to collect personal information. ""This is a major breach that must be investigated,"" demanded Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. ""It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves. I've called for more transparency and accountability for online political ads. They say 'trust us'."" She added: ""Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary."" That sentiment was backed by Adam Schiff, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is already investigating social media manipulation in the run up to the 2016 presidential election. ""I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees,"" he told the Washington Post. ""And not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space."" On Sunday morning TV, Florida senator and former presidential hopeful Marco Rubio told NBC's Meet the Press he felt technology companies acted as if they are ""above"" regulations. ""Their growth has been a lot faster than perhaps their ability to mature institutionally from within on some of these challenges that they're facing,"" he said. ""I think another part about it is sometimes these companies grow so fast and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think that perhaps they're above sort of the rules that apply to everybody else."" The man in charge of Britain's investigation into Russian meddling in the democratic process said he too wanted to press Mr Zuckerberg on the issue. ""I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,"" said Damian Collins MP. ""It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers."" Mr Collins also said he would be recalling Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix to parliament to answer more questions. ""It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and parliament,"" Mr. Collins said. Cambridge Analytica and Mr Nix have denied any wrongdoing. In an attempt to get out ahead of a story in the New York Times and Observer newspapers, Facebook made an announcement late Friday night, California time, that it was blocking Cambridge Analytica from using Facebook while it investigated claims the inappropriately-obtained data had not been deleted as promised. This was followed by remarks from Alex Stamos, the firm's chief security officer, who wrote and then deleted a series of tweets. He objected to the word ""breach"" being used to describe how data from as many as 50 million peoples' user profiles may have been obtained without explicit user consent. ""I have deleted my tweets on Cambridge Analytica,"" he later wrote. ""Not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in."" Christopher Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica, revealed how it and its partners harvested data belonging to mostly US voters. Over the weekend, he announced he had been suspended from Facebook. On top of its initial statement, Facebook on Sunday said it was conducting a ""comprehensive internal and external review"" into whether the data, gathered via an app created by Global Science Research (GSR), still existed. GSR was set up by University of Cambridge associate professor Aleksandr Kogan and his colleague Joseph Chancellor. According to the Guardian, Mr Chancellor was given a job at Facebook as a researcher just months after GSR carried out the data-gathering exercise that Facebook now says violated its policies. Facebook has not commented on the calls for Mr Zuckerberg to appear in front of the several committees expressing a desire to hear from him. But one analyst warned that this controversy is a direct threat to Facebook's business model, and therefore Mr Zuckerberg will be expected to put investors at ease, sooner rather than later. ""This has potential to grow into something a lot more onerous,"" said Daniel Ives from GBH Insight. ""So he has to get ahead of this storm before it turns into a hurricane."""
investors sentiments,Facebook haunted by 'ugly truth' memo,2024-09-15,2018-03-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43594959,"A Facebook executive's memo that claimed the ""ugly truth"" was that anything it did to grow was justified has been made public, embarrassing the company. The 2016 post said that this applied even if it meant people might die as a result of bullying or terrorism. Both the author and the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, have denied they actually believe the sentiment. But it risks overshadowing the firm's efforts to tackle an earlier scandal. Facebook has been under intense scrutiny since it acknowledged that it had received reports that a political consultancy - Cambridge Analytica - had not destroyed data harvested from about 50 million of its users years earlier. The memo was first made public by the Buzzfeed news site, and was written by Andrew Bosworth.  So we connect more people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack co-ordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. It is perhaps the only area where the metrics do tell the true story as far as we are concerned. [...] That's why all the work we do in growth is justified. All the questionable contact importing practices. All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends. All of the work we do to bring more communication in. The work we will likely have to do in China some day. All of it. Read the post in full  Mr Bosworth - who co-invented Facebook's News Feed - has held high-level posts at the social network since 2006, and is currently in charge of its virtual reality efforts. Mr Bosworth has since tweeted that he ""didn't agree"" with the post at the time he had posted it, but he had shared it with staff to be ""provocative."" ""Having a debate around hard topics like these is a critical part of our process and to do that effectively we have to be able to consider even bad ideas,"" he added. Mark Zuckerberg has issued his own statement. ""Boz is a talented leader who says many provocative things,"" it said. ""This was one that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly. We've never believed the ends justify the means."" A follow-up report by the Verge revealed that dozens of Facebook's employees have subsequently used its internal chat tools to discuss concerns that such material had been leaked to the media. What immediately struck me about this leaked memo was the line about ""all the questionable contact importing practices"".  When I downloaded my Facebook data recently, it was the presence of thousands of my phone contacts that startled me. But the company's attitude seemed to be that this was normal and it was up to users to switch off the function if they didn't like it.  What we now know is that in 2016 a very senior executive thought this kind of data gathering was questionable.  So, why is it only now that the company is having a debate about this and other dubious practices? Until now, Facebook has not been leaky. Perhaps we will soon get more insights from insiders as this adolescent business tries to grow up and come to terms with its true nature. The disclosure coincided with Facebook's latest efforts to address the public and investors' concerns with its management. Its shares are trading about 14% lower than they were before the Cambridge Analytica scandal began, and several high profile figures have advocated deleting Facebook accounts. The company hosted a press conference on Thursday, at which it said it had: In previous days it had also announced a revamp of its privacy settings, and said it would restrict the amount of data exchanged with businesses that collect information on behalf of advertisers. The latest controversy is likely, however, to provide added ammunition for critics. CNN reported earlier this week that Mr Zuckerberg had decided to testify before Congress ""within a matter of weeks"" after refusing a request to do so before UK MPs. However, the BBC has been unable to independently verify whether he answer questions in Washington."
investors sentiments,Scotland's appeal to foreign investors bucks trend,2024-09-15,2021-06-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-57374987,"Scotland's appeal to foreign investors bucked the sharp downward trend during the Covid crisis last year, according to an annual survey by accountancy and consulancy firm EY. The number of foreign direct investment (FDI) projects that came to Scotland last year was up from 101 to 107. That 6% rise compared with a 12% drop for the UK as a whole, to 975 projects.  Much of that was from the reduction in digital technology going to London. Europe's total FDI haul was down 13%. While London was the city that continued to attract the biggest number of UK projects - down from 48% to 39% of the UK total - Edinburgh knocked Manchester into second place with 36 projects. Glasgow, with 23, came behind Birmingham and Belfast, followed by Leeds and then Aberdeen, with 13 projects. The UK figures run counter to downbeat assessments of Britain's appeal to international investors following Brexit. Sentiment about investment in the UK rose significantly between a survey last autumn and the spring survey for EY. However, the pattern over the years since the Brexit referendum point to the UK's dominance in this field being challenged by Germany and France. Paris emerged last year as Europe's most attractive city for FDI, but London regained that position in this year's survey. The Scottish figures also suggest the prospect of another independence referendum is not a significant discouragement to foreign investors. Scotland has consistently outperformed other parts of the UK in this annual survey, with the exception of London. Asked this year which are the most attractive parts of the UK to invest, the EY survey of 570 international investors put Scotland on 15%, up from 7% in 2019, and behind only London, which had 25% support. Much of the appeal in Scotland last year was in digital technology, agri-food and business services. The top project activities were in boosting sales and service, reflecting the growth of online sales, plus research and some manufacturing. However, the UK figures on inward investment in manufacturing continued to decline compared with continuing members of the European Union. It was the only sector in which Britain clearly underperformed its near neighbours in attracting investment. That is more likely to reflect Brexit, as Britain is no longer a base from which to manufacture with seamless access across Europe's market. Inward investment, which used to be seen as a source of large numbers of jobs in assembly plants, has shifted in Europe and the UK towards higher value jobs, but fewer of them. The countries that were source of the most investment into Scotland continued to be led by the USA, with 38 of the 107 projects, followed by Ireland (10) and the Netherlands (8). Some 61 of them were new investment projects and the others were re-investments, as existing FDI companies extended and deepened their commitment to operations in Scotland. It is harder to tell the impact of the raw project numbers on jobs, as these are less clear, they can take years to reach employment targets, and they can be skewed from one year to another by big factory investments or takeover deals. The EY analysis of the numbers available suggests a decline in the number of jobs supported by new FDI in Scotland, down from a 10 year average of 4,650 to 4,500 last year. Ali Scott of EY commented: ""Scotland has now narrowed the gap significantly with London, which continues to lead as the most attractive region to establish operations.  ""The scale of this two-year shift is illustrated by London's vote as most attractive region almost halving since 2019, while Scotland's has more than doubled. As well as being firmly established as the UK's second biggest recipient of FDI projects behind London, Scotland is now also in second place in terms of attractiveness, well ahead of third-placed south-east England. ""But this is no time for Scotland to rest on its laurels. As we look to the economic recovery from Covid-19, constructive, practical engagement between business and both the UK and Scottish governments remains key to shaping the right policies, business environment and incentives to give investors continued confidence to invest"". Linda Hanna, interim chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, which co-ordinates efforts to identify and attract inward investment opportunities, argued that the figures reflect the benefit of a ""team Scotland"" approach across the public sector, universities and business.  She said: ""Scotland's incredible workforce, competitive cost base, world-class universities and supportive business environment is what makes global companies want to locate here.   ""Not only does inward investment deliver high-quality, well-paid jobs, it also provides wider benefits such as supply chain opportunities and increased R&D spending that impacts across Scotland's economy."" There is global competition to attract inward investment, using incentives such as tax, subsidy, installing infrastructure and workforce training. Tax is seen as a key element, and the deal struck by the G7 this weekend could see significant shifts in that competition.  If, for instance, Ireland is forced to raise its basic corporation tax from 12.5% to the G7 minimum of 15%, that would make it easier for Scotland to compete with its neighbour for these projects. The UK Government is putting a lot into freeports, intended as low-tax enclaves for industry to import materials, process and export. None have yet been chosen for Scotland, and they are meant to be for green jobs. It could be that initiative is undermined by the G7 agreement. More often, freeports have been found to displace jobs from other parts of the country rather than creating new ones. For Scotland to compete, it is not tax but its workers' skills that are most often the differentiating factor.  Universities are vital to this, producing graduates who stay in Scotland because its cities offer clusters of attractive technology start-ups and innovation. The scale may not be as big as the big factories of the past. But in the wake of Brexit, retaining the in-flow of highly-productive global companies is essential to helping home-grown ones learn and compete."
investors sentiments,Global shares fall as growth fears rattle investors,2024-09-15,2022-05-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61497817,"Fears about rising prices and slowing economies have spread to UK and European stock markets following sharp falls in the US and Asia. The FTSE 100 index of leading companies sank 1.8% on Thursday while the main stock markets in France and Germany also saw declines.       On Wednesday, US shares recorded their biggest one-day drop since the early days of the Covid pandemic in 2020.  Markets were spooked by gloomy forecasts from major US retailers. Countries are also grappling with steep rises in inflation - the UK's reached a 40-year high of 9% in April - and there are concerns that some economies are heading for a slowdown as interest rates are increased in an attempt to counter price rises. ""A red wall of worry has built up across financial markets with investors increasingly nervous that economies are set to career into recession,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The downbeat news from US retailers hit shares in UK companies reliant on consumer spending. The UK's biggest retailer, Tesco, fell 1.8%, while shares in consumer goods giant Unilever dropped nearly 1%. However, the biggest faller on the UK market was Royal Mail, which sank more than 12% after reporting disappointing results and warning it was facing ""significant headwinds"" from rising costs. The FTSE 100 closed 135 points lower at 7,302.7, while France's Cac-40 index and Germany's Dax dropped by 1.3% and 0.9% respectively. In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei index closed down 1.9%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 2.5%. That came after the S&P 500 index in the US, which tracks shares of a wide swathe of America's biggest companies, plunged more than 4% on Wednesday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 3.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 4.7%. The falls added to weeks of declines on US financial markets.  The steep falls on US markets came after retail chain Target said unexpectedly high fuel and freight costs had cut into profits, which halved compared with a year ago.  It also said that as prices rise, shoppers are spending more on essentials and cutting back on discretionary items, such as television sets and clothing. Target's comments followed a similarly downbeat update from rival Walmart earlier in the week. ""What people are worried about after seeing Target is, will more earnings [estimates] have to be taken down?"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital in New York.  ""Consumer sentiment is at multi-year lows and tied at the hip with inflation. So people are looking for signs of inflation moderating, and Target did not give them any today."" Target's update sent its shares plunging 25% - the biggest decline in more than three decades. Official US government data recently showed retail sales rose a healthy 0.9% in April, but some analysts have warned the figures may be understating signs of slowdown - especially for lower-income families - since they are not adjusted for inflation. Earlier this year, Amazon reported a surprise drop in online sales in the first three months of the year."
investors sentiments,Tech stocks slide as Wall Street goes into reverse,2024-09-15,2020-09-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54020706,"US and Asian stock markets have gone into reverse after shares in America's biggest technology firms tumbled. Companies that have powered US markets to record highs - Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook - fell between 4% and 8%. Analysts said fears about the economic shock of coronavirus and a possible second wave prompted the sell-off. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed down 5%, the Dow Jones fell almost 3%, and the broad-based S&P 500 lost 3.5%. In Asian trading Tokyo's Nikkei index was 1% lower, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down by 1.4%. Carmaker Tesla, whose shares have soared this year, tumbled 9% on Thursday after falling sharply in the previous two sessions. Another tech heavyweight, Nvidia, ended 9.3% down. Apple's 8% fall meant $150bn (£113bn) was wiped off the value of the iPhone maker. The sell-off came after mixed US economic data on Thursday that included a report showing slower services sector growth in August, bigger-than-expected drop in new jobless claims, record job cuts this year and an unexpectedly big trade deficit for July. While the latest weekly initial jobless claims fell more than anticipated, they remain high amid growing worries that employment growth could stall without further economic stimulus. Chicago Federal Reserve president Charles Evans said on Thursday that Congress would need to deliver more fiscal aid. And he indicated that US monetary policy would be eased further and interest rates kept at ultra-low levels for years to help the economy recover its pre-pandemic strength. Growing worries about US economic health were underlined by the Vix index, also known as the ""fear gauge"". This reached its highest since mid-July.  Sentiment wasn't helped by a warning from US infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci who said there is doubt a Covid-19 vaccine will be developed by the end of October. The downturn in the US hit European markets. London's FTSE 100 ended down 1.5% at 5,850 points, and Germany's Dax fell 1.4%. Wall Street had reached fresh highs this week on what Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, called ""a combination of relatively unfounded vaccine and stimulus speculation"". Markets were now seeing a ""sharp turnaround"", he said. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed at record levels, and the Dow came within 1.5% of its February peak. Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, said markets were due a reality check.  ""Think about the mounting number of risks the market has been shrugging off over the last couple of months. We're 60 days away from the election. That may be an area where investors are getting a bit spooked,"" she said."
investors sentiments,WeWork's Adam Neumann quits as chief executive,2024-09-15,2019-09-24,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49803064,"WeWork's Adam Neumann has agreed to step down as chief executive of the trendy office rental firm saying it's in the ""best interests"" of the company. The decision is effective immediately, the firm said. He will remain with the company as non-executive chairman.  Scrutiny of his leadership had ""become a significant distraction,"" it said.  The move comes after WeWork's plans for a stock market listing ran into trouble, with investors raising concerns about losses and governance. ""While our business has never been stronger, in recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive,"" Mr Neumann said in a statement.  WeWork's board of directors said it had named WeWork's Artie Minson, formerly co-president and chief financial officer, and Sebastian Gunningham, formerly vice chairman, co-chief executives of the company. Mr Neumann built WeWork in his own image, creating a buzzy, multi-billion dollar company known for its co-working spaces, free-flowing alcohol and a stated mission to ""elevate the world's consciousness"". Since 2010, the firm has expanded from a single office in New York City to more than 500 locations in 29 countries. Japanese investment giant Softbank valued the company at $47bn (£37bn) in its most recent investment round. But Mr Neumann's brash charisma, which once attracted investors, emerged as a liability as WeWork decided to sell its shares on the public market. Reports suggest the firm's expected valuation had sunk to between $10bn and $12bn. Reports surfaced detailing erratic decision making and the ways his hard-partying habits had infused corporate culture. Perhaps most alarming to potential investors were the ways Mr Neumann had blurred the lines between his own personal finances and WeWork. For example, over the years, the company had been a tenant in some properties that he owned; and Mr Neumann, who had voting control of the company, had also secured personal loans using company stock as collateral. ""I think many investors are uncomfortable with Neumann's relationship with the company,"" Sam Reynolds, a technology analyst, told the BBC. Mr Neumann agreed to modify some of those arrangements as it became clear that he was losing support from major backers, such as Softbank.  For example, he returned the $5.9m in stock he received for selling WeWork the trademark ""We"" and agreed to give WeWork any profit from properties he owns that the company leases.  His wife Rebekah, a WeWork co-founder who had been given the power to identify a successor, also had her role reduced. Mr Neumann has reportedly also agreed to significantly reduce his voting powers. But even that move and his role change may not assuage concerns about the company, which lost nearly $2bn last year.  Market sentiment has turned, after shares in other high-profile, loss-making start-ups such as ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft, have crashed following flotation. And critics have long complained that WeWork's financials don't make sense, pointing to the firm's losses and the much lower valuations of similar companies such as rival IWG, which used to be known as Regus. WeWork ""is a property company trying to sprinkle tech company fairy dust over itself,"" said Richard Kramer, founder of Arete Research. ""That won't work with investors.""  The company was relying on its stock market launch to unlock new loans, which means its delay could spell trouble. Mr Reynolds said he expected the company to remain privately held for the foreseeable future. ""I think the IPO will be delayed indefinitely,"" he said. ""WeWork certainly has a future, but not as a public company."" Born in Israel, Mr Neumann served in the Israeli Navy before moving to New York to ""get a great job, have tons of fun and make a lot of money"", as he put it in a 2017 TechCrunch interview.  He enrolled at Baruch College at the City University of New York in 2002, but dropped out just shy of graduation to go into business.  One of his early ventures was a baby clothing company that evolved into the luxury Egg Baby brand. Later, he and business partner Miguel McKelvey, an architect, renovated an office space and sublet the property. They sold the business but the idea grew into WeWork.

investors sentiments,Foxtons hit by 'prolonged downturn',2024-09-15,2019-02-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47389160,"London-focused estate agent Foxtons has swung to a loss and says the housing market in the capital is in a ""prolonged downturn"". The company reported a loss of £17.2m for last year, partly due to the costs of closing six offices. It made a profit of £6.5m in 2017. Foxtons added that Brexit uncertainty was ""impacting consumer confidence"". Separately, the Nationwide said the UK market remained ""subdued"", with prices up 0.4% in February from a year ago. Foxtons said annual revenues fell 5% to £111.5m, with the weakness in property sales being offset slightly by a ""resilient lettings performance"". The estate agent was pushed into the red by one-off charges of £15.7m, which included the costs of closing six offices: Beckenham, Enfield, Loughton, Ruislip, Park Lane and Barnes.  Foxtons said it was able to cover 85% of London from 61 branches and had no current plans for further closures. ""Our performance in 2018 was impacted by a further deterioration in the sales market, with transaction levels falling for another year from their already low levels,"" said chief executive Nic Budden. However, the company said that in the long term, London remained ""a highly attractive property market"". The Nationwide said that house prices in February dipped 0.1% from the month before, with the average property now costing £211,304. The Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner, said: ""Indicators of housing market activity, such as the number of property transactions and the number of mortgages approved for house purchase, have remained broadly stable in recent months, but survey data suggests that sentiment has softened. ""Measures of consumer confidence weakened around the turn of the year and surveyors reported a further fall in new buyer enquiries over the same period. ""While the number of properties coming onto the market also slowed, this doesn't appear to have been enough to prevent a modest shift in the balance of demand and supply in favour of buyers in recent months."""
investors sentiments,Lloyds Bank takes an extra £460m PPI hit,2024-09-15,2018-08-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45028812,"Lloyds Banking Group has said it has put aside another £460m in costs for payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling claims. That means it has now allocated more than £19.2bn to settle the claims. The bank said it expected 13,000 PPI complaints a week until August 2019. The provision came as Lloyds said its profits for the first six months of the year rose by nearly a quarter. It made pre-tax profits of £3.1bn, 23% higher than the same time last year. Chief executive António Horta-Osório said: ""We have delivered another strong and sustainable financial performance with increased statutory profits, higher returns and a strong capital build."" Lloyds said the latest PPI charge was ""largely driven by a potentially higher total volume of complaints and associated administration costs due to higher reactive complaint volumes received over the past six months and ongoing volatility"". It added: ""The remaining provision is consistent with an average of approximately 13,000 complaints per week through to the industry deadline of the end of August 2019."" It said that every extra 1,000 complaints a week above that level would cost it another £150m. The bank said it had sold an estimated 16 million PPI policies since 2000, including policies that were not mis-sold and those that had been successfully claimed upon. It has already dealt with about 53% of those policies. PPI mis-selling was a huge financial scandal and now, for many, the reason for a lot of unwanted calls about claiming compensation. But it is worth stepping back for a minute to look at the staggering numbers involved.  Latest figures from the regulator show that in May alone, compensation of more than £400m was paid out by the industry. No wonder banks were so delighted when a claims deadline was set for 29 August 2019. On the flipside, claims management companies (CMCs) are furious. This week a trade body for CMCs claimed that half of us are unaware of the cut-off date.  They will be busy in the next 12 months, so expect more calls. Despite those efforts, many people are missing out on compensation that is rightfully theirs and that they can claim themselves without charge. Lloyds said it was committed to maintaining the UK's largest network of branches, despite its announcement of 49 branch closures in April. It said it also had the largest digital bank in the UK, with active users increasing to almost 14 million, including about 10 million mobile banking users. Lloyds said its balance sheet remained strong, with its common equity tier one capital ratio increasing to 15.1% pre-dividend. It said it would pay an interim dividend of 1.07 pence a share. The government sold its last shares in Lloyds in May 2017, eight years after pumping in £20bn to save it. Lloyds' share price rose nearly 2%, but remains slightly lower than it was a year ago. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""António Horta-Osório must be wondering just what he has to pull out of the bag to push the stock price up.  ""Since taking over the reins in 2011, Horta-Osório has presided over a bank which has swung from an annual loss of £260m to a profit of £3.5bn. The share price, meanwhile, is at roughly the same level it stood at when he became CEO. ""That's largely because Brexit means some investors don't want to touch UK domestic companies like Lloyds with a bargepole.  ""While this sentiment doesn't look like shifting any time soon, Lloyds shareholders are being paid to wait. The bank is expected to deliver a total dividend of 3.44p this year, equivalent to a 5.5% income yield. Not bad, if you can get it."""
investors sentiments,Why people in China stopped paying their mortgages,2024-09-15,2022-08-09,By Suranjana Tewari,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-62402961,"""Construction stops, mortgage stops. Deliver homes and get repaid!"" That was one of the chants disgruntled apartment buyers in China used at a protest in June. But their ire over unfinished homes didn't stop at signs and chants. Hundreds of them stopped paying their mortgages - a radical step for China, where dissent is not tolerated.  A young couple who moved to Zhengzhou in central China told the BBC that after receiving the down payment last year, the developer withdrew from the project and construction stalled. ""I have imagined countless times the joy of living in a new home, but now it all feels ridiculous,"" the woman, who did not wish to be named, said. A woman in her late 20s who also bought a home in Zhengzhou told the BBC that she too is ready to stop paying her mortgage: ""After the project is fully resumed, I'll continue paying."" Many of them can pay but are choosing not to, unlike the US subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 when money was lent to high-risk borrowers who then defaulted. They have purchased homes in roughly 320 projects around the country, according to a crowd-sourced estimate on Github where homeowners have been posting about their decision. But it's unclear how many actually stopped paying.  The boycotted loans could total $145bn (£120bn), S&P Global ratings estimates. Other analysts say it could be even higher. The revolt has rattled authorities, focusing attention on a market already under pressure from a slowing economy and a serious cash crunch. More alarmingly, it has signalled a lack of confidence in one of the main pillars of the world's second largest economy.  ""Mortgage boycotts, driven by deteriorating sentiment toward property, are... a very serious threat to the financial position of the sector,"" think tank Oxford Economics said in a recent note. China's property sector makes up a third of its economic output. That includes houses, rental and brokering services; industries producing white goods that go into apartments; and construction materials. But China's economy has been slowing - in the last quarter it grew by just 0.4% compared to the previous year. Some economists don't expect any growth this year. That's largely because of Beijing's zero-Covid strategy - repeated lockdowns and continued restrictions have affected incomes and, in turn, savings and investments. The size of China's economy means that disruption in a crucial market - like property - can affect the global financial system. Experts believe contagion is the concern now - banks won't lend if they believe the sector is tanking.  ""It will all depend on policy,"" says Ding Shuang, head of Greater China economic research at Standard Chartered. ""Unlike in other parts of the world where property bubbles break because of the markets, this is government-inflicted.""  Thirty real estate companies have already missed foreign debt payments. Evergrande, which defaulted last year on its $300bn debt, is the most high-profile casualty. S&P has warned that if sales do not pick up, more companies could follow suit. Demand for homes is also not rising as China undergoes a demographic change with urbanisation and population growth slowing.  ""The fundamental issue is that we have reached a turning point in the housing market in China,"" says Julian Evans-Pritchard, a senior China economist at Capital Economics.  Real estate accounts for about 70% of personal wealth in China - and home buyers often pay upfront for unfinished projects. These ""pre-sales"" make up 70%-80% of new home sales in China, Mr Evans-Pritchard said, adding that developers need that money because they use it to fund several projects at once.  But many young and middle class Chinese are no longer investing in property, likely because of a weak economy, job losses and pay cuts - and now the fear that developers might not complete projects. ""That's part of the problem - developers were counting on new money coming in, and those new sales are not happening anymore,"" Mr Evans-Pritchard said. More than $220bn worth of loans could be tied to unfinished projects, according to banking group ANZ. And credit - a  major source of cash in the boom years - has also dried up.  In 2020, China's government introduced the ""three red lines"" - accounting measures to limit how much developers could borrow. That cut off funding, and the subsequent lack of confidence in the market has also affected banks' willingness to lend to property companies.  For one, Beijing is putting the onus on local governments - they're offering reduced deposits, tax rebates and cash subsidies to home buyers, and relief funds to developers. But this comes at a cost because local coffers will take a hit as property developers buy less land. ""I think this is the moment for the central government and regulators to step in,"" Mr Ding said. ""At some point it will step in to ring-fence the problem of some companies. The sector is too important for the economy."" The Financial Times recently reported that China issued $148bn in loans to help property developers, and Bloomberg reported that mortgage holders may be given a payment holiday without it affecting their credit score. But in a recent note, Oxford Economics said any government intervention in real estate and infrastructure may provide a short-term boost but that ""it is not ideal for China's longer-term growth as the government and the financial sector are being forced to help sustain an unproductive (and failing) real estate industry"". This is also not just a financial crisis. The boycott of mortgages risks becoming a serious social issue, Mr Ding said. And that could become a problem for President Xi Jinping ahead of a crucial party congress later this year where he is expected to seek a historic third term.  Analysts say the reported bailout - $148bn - may not be enough. Capital Economics estimates companies need $444bn just to complete halted projects. It's also not clear whether banks - especially smaller rural ones - can absorb the cost of the mortgage strike.  Even if construction restarts, many developers may not survive because house sales are unlikely to shore up sentiment. Sales in China's 100 top developers dropped by 39.7% in July compared to the same period last year, according to China Real Estate Information Corp (CRIC). This crisis is the clearest indication yet that China's economy is at a crossroads. ""The government is trying its best to find new sources of growth but that's going to be challenging because the economy has been very reliant on property, infrastructure investment and exports over the last three decades,"" Mr Evans-Pritchard said. ""The era of very rapid growth in China is probably now over... and that's most obvious in the property sector at the moment."" Additional reporting by BBC Beijing"
investors sentiments,Fed confidence about US economy grows,2024-09-15,2018-02-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43148881,"The US Federal Reserve is preparing for stronger-than-expected economic growth this year, a view that boosts the case for higher interest rates. But some policymakers remain doubtful that the gains will appear in the form of rapid inflation and higher wages. Those members urged their colleagues to be ""patient"" as they weigh future rate rises. The views were revealed in minutes published on Wednesday from the Fed's January meeting. The meeting, the final gathering led by former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, concluded 31 January.  It preceded turmoil in the stock market that has been pinned partly on investor calculations that the Fed might raise interest rates more rapidly than anticipated.  Investors were reacting to data, including wage increases, that suggested inflation might be stronger than in recent years, prompting the Fed to raise rates more quickly. US stocks jumped after the minutes were released, but sank again as the afternoon continued, reflecting continuing uncertainty about the bank's future course.  The Fed has been shifting away from the policies aimed at economic stimulus it enacted during the recession, including ultra-low interest rates.  The bank took no action to raise rates at its January meeting, but markets expect at least three rate rises this year, and predict the Fed will take its next action in March. Investors are also watching carefully to see if new Fed chair Jerome Powell takes a more aggressive stance than Ms Yellen, who was viewed as moving relatively slowly to raise rates. At the January meeting, ""almost all"" Fed members - more than previously - said they expect inflation to hit the bank's 2% target over the medium term, bolstering the case for future rate rises. A number of Federal Reserve members also ""marked up"" forecasts for 2018 growth to reflect stronger economic data since December, according to the minutes. However, the record showed the participants continued to hold a wide range of views about inflation and wage pressures. While some see the possibility of rapid inflation, others see ""little solid evidence"" of inflation or wage pressures, the minutes said.  ""They judged that the committee could afford to be patient"". Ken Matheny, executive director for US economics at Macroeconomic Advisers by IHS Markit, said the discussion was ""consistent"" with predictions of several rate rises in 2018. Mr Matheny, whose firm is predicting four rate rises this year, said he expects inflation will finally hit the Fed's 2% target causing ""dovish sentiments to fade""."
investors sentiments,Unfinished business for the next first minister,2024-09-15,2023-02-20,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-64712806,"In the weeks before Nicola Sturgeon hands back the Great Seal of Scotland and boxes up her books at Bute House, there is unfinished business. A lot of it has to do with, well, business. A budget to pass on Tuesday. And the economy.  And it's likely that the low profile given to growing the economy under Ms Sturgeon's leadership might be something Kate Forbes and perhaps others will wish to change. When she's not being required to explain her Christian faith, that seems to be one part of the turf where the finance and economy secretary intends to pitch her leadership campaign tent. Her main rival, Humza Yousaf, has less of a track record in economic roles, either as a minister or outside politics.  As transport secretary for two years, he was on the ministerial bridge while Ferguson shipyard was heading for the rocks, and his record on ScotRail was to shift the points in the direction of public ownership. Benny Higgins, the former banker who was given the task of drawing up an economic recovery plan a few months after the first Covid lockdown, does not sound impressed by progress on his report or others. He told the Financial Times this weekend that there remains ""a tendency to announce a new study or a new group, when actually there are a lot of things that are staring you in the face and you just need to tackle"". It's perceived that social justice and health has taken priority on Nicola Sturgeon's watch. And even where the outgoing First Minister has set out goals which could boost the economy, there's disappointment at the track record of following up. There's a huge business opportunity, for instance, in insulating and re-fuelling Scotland's heating systems. The WWF environment group reports on the slow progress there.  The Scottish government said it would introduce ways that tied its budget in with its commitment to reaching net zero. That hasn't gone well either, according to the Fraser of Allander Institute.  The economists were asked by the Scottish government to assess how it's doing. The response - published in a blog last week - was harsh. The easy thing is to point to hardware. But if the boring bit about budget and decision processes isn't right, or isn't even there, the targets will be missed. The Allander people found that there's a ""significant gap"" between government intentions and reality - across project planning, impact on equalities or islanders, for instance, and on which project options provide the best social outcomes, let alone economic ones. The economists concluded: ""This is hugely concerning given the importance of these processes to setting clear objectives, identifying value for money, supporting evidence-based policymaking, documenting information and ensuring policy matches the overarching strategic goals of Government.  ""These processes appear to be regularly missing key components, insufficient in quality, performed too late to genuinely influence how decisions are made, or missing entirely."" It's suggested the Scottish government is merely ""tinkering around the edges"", and as such, it's not taking its environmental targets seriously. ""Decisions being made now are locking in emissions many years in the future, and government-wide change is a slow process,"" conclude the Strathclyde University economists.  They quote the Committee on Climate Change, an adviser to the Scottish government, saying in December that 'Scotland's climate targets are in danger of becoming meaningless'.  And they write: ""Our project has found that integration of climate targets into internal processes is severely lacking and so we echo this sentiment. Immediate action is required if the Government wishes for its climate targets to remain rooted in reality."" Ouch. The Scottish government response is to confirm that this net zero challenge is complex and on a big scale. It says it's doing work on its budget and that it remains ""continually ambitious"".  That may all be true, but it's not to the point. So what about growing business?  You might have expected Nicola Sturgeon to ensure at least that women would get a helping hand in starting up business.  And yet it took until the week after she announced her departure for that issue has been addressed by a further review. This one was launched by the First Minister with small tech firms in Midlothian, as the leadership contest was being fired up elsewhere. Its co-author, investment specialist Ana Stewart, commented on the support for women starting up in business: ""I'm shocked myself by the scale of the chasm, really. ""Only one in five businesses in Scotland are female-led, and that hasn't changed in the last 10 years. ""So despite people thinking progress is being made, nothing in statistics that we've looked at - and they're very robust statistics - is telling us the progress is being made."" So there are 31 recommendations - not all for government, of course. It is in the finance sector that bigger challenges lie, while women get only 2% of the start-up funding made available by institutional investors. Other business lobby groups are more interested in seeing where the SNP leadership candidates will go with measures that are in the pipeline to do with health and the environment and which carry a new regulatory burden, particularly for the hospitality sector - on advertising alcohol, marketing food and recycling drink containers. As they're all agreed that independence is a good thing (they know the electorate in this contest), is that where they'll differentiate themselves from each other, and from Nicola Sturgeon?"
investors sentiments,Government reassures over Interserve,2024-09-15,2018-01-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42715453,"The government has said it does not believe any of its major suppliers are in a similar position to Carillion. It commented after shares in the construction and services firm Interserve fell amid reports that its financial health was under special Cabinet Office scrutiny.  The Cabinet Office said it monitored all its ""strategic suppliers"", and was in regular talks about their finances. Interserve said it was keeping officials informed.  Interserve shares dive on new warning Carillion: Not alone in hitting problems The company, which employs 80,000 people worldwide, issued a profits warning in September saying its profits were likely to halve, in part because of big losses in its energy-from-waste business.  This was followed by a second profits warning in October.   It said it expected net debt for 2017 to be about £513m, in part because of the problems in the energy-from-waste business, but also a ""normalisation of trading terms with our supply chain and exceptional costs"".  However, it forecast that debt would peak in the first half of 2018. Interserve is involved in a three-year restructuring programme launched by new management in October aimed at improving efficiency, its procurement process and simplifying the business. On Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the Cabinet Office was monitoring Interserve.  In response, Interserve said: ""Last week we announced that we expect our 2017 performance to be in-line with expectations outlined in October and that our transformation plan is expected to deliver £40m-£50m benefit by 2020."" It said it expected its 2018 operating profit to be ""ahead of current market expectations and we continue to have constructive discussions with lenders over longer-term funding"". ""We are keeping the Cabinet Office closely appraised of our progress as would be expected,"" it added. Like Carillion, Interserve's business involves construction, as well as cleaning, healthcare probation and healthcare services.   The Cabinet Office said: ""We monitor the financial health of all of our strategic suppliers, including Interserve.   ""We are in regular discussions with all these companies regarding their financial position. We do not believe that any of our strategic suppliers are in a comparable position to Carillion."" Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said Interserve had had its problems ,""but it's no Carillion"".  He said last week's trading update ""showed improvement"", but added that Wednesday's reports would do ""no good for sentiment, given there may be some twitchiness among investors in the sector following Carillion's collapse"". ""Comparisons with Carillion are all too easy to make, of course - a diverse business operating on thin margins. It has faced pressure from employment and contract mobilisation costs and margin deterioration from a cost base which has not been flexible enough,"" added Mr Wilson. However, he added: ""The arithmetic doesn't look anything like as bad as Carillion."" He pointed out that Interserve had been winning contracts in recent months, including a £140m contract with the BBC to continue providing facilities services and a £227m contract from the Department for Work and Pensions.  Shares in Interserve fell sharply at the start of trading in London, but have subsequently rebounded to stand about 1.5% lower."
investors sentiments,Asia follows global shares slide amid Covid fears,2024-09-15,2021-07-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57885183,"Asian stock markets fell on Tuesday, tracking sharp declines seen in Europe and the US on Monday that were triggered by fears that rising Covid cases will hamper economic recovery. Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 1% to hit its lowest level in six months, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng also lost 1%. On Monday, both the UK's FTSE 100 index and the US Dow Jones Industrial Average had tumbled by more than 2%. But shares in London and the rest of Europe started stronger on Tuesday. The FTSE 100 index rebounded 1%, while other major European indexes saw similar rises. Monday's sharp falls came as investors became increasingly jittery about the rise in the number of Covid cases in some countries, fuelled by the Delta variant. Japanese shares have now fallen for five sessions in a row over concerns about the spread of the variant and that the Tokyo Olympics could worsen the health crisis. ""Investors are concerned that the rapid spread of the Delta variant will derail the trajectory of the global recovery, notably in Asia which still has relatively low vaccination rates and where some widely used vaccines do not appear overly effective against it,"" Jeff Halley, senior market analyst, from Oanda told the BBC. ""I believe we are in for a messy week ahead, with markets being driven around by sentiment and not data, as the international economic calendar is very quiet."" Meanwhile, businesses in the UK have described how they are cutting opening hours, closing shops or may have to reduce production as employees are forced to self-isolate after being alerted by the NHS Covid-19 app. ""Optimism which had been on the horizon just a few weeks ago has again been obscured by dark clouds, especially with the snap decision to enforce a 10-day quarantine for arrivals from France,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, on Monday. ""With some scientists warning that infections could reach 200,000 a day by September, there is now a feeling that the UK could be staring at a fresh autumn lockdown,"" she added. At a media briefing, US President Joe Biden urged Americans to get vaccinated in order to ensure the economy can remain open. Covid infections linked to the Delta variant have been increasing, but concerns among US investors spiked after Los Angeles imposed an indoor mask mandate again over the weekend. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.1% in its worst session of 2021.  Commenting on how markets performed on Monday, President Biden said: ""That's not how I judge economic growth."" His comments came after data published last week showed prices in the US spiked again in June, driven higher by the cost of used cars and food increasing. Mr Biden said that the increase in inflation was expected to be temporary, but he understood that unchecked inflation over the long term would pose a ""real challenge"" to the economy."
investors sentiments,"London still works for share listings, says boss",2024-09-15,2023-06-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65777308,"""London still works"" as a place to float a business on the stock exchange, according to the boss of the world's largest producer of natural soda ash. We Soda has announced plans to list its shares in the UK, in a move that could value it at up to $7.5bn (£6bn). The move is being seen as a boost for London's stock market, after concern it is losing out to overseas rivals. It would be the country's biggest flotation so far this year and could see We Soda enter the FTSE 100 index. According to consultancy EY, the amount raised through share flotations in London fell by 90% last year. Earlier this year, building materials giant CRH said it would be moving its main share listing from the UK to the US. British microchip designer Arm is to float in the US despite reports that the UK government had lobbied it to choose London. But We Soda chief executive Alasdair Warren told the BBC's Today programme it had chosen the UK as it felt the London market was one that would ""well understand our business"". The soda ash produced by We Soda can be found in washing powder detergents, and is also used by companies in the production of goods such as glass. solar panels and batteries for electric vehicles. As well as soda ash, Mr Warren said the company was also a chemicals producer, ""with lots of characteristics which are similar to a lot of the speciality chemicals companies that are listed in London"". Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges. But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here. Accountants, lawyers, financial PR firms and others feed off the fees that UK listings generate. The exodus has not gone unnoticed by the government. It has been scrambling to try to make the UK a more attractive place for companies to set out their stall. We Soda already has its headquarters in London and Europe is its biggest market.  Mr Warren added that since the company had launched its flotation plans, ""we've had almost 300 investors express interest, around half of those are from the UK, but a half of them are from also other countries around the world, including a lot from the US and Europe"". ""So I think that that's an endorsement of the fact that London still works and we're very confident we'll get a good deal done,"" he said, We Soda is owned by Ciner Group, a Turkish industrial conglomerate controlled by billionaire Turgey Ciner. The flotation is aiming to raise about $800m for the Ciner Group, with part of the proceeds being used to pay down debt. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the flotation was a ""ray of light"" for the London market. However, she added it was ""unlikely to lead to a flood of immediate listings due to the still volatile nature of market sentiment""."
investors sentiments,Coronavirus fears wipe £200bn off UK firms' value,2024-09-15,2020-02-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51681620,"London's FTSE 100 share index has seen one of its worst weeks since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008 as markets continue to reel from the impact of the coronavirus.  Shares have shed almost 13% of their value, wiping £210bn from the value of companies on the index. Investors are worried after a surge in the number of companies warning about the impact of the outbreak on firms. US markets are also in the red, with markets around the globe in retreat. ""The panic mode is full on,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. ""The coronavirus outbreak has certainly hit businesses, and it might have a longer-than-expected negative impact on company earnings and global growth,"" she added. Globally, the dismal week on stock markets has so far wiped about $5 trillion from the value of listed companies around the world, according to Capital Economics' chief economist Neil Shearing. He said that affected the value of pension pots and could make it more difficult to borrow money if banks become more fearful of taking risks. Big shifts in the stock market are often in the news, whether they are booms in the US or falls due to the coronavirus or the financial crisis. As companies grow, they issue shares. The largest companies in the UK have shares which are bought and sold on the London Stock Exchange. There are good reasons why this performance affects your life and finances. Millions have pensions - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest this money to help it grow. Widespread falls in share prices are likely to be bad news for pension savers. Read more here. Investors are selling shares over fears that consumers will spend less if the virus continues to spread in the UK, Mr Shearing said. Instead, he said, investors are putting their money into government bonds, which are considered a safer investment. ""The markets are essentially betting on the fact that growth is going to slow the central bank is going to cut interest rates,"" he said. And it could be a safe bet. In an interview with Sky News, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that the coronavirus outbreak could lead to a downgrade of the UK's economic growth prospects. One of the firms selling some shares to buy government bonds is Bowmore Asset Management. ""We've gone from risk assets into more safe-haven assets,"" the wealth manager's client director Charles Incledon said. The company said that more than 130 listed firms in the UK had warned about the effects of the coronavirus on their business. Those firms range from travel companies to drinks makers, with both British Airways owner, IAG, and Diageo, which makes Guinness, warning that the demand had been affected by the outbreak. But Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that the reaction of investors to the announcements by companies was becoming increasingly irrational. ""Yes, the outbreak is frightening. Yes, it's unquantifiable. But is it as bad as a traditional influenza season in the West? No."" He said it had killed fewer people in Europe than the French heatwave last year. ""I don't want to sound macabre or unconcerned about it, but it shows how stock market sentiment has shifted from being over-exuberant to having no fear at all to now having reassessed things in a more sober fashion."""
investors sentiments,Why people in China stopped paying their mortgages,2024-09-15,2022-08-09,By Suranjana Tewari,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-62402961,"""Construction stops, mortgage stops. Deliver homes and get repaid!"" That was one of the chants disgruntled apartment buyers in China used at a protest in June. But their ire over unfinished homes didn't stop at signs and chants. Hundreds of them stopped paying their mortgages - a radical step for China, where dissent is not tolerated.  A young couple who moved to Zhengzhou in central China told the BBC that after receiving the down payment last year, the developer withdrew from the project and construction stalled. ""I have imagined countless times the joy of living in a new home, but now it all feels ridiculous,"" the woman, who did not wish to be named, said. A woman in her late 20s who also bought a home in Zhengzhou told the BBC that she too is ready to stop paying her mortgage: ""After the project is fully resumed, I'll continue paying."" Many of them can pay but are choosing not to, unlike the US subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 when money was lent to high-risk borrowers who then defaulted. They have purchased homes in roughly 320 projects around the country, according to a crowd-sourced estimate on Github where homeowners have been posting about their decision. But it's unclear how many actually stopped paying.  The boycotted loans could total $145bn (£120bn), S&P Global ratings estimates. Other analysts say it could be even higher. The revolt has rattled authorities, focusing attention on a market already under pressure from a slowing economy and a serious cash crunch. More alarmingly, it has signalled a lack of confidence in one of the main pillars of the world's second largest economy.  ""Mortgage boycotts, driven by deteriorating sentiment toward property, are... a very serious threat to the financial position of the sector,"" think tank Oxford Economics said in a recent note. China's property sector makes up a third of its economic output. That includes houses, rental and brokering services; industries producing white goods that go into apartments; and construction materials. But China's economy has been slowing - in the last quarter it grew by just 0.4% compared to the previous year. Some economists don't expect any growth this year. That's largely because of Beijing's zero-Covid strategy - repeated lockdowns and continued restrictions have affected incomes and, in turn, savings and investments. The size of China's economy means that disruption in a crucial market - like property - can affect the global financial system. Experts believe contagion is the concern now - banks won't lend if they believe the sector is tanking.  ""It will all depend on policy,"" says Ding Shuang, head of Greater China economic research at Standard Chartered. ""Unlike in other parts of the world where property bubbles break because of the markets, this is government-inflicted.""  Thirty real estate companies have already missed foreign debt payments. Evergrande, which defaulted last year on its $300bn debt, is the most high-profile casualty. S&P has warned that if sales do not pick up, more companies could follow suit. Demand for homes is also not rising as China undergoes a demographic change with urbanisation and population growth slowing.  ""The fundamental issue is that we have reached a turning point in the housing market in China,"" says Julian Evans-Pritchard, a senior China economist at Capital Economics.  Real estate accounts for about 70% of personal wealth in China - and home buyers often pay upfront for unfinished projects. These ""pre-sales"" make up 70%-80% of new home sales in China, Mr Evans-Pritchard said, adding that developers need that money because they use it to fund several projects at once.  But many young and middle class Chinese are no longer investing in property, likely because of a weak economy, job losses and pay cuts - and now the fear that developers might not complete projects. ""That's part of the problem - developers were counting on new money coming in, and those new sales are not happening anymore,"" Mr Evans-Pritchard said. More than $220bn worth of loans could be tied to unfinished projects, according to banking group ANZ. And credit - a  major source of cash in the boom years - has also dried up.  In 2020, China's government introduced the ""three red lines"" - accounting measures to limit how much developers could borrow. That cut off funding, and the subsequent lack of confidence in the market has also affected banks' willingness to lend to property companies.  For one, Beijing is putting the onus on local governments - they're offering reduced deposits, tax rebates and cash subsidies to home buyers, and relief funds to developers. But this comes at a cost because local coffers will take a hit as property developers buy less land. ""I think this is the moment for the central government and regulators to step in,"" Mr Ding said. ""At some point it will step in to ring-fence the problem of some companies. The sector is too important for the economy."" The Financial Times recently reported that China issued $148bn in loans to help property developers, and Bloomberg reported that mortgage holders may be given a payment holiday without it affecting their credit score. But in a recent note, Oxford Economics said any government intervention in real estate and infrastructure may provide a short-term boost but that ""it is not ideal for China's longer-term growth as the government and the financial sector are being forced to help sustain an unproductive (and failing) real estate industry"". This is also not just a financial crisis. The boycott of mortgages risks becoming a serious social issue, Mr Ding said. And that could become a problem for President Xi Jinping ahead of a crucial party congress later this year where he is expected to seek a historic third term.  Analysts say the reported bailout - $148bn - may not be enough. Capital Economics estimates companies need $444bn just to complete halted projects. It's also not clear whether banks - especially smaller rural ones - can absorb the cost of the mortgage strike.  Even if construction restarts, many developers may not survive because house sales are unlikely to shore up sentiment. Sales in China's 100 top developers dropped by 39.7% in July compared to the same period last year, according to China Real Estate Information Corp (CRIC). This crisis is the clearest indication yet that China's economy is at a crossroads. ""The government is trying its best to find new sources of growth but that's going to be challenging because the economy has been very reliant on property, infrastructure investment and exports over the last three decades,"" Mr Evans-Pritchard said. ""The era of very rapid growth in China is probably now over... and that's most obvious in the property sector at the moment."" Additional reporting by BBC Beijing"
investors sentiments,Former Staples chain in administration,2024-09-15,2019-03-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47626280,"The former Staples stationery chain, Office Outlet, is in administration, putting 1,200 jobs at risk. The retailer has no connection to the online-only business which trades under the Staples UK name. Two partners at business services firm Deloitte were appointed joint administrators on Monday. Office Outlet, which is part-owned by Hilco, the former HMV owner, has 90 UK stores, which will continue to trade while a buyer is sought.  The administrators said the chain had suffered as demand for stationery supplies had continued to fall and its suppliers cut the credit terms on which it trades. Office Outlet chief executive Chris Yates led a management buyout of the company last September, leaving Hilco as a minority owner.  ""Over the last two years the business has been transformed from the heavily loss-making old Staples business to a near break even modern multichannel retailer,"" Mr Yates said. ""However, additional growth capital was required to continue delivery of the next stage of the management buyout business plan. Despite being highly impressed by the Office Outlet story potential investors have held back due to retail sector sentiment and the general level of uncertainty.""  Joint administrator Richard Hawes said: ""The company has recently experienced a reduction in credit from key suppliers, given the economic outlook which has severely impacted the financial position of the company."" But he went on to say he was hopeful that a buyer could be found and that the business would carry on trading ""with that in mind"".  Office Outlet ran into difficulty last August, when it arranged to close a number of stores under a form of insolvency called a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA). Hilco bought the UK stores of US-chain Staples in 2016, renaming it Office Outlet."
investors sentiments,Stock markets rocket on Covid vaccine hopes,2024-09-15,2020-11-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54874108,"Stock markets have rocketed on hopes of a potential breakthrough in the search for a vaccine against Covid-19. Drugs firm Pfizer's own shares climbed 9% after it said that preliminary analysis indicated that its coronavirus vaccine was 90% effective. Markets, already buoyed after a clear end to the US election, piled on gains. The FTSE 100 jumped nearly 5%.  But some of the initial optimism appeared to fade by the end of the trading session.  In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had jumped 5.6% in opening trade, closed up about 3%. The S&P 500 also retreated from its morning leap, ending just 1.1% higher, short of a new record. Meanwhile the Nasdaq, where many of the tech firms that have benefited from the lockdowns are listed, fell 1.5%. The vaccine hopes revived investor appetite for airlines, hotels, energy firms and others hit hardest by the pandemic, sending shares soaring - in some cases by more than 40%. Firms lifted by the pandemic dived, in contrast, dived.  Such sizable swings are rare. In the case of the UK, the FTSE 100 added roughly £82bn to the value of its shares in the market's best day since March - and one of the ten largest ever single-day gains for the index. Markets are primarily about sentiment - does tomorrow look better than today - and in that regard there has been a radical and probably permanent sea change. With more vaccines in development that optimism could grow.  What this result demonstrates is that while the virus is not yet beaten it is beatable.  That ray of light has lit up stock markets around the world.  As always, some people in the markets are already looking for something else to worry about. If we are returning to a semblance of normality in the months ahead, do the US authorities really need a stimulus package as big as the $3tn to $4tn being discussed by the Biden team? But for now, the markets, like the rest of us, are enjoying the warm glow of the first significant sentiment boost since the virus started ravaging the world economy. Read more here. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, called it ""very very unusual"", but said that a vaccine was ""one of the things that markets have been waiting for"". However, he told the BBC there were ""still lots and lots of questions around the vaccine"" and it was still too early to say when economies would bounce back or whether the market surge would be sustained.   In the UK, shares in travel firms - which have been hit hard by the pandemic - saw the biggest rises, with British Airways owner IAG soaring 25%. Elsewhere in the sector, EasyJet shares rose 34%, while aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce surged almost 45%. Another sector of the economy that has been hit hard by coronavirus is hospitality - catering firm Compass Group saw its shares rise more than 21%.  US-listed Royal Caribbean cruises meanwhile were up 29%, while travel booking firm Expedia jumped 24% and Disney climbed almost 12%.  However, shares in those companies that have benefitted in the crisis fell sharply given the hopes of a successful vaccine.  Drugmakers have been racing to be the first to develop a successful coronavirus vaccine. If Pfizer's vaccine is authorised, the number of doses will be limited initially. Many questions also remain, including how long the vaccine will provide protection. Stock markets had already been rallying in response Saturday's declaration that Joe Biden had won the race to become the next US president. The Pfizer announcement then pushed market optimism ""exceedingly high"", but it ""could fade"" said Neil Wilson. ""We should not be jumping any guns here, but ultimately a vaccine that works effectively would be good for the economy and favours the cyclical parts of the market that we thought were going to struggle,"" he said. ""It's clear the market is forward looking and pricing in recovery in a number of beaten-down areas next year."" Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: ""The Pfizer announcement is not yet a panacea, but adds to investor sentiment which had already been buoyed by the Biden victory, and has sent markets to strongly positive levels."" He noted that airline and related stocks had been rising rapidly, while ""housebuilders, banks and retailers are all in the boat currently being lifted by a rising tide"". ""It is still early days, and the practicalities point to any meaningful distribution not being available until the first few months of next year,"" he added. ""Even so, the news is without question a positive development and has certainly captured the imagination of investors."""
investors sentiments,Metro Bank cash injection talks 'advanced',2024-09-15,2019-05-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48243155,"Metro Bank has said its plans to raise £350m to strengthen its finances are ""well advanced"" as it tries to quell questions over its financial health. The bank's shares have plummeted around 75% since January when it announced it needed the money to boost its capital after an accounting error. Reports have suggested the bank was struggling to raise the cash. But Metro Bank said it was now in ""final discussions"" with shareholders and new investors over its plans. ""Feedback continues to be positive,"" it added. The bank - which has 67 branches in London and the South East - said it expected to raise the cash by the end of June. It said it would raise the money via a share placing, with additional shares created and offered to new and existing investors. The bank revealed in January that it had underestimated the risk level of some of its commercial loans, meaning it didn't have the required shock-absorbing capital it needed to support a number of its business loans. The funds it raises via its new share placing are aimed at making up for the shortfall. The bank said the share sale had been underwritten by the banks arranging the sale.  In a separate move, Metro Bank is also considering selling the commercial loans affected by the accounting error. Chief executive Craig Donaldson told the Financial Times it was an option, but stressed the bank had not made a final decision.  Metro Bank has been under close supervision by regulator the Prudential Regulation Authority after the capital miscalculation. The issue has also weighed heavily on its performance, with its recent results for the first three months of the year showing a sharp drop in pre-tax profit to £6.9m from £10m for the same period a year ago. Chief executive Craig Donaldson said ""adverse sentiment"" has also impacted deposit growth, but said that 2019 would be ""a year of transition"" for the bank. The bank was founded in 2010 by American Vernon Hill, becoming Britain's first new High Street bank for over 100 years.  Its unusual focus, in a world where most banks are drastically cutting back on branches, has been on building physical branches,  which open earlier and longer than any of their rivals."
investors sentiments,Saving the oceans plan was one big fraud,2024-09-15,2019-05-10,By Will Fyfe,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-48225377,"Tony Smith was the businessmen with a golden idea - a new type of fish feed that he said could help save the oceans, while also making Wales a global leader in the aquaculture industry.  So powerful was his pitch that he had no shortage of backers, and was given £4.7m in grants from the Welsh Government and EU. He wanted to create huge ragworm farms to offer sustainable feed to the seafood industry - and experts argued the idea was destined to succeed. But despite that, Smith's companies folded, prompting the start of inquiries into what would eventually be revealed as the largest ever sum defrauded from the Welsh Government. ""It didn't sound too good to be true. It sounded completely logical,"" said Kit Smith, who with his business partner invested £250,000 into Smith's idea. ""I come from an aquaculture and seafood background, everyday I was faced with stories about how catastrophic the industrial fishing sector was, and still is.  ""The race was on to find a solution and an alternative."" The attraction behind Smith's idea lay with the way in which fish were farmed for the seafood industry.  Aquaculture, or farming fish specifically for food, is seen as a way of limiting the impact of traditional fishing on the oceans. But the process uses '""fishmeal"" to feed the stocks, which is itself made up of smaller fish caught from the ocean. ""Because at the moment fishing fleets are going out there and catching all these fish to create fish feed for aquaculture, the industry isn't actually helping the oceans, instead it is contributing to their downfall,"" said Kit Smith's business partner, Malcolm Stewart. The pair were attracted to Tony Smith's idea to use the ragworms, which he was breeding on land in huge ponds, as an alternative to traditional fishmeal. ""We went into it with our eyes open wide, thinking we were going to make the world a better place and make a load of money,"" said Mr Stewart. But about 10 years after they first met Smith, both men say they too were ""duped"" into investing in Smith's fraudulent operation, which collapsed shortly after they had invested.  ""Tony was very charismatic, he came across as very likeable, very genuine, but he was an extremely effective liar,"" said Mr Stewart. ""The whole thing was tragic, it's still a such a great idea and he could have made so much money instead of just ripping everybody off."" After an investigation spanning years, Smith admitted three counts of fraudulent trading involving his companies Dragon Research, Dragon Feeds and Dragon Baits - which were based at sites in Port Talbot and Laugharne, Carmarthenshire. He was jailed for three years and nine months. Janet Potter, deputy head of the Crown Prosecution Service's specialist fraud division, said between 2005 and 2011, Smith consistently lied on applications for grants to pump his businesses full of public money he was not entitled to.  ""He over-exaggerated expenditure made by his companies,"" she said.  ""Producing false invoices which showed expenditure had been made when in fact it hadn't, or by using various ways of money being shown to leave the company, when actually it then made its way back in."" The result, she said, was that Smith was approved for and given large sums of funding that he would never legally have qualified for. ""The grant applications that were made contained information that wasn't true, and deliberately wasn't true. What perhaps is unusual in this case is the persistent applications to the same authority."" Ms Potter said the result of Smith's fraud allowed him to invest very little of his own money in his worm farming ventures, instead allowing taxpayers' money to shoulder the associated risks while he continued to take a salary.  ""The evidence in the case seems to suggest that the money was going back into the companies owned by Mr Smith and others, and obviously they would be receiving an income form those companies.  ""That seems to be where the money was going, it was circulating around the companies.   ""I think people very often think that fraud, particularly against a government is a victimless crime, but the fact of the matter is that this is £4.7m worth of tax payers money and European Union funding that didn't go to legitimate businesses in Wales, it could have provided employment and opportunities for the Welsh community. ""It's a considerable amount of money which has now been taken out of those resources.""  It is a sentiment visible both in terms of jobs and failed promises. At the peak of his success, while expanding his operation to Laugharne, Smith had pledged to create 120 jobs in the aquaculture industry in Wales, but only seven ever materialised. ""Not only did he let me down but he let the Welsh people down,"" said Mr Stewart, who still intends to pursue the £250,000 he said he lost. Although he, like other investors, argue that perhaps Smith's greatest crime was damaging an idea potentially capable of really helping the natural world. ""The biggest tragedy of this whole thing is that he didn't use the money for what it was for. To this day there's a huge gap in the market to create fish feed without fishmeal in it,"" he added. ""There's a huge opportunity and also a huge need for a fishmeal-free fish feed, and he was on the cusp of having it."""
investors sentiments,Is a no-deal Brexit back on the table?,2024-09-15,2019-12-17,By Simon Jack,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50829794,"The government intends to bring down a Brexit process guillotine at the end of December 2020. If we haven't agreed a trade deal by then, we are out anyway. The ghost of no-deal, it seems, will be haunting business in Christmas future.  The financial markets took fright and we saw the pound immediately give up all the gains it enjoyed since the Conservatives won a thumping majority last Friday.  Suddenly pundits and investors who thought an 80-seat majority would neutralise the party's hard Brexit elements prepared - or even wanting - to leave without a deal were seemingly proved wrong.  Many businesses who wanted to press the ""invest now"" button may have wavered this morning. The previous parliamentary brake cables preventing the UK driving off a Brexit cliff have been cut and Thelma Johnson and Louise Cummings are driving merrily towards the edge.   That's the movie. In real life, Boris Johnson, Dominic Cummings (and Michael Gove) really don't want to drive over the edge. They all privately acknowledge that a no-deal Brexit would be a very bad outcome for the UK economy and the Prime Minister knows that would jeopardise his ambition to win multiple terms in Number 10.  Business leaders in the UK have also been slow to sound the alarm over a new potential cliff edge in December.  They know that the government found the threat of no-deal very politically useful in renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement (even if they also think Theresa May's deal was better for business).  Many also think that this is a bit of post-election chest beating - a sentiment shared in Brussels.  According to my colleague Katya Adler, there is also a growing consensus that it is possible to do a ""bare bones"" trade deal by next year which can then be added to over time.  In other words, you can extend without extending.  It also adds to the Johnsonian narrative of possessing super powers when it comes to negotiating things no-one thought possible.  There is another camp which believes that enacting a law limiting the negotiating period could actually provide political cover for Mr Johnson to concede some ground to the EU if that becomes necessary towards crunch time next year.  Rupert Harrison, George Osborne's former Chief of Staff and now portfolio manager at the world's biggest money manager Blackrock summed up in a tweet what many in financial markets are thinking. ""Anyone who thinks either side will contemplate a damaging cliff edge has learned nothing from the revealed preferences of the last year"".  In other words - when push comes to shove, both sides will find a way to avoid the edge of the cliff.  One thing we learned this morning the political shadow boxing of the last three years is not over. Indeed, it is arguably just starting. "
investors sentiments,US was 'very worried' over Canada trucker protests,2024-09-15,2022-11-23,By Jessica Murphy,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63736482,"An inquiry into the first-ever use of government emergency powers to bring an end to the ""Freedom Convoy"" protest that gridlocked Canada's national capital last winter completes its public work this week, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expected as its final witness.  The Public Order Emergency Commission is examining whether the Trudeau government was justified in invoking the Emergencies Act to bring an end to the anti-vaccine mandate and anti-government protests that gridlocked the country's national capital and blocked vital border crossings, costing the economy millions of dollars a day.  Over six weeks, the inquiry has offered a rare glimpse behind the curtain into how Canadian officials handled the unprecedented protests that drew the global attention - and revealed plenty of frustration, ""intemperate"" text messages, and finger-pointing as they sought to bring an end to the blockades.  A final report on the inquiry's findings will be released early next year. In the lead-up to Mr Trudeau's testimony, the inquiry, headed by Justice Paul Rouleau, is hearing from a series of federal ministers, including Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, who expressed concern that the protests were harming Canada's reputation and its trade relationship with the US. The Ottawa protest lasted three weeks, from late January to mid-February, but shorter-lived protests cropped up at two key border crossings, near Coutts, Alberta, and at the Ambassador Bridge, a vital trade route between the US and Canada. Mr Trudeau has said that invoking the Act on 14 February - which allowed the government to temporarily impose bans on public assembly in some areas, prohibit travel to protest zones, and give authorities the ability to freeze bank accounts - was a necessary ""last resort"".  Civil liberty groups and the convoy organisers have argued the use of the Act was an overreach.  Police cleared the protests at the border crossings before the emergency order was implemented. But the border blockades - especially at the Ambassador Bridge crossing, used by North America automakers - got the White House's attention.  Ms Freeland spoke with Brian Deese, a senior economic advisor for President Joe Biden, who she said told her the US was ""very, very, very worried"".  Americans saw an ""amber light flashing in Canada - and this amber light said to them, you know what, the Canadian supply chain could be a vulnerability"", she said on Thursday.  Canadian bank CEOs were also worried, telling Ms Freeland during a 13 February call that investors were looking at Canada as a ""joke"". One banker, whose name was not revealed in the call readout released at the inquiry, said a US investor told him: ""I won't invest another red cent in your banana republic in Canada."" Ms Freeland told the banker to remind investors that other countries had recent political upheavals, including the 6 January Capital riots in the US. ""If they are a Brit, remind them of Brexit. If they are French, remind them of the Yellow Vests. If they are German, look at how badly they are handling Russia right now,"" she said. Earlier this week, Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair testified that his colleagues were reluctant to use the emergency powers but that an ""escalation"" of protests - including further ""threatened"" blockades at the border - convinced him otherwise.  He said the blocking of critical infrastructure raised it to ""an actual emergency"".  ""You don't have to blow everything up to render it unusable,"" he said. Two provinces - Saskatchewan and Alberta - said they were caught unawares by the invocation of the Act, and one Alberta official felt Ottawa failed to offer timely help.  In February, Alberta had asked about the possibility of military help to remove vehicles at Coutts, but a text message from provincial Municipal Affairs Minister Ric McIver to Mr Blair - ""Any update?"" - to follow up on the request went unanswered for 11 days. By then, police had ended the blockade. Convoy protesters at the inquiry painted a very different picture of those three weeks in Ottawa compared to city residents who testified about being harassed by convoy participants, feeling like hostages within their own homes, and of diesel fumes and deafening noise.  Protesters, in comparison, described a ""festive"" gathering where people - even families - could come together to make themselves heard by the government after two years of Covid restrictions.  Still, there were tensions. Convoy organisers described infighting among various factions. One organiser, Chris Barber, told the inquiry there was conflict over the role of Pat King, an activist known to have shared extreme views. Both men face criminal charges related to the protests. Text exchanges showed some convoy leaders were wary of Mr King's history of inflammatory comments, including ones threatening Mr Trudeau, but they saw benefit in his large online following.  Mr Barber said it was ""evident"" there was tension between himself and Mr King.  ""It was a power struggle back and forth over control,"" Mr Barber said. There were also concerns over an anti-vaccine mandate ""memorandum"" shared by another group within the convoy that proposed overthrowing the government. One of the lawyers representing the protesters also suggested convoy leaders received regular leaks from law enforcement ""sympathetic"" to their cause.  The convoy raised C$24m ($18m; £15m) from supporters, primarily in Canada and the US, the inquiry heard. Some funds were returned to donors while some remain frozen because of litigation by Ottawa residents.  At the heart of the inquiry is whether the high legal bar to invoke the Act - specifically an ""urgent and critical situation"" that ""seriously endangers the lives, health or safety of Canadians"" - was met.  Among other measures, invoking the Act allowed the government to bring in tow trucks to remove the big rigs blocking Ottawa's city centre and to freeze an estimated 280 bank accounts linked to protesters.  A document from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) warned that using it could ""further the radicalisation of some towards violence"" and ""galvanise anti-government sentiment"".  The intelligence service also had doubts that the protests met the defined national security threat threshold - but ultimately, CSIS director David Vigneault testified he recommended its use.   Mr Vigneault said a combination of factors - the unpredictability of the event, its variable size and scope, the strain on police resources and the fact that ""there were ideologically motivated violent individuals who were interested"" in the protests - led him ""to believe that the regular tools were just not enough to address the situation"". Tensions between various levels of government and different police forces came up frequently over the past six weeks. According to a summary of an 8 February phone call between Mr Trudeau and Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson, the prime minister accused Ontario Premier Doug Ford of ""hiding from his responsibility on it for political reasons"".  Mr Watson then complained that Mr Ford had been skipping meetings of federal and municipal officials.  Mr Ford expressed his own frustrations to Mr Trudeau in a phone call the next day, accusing Ottawa's police and mayor of having ""totally mismanaged"" the situation.  Protesters at the time were blocking the Ambassador Bridge, halting trade between Detroit and Windsor. Mr Ford told Mr Trudeau he couldn't direct the provincial police to act, but vowed the force would have a plan in place.  ""I'll be up their ass with a wire brush,"" he told the prime minister.   The premier of Canada's most populous province has publicly supported the Trudeau government's decision to invoke the emergency powers, but refused to testify at the inquiry.  "
investors sentiments,Pound's gains erased amid Brexit deal jitters,2024-09-15,2019-10-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50082926,"The rally in the pound triggered by news of a Brexit agreement has failed to last following concerns that the deal could still be scuppered. Sterling had surged to a five-month high against the dollar, coming close to $1.30, after the UK and EU's negotiating teams agreed a deal. However, the pound began to lose ground after Northern Irish party the DUP said it would not vote for the deal. Sterling fell back below $1.28 in early afternoon before steadying again. There was a similar pattern against the euro. At first the pound jumped above €1.16, before falling back to stand at €1.1582. Worries about the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a deal have been weighing on the value of the pound, as markets view a no-deal Brexit scenario as damaging for the UK's economy. Sterling has risen in value whenever there have been signs that a deal could be reached. Announcing news of the breakthrough in the Brexit talks, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: ""We've got a great new deal that takes back control."" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the deal was ""a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions"". ""I recommend that [EU summit] endorses this deal."" Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""If the Brexit deal agreed by the EU and UK earlier today passes through Parliament, then there is scope for economic growth, interest rates, gilt yields and the pound to all rise further than is widely expected."" The agreed deal will still need the approval of both the UK and European parliaments, but the opposition from the DUP has cast doubts on its sign-off. In a statement, the DUP, which the government relies on for support in key votes, said: ""These proposals are not, in our view, beneficial to the economic well-being of Northern Ireland and they undermine the integrity of the Union."" Analysts warned that this opposition from the DUP could scupper the deal.  Michael Brown, senior analyst at Caxton, noted that ""some of the wind has been taken out of the pound's sails after reports that the DUP are not yet on board to back a deal"". ""The Parliamentary arithmetic for passing a deal looks challenging,"" he said. ""Attention will continue to focus on whether the new agreement will pass in the Commons on Saturday."" Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said: ""Sterling is giving us the clearest indication of market sentiment on Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. ""Immediately after the deal was announced this morning, sterling rose to within a whisker of $1.30, before weakening back to around $1.28 as concerns about the DUP's lack of support took its toll.  ""Negative positioning suggests that, if the deal passes on Saturday, you could see another climb in the pound to around $1.35-$1.40. ""If the deal fails on Saturday, you could see sterling re-testing lows of $1.20. Looking beyond that, if a 'no-deal Brexit' once again rears its ugly head, a level of $1.10 or below would be likely."" News of the agreement initially lifted the stock market too, but by the close, the FTSE 100 index had fallen back and closed just 0.4% higher.  The prime minister wrote an open letter to British businesses following the deal's announcement, recognising business leaders' need for certainty and their preference for leaving the EU with a deal.   He said his deal would provide ""the basis of a new relationship with the EU based on free trade and friendly co-operation"". ""We can now get Brexit done and leave the EU in two weeks' time, without disruption and in a friendly way,"" the letter said. Adam Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce said many businesses would ""reserve judgement until they see the detail"", adding that firms ""need a chance to analyse precisely what the terms of this agreement would mean for all aspects of their operations"". ""Let's not forget, we've been here before,"" he added. ""There is still a long way to go before businesses can confidently plan for the future. ""For business, this deal may be the end of the beginning - but it is far from the beginning of the end of the Brexit process.""   For business, pretty much anything is better than no deal so there was a ripple of cautious applause from the business audience today.  Some groups, including the manufacturing lobby in Northern Ireland, specifically urged MPs to accept the deal while others, like the CBI said privately they did not want to take a political position.  For most businesses, the withdrawal agreement is less important than the vision of the future sketched out be the accompanying political declaration and here there were some specific concerns. First there are huge misgivings that the 14 months left until the end of the transition period is anywhere near long enough to thrash out a future relationship, second that the services sector which makes up 80% of the UK economy is barely mentioned, and third, that the commitment to maintain close regulatory alignment between the UK and the EU has been watered down.

investors sentiments,Scotland's appeal to foreign investors bucks trend,2024-09-15,2021-06-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-57374987,"Scotland's appeal to foreign investors bucked the sharp downward trend during the Covid crisis last year, according to an annual survey by accountancy and consulancy firm EY. The number of foreign direct investment (FDI) projects that came to Scotland last year was up from 101 to 107. That 6% rise compared with a 12% drop for the UK as a whole, to 975 projects.  Much of that was from the reduction in digital technology going to London. Europe's total FDI haul was down 13%. While London was the city that continued to attract the biggest number of UK projects - down from 48% to 39% of the UK total - Edinburgh knocked Manchester into second place with 36 projects. Glasgow, with 23, came behind Birmingham and Belfast, followed by Leeds and then Aberdeen, with 13 projects. The UK figures run counter to downbeat assessments of Britain's appeal to international investors following Brexit. Sentiment about investment in the UK rose significantly between a survey last autumn and the spring survey for EY. However, the pattern over the years since the Brexit referendum point to the UK's dominance in this field being challenged by Germany and France. Paris emerged last year as Europe's most attractive city for FDI, but London regained that position in this year's survey. The Scottish figures also suggest the prospect of another independence referendum is not a significant discouragement to foreign investors. Scotland has consistently outperformed other parts of the UK in this annual survey, with the exception of London. Asked this year which are the most attractive parts of the UK to invest, the EY survey of 570 international investors put Scotland on 15%, up from 7% in 2019, and behind only London, which had 25% support. Much of the appeal in Scotland last year was in digital technology, agri-food and business services. The top project activities were in boosting sales and service, reflecting the growth of online sales, plus research and some manufacturing. However, the UK figures on inward investment in manufacturing continued to decline compared with continuing members of the European Union. It was the only sector in which Britain clearly underperformed its near neighbours in attracting investment. That is more likely to reflect Brexit, as Britain is no longer a base from which to manufacture with seamless access across Europe's market. Inward investment, which used to be seen as a source of large numbers of jobs in assembly plants, has shifted in Europe and the UK towards higher value jobs, but fewer of them. The countries that were source of the most investment into Scotland continued to be led by the USA, with 38 of the 107 projects, followed by Ireland (10) and the Netherlands (8). Some 61 of them were new investment projects and the others were re-investments, as existing FDI companies extended and deepened their commitment to operations in Scotland. It is harder to tell the impact of the raw project numbers on jobs, as these are less clear, they can take years to reach employment targets, and they can be skewed from one year to another by big factory investments or takeover deals. The EY analysis of the numbers available suggests a decline in the number of jobs supported by new FDI in Scotland, down from a 10 year average of 4,650 to 4,500 last year. Ali Scott of EY commented: ""Scotland has now narrowed the gap significantly with London, which continues to lead as the most attractive region to establish operations.  ""The scale of this two-year shift is illustrated by London's vote as most attractive region almost halving since 2019, while Scotland's has more than doubled. As well as being firmly established as the UK's second biggest recipient of FDI projects behind London, Scotland is now also in second place in terms of attractiveness, well ahead of third-placed south-east England. ""But this is no time for Scotland to rest on its laurels. As we look to the economic recovery from Covid-19, constructive, practical engagement between business and both the UK and Scottish governments remains key to shaping the right policies, business environment and incentives to give investors continued confidence to invest"". Linda Hanna, interim chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, which co-ordinates efforts to identify and attract inward investment opportunities, argued that the figures reflect the benefit of a ""team Scotland"" approach across the public sector, universities and business.  She said: ""Scotland's incredible workforce, competitive cost base, world-class universities and supportive business environment is what makes global companies want to locate here.   ""Not only does inward investment deliver high-quality, well-paid jobs, it also provides wider benefits such as supply chain opportunities and increased R&D spending that impacts across Scotland's economy."" There is global competition to attract inward investment, using incentives such as tax, subsidy, installing infrastructure and workforce training. Tax is seen as a key element, and the deal struck by the G7 this weekend could see significant shifts in that competition.  If, for instance, Ireland is forced to raise its basic corporation tax from 12.5% to the G7 minimum of 15%, that would make it easier for Scotland to compete with its neighbour for these projects. The UK Government is putting a lot into freeports, intended as low-tax enclaves for industry to import materials, process and export. None have yet been chosen for Scotland, and they are meant to be for green jobs. It could be that initiative is undermined by the G7 agreement. More often, freeports have been found to displace jobs from other parts of the country rather than creating new ones. For Scotland to compete, it is not tax but its workers' skills that are most often the differentiating factor.  Universities are vital to this, producing graduates who stay in Scotland because its cities offer clusters of attractive technology start-ups and innovation. The scale may not be as big as the big factories of the past. But in the wake of Brexit, retaining the in-flow of highly-productive global companies is essential to helping home-grown ones learn and compete."
investors sentiments,Facebook haunted by 'ugly truth' memo,2024-09-15,2018-03-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43594959,"A Facebook executive's memo that claimed the ""ugly truth"" was that anything it did to grow was justified has been made public, embarrassing the company. The 2016 post said that this applied even if it meant people might die as a result of bullying or terrorism. Both the author and the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, have denied they actually believe the sentiment. But it risks overshadowing the firm's efforts to tackle an earlier scandal. Facebook has been under intense scrutiny since it acknowledged that it had received reports that a political consultancy - Cambridge Analytica - had not destroyed data harvested from about 50 million of its users years earlier. The memo was first made public by the Buzzfeed news site, and was written by Andrew Bosworth.  So we connect more people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack co-ordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. It is perhaps the only area where the metrics do tell the true story as far as we are concerned. [...] That's why all the work we do in growth is justified. All the questionable contact importing practices. All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends. All of the work we do to bring more communication in. The work we will likely have to do in China some day. All of it. Read the post in full  Mr Bosworth - who co-invented Facebook's News Feed - has held high-level posts at the social network since 2006, and is currently in charge of its virtual reality efforts. Mr Bosworth has since tweeted that he ""didn't agree"" with the post at the time he had posted it, but he had shared it with staff to be ""provocative."" ""Having a debate around hard topics like these is a critical part of our process and to do that effectively we have to be able to consider even bad ideas,"" he added. Mark Zuckerberg has issued his own statement. ""Boz is a talented leader who says many provocative things,"" it said. ""This was one that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly. We've never believed the ends justify the means."" A follow-up report by the Verge revealed that dozens of Facebook's employees have subsequently used its internal chat tools to discuss concerns that such material had been leaked to the media. What immediately struck me about this leaked memo was the line about ""all the questionable contact importing practices"".  When I downloaded my Facebook data recently, it was the presence of thousands of my phone contacts that startled me. But the company's attitude seemed to be that this was normal and it was up to users to switch off the function if they didn't like it.  What we now know is that in 2016 a very senior executive thought this kind of data gathering was questionable.  So, why is it only now that the company is having a debate about this and other dubious practices? Until now, Facebook has not been leaky. Perhaps we will soon get more insights from insiders as this adolescent business tries to grow up and come to terms with its true nature. The disclosure coincided with Facebook's latest efforts to address the public and investors' concerns with its management. Its shares are trading about 14% lower than they were before the Cambridge Analytica scandal began, and several high profile figures have advocated deleting Facebook accounts. The company hosted a press conference on Thursday, at which it said it had: In previous days it had also announced a revamp of its privacy settings, and said it would restrict the amount of data exchanged with businesses that collect information on behalf of advertisers. The latest controversy is likely, however, to provide added ammunition for critics. CNN reported earlier this week that Mr Zuckerberg had decided to testify before Congress ""within a matter of weeks"" after refusing a request to do so before UK MPs. However, the BBC has been unable to independently verify whether he answer questions in Washington."
investors sentiments,Coronavirus fears wipe £200bn off UK firms' value,2024-09-15,2020-02-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51681620,"London's FTSE 100 share index has seen one of its worst weeks since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008 as markets continue to reel from the impact of the coronavirus.  Shares have shed almost 13% of their value, wiping £210bn from the value of companies on the index. Investors are worried after a surge in the number of companies warning about the impact of the outbreak on firms. US markets are also in the red, with markets around the globe in retreat. ""The panic mode is full on,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. ""The coronavirus outbreak has certainly hit businesses, and it might have a longer-than-expected negative impact on company earnings and global growth,"" she added. Globally, the dismal week on stock markets has so far wiped about $5 trillion from the value of listed companies around the world, according to Capital Economics' chief economist Neil Shearing. He said that affected the value of pension pots and could make it more difficult to borrow money if banks become more fearful of taking risks. Big shifts in the stock market are often in the news, whether they are booms in the US or falls due to the coronavirus or the financial crisis. As companies grow, they issue shares. The largest companies in the UK have shares which are bought and sold on the London Stock Exchange. There are good reasons why this performance affects your life and finances. Millions have pensions - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest this money to help it grow. Widespread falls in share prices are likely to be bad news for pension savers. Read more here. Investors are selling shares over fears that consumers will spend less if the virus continues to spread in the UK, Mr Shearing said. Instead, he said, investors are putting their money into government bonds, which are considered a safer investment. ""The markets are essentially betting on the fact that growth is going to slow the central bank is going to cut interest rates,"" he said. And it could be a safe bet. In an interview with Sky News, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that the coronavirus outbreak could lead to a downgrade of the UK's economic growth prospects. One of the firms selling some shares to buy government bonds is Bowmore Asset Management. ""We've gone from risk assets into more safe-haven assets,"" the wealth manager's client director Charles Incledon said. The company said that more than 130 listed firms in the UK had warned about the effects of the coronavirus on their business. Those firms range from travel companies to drinks makers, with both British Airways owner, IAG, and Diageo, which makes Guinness, warning that the demand had been affected by the outbreak. But Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that the reaction of investors to the announcements by companies was becoming increasingly irrational. ""Yes, the outbreak is frightening. Yes, it's unquantifiable. But is it as bad as a traditional influenza season in the West? No."" He said it had killed fewer people in Europe than the French heatwave last year. ""I don't want to sound macabre or unconcerned about it, but it shows how stock market sentiment has shifted from being over-exuberant to having no fear at all to now having reassessed things in a more sober fashion."""
investors sentiments,Wednesday 'deadline' set for revised Man Utd bids,2024-09-15,2023-03-21,Dan Roan,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65024583,"This video can not be played Sir Jim Ratcliffe: Prospective owner visits Manchester United Prospective owners of Manchester United have been told they have until 21:00 GMT on Wednesday to submit second, revised bids for the club as the takeover saga accelerates.  Just how strict this deadline is, and whether any other bidders emerge, remains unclear.  But BBC Sport has learned that United officials met eight different potential investors over a 10-day period of high-level meetings recently, and confidence is high that several could make formal offers. It could mean that a 'preferred bidder' is declared by Raine - the investment bank conducting the sale - very soon, with it then granted exclusivity on the more thorough due diligence process that would take place.  It means the only two publicly-declared bids - Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim and Ineos owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe - will have had just a few days to consider the data and information they discovered last week during visits to Old Trafford and the club's Carrington training complex.  Both parties are understood to have held positive meetings with United officials and both are thought to remain committed to a takeover and expected to make improved, more detailed bids.  But while the amount that both have so far offered has not been disclosed (with reports both are in the region of £4.5bn), they are clearly far below the £5-6bn valuation that the club's American owners - the Glazers - have established.  Ineos want to buy the combined Glazer shareholding of around 69%, while the Qataris are targeting 100% of the club. Whether they - or any other prospective bidders - are able to submit an offer that persuades the Glazers to sell is the next key question. If not, and with United's fortunes improving significantly in recent months under manager Erik ten Hag, the Americans may well yet decide to retain the club and perhaps instead look to sell a minority stake to the likes of US hedge fund Elliott Investment Management.  Listen: How To Buy A Football Club podcast Interestingly, in a newly-released interview with the Wall St Journal that was conducted before last week's visit to Old Trafford, Ratcliffe said: ""What you don't want to do is pay stupid prices for things because then you regret it subsequently"", a clear signal that he is determined not to overpay for the club he says he supported as a boy growing up in Manchester.  He also said his interest in the club would be ""purely in winning things"", calling the club ""a community asset"", not a financial one.  Ratcliffe and his advisers will hope these sentiments, and his attendance in person on Friday when visiting United where he met Ten Hag, will persuade fans of his intention to be a visible, engaged presence who has the club's interests at heart. Ratcliffe was also accompanied by his team of sports 'experts', including Ineos Director of Sport - the former Team Sky cycling chief - Sir Dave Brailsford.  But as the process reaches a critical stage, the scrutiny on both these prospective owners is also intensifying. The environmental campaign group Greenpeace has labelled the bidding war a ""dirty derby of 'sportswashing' between entities linked to fossil fuels"". It points to the fact that Ineos is a major producer of plastic and supports fracking, and that the Qatari bid has been partly financed by oil and gas in one of the world's largest fossil fuel economies.  Both bidders deny suggestions of 'sportswashing', emphasising a deep affection for the club lays behind their attempted takeovers. The Qataris have also tried to emphasise that their bid will be debt-free and is by an individual, separate from the government. But critics also say that as a member of the country's ruling family and son of the former Prime Minister, Sheikh Jassim's bid is effectively an attempted state takeover. The risk, they say, is that United is then used to help distract from the country's human rights record and discriminatory laws, drawn into geopolitics and foreign policy.    Both bids must also overcome concerns over links with other European football clubs, with Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) owning French club Paris St Germain, and Ineos already owning both Nice and Lausanne.  However many United fans will simply want to see the end of the Glazer's hugely controversial 18-year reign. "
investors sentiments,Metro Bank cash injection talks 'advanced',2024-09-15,2019-05-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48243155,"Metro Bank has said its plans to raise £350m to strengthen its finances are ""well advanced"" as it tries to quell questions over its financial health. The bank's shares have plummeted around 75% since January when it announced it needed the money to boost its capital after an accounting error. Reports have suggested the bank was struggling to raise the cash. But Metro Bank said it was now in ""final discussions"" with shareholders and new investors over its plans. ""Feedback continues to be positive,"" it added. The bank - which has 67 branches in London and the South East - said it expected to raise the cash by the end of June. It said it would raise the money via a share placing, with additional shares created and offered to new and existing investors. The bank revealed in January that it had underestimated the risk level of some of its commercial loans, meaning it didn't have the required shock-absorbing capital it needed to support a number of its business loans. The funds it raises via its new share placing are aimed at making up for the shortfall. The bank said the share sale had been underwritten by the banks arranging the sale.  In a separate move, Metro Bank is also considering selling the commercial loans affected by the accounting error. Chief executive Craig Donaldson told the Financial Times it was an option, but stressed the bank had not made a final decision.  Metro Bank has been under close supervision by regulator the Prudential Regulation Authority after the capital miscalculation. The issue has also weighed heavily on its performance, with its recent results for the first three months of the year showing a sharp drop in pre-tax profit to £6.9m from £10m for the same period a year ago. Chief executive Craig Donaldson said ""adverse sentiment"" has also impacted deposit growth, but said that 2019 would be ""a year of transition"" for the bank. The bank was founded in 2010 by American Vernon Hill, becoming Britain's first new High Street bank for over 100 years.  Its unusual focus, in a world where most banks are drastically cutting back on branches, has been on building physical branches,  which open earlier and longer than any of their rivals."
investors sentiments,US markets mixed after turbulent week,2024-09-15,2018-12-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46699288,"US financial markets were mixed on Friday after a choppy trading session that bounced between gains and losses. The Dow Jones index sank 0.3% and the S&P 500 fell about 0.1%, but the Nasdaq gained almost 0.1%. The moves marked a relatively calm end to a wild week of trade, in which US indexes rallied sharply after plunging on Monday. European markets built on those gains on Friday. The FTSE 100 share index closed up more than 2.2% at 6,733.97. In Germany, the DAX gained about 1.7%, while France's CAC index also rose about 1.7%. Many markets have had a dismal year, as investor sentiment soured on fears of decelerating global growth, trade tensions and rising interest rates. Japan's Nikkei suffered its first annual loss in seven years, while Germany's Dax index closed the year down about 18% - the biggest annual loss in a decade. On Friday, Japan's Nikkei 225 ended 0.31% lower at 20,014.77, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed flat, at 25,504.20. In the US, Friday's declines were fairly widespread. However, they spared the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers such as Amazon. Amazon shares jumped more than 1% on Friday, days after the  e-commerce giant told investors it had a ""record-breaking"" holiday season. Analysts cautioned that movements were exacerbated by the lower dealing levels seen during holiday trading. US shares have been hit this week by weaker than expected home sales and consumer confidence data. Concerns about US-China trade tensions also resurfaced, with reports saying US President Donald Trump is considering an executive order banning the use of Chinese technology. "
investors sentiments,Global markets in sell-off mode,2024-09-15,2018-10-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45995725,"Global markets remained in sell-off mode on Friday, as investor worries sent shares in Asia, Europe and the US tumbling. The benchmark S&P 500 index in the US slid more than 1.7%, closing down almost 10% from its September high. The Dow Jones fell 1.2%, while the Nasdaq slumped more than 2%. The falls extended losses earlier in the month, fuelling concerns that sentiment is shifting as investors face a widening mix of risks. As of this week, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indexes have given up the gains they posted earlier in the year, while the Nasdaq is up only about 2%. On Friday, a US Commerce Department report showing stronger-than-expected annualised growth of 3.5% in the third quarter failed to bolster confidence, as analysts focused on weakness in exports, housing and business investment. Disappointing quarterly results from tech giants Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet also fuelled Friday's declines. On the S&P 500, Amazon - previously one of the market's star performers - was one of the biggest losers. Shares in the retail giant fell more than 7%, after the firm forecast weaker sales growth than expected for the upcoming Christmas season. October is typically a bumpy month for the markets, but the declines have made for one of the worst months in several years. Analysts expect global growth to slow next year, particularly in China. In the US, companies are facing rising costs due to labour shortages and trade tariffs. In Europe, uncertainty over Brexit and Italian debt has also fuelled worries.  On Friday, France's CAC 40 index fell 1.3%, while the Dax slipped about 1%.  In London, the FTSE 100 retreated, closing down 0.9% at 6,939.56. Earlier, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 1.1%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.4%."
investors sentiments,US was 'very worried' over Canada trucker protests,2024-09-15,2022-11-23,By Jessica Murphy,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63736482,"An inquiry into the first-ever use of government emergency powers to bring an end to the ""Freedom Convoy"" protest that gridlocked Canada's national capital last winter completes its public work this week, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expected as its final witness.  The Public Order Emergency Commission is examining whether the Trudeau government was justified in invoking the Emergencies Act to bring an end to the anti-vaccine mandate and anti-government protests that gridlocked the country's national capital and blocked vital border crossings, costing the economy millions of dollars a day.  Over six weeks, the inquiry has offered a rare glimpse behind the curtain into how Canadian officials handled the unprecedented protests that drew the global attention - and revealed plenty of frustration, ""intemperate"" text messages, and finger-pointing as they sought to bring an end to the blockades.  A final report on the inquiry's findings will be released early next year. In the lead-up to Mr Trudeau's testimony, the inquiry, headed by Justice Paul Rouleau, is hearing from a series of federal ministers, including Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, who expressed concern that the protests were harming Canada's reputation and its trade relationship with the US. The Ottawa protest lasted three weeks, from late January to mid-February, but shorter-lived protests cropped up at two key border crossings, near Coutts, Alberta, and at the Ambassador Bridge, a vital trade route between the US and Canada. Mr Trudeau has said that invoking the Act on 14 February - which allowed the government to temporarily impose bans on public assembly in some areas, prohibit travel to protest zones, and give authorities the ability to freeze bank accounts - was a necessary ""last resort"".  Civil liberty groups and the convoy organisers have argued the use of the Act was an overreach.  Police cleared the protests at the border crossings before the emergency order was implemented. But the border blockades - especially at the Ambassador Bridge crossing, used by North America automakers - got the White House's attention.  Ms Freeland spoke with Brian Deese, a senior economic advisor for President Joe Biden, who she said told her the US was ""very, very, very worried"".  Americans saw an ""amber light flashing in Canada - and this amber light said to them, you know what, the Canadian supply chain could be a vulnerability"", she said on Thursday.  Canadian bank CEOs were also worried, telling Ms Freeland during a 13 February call that investors were looking at Canada as a ""joke"". One banker, whose name was not revealed in the call readout released at the inquiry, said a US investor told him: ""I won't invest another red cent in your banana republic in Canada."" Ms Freeland told the banker to remind investors that other countries had recent political upheavals, including the 6 January Capital riots in the US. ""If they are a Brit, remind them of Brexit. If they are French, remind them of the Yellow Vests. If they are German, look at how badly they are handling Russia right now,"" she said. Earlier this week, Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair testified that his colleagues were reluctant to use the emergency powers but that an ""escalation"" of protests - including further ""threatened"" blockades at the border - convinced him otherwise.  He said the blocking of critical infrastructure raised it to ""an actual emergency"".  ""You don't have to blow everything up to render it unusable,"" he said. Two provinces - Saskatchewan and Alberta - said they were caught unawares by the invocation of the Act, and one Alberta official felt Ottawa failed to offer timely help.  In February, Alberta had asked about the possibility of military help to remove vehicles at Coutts, but a text message from provincial Municipal Affairs Minister Ric McIver to Mr Blair - ""Any update?"" - to follow up on the request went unanswered for 11 days. By then, police had ended the blockade. Convoy protesters at the inquiry painted a very different picture of those three weeks in Ottawa compared to city residents who testified about being harassed by convoy participants, feeling like hostages within their own homes, and of diesel fumes and deafening noise.  Protesters, in comparison, described a ""festive"" gathering where people - even families - could come together to make themselves heard by the government after two years of Covid restrictions.  Still, there were tensions. Convoy organisers described infighting among various factions. One organiser, Chris Barber, told the inquiry there was conflict over the role of Pat King, an activist known to have shared extreme views. Both men face criminal charges related to the protests. Text exchanges showed some convoy leaders were wary of Mr King's history of inflammatory comments, including ones threatening Mr Trudeau, but they saw benefit in his large online following.  Mr Barber said it was ""evident"" there was tension between himself and Mr King.  ""It was a power struggle back and forth over control,"" Mr Barber said. There were also concerns over an anti-vaccine mandate ""memorandum"" shared by another group within the convoy that proposed overthrowing the government. One of the lawyers representing the protesters also suggested convoy leaders received regular leaks from law enforcement ""sympathetic"" to their cause.  The convoy raised C$24m ($18m; £15m) from supporters, primarily in Canada and the US, the inquiry heard. Some funds were returned to donors while some remain frozen because of litigation by Ottawa residents.  At the heart of the inquiry is whether the high legal bar to invoke the Act - specifically an ""urgent and critical situation"" that ""seriously endangers the lives, health or safety of Canadians"" - was met.  Among other measures, invoking the Act allowed the government to bring in tow trucks to remove the big rigs blocking Ottawa's city centre and to freeze an estimated 280 bank accounts linked to protesters.  A document from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) warned that using it could ""further the radicalisation of some towards violence"" and ""galvanise anti-government sentiment"".  The intelligence service also had doubts that the protests met the defined national security threat threshold - but ultimately, CSIS director David Vigneault testified he recommended its use.   Mr Vigneault said a combination of factors - the unpredictability of the event, its variable size and scope, the strain on police resources and the fact that ""there were ideologically motivated violent individuals who were interested"" in the protests - led him ""to believe that the regular tools were just not enough to address the situation"". Tensions between various levels of government and different police forces came up frequently over the past six weeks. According to a summary of an 8 February phone call between Mr Trudeau and Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson, the prime minister accused Ontario Premier Doug Ford of ""hiding from his responsibility on it for political reasons"".  Mr Watson then complained that Mr Ford had been skipping meetings of federal and municipal officials.  Mr Ford expressed his own frustrations to Mr Trudeau in a phone call the next day, accusing Ottawa's police and mayor of having ""totally mismanaged"" the situation.  Protesters at the time were blocking the Ambassador Bridge, halting trade between Detroit and Windsor. Mr Ford told Mr Trudeau he couldn't direct the provincial police to act, but vowed the force would have a plan in place.  ""I'll be up their ass with a wire brush,"" he told the prime minister.   The premier of Canada's most populous province has publicly supported the Trudeau government's decision to invoke the emergency powers, but refused to testify at the inquiry.  "
investors sentiments,Fund manager warns of 'turbulent' year for markets,2024-09-15,2020-03-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-51817487,"Standard Life Aberdeen (SLA) has warned of a ""turbulent"" year for the markets after posting a 10% drop in annual profits. The Edinburgh-based group reported underlying pre-tax profit of £584m, down from £650m in 2018. Fee-based revenues fell by 13%, after two years of fund outflows. The asset manager saw net outflows last year of £58.4bn, including £41bn lost when Lloyds Banking Group ended a £100bn-plus contract with the group. SLA said the outflows ""continued reflecting investor sentiment towards emerging markets and equity markets more generally"". The results showed the group's assets under management and administration fell by 1% to £544.6bn, but were 6% up with the hit from the Lloyds contract loss stripped out. Lloyds was forced to pay £140m to SLA last year after a tribunal ruled the banking group did not have the right to end its mammoth contract with the asset manager. SLA has also retained £35bn of Lloyds assets following its dispute with the bank. In its latest full-results, SLA warned that the outlook was set to be volatile, given the coronavirus outbreak and equity market turmoil. Chief executive Keith Skeoch said: ""The outlook for the markets and our industry in 2020 is turbulent with the additional complexity of Covid-19. ""Importantly we are focused on what we can control, namely delivering for our clients, customers, colleagues and shareholders; diversifying our revenues; investing for the future and maintaining financial discipline."" SLA shares were up by 4.5% at 11:30 on Tuesday, amid a wider bounce back in the London market after Monday's heavy falls. John Moore, senior investment manager at wealth management firm Brewin Dolphin, said the foundations of a strong company ""are there if you take a long-term view"".  He added: ""Standard Life Aberdeen has been rigid with its cost-cutting, while new outflows have slowed to a degree and, reflecting the optimism attached to this, the dividend remains in line with guidance.  ""Nevertheless, until there is asset growth and better market conditions, investors in Standard Life Aberdeen will have to remain patient."""

investors sentiments,How your data is being scraped from social media,2024-09-15,2021-07-15,By Joe Tidy,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57841239,"How much personal information do you share on your social media profile pages? Name, location, age, job role, marital status, headshot? The amount of information people are comfortable with posting online varies.  But most people accept that whatever we put on our public profile page is out in the public domain. So, how would you feel if all your information was catalogued by a hacker and put into a monster spreadsheet with millions of entries, to be sold online to the highest paying cyber-criminal? That's what a hacker calling himself Tom Liner did last month ""for fun"" when he compiled a database of 700 million LinkedIn users from all over the world, which he is selling for around $5,000 (£3,600; €4,200). The incident, and other similar cases of social media scraping, have sparked a fierce debate about whether or not the basic personal information we share publicly on our profiles should be better protected.  In the case of Mr Liner, his latest exploit was announced at 08:57 BST in a post on a notorious hacking forum.  It was a strangely civilised hour for hackers, but of course we have no idea which time zone, the hacker who calls himself Tom Liner, lives in. ""Hi, I have 700 million 2021 LinkedIn records"", he wrote. Included in the post was a link to a sample of a million records and an invite for other hackers to contact him privately and make him offers for his database.  Understandably the sale caused a stir in the hacking world and Tom tells me he is selling his haul to ""multiple"" happy customers for around $5,000 (£3,600; €4,200). He won't say who his customers are, or why they would want this information, but he says the data is likely being used for further malicious hacking campaigns. The news has also set the cyber-security and privacy world alight with arguments about whether or not we should be worried about this growing trend of mega scrapes. What's important to understand here is that these databases aren't being created by breaking into the servers or websites of social networks. They are largely constructed by scraping the public-facing surface of platforms using automatic programmes to take whatever information is freely available about users. In theory, most of the data being compiled could be found by simply picking through individual social media profile pages one-by-one. Although of course it would take multiple lifetimes to gather as much data together, as the hackers are able to do. So far this year, there have been at least three other major ""scraping"" incidents.  In April, a hacker sold another database of around 500 million records scraped from LinkedIn. In the same week another hacker posted a database of scraped information from 1.3 million Clubhouse profiles on a forum for free. Also in April, 533 million Facebook user details were compiled from a mixture of old and new scraping before being given away on a hacking forum with a request for donations. The hacker who says he is responsible for that Facebook database, calls himself Tom Liner. I spoke with Tom over three weeks on Telegram messages, a cloud-based instant messenger app. Some messages and even missed calls were made in the middle of the night, and others during working hours so there was no clue as to his location.  The only clues to his normal life were when he said he couldn't talk on the phone as his wife was sleeping and that he had a daytime job and hacking was his ""hobby"". Tom told me he created the 700 million LinkedIn database using ""almost the exact same technique"" that he used to create the Facebook list. He said: ""It took me several months to do. It was very complex. I had to hack the API of LinkedIn. If you do too many requests for user data in one time then the system will permanently ban you.""  API stands for application programming interface and most social networks sell API partnerships, which enable other companies to access their data, perhaps for marketing purposes or for building apps. Tom says he found a way to trick the LinkedIn API software into giving him the huge tranche of records without setting off alarms. Privacy Shark, which first discovered the sale of the database, examined the free sample and found it included full names, email addresses, gender, phone numbers and industry information. LinkedIn insists that Tom Liner did not use their API but confirmed that the dataset ""includes information scraped from LinkedIn, as well as information obtained from other sources"". It adds: ""This was not a LinkedIn data breach and no private LinkedIn member data was exposed. Scraping data from LinkedIn is a violation of our Terms of Service and we are constantly working to ensure our members' privacy is protected."" In response to its April data scare Facebook also brushed off the incident as an old scrape. The press office team even accidentally revealed to a reporter that their strategy is to ""frame data scraping as a broad industry issue and normalise the fact that this activity happens regularly"".  However, the fact that hackers are making money from these databases is worrying some experts on cyber security. The chief executive and founder of SOS Intelligence, a company which provides firms with threat intelligence, Amir Hadžipašić, sweeps hacker forums on the dark web day and night. As soon as news of the 700 million LinkedIn database spread he and his team began analysing the data. Mr Hadžipašić says the details in this, and other mass-scraping events, are not what most people would expect to be available in the public domain. He thinks API programmes, which give more information about users than the general public can see, should be more tightly controlled. ""Large-scale leaks like this are concerning, given the intricate detail, in some cases, of this information - such as geographic locations or private mobile and email addresses.  ""To most people it will come as a surprise that there's so much information held by these API enrichment services.  ""This information in the wrong hands could be significantly impacting for some,"" he said. More Technology of Business Tom Liner says he knows his database is likely to be used for malicious attacks.  He says it does ""bother him"" but would not say why he still continues to carry out scraping operations. Mr Hadžipašić, who is based in southern England, says hackers who are buying the LinkedIn data could use it to launch targeted hacking campaigns on high-level targets, like company bosses for example.  He also said there is value in the sheer number of active emails in the database that can be used to send out mass email phishing campaigns. But cyber-security expert Troy Hunt, who spends most of his working life poring over the contents of hacked databases for his website haveibeenpwned.com, is less concerned about the recent scraping incidents and says we need to accept them as part of our public profile-sharing.  ""These are definitely not breaches, there's no ambiguity here. Most of this data is public anyway. ""The question to ask, in each case though, is how much of this information is by user choice publicly accessible and how much is not expected to be publicly accessible."" Troy agrees with Amir that controls on social network's API programmes need to be improved and says we can't brush off these incidents. ""I don't disagree with the stance of Facebook and others but I feel that the response of 'this isn't a problem' is, whilst possibly technically accurate, missing the sentiment of how valuable this user data is and their perhaps downplaying their own roles in the creation of these databases.""  Mr Liner's actions would be likely to get him sued by social networks for intellectual property theft or copyright infringement. He probably wouldn't face the full force of the law for his actions if he were ever found but, when asked if he was worried about getting arrested he said ""no, anyone can't find me"" and ended our conversation by saying ""have a nice time""."
investors sentiments,Foxtons hit by 'prolonged downturn',2024-09-15,2019-02-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47389160,"London-focused estate agent Foxtons has swung to a loss and says the housing market in the capital is in a ""prolonged downturn"". The company reported a loss of £17.2m for last year, partly due to the costs of closing six offices. It made a profit of £6.5m in 2017. Foxtons added that Brexit uncertainty was ""impacting consumer confidence"". Separately, the Nationwide said the UK market remained ""subdued"", with prices up 0.4% in February from a year ago. Foxtons said annual revenues fell 5% to £111.5m, with the weakness in property sales being offset slightly by a ""resilient lettings performance"". The estate agent was pushed into the red by one-off charges of £15.7m, which included the costs of closing six offices: Beckenham, Enfield, Loughton, Ruislip, Park Lane and Barnes.  Foxtons said it was able to cover 85% of London from 61 branches and had no current plans for further closures. ""Our performance in 2018 was impacted by a further deterioration in the sales market, with transaction levels falling for another year from their already low levels,"" said chief executive Nic Budden. However, the company said that in the long term, London remained ""a highly attractive property market"". The Nationwide said that house prices in February dipped 0.1% from the month before, with the average property now costing £211,304. The Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner, said: ""Indicators of housing market activity, such as the number of property transactions and the number of mortgages approved for house purchase, have remained broadly stable in recent months, but survey data suggests that sentiment has softened. ""Measures of consumer confidence weakened around the turn of the year and surveyors reported a further fall in new buyer enquiries over the same period. ""While the number of properties coming onto the market also slowed, this doesn't appear to have been enough to prevent a modest shift in the balance of demand and supply in favour of buyers in recent months."""

investors sentiments,Is Tesla heading for trouble?,2024-09-15,2018-05-01,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43966754,"Tesla is facing more questions about its financial viability ahead of its latest results on Wednesday. The electric car-maker is facing a cash crunch, caused by a combination of a major debt load and heavy spending. Tesla boss Elon Musk says the firm could be profitable this year and dismissed concerns with an April Fool's Day joke about bankruptcy. However, analysts are less jovial and say Tesla's problems are serious. Since September, the firm's shares have fallen by about a quarter to $296 - and many investors think they will continue to drop. As of April 25, Tesla was the most shorted company in the US, according to S3 Partners, a financial data and analytics firm. John Thompson, chief executive of Vilas Capital Management, is one of the people who has put money on the idea that the share price will collapse, placing pressure on the company and eventually leading to bankruptcy. ""Over the next three to six months, I've said I think the stock will fall significantly, at which time the capital markets will close to Tesla entirely,"" he said. ""Then it's just a matter of time given their losses and their capital expenditure needs.""  Tesla, which has not made an annual profit in its 15-year history, had more than $10bn in debt at the end of 2017 and $3.4bn in cash. The firm has been spending heavily to increase production of its newest car, the Model 3, but continues to fall short of manufacturing forecasts despite robust customer demand. It made just 9,800 Model 3s in the first three months of the year, compared to an earlier goal of 5,000 vehicles a week. Last summer, Mr Musk said Tesla was spending about $100m a week to ramp up production. Bloomberg recently calculated that it continues to spend more than $6,500 per minute. ""I don't see how Tesla's going to survive, given their capital structure, meaning they have a ton of debt and continued massive losses,"" Mr Thompson said. Tesla has previously tapped investors for more money, as well as collecting deposits from customers lining up for its cars. It raised more than $3bn on Wall Street last year, largely by issuing debt, cashing in on the enthusiasm for the firm and Mr Musk, 46, also known for his SpaceX rocket venture, punchy Twitter personality and tortured personal life. This year, Tesla has maintained that it does not need to raise money apart from its ""standard credit lines"", citing improving production.  But in March Moody's said it expects the firm will need to raise about $2bn in the near-term. At the same time, the credit rating agency downgraded Tesla debt, citing the production struggles. Tesla fans, who include celebrities such as Kanye West, remain legion, and demand for both its debt and shares was strong last year. Mr Thompson, for one, thinks sentiment is shifting: ""I think the story of, 'the next car is profitable, the next great thing is going to save the company', is sort of getting old and ... people are starting to realise that.""  In addition to the manufacturing issues, Tesla has faced negative publicity for conflicts of interest on its board, as well as working conditions.  Its autopilot feature is under scrutiny after fatal accidents and the company recently recalled more than 100,000 Model S cars for an issue with the power steering.  Tesla has said its high public profile makes it a target for critics and Mr Musk, who has dubbed short-sellers ""jerks"", recently told CBS he is optimistic about the firm's ""path out of hell"".  Tesla's challenges did not stop shareholders from awarding Mr Musk a record pay package earlier this year.  ""It should be pretty obvious, I think, that I'm not gonna joke about bankruptcy if I think it's remotely real,""  Mr Musk said. ""I'm feeling pretty optimistic about where Tesla is at this point. At this point I can have a clear understanding of the path out of hell, and I did not, until recently, have a clear understanding."""
investors sentiments,Amazon reveals plan to enter healthcare,2024-09-15,2018-01-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42877287,"Amazon, JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway are joining forces to create a healthcare firm aimed at cutting costs for their US employees. The independent firm would be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints"", the firms said. They said their aim was to provide care to staff at a ""reasonable cost"". Nonetheless, the announcement sparked fears that tech giant Amazon could disrupt the healthcare sector in the same way that it has the retail sector.  The firms are the three largest private employers in the US, collectively employing over 500,000 staff. The three companies said they would focus on technology to provide ""simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare"". ""Our people want transparency, knowledge and control when it comes to managing their healthcare,"" said Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase.  ""The three of our companies have extraordinary resources, and our goal is to create solutions that benefit our US employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans."" Shares in US health insurers UnitedHealth, Anthem and Cigna Corp all fell over 5% in early trading following the announcement.  He's the man who started with what was effectively a mail order bookshop with an email address and ended up building a vast machine that has transformed the world's retail industry. Along the way he has sparked a revolution in enterprise computing, putting thousands of organisations into the cloud, bought the Washington Post, and is trying to rival Elon Musk as a space entrepreneur.  No wonder Jeff Bezos thinks he can do anything, including the fearsome task of finding a middle way for American healthcare, which even Donald Trump has described as ""so complicated"".  Just as with Mr Trump, many analysts have predicted over the years that Jeff Bezos and his various ventures are heading for failure or bankruptcy. B ut the world's richest man - well this month at least - has stuck by his own vision and charged ahead. Don't expect him to give up on his audacious health plan in a hurry. ""Investors have continually asked what unexpected development might spoil the strong investor sentiment towards managed care.  ""Unfortunately, this seems tailor-made to fit the bill,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch said. Initially, the company's formation will be headed by Todd Combs, an investment officer of Berkshire Hathaway; Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold, a managing director of JPMorgan Chase; and Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon.  Plans for a longer-term management team and how the company will operate have yet to be decided.  ""The healthcare system is complex, and we enter into this challenge open-eyed about the degree of difficulty,"" said Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos.  ""Hard as it might be, reducing healthcare's burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort.  ""Success is going to require talented experts, a beginner's mind, and a long-term orientation."" The US Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has forecast that the cost of a medical insurance policy would increase by 25% in 2018 and double by 2026."
investors sentiments,Stock markets and pound rise ahead of Brexit deal,2024-09-15,2020-12-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55433657,"UK stock markets have closed for the Christmas break in an upbeat mood. The FTSE 250 jumped 1.15% to 20,531, hours before the Brexit trade deal with the EU was announced. But the blue-chip FTSE 100 ended the day's trading up just 0.01% at 6,502 as traders waited for confirmation of the deal to emerge. Market positivity will give a seasonal boost to investors, including the millions who have a financial stake in stock markets through their pensions. The pound was up, showing a gain of about 0.7% against the dollar to touch $1.36 before falling back slightly. It also gained 0.5% against the euro, rising to €1.1136. Across Europe, shares were also on the rise, although the key Frankfurt stock market was closed. Asian markets closed positively with Japan's Nikkei gaining 0.54%, while markets in Australia, South Korea and Singapore also saw modest rises. Sterling has always been the most reliable of Brexit trade deal sentiment - the pound rose against the US dollar yesterday and continued that rise this morning.  It started the week worth $1.34, dropped to $1.32 as hopes of a deal faded, and this morning climbed to $1.36.  The stock market reaction today has been muted - the FTSE 100 was barely changed this morning, but much of the reaction to the looming deal took place yesterday.  The FTSE 250, a stock market index that is regarded as more representative of the UK economy, climbed nearly 2% on Wednesday.  Lloyds Bank, which investors have come to see as a bellwether of sentiment towards a trade deal, rose 7% yesterday and another 6% this morning. An agreement on fishing rights has been the main stumbling block of the trade talks as an end-of-year deadline looms. The pound has seen plenty of volatility in recent weeks as negotiations between UK and European ministers have stalled and deadlines missed. Last week, it had hit a two-year high above $1.36. The British currency had surged almost 1% in the previous session to snap a three-day losing streak in what has been a roller-coaster ride. ""Sentiment improved after headlines started appearing that the United Kingdom and European Union have finally reached a provisional Brexit trade agreement."" said Jeffrey Halley at foreign exchange firm Oanda. If your reaction to ""market movements"" is that you are not directly affected because you do not invest money, think again. You are likely to be one of the millions of people with a pension - either privately or through work - who have their savings invested by pension schemes. As much as £600bn is held in defined contribution pensions at the moment. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest their money to help it grow. But that means the value of your savings pot is influenced by the performance of the investments. So rises or falls in shares can affect your pension and effectively your savings, which is why you are affected by major market movements. However, it's worth bearing in mind that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet, so short-term market fluctuations are not something to panic about. ""There's a huge difference between knowing you're connected to the stock market and panicking about it,"" says Sarah Coles from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown.  ""Stock markets always go up and down over the short term,"" she adds. ""It's important to bear in mind that investors have lived through major ups and downs in the past and come out the other side."""
investors sentiments,WeWork's Adam Neumann quits as chief executive,2024-09-15,2019-09-24,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49803064,"WeWork's Adam Neumann has agreed to step down as chief executive of the trendy office rental firm saying it's in the ""best interests"" of the company. The decision is effective immediately, the firm said. He will remain with the company as non-executive chairman.  Scrutiny of his leadership had ""become a significant distraction,"" it said.  The move comes after WeWork's plans for a stock market listing ran into trouble, with investors raising concerns about losses and governance. ""While our business has never been stronger, in recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive,"" Mr Neumann said in a statement.  WeWork's board of directors said it had named WeWork's Artie Minson, formerly co-president and chief financial officer, and Sebastian Gunningham, formerly vice chairman, co-chief executives of the company. Mr Neumann built WeWork in his own image, creating a buzzy, multi-billion dollar company known for its co-working spaces, free-flowing alcohol and a stated mission to ""elevate the world's consciousness"". Since 2010, the firm has expanded from a single office in New York City to more than 500 locations in 29 countries. Japanese investment giant Softbank valued the company at $47bn (£37bn) in its most recent investment round. But Mr Neumann's brash charisma, which once attracted investors, emerged as a liability as WeWork decided to sell its shares on the public market. Reports suggest the firm's expected valuation had sunk to between $10bn and $12bn. Reports surfaced detailing erratic decision making and the ways his hard-partying habits had infused corporate culture. Perhaps most alarming to potential investors were the ways Mr Neumann had blurred the lines between his own personal finances and WeWork. For example, over the years, the company had been a tenant in some properties that he owned; and Mr Neumann, who had voting control of the company, had also secured personal loans using company stock as collateral. ""I think many investors are uncomfortable with Neumann's relationship with the company,"" Sam Reynolds, a technology analyst, told the BBC. Mr Neumann agreed to modify some of those arrangements as it became clear that he was losing support from major backers, such as Softbank.  For example, he returned the $5.9m in stock he received for selling WeWork the trademark ""We"" and agreed to give WeWork any profit from properties he owns that the company leases.  His wife Rebekah, a WeWork co-founder who had been given the power to identify a successor, also had her role reduced. Mr Neumann has reportedly also agreed to significantly reduce his voting powers. But even that move and his role change may not assuage concerns about the company, which lost nearly $2bn last year.  Market sentiment has turned, after shares in other high-profile, loss-making start-ups such as ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft, have crashed following flotation. And critics have long complained that WeWork's financials don't make sense, pointing to the firm's losses and the much lower valuations of similar companies such as rival IWG, which used to be known as Regus. WeWork ""is a property company trying to sprinkle tech company fairy dust over itself,"" said Richard Kramer, founder of Arete Research. ""That won't work with investors.""  The company was relying on its stock market launch to unlock new loans, which means its delay could spell trouble. Mr Reynolds said he expected the company to remain privately held for the foreseeable future. ""I think the IPO will be delayed indefinitely,"" he said. ""WeWork certainly has a future, but not as a public company."" Born in Israel, Mr Neumann served in the Israeli Navy before moving to New York to ""get a great job, have tons of fun and make a lot of money"", as he put it in a 2017 TechCrunch interview.  He enrolled at Baruch College at the City University of New York in 2002, but dropped out just shy of graduation to go into business.  One of his early ventures was a baby clothing company that evolved into the luxury Egg Baby brand. Later, he and business partner Miguel McKelvey, an architect, renovated an office space and sublet the property. They sold the business but the idea grew into WeWork.

investors sentiments,Soaring shares: A good or bad sign?,2024-09-15,2017-08-02,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40744544,"For weeks now, US stock markets have been hitting records, a rise claimed by President Donald Trump as proof of a healthy economy.  But Mr Trump's pride in the numbers is at odds with analysts and investors, who have expressed increasing discomfort over the market's climb. About 65% of investment managers surveyed by Northern Trust last quarter said they believed shares were over-valued, the highest ever in the firm's report.  Surveys by Bank of America Merrill Lynch have expressed alarm about the high prices, as have policymakers at the Federal Reserve. ""We are concerned about equity valuations right now,"" says Mike Morrill, chief operating officer at DF Dent, a Baltimore-based investment company. ""We've had nine years of a strong bull market and that's not going to last forever."" The sentiment is similar to statements Mr Trump himself made before his election, when he said the stock market was ""so bloated"" and warned people to ""be careful"". If investors believe prices are too high - and are buying anyway - that could be a sign of a bubble.  So is the stock market rally a reason to cheer, as Mr Trump suggests now? Or could a crash be around the corner? Stocks, which have been on a long-term upward trend, surged early in 2017, amid optimism over business-friendly policies endorsed by the Trump administration, such as tax reform.  Analysts say that without clear signs of progress on reform in Washington that effect has faded.  Now, it's strong corporate revenue and profit growth that are boosting share prices, with gains going to larger, multinational companies. The three major measures - the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq - have climbed between roughly 10% and 17% so far this year, compared with about 6% to 7% during the same period last year. The Nasdaq has hit a new high more than 40 times this year. Since 2012, the value of the S&P 500 index has almost doubled. ""The stock market hit the highest level it's ever been,"" Mr Trump boasted on Wednesday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average exceeded 22,000 points on Wednesday morning.  ""Our country is doing very well,"" he said. But that hasn't stopped the muttering that the stock market, at least, is due for a correction.  Robert Shiller, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at Yale University, says share gains reflect optimism about where the economy is heading, but it's an unreliable forecasting tool, and shifts quickly. ""The stock market is mostly psychology,"" he says. ""The fluctuations in it mean that we're in an optimistic mood but we could change and we could change suddenly."" Investors are trying to anticipate what might trigger a change - whether it be rising interest rates, weak consumer spending, developments overseas or something else entirely.  Mr Shiller says he thinks Mr Trump himself poses one of the biggest risks.   The firestorm in Washington in May after Mr Trump fired former FBI director James Comey prompted some of the biggest one-day share sell-offs this year.  ""Usually, presidents are not able to transform the economy unless he does something disastrous, which transforms it down,"" says Mr Shiller. ""I'm thinking that it's more likely he will create some kind of uncertainty, disruption and that might be a trigger for decline."" Many of the biggest gains come from a single sector - technology stocks - the same industry that some investors say is overvalued. The S&P 500 information technology index, which averages 68 companies, including heavyweights such as Apple, Microsoft and Facebook, last month passed the record set in March 2000.  The index rose about 22% in the first seven months of 2017, while the broader S&P 500 climbed about 10%.  Some say the gains in tech make sense, as investors target a part of the economy seeing rapid growth.  However, others worry that in some cases the rise in shares has little to do with the companies' actual prospects.  And in more recent weeks, tech stocks have come under pressure. If the sell-off spreads to other sectors, it could be a warning of bigger problems.  Jill Hall, a US equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, doesn't expect stock markets in general to rise much more this year, but she's not predicting a big sell-off either.  She thinks investors will shift their money from the high-growth tech industry into sectors such as energy, health care and finance. ""What we're expecting is more of a rotation out of growth and into value,"" she says. Some say they're worried Federal Reserve and central bankers elsewhere will move too aggressively to increase interest rates, causing havoc in bond and stock markets. About 27% of investors surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch last month identified a mistake by central bankers in the US and Europe as the biggest risk to their outlooks. Another 28% were worried about bonds. Mr Trump himself raised alarms on these lines at a presidential debate last year.  ""We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble,"" he said. ""The only thing that looks good is the stock market. But if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down."" That's something that is not lost on the central bankers responsible for monetary policy. Last month Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen told a US congressional committee: ""We want to make sure that we manage this in a way that is not disruptive to financial markets.""  And that's a sentiment financial markets would no doubt endorse. "

investors sentiments,"Bitcoin back above $50,000 as recovery continues",2024-09-15,2021-08-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58309024,"The price of Bitcoin has risen above $50,000 (£36,480) for the first time in three months as the cryptocurrency continues to recover from a deep slump.  The coin fell sharply in May after a crackdown in China and a decision by Elon Musk's Tesla not to accept it as payment any more.  But investor sentiment is improving as more mainstream financial companies begin using the digital currency. Bitcoin is now up 81% since January, when it was trading at just $27,700. On Monday, it climbed almost 3% to $50,266.90 while Ether, another popular digital coin, was up more than 4% at $3,367.51.  It came as PayPal said it would allow customers in the UK to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin and other digital currencies as it expands its crypto services outside of the US for the first time. With over 403 million active accounts globally, the US firm is one of the largest mainstream financial companies to offer users access to cryptocurrencies.  ""This appears to be yet another example of a global company legitimising the use of crypto as it becomes more mainstream,"" said Michael Hewson at CMC Markets.   Continued support from the US Federal Reserve for the US economy has also bolstered Bitcoin recently, analysts say. It is holding interest rates at record lows and making riskier assets more attractive to investors.  Neil Wison of Markets.com said Bitcoin's rebound ""shows no signs of cooling"", although he said he expected to see some ""pullback"" in the short term.  But Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities said Bitcoin remained ""a highly volatile digital currency"", despite growing investor optimism. "
investors sentiments,Tesla profit surge driven by record car deliveries,2024-09-15,2021-07-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57935264,"Tesla has reported surging profits, despite shortages of semiconductor chips and congestion at ports hampering production. Sales rose to $12bn (£8.6bn) in the three months to the end of June, up from $6bn a year ago, when its US factory was shut down. The electric carmaker said it delivered a record 200,000 cars to customers in the same period. It added that public support for greener cars was greater than ever. The company, led by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, reported on Monday that profits soared off the back of strong sales. Profits for the second three months of the year were $1.1bn, up from $104m last year, bolstered by sales of its cheaper Model 3 sedan and Model Y. In an update to investors on Monday, Tesla said: ""Public sentiment and support for electric vehicles seems to be at a never-before-seen inflection point.  ""We continue to work hard to drive down costs and increase our rate of production to make electric vehicles accessible to as many people as possible."" Tesla added that how quickly it could produce cars throughout the rest of the year would depend on the supply of key parts of its vehicles, with demand at ""record levels"". On a call with financial analysts on Monday, Mr Musk said: ""At this point, I think everyone can agree, electric vehicles are the only way forward."" Mr Musk said during the call that the global chip shortage ""remains quite serious"" and manufacturing would hinge on this ""slowest part of the supply chain"". He also described late-night calls with suppliers in an attempt to resolve shortages. As a result, there were growing waiting times for Tesla cars, especially across Europe, the company said in its results. It will look to start production at its new Berlin ""gigafactory"" as soon as possible. It has been plagued by delays, although the company bills it as ""the most advanced high-volume electric vehicle production plant in the world"". It will ramp up the manufacturing of its cars at its California hub in the meantime. Mr Musk was also reportedly seen visiting Luton earlier this year, sparking rumours he may be considering a Tesla factory in the UK. Other car giants such as Ford and General Motors have been forced to suspend production temporarily in some US factories, having been hit by the global shortage of semiconductors. Profits at Tesla in the second quarter were also dented, however, by other items such as investments in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. It invested heavily in the digital currency previously. But it stopped taking Bitcoin as a form of payment earlier this year because of Mr Musk's concerns about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, which uses huge amounts of electricity. The company reported a $23m loss on its Bitcoin investments on Monday, although its chief executive recently signalled it might accept it again in future. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said that this figure was, however, ""much lower than many had feared"". He added that overall, the set of results marked a ""step in the right direction"" for the company, with ""healthy"" growth also seen in China, where Tesla began manufacturing last year. Mr Ives did point out, however, that a big question for investors would be when the company would be able to hit profitability excluding the income it gets from reselling to other carmakers the credits that it earns for exceeding emissions and fuel standards. Between April and the end of June, it saw $354m in revenues generated through the sale of such credits, down from $428m the same period a year before."
investors sentiments,Bitcoin slump sees trades suspended,2024-09-15,2017-12-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42457983,"Bitcoin plunged on Friday, extending a fall that saw the crypto-currency lose almost a third of its value from a record of nearly $20,000 (£15,000). The crypto-currency's price dipped below $11,000 on Friday, according to the Coindesk exchange website, before recovering to above $13,000. Amid the swings, three Bitcoin-related exchanges suspended certain trades. Bitcoin has had a blistering trip over the past 12 months. Its price at the start of the year was about $1,000.  It has skyrocketed since - more than doubling in value since November -  drawing interest from major firms as well as private investors. But since Sunday Bitcoin has been on a losing streak, falling back to where it was at the start of December. Analysts said investors should be prepared for such rapid changes, which have characterised the asset from its start.  ""This is exactly how this asset trades and has done since the beginning,"" said Nick Colas, co-founder of New York-based DataTrek Research. ""It has a lot of volatility and it will for the foreseeable future."" This week's plunge led to a flood of trades that swamped one of Bitcoin's major exchanges, Coinbase, on Friday. A technical slowdown prompted the firm to halt buying and selling twice. The CME and CBOE exchanges in the US also temporarily suspended trading of certain Bitcoin futures contracts, which allow investors to bet on where they expect the price of Bitcoin to be at certain points in the future.  The exchanges have automatic brakes that apply once a commodity or asset has moved by a certain amount - as happened in this case. The market remains driven by sentiment, according to Charles Hayter, founder and chief executive of industry website Cryptocompare. ""A manic upward swing led by the herd will be followed by a downturn as the emotional sentiment changes,"" he said. Some traders would have been cashing in on the spectacular gains made over the year, he added. Concerns about the infrastructure behind crypto-assets may also be spooking investors, said Nick Colas, himself a Bitcoin trader. In recent weeks, markets have been rattled by hacks and allegations of insider trading. He attributes some of this week's slump to the launch of a new crypto-asset that came earlier than planned. The surprise temporary shutdown of Coinbase on Friday was the kind of thing that could erode investor confidence, he argued. ""It is not OK to just take trading offline randomly through the day,"" he said. ""The robustness of that system is just as important to their confidence... as the price of crypto-currencies themselves."" A spokesman for Coinbase said the firm was working around the clock to ensure smooth trading. Friday's suspensions lasted for about two hours in total. ""We're doing everything within our power,"" the spokesman said.  A digital asset, Bitcoin is not backed by any governments. It is created through a complex process known as ""mining"", and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. There is a steady stream of about 3,600 new Bitcoins a day, with more than 16.5 million now in circulation. Supply is expected to peak at about 21 million.  Every single transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain. This makes it possible to trace the history of Bitcoins to stop people from spending coins they do not own, making copies or undoing transactions. Regulators around the world have stepped up their warnings about its provenance as an investment.  One of this week's most striking comments came from Denmark's central bank governor, who called it a ""deadly"" gamble. Earlier this month, the head of one of the UK's leading financial regulators warned people to be ready to ""lose all their money"" if they invested in Bitcoin. Andrew Bailey, head of the Financial Conduct Authority, told the BBC that neither central banks nor the government stood behind the ""currency"" and therefore it was not a secure investment. Despite the risk to individuals, US authorities have said they do not think it is a big enough part of financial markets to be a threat to broader economic stability."
investors sentiments,Covid sees share of women on India's stock market rise,2024-09-15,2020-11-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-54873285,"More and more Indian women have turned to the stock market during the pandemic to bolster their savings, reports the BBC's Nidhi Rai in Mumbai.  Sakina Gandhi has found a new passion: stock market trading.  The 31-year-old works in public relations and until this year had only invested in mutual funds, generally seen as a safer bet than directly trading in stocks.  But when India went into a stringent lockdown in March to prevent the spread of Covid-19, Ms Gandhi found herself with a lot of time on her hands.  ""I had time to look at the market,"" she says. ""The first 15 days I only tracked the market. I made a list of stocks and analysed what kind of volatility they were showing. After consulting a few colleagues, I bought those stocks."" It proved to be a lucrative option.  Share prices plunged amid fears over the virus and stayed low as the lockdown battered the Indian economy. But they soon picked up as investor sentiment rallied. Trusted stocks braved the storm and some company valuations have since grown substantially. Prices remain at a high, buoyed by falling Covid case numbers and the promise of a vaccine.  This is despite heavy job losses, negative growth and other macro factors that have left the Indian economy reeling.  But that's also why working women such as Ms Gandhi are looking to make some extra money. And she is not alone.  ""There is a definite rise in new women investors,"" says Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of Zerodha, a stockbroking company.  Of the more than 1.5 million clients the firm has added since the outbreak of Covid-19 in India earlier this year, some 235,000 are women. That's about half of their women investors, whose average age is 33 years, Mr Kamath says.  Another stockbroking firm, FYERS Securities, told the BBC it has seen a three-fold rise in active women traders.  This fits with the larger trend in India that appears to have been wrought by the pandemic - a surge in demat accounts, an electronic facility for passing virtual share certificates between investors. Some 6.3 million new demat accounts were opened in India between April and September this year, according to market regulator SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India). This is more than double of last year's tally for the same period (2.7 million).  And many of these investors are young women, says stockbroking firms.  Ritika Shah, 36, comes from a family that has long invested in the stock market but she had never done so - until this year. ""I was waiting for the right time to do it. The pandemic gave me time to plan my finances. I got time to research, study and follow up,"" she said.  Mr Khoday says women are typically more ""inclined to invest than trade"". That is, they buy traditional assets such as gold or park money in safe place such as fixed deposits and, more recently, tax-saving mutual funds.  The lockdown also turned out to be a good time to enter the market. Ms Shah, for instance, says the valuation for the market in March was a deciding factor.  Mr Kamat says fixed deposits, although safe, became less attractive and mutual funds dropped too, encouraging people to start investing directly in stocks. So, he adds, people's attention turned to capital markets because of the ""heavily discounted valuations of fundamentally strong large-capital companies"".  The surge has also been aided by technology and simplified processes.  Cheap data allowed investors to stay hooked to the stock market; and online banking and trading quickened buying and selling. Many broking firms are charging almost no fees, enticing new investors. Firms have also begun educating investors about the stock market and have seen an uptick in visits to their website.  The biggest encouragement came from market regulator SEBI, which eased the process of opening a demat account. It also allowed the e-signatures and digital lockers so paperwork can be processed fast and from within the confines of home during the pandemic.  And those who decided to give it a shot have even begun to enjoy it. Ms Gandhi says she tracks stocks in the newspaper daily and has also set up Google alerts for news of companies that interest her.  ""It's my money"" she says. ""My husband or anyone has no say in it. Therefore I thought why not take some risk and see what happens. It actually turned out to be good."" "
investors sentiments,US markets pick up amid global sell-off,2024-09-15,2018-10-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45957674,"US stock markets have begun to recover from a global sell-off, regaining most of their losses in the final hour of trading. The three major indexes closed between 0.4% and 0.6% lower, having earlier been down over 2% with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both at six-month lows. The recovery comes after sharp falls in European and Asian markets, with London's FTSE 100 on track for its worst monthly performance in a decade. Asian stocks also fell overnight. Analysts said it was hard to pinpoint the global falls on one particular factor. In Europe, they said the sell-off had been exacerbated by fears over the situation in Italy, which has the second-highest national debt in the eurozone. The European Commission has told the country to revise its budget, the first time it has ever made such a request.  Meanwhile, there are also fears over the impact on trade of the current situation in Saudi Arabia, where the Kingdom is facing pressure over the death of prominent Saudi critic journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The country is one of the world's largest oil exporters and investors are concerned about the threat of possible sanctions. ING strategist Benjamin Schroeder blamed ""a concoction of concerns"" for the falls, saying investors' overall sentiment was suffering from trade tensions, fears over Italy and Brexit.  While Charles Schwab analysts said these general fears were ""exacerbating already skittish global sentiment"". Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said the general tone was ""not good"". He said it was ""hard to say"" what was driving the falls, but ""the old adage that the market hates uncertainty holds true"". ""But it's not all geopolitical noise and fears about rates - some notable earnings announcements have also rocked confidence,"" he said, noting that disappointing performances from 3M and Caterpillar had hit the Dow's performance.

investors sentiments,Uncertainty for foreign firms amid China protests,2024-09-15,2022-11-29,By Suranjana Tewari,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63789991,"For foreign companies that operate in China, the unprecedented protests at the weekend could not have come at a worse time. It has been almost three years of intermittent lockdowns, disrupted supply chains and rules that have made the country uninviting to international staff. The last year has been particularly painful - as the rest of the world opened up and learned to live alongside the virus.  ""In my 12 years of being in China, I have never seen the levels of social and economic disruption. The extraordinary civil unrest taking place at the moment is all due to zero-Covid fatigue,"" the British Chamber of Commerce's Managing Director Steven Lynch told the BBC.   ""This is the lowest level of sentiment we've ever experienced, certainly for British businesses."" Protests and political instability are not good for business. But it is the Covid numbers in China that are really rattling investors.  Recent days have seen about 40,000 new cases - record highs for China - and with authorities determined to stamp out infections according to President Xi Jinping's zero-Covid strategy, that could mean more disruption to manufacturing, services and normal consumer behaviour. The European Chamber of Commerce in China, which represents more than 1,700 members across the country, on Tuesday called for a vaccination campaign to be rolled out to the entire population, and to ease current virus control measures.  ""This should be preceded by a comprehensive, nationwide education campaign about Covid-19, based on the latest scientific evidence, in order to alleviate any public anxiety and to illustrate that being fully vaccinated significantly reduces the risk of contracting serious disease,"" it said in a statement. The Chinese government says it is taking some action.  At a press conference on Tuesday, State Council health officials said they would speed up a push to vaccinate the elderly and more vulnerable members of society. They also announced a publicity campaign to combat vaccine hesitancy among the elderly and promote vaccines' ability to protect against severe illness and death. But they insisted any complaints about Covid restrictions stemmed from ""overzealous implementation"" rather than the measures themselves. When asked if the protests would encourage authorities to reconsider the policy, a spokeswoman for the National Health Commission, said policy would be ""fine-tuned"" to control the impact on society and the economy. Many companies still want to keep business in the vast market going - even as strict Covid measures have made international operations harder. ""Many companies are doing very well despite the headwinds. Look at Starbucks, Nike, and Mercedes,"" Frank Lavin, former US under secretary of commerce for international trade said. ""They already have resiliency plans in place. Those who might be more vulnerable are the smaller and medium size companies doing business in China that don't have a resiliency plan. You can't expect the business plan that worked at home will work abroad,"" Mr Lavin added. China's growth into the world's second-largest economy relied heavily on foreign investment and those firms are now keen to reap the reward.  The country is a growing market for cars, clothes, luxury goods and electronics as its citizens become wealthier, and also an enormous manufacturing hub with relatively cheap labour and established supply chains. But some executives are now wondering if their China dreams will ever come to fruition. ""China has not communicated an exit strategy. There's no end in sight, there's no sign of normal life returning,"" Steven Lynch from the British Chamber of Commerce said. Additional reporting by Monica Miller"
investors sentiments,Asia follows global shares slide amid Covid fears,2024-09-15,2021-07-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57885183,"Asian stock markets fell on Tuesday, tracking sharp declines seen in Europe and the US on Monday that were triggered by fears that rising Covid cases will hamper economic recovery. Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 1% to hit its lowest level in six months, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng also lost 1%. On Monday, both the UK's FTSE 100 index and the US Dow Jones Industrial Average had tumbled by more than 2%. But shares in London and the rest of Europe started stronger on Tuesday. The FTSE 100 index rebounded 1%, while other major European indexes saw similar rises. Monday's sharp falls came as investors became increasingly jittery about the rise in the number of Covid cases in some countries, fuelled by the Delta variant. Japanese shares have now fallen for five sessions in a row over concerns about the spread of the variant and that the Tokyo Olympics could worsen the health crisis. ""Investors are concerned that the rapid spread of the Delta variant will derail the trajectory of the global recovery, notably in Asia which still has relatively low vaccination rates and where some widely used vaccines do not appear overly effective against it,"" Jeff Halley, senior market analyst, from Oanda told the BBC. ""I believe we are in for a messy week ahead, with markets being driven around by sentiment and not data, as the international economic calendar is very quiet."" Meanwhile, businesses in the UK have described how they are cutting opening hours, closing shops or may have to reduce production as employees are forced to self-isolate after being alerted by the NHS Covid-19 app. ""Optimism which had been on the horizon just a few weeks ago has again been obscured by dark clouds, especially with the snap decision to enforce a 10-day quarantine for arrivals from France,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, on Monday. ""With some scientists warning that infections could reach 200,000 a day by September, there is now a feeling that the UK could be staring at a fresh autumn lockdown,"" she added. At a media briefing, US President Joe Biden urged Americans to get vaccinated in order to ensure the economy can remain open. Covid infections linked to the Delta variant have been increasing, but concerns among US investors spiked after Los Angeles imposed an indoor mask mandate again over the weekend. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.1% in its worst session of 2021.  Commenting on how markets performed on Monday, President Biden said: ""That's not how I judge economic growth."" His comments came after data published last week showed prices in the US spiked again in June, driven higher by the cost of used cars and food increasing. Mr Biden said that the increase in inflation was expected to be temporary, but he understood that unchecked inflation over the long term would pose a ""real challenge"" to the economy."
investors sentiments,'Dangerous undercurrents' in global economy,2024-09-15,2018-10-10,By Kamal Ahmed,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45803283,"One of the most comprehensive studies of the state of banking and markets since the financial crisis warns that ""dangerous undercurrents"" are a rising threat to the world economy. The International Monetary Fund's Financial Stability Report says that although banks are far safer than they were in 2008 there are new risks. Trade tensions are growing, the IMF says, and inequality has risen. Further moves towards a trade war could ""significantly harm global growth"". Other threats to trade, such as a disorderly Brexit, could also ""adversely affect market sentiment"", the IMF argues. The US-based organisation says that a ""no-deal"" departure from the European Union could lead to fragmentation in European money markets, meaning that finance cannot flow around the system so efficiently. The body urges the Bank of England to be ready to provide more quantitative easing - money printing - if it is required. In a separate report, the IMF said the UK had historically weak public finances with high levels of debt and low levels of assets. Britain sold off many of its assets in the privatisations of the 1980s and 1990s and also did not create a sovereign wealth fund from its oil revenues, which Norway did.  Of leading industrialised countries, only Portugal's ""net worth"" was in a poorer position, the IMF said.  That could mean that Britain will have to raise more taxes in the future because government-owned asset growth will not provide as much support to the economy. The Financial Stability Report is the second time in 24 hours the IMF has published sober warnings about the state of global finance. On Monday, it downgraded world growth forecasts for next year, blaming new trade barriers. Tuesday's report says governments should resist attempts to roll back banking regulations put in place in 2008 to stop a similar financial crisis happening again. President Donald Trump has already pushed through laws repealing banking rules in America for smaller institutions, saying they were holding back bank lending to businesses.  The IMF also warns market investors, who have seen the largest upward bull run in stocks in history. The report says they are in danger of becoming complacent about the chances of an economic shock to the system. One could be the ending of ""easy money"". Central banks are starting to withdraw the stimulus that was put in place at the time of the financial crisis. Interest rates are rising and quantitative easing - money printing - being dialled back. The IMF fears this could lead to sharp falls in markets. The risks of a government funding crisis in Italy, where the country's banks are under pressure, is also highlighted. ""Looking ahead, clouds appear on the horizon,"" the report, published at the body's annual meeting in Bali, Indonesia, says. ""Support for multilateralism has been waning, a dangerous undercurrent that may undermine confidence in policymakers' ability to respond to future crises. ""Nonetheless, despite trade tensions and continued monetary policy normalisation in a few advanced economies, global financial markets have remained buoyant and appear complacent about the risk of a sudden, sharp tightening in financial conditions."" The IMF's warnings will increase fears that the present buoyancy in global growth may not last. The American economy has been performing strongly, encouraging international investors to move capital there and invest in the dollar. To cool inflationary pressure, the American central bank, the Federal Reserve, is raising interest rates, which acts as a further attraction to global capital because returns are higher. That puts pressure on emerging market economies such as Turkey and Argentina, which have large amounts of debt which concerns investors. The IMF says there is a ""risk of contagion"" as investors become increasingly nervous about the strength of emerging markets, with the risk of capital flows towards the US accelerating. The report says that outflows could hit $100bn (£76.4bn) over a year, about 0.6% of emerging market economies' gross national income. That would be ""of a magnitude"" similar to the financial crisis."
investors sentiments,Fed confidence about US economy grows,2024-09-15,2018-02-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43148881,"The US Federal Reserve is preparing for stronger-than-expected economic growth this year, a view that boosts the case for higher interest rates. But some policymakers remain doubtful that the gains will appear in the form of rapid inflation and higher wages. Those members urged their colleagues to be ""patient"" as they weigh future rate rises. The views were revealed in minutes published on Wednesday from the Fed's January meeting. The meeting, the final gathering led by former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, concluded 31 January.  It preceded turmoil in the stock market that has been pinned partly on investor calculations that the Fed might raise interest rates more rapidly than anticipated.  Investors were reacting to data, including wage increases, that suggested inflation might be stronger than in recent years, prompting the Fed to raise rates more quickly. US stocks jumped after the minutes were released, but sank again as the afternoon continued, reflecting continuing uncertainty about the bank's future course.  The Fed has been shifting away from the policies aimed at economic stimulus it enacted during the recession, including ultra-low interest rates.  The bank took no action to raise rates at its January meeting, but markets expect at least three rate rises this year, and predict the Fed will take its next action in March. Investors are also watching carefully to see if new Fed chair Jerome Powell takes a more aggressive stance than Ms Yellen, who was viewed as moving relatively slowly to raise rates. At the January meeting, ""almost all"" Fed members - more than previously - said they expect inflation to hit the bank's 2% target over the medium term, bolstering the case for future rate rises. A number of Federal Reserve members also ""marked up"" forecasts for 2018 growth to reflect stronger economic data since December, according to the minutes. However, the record showed the participants continued to hold a wide range of views about inflation and wage pressures. While some see the possibility of rapid inflation, others see ""little solid evidence"" of inflation or wage pressures, the minutes said.  ""They judged that the committee could afford to be patient"". Ken Matheny, executive director for US economics at Macroeconomic Advisers by IHS Markit, said the discussion was ""consistent"" with predictions of several rate rises in 2018. Mr Matheny, whose firm is predicting four rate rises this year, said he expects inflation will finally hit the Fed's 2% target causing ""dovish sentiments to fade""."

investors sentiments,Tesla profit surge driven by record car deliveries,2024-09-15,2021-07-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57935264,"Tesla has reported surging profits, despite shortages of semiconductor chips and congestion at ports hampering production. Sales rose to $12bn (£8.6bn) in the three months to the end of June, up from $6bn a year ago, when its US factory was shut down. The electric carmaker said it delivered a record 200,000 cars to customers in the same period. It added that public support for greener cars was greater than ever. The company, led by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, reported on Monday that profits soared off the back of strong sales. Profits for the second three months of the year were $1.1bn, up from $104m last year, bolstered by sales of its cheaper Model 3 sedan and Model Y. In an update to investors on Monday, Tesla said: ""Public sentiment and support for electric vehicles seems to be at a never-before-seen inflection point.  ""We continue to work hard to drive down costs and increase our rate of production to make electric vehicles accessible to as many people as possible."" Tesla added that how quickly it could produce cars throughout the rest of the year would depend on the supply of key parts of its vehicles, with demand at ""record levels"". On a call with financial analysts on Monday, Mr Musk said: ""At this point, I think everyone can agree, electric vehicles are the only way forward."" Mr Musk said during the call that the global chip shortage ""remains quite serious"" and manufacturing would hinge on this ""slowest part of the supply chain"". He also described late-night calls with suppliers in an attempt to resolve shortages. As a result, there were growing waiting times for Tesla cars, especially across Europe, the company said in its results. It will look to start production at its new Berlin ""gigafactory"" as soon as possible. It has been plagued by delays, although the company bills it as ""the most advanced high-volume electric vehicle production plant in the world"". It will ramp up the manufacturing of its cars at its California hub in the meantime. Mr Musk was also reportedly seen visiting Luton earlier this year, sparking rumours he may be considering a Tesla factory in the UK. Other car giants such as Ford and General Motors have been forced to suspend production temporarily in some US factories, having been hit by the global shortage of semiconductors. Profits at Tesla in the second quarter were also dented, however, by other items such as investments in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. It invested heavily in the digital currency previously. But it stopped taking Bitcoin as a form of payment earlier this year because of Mr Musk's concerns about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, which uses huge amounts of electricity. The company reported a $23m loss on its Bitcoin investments on Monday, although its chief executive recently signalled it might accept it again in future. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said that this figure was, however, ""much lower than many had feared"". He added that overall, the set of results marked a ""step in the right direction"" for the company, with ""healthy"" growth also seen in China, where Tesla began manufacturing last year. Mr Ives did point out, however, that a big question for investors would be when the company would be able to hit profitability excluding the income it gets from reselling to other carmakers the credits that it earns for exceeding emissions and fuel standards. Between April and the end of June, it saw $354m in revenues generated through the sale of such credits, down from $428m the same period a year before."

The falls came after the release of weak US economic data and a World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling paving the way for $7.5bn (£6.1bn) in US tariffs on EU goods.  Analysts said these factors had sparked fears over the strength of the global economy. ""There seems to be some cracks forming in some parts of the US economy and also in investor confidence,"" CMC Market analyst Margaret Yan said.  She said a combination of factors - including soft US jobs and manufacturing reports - added to existing investor worries ""in light of deepened fears of a global recession and mounting trade risks"".   Those risks include a fresh front in global trade hostilities, between the US and Europe.  America has been given the green light by the WTO to hit a range of EU goods - from aircraft to cheese and olives - with new tariffs.  The move marks the latest chapter in a long-running battle between the US and the EU over illegal subsidies for planemakers Airbus and rival Boeing. The tariffs are separate to US President Donald Trump's ongoing trade disputes with countries around the world. The stock market falls in Asia follow a weak performance on US and European indexes on Wednesday.  The blue-chip UK FTSE 100 suffered its worst day since January 2016. In Europe, Germany's main index, the Dax, closed 2.8% lower, while France's Cac 40 lost more than 3%. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended trading down 1.9%, marking the second day in a row it has dropped more than 1%. The S&P 500 fell 1.8% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq gave up 1.6%. The losses came after one of the most closely-watched US manufacturing figures, the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) index of factory activity, dropped to its lowest level since June 2009. Fresh figures on Wednesday showing a slowdown in jobs growth in the private sector in September accelerated concerns over the US economy. ""With sentiment so fragile, the one-two punch from the WTO and [US jobs data] was enough to cremate European stock markets,"" said Jeffrey Halley, OANDA senior market analyst. "
investors sentiments,Bank deputy calls for urgent crypto regulation,2024-09-15,2021-10-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58906109,"Cryptocurrencies need regulation as a ""matter of urgency"", according to Bank of England deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe. Crypto technologies do not pose a risk to financial stability at the moment, he said. But there are ""very good reasons"" to think that this might not be the case for much longer, Sir Jon said in a speech. A future cryptocurrency collapse could spread through markets, he warned. A severe fall in the value of crypto-assets - for example, to zero - could force investors who have taken on debt with brokers to have to find cash to pay them. ""Similarly, there is the possibility of contagion,"" he said. ""A large fall in crypto valuations could affect investor risk sentiment more broadly, causing investors to sell other assets that are judged to be risky and those perceived to have a similar investor base."" ""Interconnectedness creates the possibility that shocks are transmitted through the financial system,"" he added. In the past year, crypto-assets have grown around 200% in value from just under $800bn (£580bn) to $2.3tn (£1.7tn). While this is relatively small in the context of the $250tn global financial system, the 2008 financial crisis was triggered by the sub-prime sector which was valued then at $1.2tn, Sir John said. Most crypto-assets, such as Bitcoin, are not backed up in the real world by assets or commodities. They are essentially strings of computer code, and make up 95% of the $2.3tn. As a result, they are volatile, he said. Connections between cryptocurrencies and the traditional financial system are also growing as big investors, hedge funds and banks become more involved, Sir Jon said. ""Bringing the crypto world effectively within the regulatory perimeter will help ensure that the potentially very large benefits of the application of this technology to finance can flourish in a sustainable way,"" he added."
investors sentiments,The mounting cost of Brexit,2024-09-15,2019-09-20,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-49774561,"The price being paid for Brexit is already eye-watering. The latest wheeze is to spend up to £140m telling us to be prepared. For what? Stocking up on olive oil? Buying a German or French car while you can still afford one? The UK government's advertising campaign doesn't say. The message seems to be more relevant to businesses. Well, three points about that: That's just part of the government cost of preparations. Far more significant for the economy is the cost in lost potential. We've got an update today from the Scottish government's chief economist, Gary Gillespie, reckoning that the latter is getting substantially higher.  His team has updated an analysis carried out at the start of last year, looking at the impact on business investment of uncertainty around Brexit.   The findings suggest that continuing uncertainty is adding a further half billion pound shortfall in the business investment than could otherwise be expected. The reckoning early last year was that the impact of a Brexit shock was a drop of £1.3bn in business investment in the quarter we're now in, gradually reducing as trading conditions become clearer. But that reduction in the Brexit shock-induced shortfall is nothing like as clear as it should have been by now. The half billion pound shortfall, added in the latest re-working of the numbers, takes the reduced business investment close to £1.4bn next quarter and the one after that, reducing to £1.2bn in the second quarter of 2020, and still £500m down in the first quarter of 2021. What does that mean? Well, it doesn't seem to be such a problem with foreign investors. Funds from them have been flowing into real estate, thanks to the weakness of sterling making assets look cheap. More significant for the economy is that less is being spent on the supply chain of capital goods. There's a consequent loss of capital stock, down 1% already, and pushing towards 2% by the end of next financial year.  Through that, there is a shortfall in the productivity improvements that new investment ought to bring. And to remind you: productivity - output per hour worked - may not be everything, but if we're to get better off, it's nearly everything. Dr Gillespie is among those to be relaxed about the prospect of the next quarter of gross domestic product figures meaning we're in recession. The contraction in total economic output of 0.3% for the April to June quarter, announced on Wednesday, was slightly sharper than the UK as a whole (0.2%).  But it seemed to follow a similar pattern - stockpiling in the first quarter of the year, in preparation for Theresa May's March deadline, pre-postponement, then unwinding the stockpile in Q2.  The distillers and pharma firms that were biggest into stockpiling in Q1 seemed to be the fastest to cut production in Q2. The indications for the UK economy suggest things have picked up in Q3. That's possibly because stockpiling is under way again, in anticipation of 31 October (this, in case you were wondering, is no way to run a business or an economy). There's another observation from Dr Gillespie's State of the Economy report that points to the real cost of Brexit. If you earn in sterling, you're worse off when you go abroad on holiday, and when you buy imports - not just that German or French car, but a lot of your food and consumer goods, while your fuel is priced in US dollars. Against the euro, we're 15% worse off. Against the US dollar, it's 17%. Now, that should be good news in boosting exports.  British firms, and their workers, benefit from being more competitive when they sell overseas. That's one of the simpler concepts in Higher Economics. Yet it isn't working that way. The International Monetary Fund has looked at this, and found that a weakening of a currency has only a modest impact on boosting exports. A country's trade balance sees more of an impact from fewer imports. That's what we're now seeing in Scotland, according to Dr Gillespie: export growth, already weak, has barely changed, while the rate of growth of imports fell around the time of the 2016 EU referendum, to below that of exports. There's a way of measuring the impact of currency depreciation, by comparing the outcome with what might have been otherwise. Scottish government economists conclude that the trade deficit would have been about £4.4bn by the start of this year, whereas it appears to have been nearer £2.3bn. Almost all of that is explained by lower imports rather than higher exports. Consumer sentiment, meanwhile, remains under water, which is where it took the plunge at the time of the Brexit referendum and where it has remained since. This relatively new indicator of Scottish economic activity tells us that Scots are particularly negative about the prospects for the Scottish economy. Comparing the upbeat with the downbeat, the pessimists have it by a 19 point margin. But ask people about the security of their own household finances, and the optimists come out ahead, by four percentage points. Businesses tend to say something similar: they are more positive about their own prospects than about those of the economy generally. But even the positivity about a company's own prospects reached a zero balance in the most recent business survey. Brexit is not the only cloud on the horizon. Tariff skirmishes, trade hostilities and slowdown in growth across Europe and the USA are also causing concern and slowing up investment. But with Brexit, the UK - Scotland included - is paying a particularly high economic price for its political choices."
investors sentiments,Europe markets calm after Asia and US sink,2024-09-15,2018-10-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45971791,"European share markets have steadied after big falls in Asian stocks that followed a bruising trading session on Wall Street.  Tokyo stocks slumped more than 3%, while losses pushed the US Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 into negative territory for the year. European markets followed suit at first, but had risen by lunchtime, with London's FTSE 100 up 0.17%. Concerns over corporate profits and slowing growth have rattled investors. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2.4% to 24,583.4 points, while the S&P 500 plunged 3.1% to 2,656.1 points on Wednesday.  The technology-focused Nasdaq dropped more than 4.4% to 7,108.4 points - its worst day since 2011 - amid concerns about weak corporate profits and global trade tensions. It was the worst day since 2011 for the index, which is now 10% lower than its September peak and in ""correction"" territory.  Even technology firms, which have driven much of the market gains this year, did not escape the sell-off, with Amazon falling 5.9%, Facebook down 5.4%, Google owner Alphabet off 4.8% and Netflix sinking 9.4%. Stephen Innes, Asia-Pacific head of trading at Oanda, said in a research note the tech sector had previously been seen as ""impervious to weaker global growth sentiment, but escalating US-China trade tension remains that sectors undoing"".  Wednesday's losses marked a sixth straight day of declines on the S&P and followed turbulence earlier in October. The Dow is now on track for its worst month since May 2010. Investors were also spooked by figures on Wednesday showing new home sales fell last month to their slowest pace in nearly two years.  They underlined other reports suggesting the US housing market is weakening - a worry given the sector is seen as a bellwether of economic health by many. Investors have also grown nervous as growth in China slows and companies report increased costs due to labour shortages and tariffs. Those forecasts hit companies such as Caterpillar, down 5.6%, and 3M, off 4.2%. The falls compounded declines on Tuesday in the wake of disappointing results. Nate Thooft at Manulife Mutual Funds said: ""Costs are increasing and it's often tariff-related. We also reached a potential peak for earnings - companies that show marginal weakness take a beating."" Adding to the sense of unease were a series of crude mail bombs and suspicious packages sent to prominent Democrats and critics of President Donald Trump, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, less than a fortnight before the midterm elections.   Jack Ablin at Cresset Wealth Advisors said the selling appeared to be ""emotionally"" driven, adding: ""Perhaps it's just a ratcheting up of chaos."" The losses on major European indexes were less severe. The pan-European STOXX 600 fell as much as 1% before paring losses slightly to trade down 0.7%"
investors sentiments,The new weapon against climate change,2024-09-15,2021-12-08,Jessica Bateman,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211207-the-legal-battle-against-climate-change,"Activists are increasingly suing governments and companies to take action against climate change – and winning. Could this be a turning point? David Schiepek, a student from the southern German state of Bavaria, has been involved in climate activism for around three years. ""After all this time fighting, protesting and talking to politicians, I was losing hope a bit,"" the 20-year-old says. ""I feel like my future is being taken away."" But in May this year, an unexpected event gave him a fresh sense of optimism. A lawsuit brought by a number of environmental NGOs, on behalf of a group of young activists, resulted in Germany's constitutional court ruling that the country's climate protection act must be amended to include more ambitious CO2 emissions reductions. The decision stated that the government's failure to protect the climate for future generations was unconstitutional. ""I saw that, finally, politicians can be put under pressure and forced to take measures against climate change,"" Schiepek says. ""It really changed the way I see politics."" Now he is hoping to build on this ruling, which applies only to the federal government. He has been recruited by an NGO, along with other young people from around Germany, to bring similar cases against their local state governments. Technically, he is suing his state to take action on climate change. The last few years have seen a snowballing of court rulings in favour of environmentalists around the world. The cumulative number of climate change-related cases has more than doubled since 2015, according to a report authored by Kaya Axelsson of Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute and colleagues. Just over 800 cases were filed between 1986 and 2014, while over 1,000 cases have been brought in the last six years, researchers Joana Setzer and Catherine Higham of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment found. Thirty-seven of those cases were ""systemic mitigation"" cases brought against governments. One of the most high-profile was a Dutch case in 2015, in which a court ruled that The Netherlands' government has a duty of care when it comes to protecting its citizens from climate change. The judges decided the government's plan to cut emissions by 14-17% compared with 1990 levels by 2020 were unlawful given the threat of climate change. They ordered the target be increased to 25%. As a result, the Dutch government closed a power plant four years earlier than planned and introduced a new climate plan in 2019. Elsewhere cases have led to similar rulings – including the recent German one that inspired Schiepek, as well as cases in countries such as Australia. The rising number of cases is paving the way for stricter enforcement of environmental laws around the world and giving activists like Schiepek a new sense of hope. Roda Verheyen, one of the best-known environmental lawyers in Germany, and one of those who represented citizens in Germany's constitutional court case this year, says she believes there are three reasons for the increase in successful cases. ""One is that courts take a long time to actually come to conclusions,"" she says. An increasing number of cases have been filed since 2014, so some are only now being heard after many years of work. On top of this, the scientific evidence that climate change is caused by humans has become undeniable, meaning it is much easier for lawyers to prove this in court. And the governing laws that countries are expected to follow have also developed and expanded – Verheyen points out that back when she first started studying law around three decades ago, there was nothing remotely related to climate. ""And then obviously the narrative of what society perceives climate change to be has changed,"" she explains. ""A lot of law is flexible to some degree, because you always have to interpret existing rules. And when [judges] do that, they take into account societal norms and how belief systems might have changed."" She compares this development to marijuana-related offences – as attitudes towards the drug have become more liberal in many countries, sentences have become much lighter. In the context of climate change, the public now overwhelmingly accepts the scientific consensus that it is man-made, and polls regularly put it towards the top of peoples’ concerns. This has in turn made courts more willing to rule against those responsible for emissions. Verheyen explains that this year's German ruling is significant because many countries do not have a constitutional court that can make this type of decision. Secondly, it is unlimited, so applies from now until forever, and she expects it to have a big impact on other cases around Europe. As well as cases against governments, cases against corporations have also been gathering pace. One landmark ruling of 2021 was again in The Netherlands, where oil giant Royal Dutch Shell was ordered to cut its emissions by 45% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. Shell has said it will appeal the ruling, while stepping up efforts to reach net zero emissions by 2050. A Royal Dutch Shell spokesperson says the company is ""rising to meet the challenge of the Dutch court's ruling"" and has committed to reducing its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030, compared with 2016 levels – these are Shell's direct emissions from owned or controlled sources, and its indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling. ""Our 2022 business plan will reflect this new target, which we are committed to delivering regardless of whether we win or lose our appeal against the ruling,"" the Shell spokesperson says. These reductions don't include the emissions from burning Shell's fossil fuel products, which come under the category of Scope 3 emissions. The Dutch ruling stated that the company also needed to reduce its Scope 3 emissions, but the Shell spokesperson says that these findings hold Shell accountable for a wider global issue. Paul Benson, a lawyer at Brussels-based NGO Client Earth, which specialises in environmental litigation, says this case ""sought to apply the same reasoning [from the ruling against the Dutch government] to a corporate body. That was very novel, and I think a lot of commentators and people in our fairly enclosed legal circle weren't entirely sure what way the court would interpret [that]."" ""I was thrilled for a court to find that a company's climate policy is in effect inadequate,"" he continues, calling the judgment ""ground-breaking"". The case was also the first time that a company was ordered to comply with the Paris climate agreement: ""[It] shows the Paris agreement has teeth – not just against governments, but against companies."" This has paved the way for other lawsuits seeking to force corporations to comply with the treaty – Verheyen is currently working on a lawsuit against German carmakers BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen which, if successful, would force them to phase out combustion engines by 2030 in line with the Paris goals. ""As you would expect, actors in this space and lawyers in our community have been studying the [Shell] judgement very carefully, and sought local reasoning to apply [it] in their jurisdiction,"" adds Benson. ""The complaint has not yet been served on us,"" says a spokesperson for Daimler, which makes Mercedes-Benz vehicles. ""We do not see a basis for a cease-and-desist declaration, because we have long since issued a clear declaration for our 'lane change' to climate neutrality: As a car manufacturer, it is our ambition to become fully electric by the end of the decade wherever market conditions allow."" A BMW spokesperson says: ""The BMW Group is firmly committed to the Paris climate agreement and already leads the automotive industry in the fight against climate change."" Meanwhile a Volkswagen spokesperson says that Volkswagen was the first car manufacturer to commit to all targets set by the Paris climate agreement ""and is committed to become net carbon neutral at the latest by 2050"", aiming to invest €35bn [£30bn/$40bn] in electric mobility before 2025. Benson and one of his colleagues, Sebastian Bechtel, both stress that the cases taking place now only challenge a fraction of environmental destruction that is happening around the world. Many activists do not have the financial resources to take on big corporations. ""A lot of countries do not want to bring these claims,"" Bechtel says. ""In the UK, those relate primarily to costs. In other countries, it's simply not possible to go to court to enforce specific laws."" Back in Germany, a newly launched NGO, Green Legal Impact, is seeking to address this issue by offering specialised training to young lawyers and connecting civil society groups to those offering legal representation. Managing director Henrike Lindemann says that as a young environmental activist she ""always saw that young people had political ideas. And then there were lawyers, often old white men, who told us our ideas were not possible because of the law,"" she says. ""And I thought, I want to know for myself if this is true. And if it is, I want to know how to change it."" Lindemann says that one of the aims of the organisation is to encourage activist groups to be strategic in the court cases they pursue, so that any judgments can pave the way for further litigation. She gives the example of a number of current cases challenging the planned 850km (530 miles) of motorway due to be built in Germany, which she argues has not been looked at through the lens of climate. ""I think if the court [ruled against one part of motorway], the discussion would change,"" she says. ""It would not just be about that one section of motorway, it would be the entire plan. And then we would have to change the whole discussion around mobility."" Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. The question of access to justice also brings about the issue of whether those in the Global South, who are disproportionately impacted by climate change, could in future bring cases against corporations or governments in wealthier nations. Green Legal Impact is already working on helping people in other countries who have been impacted by German companies' actions seek justice, and a recent UK ruling stated that communities can sue parent companies for environmental damage caused by their subsidiaries. Verheyen says it would be difficult to find courts to support cases against foreign governments, ""unless at some point one very severely hit country decides to go state-versus-state, which has been a topic of conversation in academic and political circles for a long time, but hasn't happened."" Environmentalists are feeling optimistic after this year's judgments. But given how slowly courts move, do they feel this may all be too little, too late? ""Obviously I don't think it's too late, otherwise I would stop what I'm doing,"" replies Verheyen. ""I think we're actually seeing a lot of movement."" Benson agrees. ""I think there's a tendency sometimes for people to think about climate in a fatalist way,"" he adds. ""But everything we do now to mitigate and adapt is hugely worthwhile."" In terms of which potentially ground-breaking cases we might see in future, Verheyen suggests that both the finance sector ""and anything to do with land use and forests"" are areas where she is expecting more action to arise. ""If you look closely at the Shell judgement, it says, no further fossil fuel investment, full stop,"" she explains. ""If I was a financial institution, I would be looking very closely at that one."" But overall, lawyers working in this field are keen to point out that litigation isn't a silver bullet for ending the climate crisis. ""It's just one of the levers that can be pulled to trigger necessary change,"" says Benson. ""The other levers are activism, policy and, of course, science. But [litigation] is an incredibly powerful tool, and I think this year we've seen that."" -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

investors sentiments,What makes a 'cool' office?,2024-09-15,2017-05-29,Jonathan Glancey,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20170526-your-office-doesnt-need-a-slide-to-be-cool,"Does a workspace really need 'fun' fixtures to inspire creativity? We asked BBC Culture's architecture and design critic Jonathan Glancey for his take on the modern office. “We don’t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing,” George Bernard Shaw once said. Perhaps Benjamin Franklin, too. In fact, any number of people have expressed the same sentiment over generations. Lately, it’s an idea that some companies have taken to the extreme. In the world of contemporary office design – or, at least at those companies embracing technology, innovation and creativity, such as start-ups, tech and advertising companies, this maxim appears to be laid down in corporate culture and expressed through wacky interiors featuring zany furniture. But is there any merit to it? One popular item of youthful office furniture is the Swing Table by Duffy of London. According to Duffy’s online brochure, it brings the “playground into the boardroom”. A photograph of smiling, laughing young people are shown swinging at a fun meeting under that quote from Shaw and Franklin. Duffy is just one of a growing number of design firms worldwide helping to re-shape offices as creative playpens. If this is a design movement, it began – and has thrived – in California and Washington state, where computing, casual office attire and childhood sensibilities have become corporate signifiers of innovation and cashed-up cool. But do self-consciously playful offices really make employees creative? Facebook product designer Tanner Christensen’s book The Creativity Challenge suggests you should “act like you’re three again!” because young children tend to have unbridled imaginations. Such creativity, however, is in the child’s own mind. Today’s tech company playpens are designed to make young people feel creative in deterministic settings. A truly creative team can work in a shed or garage without toys, loud graphics and free food. Garages, of course, are where the digital tech revolution began. Playpen offices may well be more about controlling a workforce, and keeping them in the office for long hours, than allowing it to be free. Although we may soon tire of them, playpen offices are meant to be young, hip, motivational and fun, if not exactly funny. But for all their nursery colours, big graphics, beach huts, hammocks, bowling alleys, punch-bags, ‘Ideas Incubators’, ‘Thought Tepees’, pods, slogans on walls boasting ‘Awareness Happens Here’, slides and jelly-bean machines, California’s tech companies can barely hold a candle to Pittsburgh’s outlandish Inventionland. Moved to its new office in 2006 by founder George M Davison, here inventors work inside a giant robot, a speedway, a pirate ship or the Old Lady’s shoe, as in the nursery rhyme, while Davison oversees the show from his Treehouse overlooking the waterfalls of the Creation Cavern and turrets of Inventalot Castle. Commercially, these are successful companies, so perhaps there is no arguing with the idea that offices taking employees back to their childhoods are good for business. But, the playpen office is not for everyone. Some workers prefer to think creatively in adult work surroundings. So, what if you’re the type to shy away from the tyranny of a forced-fun workplace, so reminiscent of American summer camps and children’s parties? Or, if you are someone who likes the cool, seductive glamour of Mid-Century Modern offices portrayed in the American TV series Mad Men? It would be a fascinating exercise to offer a nominally creative team space in a conventional office for three months, followed by three months in a playpen workspace. Would the team be more creative with fun things to look at and potty games to play? While it would be wrong to prejudge the result, history suggests that creativity thrives whenever and wherever people inspire one another, and no matter what their surroundings, while some of the greatest inventions and works of art are by people quite content to work alone in the equivalent of a garage or garden shed. Concorde, the world’s most adventurous airliner, was dreamed up and created in a mix of rather dreary looking offices and matter-of-fact industrial workshops. Maya Angelou, the American writer, civil rights activist and author of the critically acclaimed coming-of-age autobiography I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, liked to check in to hotel rooms early in the morning. Staff were instructed to remove all stimuli from the walls. Angelou’s creativity was focused in her mind’s eye. Creative people, in other words, can and have worked at their best in the architectural or design equivalent of a vacuum or blank canvas. Perhaps playpen offices say more about those who commission them than they do about the nature of creativity itself. Luckily, there are, and always have been, alternative yet self-consciously designed work spaces conducive to creativity. Look, for example, at Foster and Partners’ head office in Battersea overlooking the Thames in southwest London. Opened in 1990, it evokes  the same kind of purposeful creativity as the fecund drawing offices of the great railway and aerospace engineering offices that have shaped beautiful and successful locomotives and aircraft. Norman Foster’s firm has grown, through industry and creativity into Britain’s premier architectural practice. His architects, most of them young and drawn from around the world, have needed no slides or beanbags to think and act creatively. Significantly, Foster and Partners, working with Apple’s design team led by Jony Ive, have designed Apple’s Campus 2, a seamless ring of hi-tech offices as sleekly cool as an iPhone for 13,000 staff at Cupertino, California due to open this autumn. As cool as a cucumber, with every last detail custom-designed, the Apple building will be a perfectionist’s dream. No dangling wires. No hot tubs. No slides. A buiding as smooth as the fuselage on an airliner with interiors reflecting the look and feel if iMacs and iPhones. And, yet, the building opens up to nature through vast windows and through the 85-ft high sliding windows of its four-storey cafeteria. Clearly, Apple’s belief is that this perfection will inspire its workforce to strive for greater perfection in future. There is, though, room for creative artistry in offices that are neither coolly perfectionist nor self-consciously childlike. Look at the exquisite St Jerome in His Study (c1470), a painting by the early Italian Renaissance artist Antonello da Messina. Here, the 4th Century scholar works in a timber pod set within a dreamlike chamber complete with lion, peacock, partridge and cat for company. Through the upper Gothic windows, swallows soar – with creative thought – into a pure blue sky. The Catalonian architect, Ricardo Bofill, recreated a sense of St Jerome’s workspace in the offices of his firm, RBTA. Designed and built in the 1970s from abandoned concrete silos on the edge of Barcelona, it is a cinematic, special office for creative people without a hint of a Hula Hoop or Spacehopper. Although dramatic, its walls are lined with books and paintings reflecting not just the design fads of the moment, but also a wealth of inventive culture dating back centuries. Architecture, of course, is one of the very oldest professions, its design references going back much further than 21st Century tech companies determined to be hip, new and of the moment. The moment, however, passes as architects like Ricardo Bofill know well. Shortly before the Second World War, the great American architect Frank Lloyd Wright shaped a revolutionary headquarters for the Johnson Wax company in Racine, Wisconsin. An architectural wonder, the “Great Room” at its heart is a stylised forest of 30ft, palm-like columns woven around at ceiling level with miles of Perspex glass tubing. The result is a subtly lit office, both adult in style and highly imaginative. While it might be dramatic on first encounter, this space is a calm and relaxed one in which to work, and creativity thrives as much in calmness as with laughter, music and play. Back in California, San Francisco’s GitHub, a software development platform, is trying to have its cake and eat it. While its office features crazy wallpaper, classic motorbikes and retro bar, its principal meeting room is modelled on the White House’s Oval Office. While politics is a supposedly adult game, it is often played by people who are neither as grown up nor as creative as they might purport to be, whether or not their office – like those of tech companies – boast crazy graphics, hammocks, and those infantilising, and all-but-statutory fun! fun! fun! slides.

investors sentiments,Why citizenship is now a commodity,2024-09-15,2017-05-30,Katie Beck,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20170530-why-citizenship-is-now-a-commodity,"As more people are willing to move countries for opportunity and stability, anti-immigration policies and tightened borders are prompting a rise in ‘citizenship for sale’. On a recent flight, I was idly flipping through the inflight magazine, when I came across an unusual advert promising “a unique strategy to safeguard your future prosperity and security.” The advert was plugging what it called “citizenship by investment.” I’d heard of citizenship-for-sale initiatives in the past, and – prompted by the ad – I briefly wondered whether a second citizenship beyond my American one was something I might need. Is this something that people other than the uber rich are considering, and for reasons other than tax optimisation? And if so, why? “The global rise of populist movements, together with an ever-increasing sentiment towards the creation of insular societies have all contributed to the unpredictability of our rapidly changing world,” explained the advert. As more countries tighten their borders and paths to immigration, a new industry is working to bypass those restrictions – for a hefty fee. A desire to stay global Investment citizenship programmes are not new. They’ve been around for decades, primarily as a way for countries to boost their incomes. Canada and the Caribbean island of St Kitts and Nevis started theirs in the 1980s and the US and UK began similar ones in the 1990s. The specifics of different investment citizenship programmes vary by country. They allow foreigners to invest in real-estate projects and businesses, buy property, or to donate money directly to a country’s government in exchange for a visa or passport. St. Kitts and Nevis launched its initiative in 1984, one year after the fledgling country claimed independence from the UK. The aim was to get more money flowing in from entrepreneurs who saw value in tropical beaches and low taxes. It only attracted a few hundred participants in the beginning. But, by 2009, backed by a marketing campaign, passport holders of the island nation were given visa-free access to the 26 Schengen area countries and demand increased rapidly. The industry has seen huge growth in recent years. 2014 marked the first year that the US ran out of immigrant-investor visas before the end of the fiscal year. London-based CS Global Partners, the consultancy firm that made the inflight-magazine advert I read, shepherds investors through the legal process of procuring a passport through investment. The firm says interest in their services has grown fourfold in the past year. “We are definitely seeing big shifts,” says CEO Micha Emmett. “The traditional market still exists – very much so – but we’ve seen [people from] countries that were never interested in second citizenship by investment options before now coming online making inquiries. For example, we saw a 400% increase in enquiries from Turkey in March.” Events including the decision by Britain to leave the European Union and the 2016 US Presidential election are driving new interest. UK citizens are now seriously weighing their options, Emmett says. “In terms of what happened in the UK with Brexit, on the day that the vote was announced, our phones rang off the hook, I was approached in the street by people, there was a very apparent panic,” she adds. A changing clientele  Wealthy, private investors from emerging market economies are driving the trend, according to The International Monetary Fund. Data from the controversial EB-5 visa programme in the US, which allows foreigners to invest in real-estate projects in exchange for a fast-tracked green card application, shows the demographics are shifting, according to Peter Joseph, executive director of Invest In USA, an industry trade organisation for the programme. “We are seeing a few countries adding to a diversifying trend. China is the predominate source [of applicants], making up about 80%, but places like Vietnam, India and Brazil have been sources of growth in the past few years,” he says. Paul Williams of La Vida Golden Visas, which specialises in second residency and citizenship within Europe, works with clients from over 50 countries. Since Britain voted for Brexit, he says, he has seen an interest from UK citizens for the first time. Citizenship: a hot commodity The most well-known programmes are in the Caribbean, where white sand beaches, low investment minimums, non-restrictive residency requirements and quick processing times combine to attract investors. For example, to become a citizen of the Caribbean island of Dominica, which sits between Guadeloupe and Martinique, you’ll need an investment of $100,000, with no requirement to spend any time on the island and no wait-time. And, such programmes are important economic drivers. In St. Kitts and Nevis, passports are the country’s largest export and the money generated from the programme is seen as responsible for lifting the nation out of debt and fuelling a construction boom. The IMF says Citizenship by investment programmes amounted to 14% of St Kitt’s GDP in 2014, and other estimates say the programme may have accounted for as much as 30% of the government’s revenue in 2015. But increasingly, richer countries are offering 'citizenship for a price'. Comparable programmes in New Zealand cost NZ$1.5m ($1.06m) – a popular move among Silicon Valley’s tech elite recently – or £2m ($2.58m) for the UK and $500,000 for the US. Joseph says the EB-5 programme is hugely valuable for the country, delivering over $1 billion dollars to the US economy each quarter. “We’ve seen exponential growth since the financial crisis in 2008 to the tune of an increase of over 1,200% from 2008 until today,” he says. Increased interest in the US programme is due in part to the relatively stable economy and safe investment environment, but also thanks to the low investment minimum. The EB-5 programme requires the $500,000 to be invested areas lacking jobs and cash, but critics argue the low minimum is a loophole being exploited by developers. Although the US caps the total number of visas granted each year through the programme to 10,000, the number of applicants has no limit. Interest, it seems, doesn’t either. “There are currently over 23,000 investor petitions for a visa number.” Joseph says, “That’s just how many that are pending right now.” At last count, 23 countries from Cyprus to Singapore offered some kind of investment residency or citizenship scheme and more are being created with similar programmes proliferating across Europe. Almost half of all EU member states now offer some form of investment residency or citizenship programmes. Mobility is key For as little as $50,000 (in Latvia) or as much as $10 million (in France), foreigners can buy legal status to live, work and bank in a number of countries. Perhaps more importantly, by extension, they buy access to visa-free travel to countries around the world. And, there’s an informal rating system for the most sought after passports. “Some people in the industry determine [the value] by the number of visa-free countries a person can travel to. So I think at the moment the data out there is that on the German passport you can travel to more countries than with any other citizenship in the world.” Emmett says. In a globalised world where political isolationism is paradoxically on the rise, this freedom of movement is an attractive element of such schemes. Andrew Henderson, an American entrepreneur and founder of the Nomad Capitalist, a blog, podcast and consulting company, has four passports and is working on his fifth. Multiple citizenships provide him with a multitude of entrepreneurial options, he says. He says investing in programmes in the African archipelago of Comoros and the Caribbean Island of St. Lucia give him more opportunities and lower taxes. “For me it’s about how I could have better options, better tax treatment, better treatment as a person and get the same visa free travel.” he says, adding that he expects investment citizenship to rise. “I think the world is going more nomadic.  People don’t want to be in once place. They want to have one or two or three bases for lifestyle reasons and pay reasonable taxes, and that’s what becoming more accessible. While not everyone with multiple citizenships will reside in multiple nations, Williams says the industry can be viewed as a barometer of turmoil in the world.  He says many of the investors he works with see these programmes as a safety net. “Most of our clients do not go and live in the country they invest in,” he says. “They see it as more of an insurance policy. They know that they’ve got that second residency, so if they ever have to jump on a plane they’ve got that option.” Your country for sale Such programmes aren’t without controversy. Afterall, should citizenship be for sale? Detractors say no. Earlier this year in the US, two senators, Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Grassley, introduced a bill to get rid of the EB-5 programme, arguing that it is too flawed to continue. “It is wrong to have a special pathway to citizenship for the wealthy while millions wait in line for visas,"" Feinstein said. Detractors also argue these programmes unfairly favour the rich and are unattainable for everyone else. They also cite concerns about money laundering, criminal activity and backdoor access to countries that circumvent normal immigration systems. Indeed, the intersection of large sums of money and international real estate deals is ripe for fraud. Just this month an FBI Investigation uncovered a $50 million visa fraud operation involving Chinese investors in the EB-5 programme. And in April, the Securities and Exchange Commission brought charges against a man in Idaho who they say spent Chinese investor’s money on new homes, cars and a zip line for himself rather than the real estate projects it was meant for. The St. Kitts and Nevis programme ran into trouble with the US Treasury Department when suspected Iranian operatives were caught using their St. Kitts passports to launder money for banks in Tehran in violation of US Sanctions. Controversy surrounding the US EB-5 programme reached the upper echelons of the White House as the Kushner family’s real estate company was accused of conflicts of interest for using Presidential son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner’s name in a pitch to lure Chinese investments in a New Jersey property development. And the programme’s reputation for shady deals is not going away. But in a world where borders are closing, demand for these services will most likely continue to grow, experts say. Paul William’s advice for UK Citizenswho are anxious about Brexit? Hold tight. ‘Things are uncertain, but they can’t do anything about it now since they are still European residents,” he says. “In two years time, if the UK does end up with the same access to the EU as America, say, then a lot of people will be wanting to do something.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
investors sentiments,How to avoid awkward handshakes,2024-09-15,2020-01-21,William Park,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200120-how-not-to-shake-someones-hand,"We can know when a handshake feels wrong, but it can be hard to put a finger on exactly why. If it lingers too long, is too firm or pulls us too close it can define the rest of an encounter. Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron walked side by side, their hands clasped together. They remained in each other’s vice-like grip, tugging, patting and fawning at each other for 29 seconds as the world’s media looked on. Occurring during a parade for French National Day – the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille, a turning point in the French revolution – it could have been a moment of solidarity between the leaders of two great nations. Instead it turned into one of the most awkward, lingering handshakes in recent memory. Without being able to hear what they discussed as they pressed themselves close to each other, their body language became a surrogate for sentiment. A good greeting in this situation might have involved lots of eye contact and positive body positioning. “The best way to approach is to create equality,” says Sanda Dolcos, a psychologist at the University of Illinois. “What is important is to have an open approaching attitude, not to show dominance,” adds Florin Dolcos, her colleague at the University of Illinois. “One way is to reach out with your hand palm up.” But the handshake between Macron and Trump seems to break every rule that we know to be normal. While barely a fraction of the World Record for longest handshake – set at 43 hours, if you are interested – the interaction between the two presidents was excruciating and those watching could feel every second of it. You might also like: • The hidden ways your language betrays your character  • The ten personality traits that do not exist in English  • The benefits of not being perfect It starts fairly innocuously. Macron takes Trump’s hand, begins to pat him on the back and the two start walking. After five seconds, Trump pats Macron’s right hand as if to say “That’s enough”. Macron misses the cue, intentionally or otherwise, and at eight seconds, Trump halts dead in his tracks. If Macron is not playing his game, Trump needs to change the game. “Usually in the moment you realise whether the person is in discomfort and it is normal to retract after a few seconds,” says Sanda. But neither retracts. The two face each other and transition to what Florin calls a “brotherly” handshake; Macron has his left hand on Trump’s right arm. Trump wiggles his hand from side to side – but still no release. Trump goes to greet and kiss Brigitte Macron while still shaking his counterpart’s hand. The three now all hold hands in a strange three-way embrace which lasts a few more seconds before the whole interaction fizzles out. “The handshake sets the tone of the conversation. He was really aware of the fact that everyone was analysing his behaviour,” says Florin. “It was not something that came naturally.” But what was this strange greeting saying exactly? And what effect does breaking handshaking conventions have on subsequent meetings? Scientists like the Dolcos are interested in answering these questions because they are useful for researching interviews, deals, investments, retail habits and more. Handshakes are a sign of agreement, mutual respect or a simple hello. But they can also come loaded with meaning and aggression. Keep it firm When it comes to handshakes, firm is best. Firm handshakes have been linked positively to extraversion and emotional expressiveness and negatively to shyness and neuroticism. They have also been associated with openness to new experiences in women. Equally, limp, wet handshakes are almost universally disliked. A firm handshakes in a job interview can increase your employability, especially among women. This is true even after controlling for differences in physical attractiveness (which universally increases your chances of being employed) and the clothing of the candidates. Macron and Trump have a bit of history when it comes to intense, firm handshakes – in some cases, even leaving marks on one another. Whether there is such a thing as a too-firm handshake is unclear. “If your hand is like a dead fish, no firmness, it shows lack of interest. Or if you shake until you break it will tell me bad things about you,” says Florin. Don’t let it linger A handshake not only conveys your level of extraversion, expressiveness and employability to an interviewer, but also helps you learn about the person you are meeting too. A good handshake has the potential to put interview candidates at ease. Likewise, a bad one can set them up for an awkward encounter. The abnormal length of the handshake between Macron and Trump might show that they are very familiar with one another, but between strangers it can lead to an uncomfortable conversation afterwards. In one study, interviewees were filmed and had their body language analysed after experiencing abnormally long handshakes that left interviewees “frozen”. In the subsequent interview, they displayed anxious behaviours and were less likely to laugh or show signs that they were enjoying themselves. Add a caring touch In another context, and between different people, the touch that Macron makes on the arm of Trump could have surprising effects. Touching a hand on the back of someone’s arm can provoke them into making risky decisions, suggests Jennifer Argo, a professor in marketing at the Alberta School of Business, but only when the person greeting the potential risk-taker is a woman. Participants in her study were business school students who were asked to make financial investments. They were greeted on arrival by either a woman or man who proffered a hand with or without a “guiding touch” on the back of the arm, or by no hand at all. Investors who were greeted by the woman and guided into the room made the riskiest decisions of all. “The feeling of a gentle touch on the shoulder suggests security – it is reminiscent of someone caring for you,” says Argo. “When you are more secure you take more risks, different kinds of risks and invest more.” The researchers’ suggestion is that this kind of caring touch is associated with our mothers in childhood, and that explains why the same effect is not seen when the greeter is a man. The idea that a motherly embrace could provoke us into making riskier financial decisions is interesting, if hard to believe. Might it just be that the physical contact from the woman is being misinterpreted as sexual attraction by the investors, leading to risk-taking behaviour? A famous study from the 1970s highlighted the possibility of “misattribution of arousal” – where one mood is incorrectly interpreted as attraction. In this study, fear and anxiety were misinterpreted as sexual attraction. Men were asked to cross one of two bridges. The first, a sturdy bridge, the second a suspension bridge that swayed threateningly when someone walked across it. At the end of the bridge, an attractive male or female interviewer asked the men to complete a questionnaire and offered them their name and phone number, under the premise of answering any queries they might later have about the experiment. The men who crossed the swaying suspension bridge and were greeted by an attractive female interviewer were more likely than any other group to take up the offer of giving her a call. The researchers attributed this to the raised blood pressure and heart rates of the anxious men being misinterpreted as signs of arousal. Might a similar thing be happening with the investors? Argo says not. The risk-taking effect was seen equally in both male and female investors when greeted by the woman and with neither when the greeter was a man. “The female experimenter was also not super attractive – she was an average person,” adds Argo. “We didn’t use incredibly attractive people.” Argo suggests this might have meaningful effects in other areas outside of investments, like retail, where a guiding touch by a retail assistant might lead you towards an expensive product. Maintain a safe distance Trump and Macron are almost chest-to-chest towards the end of their shake. In most countries around the world, it is normal even for very close friends to keep at least 30cm between themselves during a social encounter. But this prolonged embrace is particularly unusual for an American like Trump, where the norm is closer to 50cm. This is assuming the two men consider each other to be close friends. Acquaintances in the US are more likely to keep 69cm between themselves, and strangers 95cm. This study did not look at data from France, but their neighbours in Spain and Germany report similar figures to their American counterparts. Saudi Arabia ranks as the most standoffish, where it is normal to keep over 95cm away from a close friend; and Argentina is one of the most familiar countries, where only 70cm separates strangers. The purpose of getting up close to a counterpart might be to elicit further information that we are only aware of subconsciously, in the form of scents. We constantly sniff our own hands, but after a handshake we do it even more so – specifically with the right hand, the one we use for greetings. In one study, by covertly monitoring hand-to-face touching after a handshake, and even fitting some participants with nasal catheters to monitor airflow, researchers proved that handshakers were actively sniffing their hands rather than just raising them to their face. Next, they had some subjects wear sterilised gloves while shaking hands and then analysed the chemicals left on the gloves to find out what the handshakers were sniffing. Two of the chemicals found included squalene and hexadecanoic acid, which are known to play a role in social signalling in dogs. ""Handshaking is already known to convey a range of information, depending on the duration of the gesture, its strength and the posture used,"" says Noam Sobel, a neurobiologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, who led the study. ""We argue that it may have evolved to serve as one of a number of ways to sample social chemicals from each other, and that it still serves this purpose in a meaningful, albeit subliminal, way."" Add a fake laugh Macron and Trump grin furiously as they continue to embrace. Clearly, they are aware of the assembled media, so to what extent these smiles are authentic is debatable. It is possible to decipher when a smile is inauthentic because traces of muscle movements associated with faces expressing disgust, fear or sadness can be seen through the happy “mask”. These subtle cues might be incredibly small, but we are still able to pick up on them. The two leaders might have been better off bursting into laughter, because fake laughs are almost as good as a real ones. Laughter helps us to strengthen social bonds and fake laughter is enough to make us more likeable (although real laughter is always more effective). For an added bonus, we are more willing to disclose personal information after sharing laughter with an acquaintance. So, a fit of fake laughter might have helped the two to open up. Meanwhile, Trump does one of the most unusual parts of the whole act. While still shaking Emmanuel Macron’s hand, he greets Brigitte in a way that is completely to be expected for two Western business people of the opposite sex. Westerners tend to default into gender-specific roles when it comes to greetings. In business, the expectation is always for men to shake hands, but when men greet women and women greet each other, cheek kissing is more often the norm. So, while the overly-familiar embrace with Macron continues, Trump is simultaneous able to kiss Brigitte in a normal way. The normal number of kisses varies between countries and even between regions within countries. Whereas for non-Western businesspeople, while handshaking is increasingly common as Westernisms become incorporated into business culture, kissing between men, or bows and no physical contact might be the norm. The oddness of Macron and Trump’s handshake is perhaps a lesson in how not to greet someone. For two politicians who spend their careers meeting people, it is possible that they are so aware of the customs and conventions that they intentionally flaunt them to communicate to their audience. But who knows if they understand the full meaning of their subtle interactions.

investors sentiments,US jobless rate falls to lowest level since July,2024-09-15,2023-12-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67662809,"Jobs growth in the US was stronger than expected last month, in part boosted as striking workers in Hollywood and the car industry returned to work. Employers added 199,000 jobs in November, the Labor Department said.  That helped to push down the jobless rate to 3.7% - the lowest level since July. The monthly report is being closely watched as the US central bank tries to cool the economy to reduce inflation, the rate at which prices rise.  The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to the highest level in more than two decades in an attempt to slow price rises, and investors are increasingly betting that rates have peaked for now and may even start to fall next year. But the latest figures, while welcome news for jobseekers, may confound those hopes.  As well as stronger-than-expected job gains, the report showed average hourly pay ticking up 0.4% from October.  Average hourly earnings have climbed 4% from November 2022 - a rate that analysts said was too fast for the Fed to declare its job is done. The strength of the US economy over the past year has defied expectations and persistently glum economic sentiment.  In the most recent quarter, it expanded at an annual rate of 5.2% - well above the trend in pre-pandemic years.  A strong labour market has helped sustain consumer spending - the main driver of the US economy - though some retailers have warned of weakening sales in recent weeks.  Last month's job gains were driven by hiring at health care and manufacturing firms, as well as the government. Payrolls at retail, warehousing and transportation firms fell, despite heading into the holiday season.  Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics said the drop could be a sign that ""retailers are already nervous"", but might also reflect quirks from the Labor Department's efforts to adjust for seasonal trends.  Overall, the US has added an average of 240,000 jobs per month over the past year, the Labor Department said.  ""While job growth is falling compared to last year, it is holding up remarkably well in the face of a tough economic picture and slowing growth globally,"" said Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot. When the Fed started raising interest rates, many analysts warned it could trigger an economic recession, if higher borrowing costs prompted firms and households to slow spending dramatically.  That forecast has been increasingly abandoned.  Mr Carter said: ""The full effects of the rate hikes have not yet been felt, so the picture could deteriorate from here, but for now the economic picture is looking strong in the US and that will leave the Fed heading into next year feeling just fine about the job it has done to date."""
investors sentiments,Five cautionary tales of leadership in 2023,2024-09-15,2023-12-22,Alex Christian,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231218-five-cautionary-tales-of-business-leadership-in-2023,"Corporate missteps have been on full display during a tumultuous, unprecedented year in business and work. It hasn't been a smooth year in the corporate world for top brass. In an uncharted post-pandemic workplace, uncertain economy and environment of rapidly-shifting shareholder and employee priorities, business leaders have had to take high-stakes decisions without precedent. ""We've seen some leaders struggle to move forward with their business models in a new age of higher interest rates and greater employee demands,"" says Christopher Kayes, professor of management at the George Washington University School of Business, in Washington, DC. ""Many are operating from the same playbook of the pre-pandemic era – when workers were more compliant and had less leverage.  Although there have been plenty of successes, many CEOs stumbled ­– in several cases, they've left their posts or been asked to step down by their boards in record numbers as a result. Among them, five missteps stood out as cautionary tales of modern management. Inflexible policies at Grindr Leaders and workers have been struggling over return-to-office policies for years; in 2023, many bosses chose to assert their power. While many employers and employees found middle ground on hybrid arrangements, in August, CEO of dating app Grindr George Arison announced a sudden, inflexible return-to-office ultimatum for workers: come into the office twice a week, or take severance in October. While this policy worked for some people who already lived close to Grindr's ""hub"" cities of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington DC, it also meant scores of workers hired remotely would need to scramble to relocate – or lose their jobs. Kayes says Grindr's leadership failed to acknowledge the profound change its mandate would have on its workforce. ""There's been a long-held, mistaken belief that being the boss simply means issuing edicts or demands, and that people will follow. That's certainly no longer the case: when you make a big policy change that affects employees' lives, you need to consult them first. Grindr failed to do that."" Larry Robertson, a Sydney-based leadership coach and author, agrees Grindr's leaders failed in their duty to communicate their rationale with employees. A lack of notice alongside a hard deadline also rushed employees into making major life choices on the backfoot. The result was that nearly half of all Grindr employees rejected the mandate – and the app faced a media backlash. ""The reality is if you haven't got your employees on-side, then you don't have a thriving business,"" says Robertson. ""With such a huge loss of talent and a tarnished public image, it's hard to see how it can be the same organisation moving forward."" Customer alienation at Reddit As the rocky economy drove companies to worry about profits, many businesses looked for alternative revenue sources to shore up balance sheets.  In April, as it prepared for IPO, Reddit said it would begin charging for access to its application programming interface (API), the framework that enables third-party apps to be built around first-party data. API access is critical for users to both participate in and moderate content on the community's subreddits. In a June post on Reddit, CEO Steve Huffman also announced the social media platform would enforce data-rate limits in July, leaving third-party app developers scrambling to implement changes to keep their software working with Reddit's first-party framework.  ""Reddit needs to be a self-sustaining business, and to do that, we can no longer subsidise commercial entities that require large-scale data use,"" wrote Huffman. While this may have been a good idea for long-term profitability, it came at the cost of the consumer relationship. Popular apps subsequently closed, the Reddit community protested and subreddit moderators enforced blackouts.  Kayes says that while Huffman's decision made financial sense, it alienated some of its dedicated userbase, perhaps permanently. ""Free platforms like Reddit have to make bold business moves if they want to generate funds and appeal to investors. But they should still include the customer's voice in how they move forward – the problem here came in the implementation, and how it was communicated."" Robertson believes Huffman's explanation should have gone further. ""If you're making a major change to a customer offering, especially one that's very popular, you need to communicate how it'll benefit them in the longer term. So, it's not just defending yourself in making a bottom-line decision, it's explaining to the customer how they can receive an even better service in the future."" Underestimating worker solidarity at GM In 2023, collective organising was at its highest level since 2019, resulting in a slew of high-profile strikes. In October, Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, became the first of the ""Big Three"" automakers to negotiate an agreement with United Auto Workers (UAW), six weeks into their sweeping strike. By that time, however, the company had already experienced losses of more than $1bn (£795m). Striking the deal – widely seen as a huge win for workers ­– helped stop GM from haemorrhaging revenue, as employees went back to work. Despite the fact workers and management were able to end the labour stoppage, Robertson says Barra's initial failure to appreciate the demands and power of the union resulted in major revenue loss as the strike dragged on. This was compounded by the fact Barra had been at the company her entire career. ""Often at big corporations, CEOs are hired hands, paid large salaries to move between companies. But Barra actually grew up with the company – she should have understood the sense of loyalty, belonging and community among auto workers,"" he says. Instead, Robertson believes Barra misread the determination of the UAW.  ""They were underestimated: in reality, workers have more power now than in the past. A CEO in a major corporation that is unionised should be able to bring their leadership on-side early, listen to them and understand what fundamentally drives them. It's possible to find common ground, that you're all working together for the benefit of the organisation, helping to build relationships – rather than be adversarial.""  Dramatic cost-cutting at Warner Bros Discovery Sometimes CEOs are brought in to shake up a corporate status quo. When David Zaslav oversaw the 2022 merger of Warner Bros and his smaller cable company, Discovery, his tactics rattled many industry insiders. Tasked with turning a profit amid more than $55bn (£43.8bn) in debt, Zaslav began issuing studio-wide cuts, including cancellations of films that had already been made, and mass layoffs that lasted throughout 2023. In June, he announced Warner Bros Discovery would eliminate Turner Classic Movies, a channel hugely popular among cinephiles. The community was so shaken that legendary Hollywood filmmakers Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese and Paul Thomas Anderson held a summit meeting with Zaslav.  Kayes suggests Zaslav's business plan was naïve: to succeed, he would have to make cuts in an industry famed for superstar talent, blockbuster productions and emotionally engaged consumers and workforce. ""That approach may work in the cable industry where there may be less star power and influence, but Hollywood is very different,"" he says. ""Here, it appeared as though he was taking on everyone.""  Low public sentiment on Zaslav's leadership also may have helped galvanise the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and Screen Actors Guild (Sag) strikes that shut down the industry for much of the year, says Kayes. ""In the end, Zaslav was even taking on movie directors, some of the most powerful, influential and popular people in the world. In turn, he was cast as the Hollywood villain."" A hostile takeover at X Since its deal-closing in November 2022, Elon Musk's Twitter takeover has been the subject of many questionable business decisions. Throughout 2023, the billionaire founder of Tesla and SpaceX rebranded the social media platform to ""X"", laid off around 80% of staff and lost an estimated $75m (£69.7m) in advertising revenue after he endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory in late November. Robertson believes Musk's unconventional leadership has failed in a company that already had an established following and singular work culture. ""At SpaceX and Tesla, companies he founded, he could build from the ground up and grow a community of loyal followers as he took on space and eclectic vehicles,"" he says. ""But Twitter was an organisation that had its own ethos, with workers used to a very different style of leadership."" Kayes describes Musk's decision making as ""erratic"". This includes recently attacking brands that had paused advertising on X, and stripping headlines from news article links posted on the platform. ""People may not mind seeing unconventional behaviour from leaders when it makes them stand out as unique and visionary,"" says Kayes. ""But once it veers into unpredictable and emotional territory, completely untied to conventional business norms, it becomes unsettling."" He adds X still has many problems to solve going into 2024. ""There remains ambiguity over who its leaders actually are – its new CEO [Linda Yaccarino] was announced in June, yet it's Musk that still seems to be pulling the levers and making public statements. That's led to broader concerns, declining monthly active users and advertising revenues falling by more than half."" Taking lessons into 2024 As the business world evolves, so has the role of the leader. Once expected to merely serve the bottom line, executives now face greater demands from all types of stakeholders, while economic conditions and workplace culture both continue to change. ""It's harder to be a leader now,"" says John Clifton, CEO of global analytics and advice firm Gallup, based in Washington, DC. ""This period emerging from the pandemic has been harder in some ways than 2020 itself – from inflation spiralling out of control, issues around hybrid working and a workforce that feels lonelier than ever. It's an incredibly challenging time for executives, undoubtedly."" The corporate failings of 2023 may provide some guidance, though – even if it's simply what not to do. ""Leaders serve the organisation – and that includes employees,"" says Robertson. ""The world has changed so much, but many leadership tactics haven't. So much of it comes down to communication, listening and having purposeful conversations so people feel included, respected and heard. Otherwise, that's when resentment builds and trust breaks down."""
investors sentiments,Asia stocks drop as slowdown fears hit investors,2024-09-15,2019-10-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49915919,"Asia markets joined a global sell-off as fresh worries about trade and the world economy rattled investors. Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed down 2% and Australia's ASX 200 lost 2.2%.  It followed sharp falls in US and European markets on Wednesday, with the UK's FTSE 100 index sinking 3.2%. The falls came after the release of weak US economic data and a World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling paving the way for $7.5bn (£6.1bn) in US tariffs on EU goods.  Analysts said these factors had sparked fears over the strength of the global economy. ""There seems to be some cracks forming in some parts of the US economy and also in investor confidence,"" CMC Market analyst Margaret Yan said.  She said a combination of factors - including soft US jobs and manufacturing reports - added to existing investor worries ""in light of deepened fears of a global recession and mounting trade risks"".   Those risks include a fresh front in global trade hostilities, between the US and Europe.  America has been given the green light by the WTO to hit a range of EU goods - from aircraft to cheese and olives - with new tariffs.  The move marks the latest chapter in a long-running battle between the US and the EU over illegal subsidies for planemakers Airbus and rival Boeing. The tariffs are separate to US President Donald Trump's ongoing trade disputes with countries around the world. The stock market falls in Asia follow a weak performance on US and European indexes on Wednesday.  The blue-chip UK FTSE 100 suffered its worst day since January 2016. In Europe, Germany's main index, the Dax, closed 2.8% lower, while France's Cac 40 lost more than 3%. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended trading down 1.9%, marking the second day in a row it has dropped more than 1%. The S&P 500 fell 1.8% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq gave up 1.6%. The losses came after one of the most closely-watched US manufacturing figures, the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) index of factory activity, dropped to its lowest level since June 2009. Fresh figures on Wednesday showing a slowdown in jobs growth in the private sector in September accelerated concerns over the US economy. ""With sentiment so fragile, the one-two punch from the WTO and [US jobs data] was enough to cremate European stock markets,"" said Jeffrey Halley, OANDA senior market analyst. "
investors sentiments,Why businesses are pulling billions from China,2024-09-15,2023-11-14,By Annabelle Liang,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67353177,"Foreign businesses have been pulling money out of China at a faster rate than they have been putting it in, official data shows.  The country's slowing economy, low interest rates and a geopolitical tussle with the US have sparked doubt about its economic potential.  All eyes will be on a crucial meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden this week.  But businesses appear to be already erring on the side of caution. ""Anxieties around geopolitical risk, domestic policy uncertainty and slower growth are pushing companies to think about alternative markets,"" says Nick Marro from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).   China recorded a deficit of $11.8bn (£9.6bn) in foreign investment in the three months to the end of September - the first time since records began in 1998.  This suggests that foreign companies are not reinvesting their profits in China, rather they are moving the money out of the country.  ""China is currently facing slower growth and needs to make some corrections,"" says a spokesperson for the Swiss industrial machinery manufacturer Oerlikon, which pulled 250m francs ($277m; £227m) from China last year. ""In 2022, we were one of the first companies to transparently communicate that we expect the economic slowdown in China to impact our business,"" the spokesperson adds. ""Consequently, we began early to implement actions and measures to mitigate these effects."" China remains a key market for the firm. It has close to 2,000 employees across the country, which accounts for more than a third of its sales. Oerlikon noted that the Chinese economy was still expected to post growth of around 5% in the next few years, ""which is among the highest in the world."" Since the onset of the pandemic, businesses like Oerlikon have contended with the challenges of operating in what is the world's biggest market. China had implemented one of the world's strictest pandemic lockdowns through its ""zero-Covid"" policy. This caused disruptions to the supply chains of many companies, such as technology giant Apple, which makes most of its iPhones in China. The firm has since diversified its supply chain by  moving some production to India. Mr Marro believes more companies have heeded calls for diversification this year, as tensions between China and the US rose with fresh export restrictions on raw materials and technology needed to make advanced chips. ""We aren't seeing many companies pulling out of China. Many of the big multinational firms have been in the market for decades, and they're not willing to give up market share that they've spent 20, 30 or 40 years cultivating. But in terms of new investment, in particular, we are seeing a reassessment."" Businesses are also considering the impact of interest rates. China bucked the trend as many countries around the world raised rates sharply last year. Many major central banks, including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have been hiking interest rates to tackle inflation. The higher cost of borrowing, which promises higher returns, also attracts foreign capital.  Meanwhile policymakers in China have cut the cost of borrowing to support its economy and struggling property industry. The yuan has depreciated by more than 5% against the dollar and euro this year. Rather than reinvesting China earnings back in the country, business are spending the money, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China says.  It adds: ""Those with excess cash and earnings in China have been increasingly transferring these funds overseas, where they will earn a higher investment return compared to investments in China."" Some firms had withdrawn earnings from China as ""part of their long-term cycles"" of taking profits ""once their projects reach a specific scale and profitability"", Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, observed.  ""The withdrawal of profits does not necessarily indicate that companies are unhappy with China, but rather that their investments here have matured."" Mr Hart says it's ""encouraging because it means companies are able to integrate their China operations into their global operations."" Canada-based aerospace electronics company Firan Technology Group invested up to C$10m ($7.2m; £5.9m) in China over the last decade, and withdrew C$2.2m from the country last year and in the first quarter of 2023. ""We are not exiting China at all. We are investing and growing our business there and taking out any excess cash to invest elsewhere in the world,"" says the firm's president and chief executive Brad Bourne. ""We had surplus cash in China and bringing it back to help fund our recent US acquisitions was just prudent cash management, and it meant that our borrowing was reduced,"" he adds. Analysts say there is much uncertainty about what lies ahead - both in terms of interest rates and China-US ties. China's central bank could move to lower interest rates further this year to support its economy, says Dan Wang, the chief economist of Hang Seng Bank China. Lowering interest rates could put more pressure on the already weakened yuan. ""There is very limited room for monetary easing right now because of the pressure of currency depreciation,"" she says. ""If economic sentiment improves next month, it's safe to say that China will lower interest rates. But if sentiment doesn't improve, the central bank will have a very difficult decision to make."" Businesses are cautiously optimistic about the upcoming meeting between Presidents Xi and Biden, says the EIU's Mr Marro. ""Direct meetings between the two presidents tend to exert a stabilising force on bilateral ties. We have also seen a flurry of US-China diplomatic engagement over the past couple of months, which has contributed to this feeling that both sides are aiming to put a floor under the relationship,"" he says.  ""That said, it doesn't take much for things to fall apart again. Until companies and investors feel like they can navigate with more certainty, this drag on foreign investment into China will continue."""
investors sentiments,Evergrande chairman put under police surveillance,2024-09-15,2023-09-28,By Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66932548,"Evergrande's chairman Hui Ka Yan has been put under police surveillance as the problems for the Chinese property giant mount. Evergrande said its shares would remain suspended until further notice. It marks another low for the heavily indebted property giant which defaulted in 2021, triggering China's current real estate market crisis. In August, it filed for bankruptcy in the US in a bid to protect its American assets as it worked on a deal. In a statement on Thursday, Evergrande said Mr Hui ""has been subject to mandatory measures in accordance with the law due to suspicion of illegal crimes"", without giving any further detail. The latest share suspension comes just a month after the firm's previous 17-month suspension was lifted. Evergrande - once the world's most valuable property developer - is at the centre of a real estate crisis threatening the world's second largest economy. With more than $300bn (£247bn) of debt, the firm has been scrambling to raise cash by selling assets and shares to repay suppliers and creditors. Most of Evergrande's debt is owed to people within China, many of whom are ordinary citizens whose homes have not been finished. When the firm defaulted on its huge debts in 2021, it sent shockwaves through global financial markets as the property sector contributes to roughly a quarter of China's economy. Several other of the country's major developers have defaulted over the past year and many are struggling to find the money to complete developments. Hui Ka Yan, also known as Xu Jiayin, was born into a poor family in China's central Henan province in 1958, during Mao Zedong's economic and social campaign, the Great Leap Forward. Despite his upbringing, after setting up Evergrande in 1996, he became a poster child for China's super-rich. He earned the nickname ""Belt Brother"" in 2012 by wearing a gold-buckled belt from the French luxury label Hermès to China's annual legislative conference. In 2017, he became China's richest person with his fortune rising to $42.5bn (£34bn). But his wealth has plummeted since then, largely as Evergrande's problems have grown, and he has kept a low profile in recent years. There are several reasons why Evergrande's problems are serious. Firstly, many people bought property from Evergrande even before building work began. They have paid deposits and could potentially lose that money if it goes bust. There are also the companies that do business with Evergrande. Firms including construction and design firms and materials suppliers are at risk of incurring major losses, which could force them into bankruptcy. The third is the potential impact on China's financial system: If Evergrande defaults, banks and other lenders may be forced to lend less. This could lead to what is known as a credit crunch, when companies struggle to borrow money at affordable rates. A credit crunch would be very bad news for the world's second largest economy, because companies that can't borrow find it difficult to grow, and in some cases are unable to continue operating. This may also unnerve foreign investors, who could see China as a less attractive place to put their money. In July, Evergrande revealed it had lost a combined 581.9bn yuan ($79.6bn; £65.6bn) over the past two years. It has been working on a new repayment plan and the company seemed to have been moving closer to resolving the problem after it filed for US bankruptcy protection. Its latest plan was to reissue its overseas debt as new bonds that it had to pay back in about 10 years' time, as well as offering their creditors stakes in the company as shares. But earlier this week, Evergrande revealed its mainland unit Hengda Real Estate had defaulted on 4bn yuan of debt. Chinese business wire Caixin also reported that several current and former executives has been detained. Trading in its two other units - property services and electric vehicles - was also suspended on Thursday. ""China's property-sector stress will continue to pose cross-sector credit risks in the near term,"" wrote Lan Wang and Duncan Innes-Ker of Fitch Ratings.  ""The government's modest policy easing to date is unlikely to drive a sharp turnaround in homebuyers' sentiment, even though it has led to some recent improvements in broader economic indicators,"" their report said."
investors sentiments,Evergrande shares jump as debt deadline looms,2024-09-15,2021-09-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58660578,"Shares in Evergrande have jumped in Hong Kong after the troubled property giant struck an agreement with Chinese bond holders on Wednesday. The announcement helped to calm some investor concerns over debts of more than $300bn (£220bn). But the world's most indebted developer is also due to make a $83.5m interest payment on an overseas bond on Thursday. The Hong Kong market was closed on Wednesday when the deal was announced. After a volatile day of trading, Evergrande shares closed more than 17% higher. The firm's shares have lost more than 80% of their value on the Hong Kong stock market so far this year as it struggles to raise money to meet its obligations. The company had moved to placate investors, saying in a statement on Wednesday that it would pay interest payments for its domestic bonds.  The amount due for the domestic bond is estimated to be $35.9m (£26.3m). However, the statement did not reveal how much interest would be paid or when any payment would be made, saying only that the bond ""has already been resolved through private negotiations"". The filing also did not mention the separate foreign bond. Under agreements with investors, the company has a 30-day grace period before a missed payment on the offshore bond would become a default. Some analysts have cautioned that the failure of such a large and heavily-indebted property developer could have a major impact on the Chinese economy, which could potentially spread to the global financial system. And while Wednesday's deal was seen by some investors as a positive development, others remain wary. ""It's too soon to say whether this is just a brief respite or it signifies that a rescue plan is in the works,"" Donald Low, Director of the Institute for Emerging Market Studies at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology said. Investment experts are looking for clarity over what the Chinese government may do to resolve the firm's debt crisis. ""Until there is certainty regarding how the government will deal with Evergrande, investors are likely to remain jittery,"" Catherine Yeung, Investment Director, Fidelity International told the BBC. Ms Yeung also pointed that Beijing' business crackdown - which has seen it increasingly tightening its grip on big businesses, including tech giant Alibaba and ride-sharing app Didi Chuxing- may add to uncertainty.  ""Investors can usually deal with different standalone issues but the regulatory changes we have seen so far this year, coupled with the fast evolving Evergrande situation, has seen investor sentiment weaken,"" she said.

investors sentiments,Zuckerberg wins on Wall Street after Washington hit,2024-09-15,2024-02-01,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68175778,"Mark Zuckerberg's Meta had a bad day in Washington this week. But on Wall Street, it took a victory lap.   The social media firm updated investors with a slew of good news: quarterly profits that tripled year-on-year to more than $14bn (£11bn), a surge in users, lower costs and higher ad sales. Even its much ridiculed, money-losing virtual reality unit hit a milestone, generating $1bn in revenue. Lest anyone doubt its confidence, the company declared a first-ever dividend. That is a payout to shareholders - in this case of 50 cents per share.  The company, owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, also pledged to keep the money flowing, saying it was in a strong financial position, and could invest in the business while still making plans for such payments on a quarterly basis ""going forward"". Shares in the company, already at record highs, surged more than 12% in after-hours trade.  Analysts said the decision to offer a dividend was a sign of maturity, as Facebook approaches its 20th birthday.  It confirmed the shift in investor sentiment from 2022, when shares in the company had swooned and a high-profile investor wrote a public letter to Mr Zuckerberg that the company had ""drifted into the land of excess — too many people, too many ideas, too little urgency"" and ""needed to get its ""mojo back"" Elsewhere in big tech, business was also good.  Amazon sales leaped 14% year-on-year during the September-to-December period. It beat analysts' expectations for its earnings after seeing strong growth in festive online shopping underpinned by stable growth in its cloud computing business. The results sent Amazon shares up more than 8% in after-hours trade. At Apple, revenue returned to growth for the first time in a year and its earnings also beat expectations thanks to growing sales of iPhones, However, its shares slipped 3% in after-hours trade after it forecast a drop in iPhone sales as it faces tough competition in China. Meta's performance was the most head-spinning, coming just a day after it faced blistering critique in Washington, where senators told Mr Zuckerberg that his product was ""killing people"" and he was pushed to apologise to families of victims of child sexual exploitation.  Speaking to analysts on Thursday, Meta acknowledged that it was facing regulatory challenges that could ""significantly"" affect its business.  But it spent little time on the topic.  And for now, whatever the product may be doing, there is little doubt that people, and advertisers, are sticking with it.  Meta said nearly 3.2 billion people were active on one of its platforms daily in December, up 8% year-on-year. Revenue in the September-December period grew 25% year-on-year to more than $40bn. Meanwhile the cost cutting drive that Mr Zuckerberg launched last year, which included thousands of job reductions, helped push expenses down 8%. Head count was 22% lower. Jasmine Engberg, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, said the company had exceeded expectations, as its investment in using AI to enhance advertising paid off.  ""It was a stellar Q4,"" she said. """"Meta's 2023 earnings are cause for more celebration as Facebook's 20th anniversary nears."""
investors sentiments,Big US jobs rise in January surprises again,2024-09-15,2024-02-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68183421,"Job creation in the US surged in January, as the economy continued to defy predictions of a slowdown. Employers added 353,000 jobs and average hourly pay jumped, while the unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%, the Labor Department said.  The report extended a streak of job gains that has surprised economists, who have expected a jump in interest rates since 2022 to slow the economy. Analysts said the job market strength made an early rate cut less likely.  ""The US employment data provided a shock, beating expectations by miles, with earnings much higher than expected as well,"" said Neil Birrell from Premier Miton Investors. ""These numbers show the US economy to be strong and will sway anyone thinking a March rate cut was on the way to look further out. Any thoughts of recession are off the mark as well for now."" The US central bank started raising rates two years ago, responding to price inflation that was rising at the fastest pace in decades.  Higher borrowing costs aimed to cool economic activity and ease pressures pushing up prices.  Price inflation has come down from the high rates seen in 2022, and stood at 3.4% in December.  But strong household spending, initially buoyed by pandemic-era savings, has kept businesses humming, generating a kind of virtuous cycle, as the healthy jobs market in turn sustains consumer spending.  Friday's report showed hiring in December and November were stronger than had been previously estimated. Health care and retail firms, as well as business and professional services, helped drive the job gains in January.  Overall, the US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.3% in the September to December period. The head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, this week said officials were hopeful that inflation would continue to fall without a more serious downturn. But he warned the bank wanted ""greater confidence"" before it declared victory and started to lower borrowing costs again. He said a rate reduction in March, as some investors had been betting, was unlikely.  Some analysts said the strong pay gains reported on Friday - with average hourly earnings up 4.5% compared with January 2023 - should worry those hoping to see inflation continue to fall quickly. ""Wages growing at this rate, in a labour market this tight, is a problem for the Fed,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.  Others warned that a fall in overall hours worked each week would undercut pay gains and complicated the picture.  With the US presidential election due in November, the monthly report has become a political flashpoint.  While surveys show consumer sentiment has improved in recent months, the mood remains significantly more downbeat than before the pandemic. Analysts said that while wage gains have largely caught up recent price rises, people are still coming to terms with higher costs.  ""You remember when you were paying $1 for something and now you're paying $1.17,"" said professor Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School poll. ""Adjusting to the new normal for prices - that takes a long time."""
investors sentiments,Stock markets rebound on Russia sanctions,2024-09-15,2022-02-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60518578,"Global markets soared on Friday as investor concerns eased about the severity of sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Coordinated Western sanctions against Russia have targeted its banks but left its energy sector largely untouched. After sharp falls on Thursday, stock markets in the UK and Europe jumped more than 3%. US exchanges also rose. Oil prices reversed early gains on Friday and fell by more than 2% but are still trading near seven-year highs. Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil prices - dropped below $98 a barrel. The share price gains followed weeks of declines, fuelled in part by concerns about Europe's most severe conflict since World War Two. While the sanctions against Russia include freezing bank assets and cutting off state-owned enterprises, they stopped short of disconnecting Russia from the Swift international banking system or targeting its oil and gas exports, which some analysts said had helped stock markets start to recover. ""It's not that the market is saying the war is good news. They were worried about the war and selling off, and now it's happened and paradoxically it's not as bad as the worst case scenario, at least not yet,"" said Jonas Golterman, senior markets economist at Capital Economics. The UK's FTSE 100 index rose 3.9%- the biggest daily gain since November 2020 when Pfizer announced a vaccine breakthrough - and stock markets in Germany and France closed more than 3.5% higher.  In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2.5% higher, while the S&P 500 rose 2.2% and the Nasdaq climbed 1.6%, extending gains from Thursday. Markets in Asia also closed higher. The gains came despite fighting across Ukraine on Friday forced tens of thousands of people from their homes.  The US, UK and EU said Friday they would place sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin, but China's foreign ministry also reported that Mr Putin might be willing to hold talks with Ukraine.  ""This is a very sentiment driven market right now, so if there is even a whisper that there might be willingness to talk, the market will rally and rally hard,"" said Ross Mayfield, a US-based investment strategy analyst at Baird investment bank.  ""That's not based on fundamentals. That's pure sentiment."" After the earlier global sell-off of shares, investors were also ""looking for bargains"", said Jane Foley, head of currency strategy at Rabobank. Ms Foley told the BBC's Today programme there were many firms in emerging markets which export agricultural products and raw materials such as metals, so ""perhaps they're going to be doing well in this crisis, because other countries will be looking to buy their commodities from other markets that aren't Russian"". The UK imports 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but there have been concerns that sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. The high price of energy and fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions, is one of the main factors currently driving up the cost of living for people in the UK. Both the RAC and AA motoring groups said average fuel prices hit fresh record highs of 149.67p a litre for petrol, with diesel at 153.05p. Despite the fall on Friday, the AA predicted that petrol would hit 150p per litre over the weekend. There is a lag between crude oil and petrol price movements. Both motoring groups said the weak pound combined with crude oil prices would push up costs at the pump. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said ""sadly, more increases are on the way"" due to the rise in the price of crude oil and the pound weakening against the dollar, ""making wholesale fuel more expensive to buy for retailers in the UK"". Gas prices have seen big fluctuations since Russia's military action began. UK wholesale gas prices soared nearly 60% on Thursday but on Friday prices were down more than 18%. Russia is the second largest exporter of crude oil after Saudi Arabia. It is also the world's biggest exporter of natural gas. Europe gets nearly a third of its oil and around 40% of its gas from Russia, much of it flowing through pipelines across Ukrainian territory. Concerns remain that sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide.  Despite the inflation risk, analysts said the stock market rally reflects in part investor bets that uncertainty from the conflict will make central banks - in particular, the US Federal Reserve - move more cautiously to raise interest rates. Fear of aggressive action has been a major factor driving prices lower in recent weeks. ""With all of this uncertainty weighing, and part of that, the way high oil prices and high gas prices might weigh on consumer spending in the US, I think they'll be more hesitant,"" said Mr Mayfield of Baird."
investors sentiments,Birkenstock growth plans fail to impress investors,2024-09-15,2024-01-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68021680,"Birkenstock is ramping up spending to open stores and expand production, expecting demand for its sturdy two-strap sandal to hold strong despite the risk of shifting fashion.  The German shoe company expects sales to rise more than 15% in its 2024 financial year, after surging 20% to almost €1.5bn (£1.29bn) in 2023. But the forecast failed to impress investors, sending shares lower. The results were the first since the company listed its shares in the US. It has opened the long-time family firm up to judgement on the public market. Despite executives' optimism about the outlook, Birkenstock shares dropped more than 8% on the results, which showed profits fell last year and margins are expected to shrink further in 2024 as it continues to invest. The company is also running into scepticism that the strong consumer spending that has powered its sales can last, as economic growth slows in key markets such as the US and luxury sales weaken.  Boss Oliver Reichert said he was ""undeterred"" by the wider financial gloom and had seen no significant slowdown in demand.  ""It is a bit different from the desire-driven luxury brands,"" he said on a call with analysts to discuss results.  ""They are much heavier under pressure. We are not - we see growth everywhere.""  Once a byword for a kind of nature-loving, granola-eating dorkiness, Birkenstock has seen its reputation shift over the last decade, with designer collaborations and prime billing in films such as Barbie.  But its ride on the share markets has been bumpy, reflecting questions about how to value the firm, which straddles uncertain territory as a maker of ""luxury"" shoes for the mass market. Its shares dropped sharply when they started trading in October but have since recovered. They were trading at around $45 per share in mid-morning trade in New York on Thursday, after the release of the results. That was similar to the price they fetched in the firm's public offering, giving it a market value of about $9bn. ""We are aware that it is not easy to compare Birkenstock to any other listed company,"" Mr Reichert acknowledged in a call for investors to discuss the results. ""We are neither luxury nor fashion nor footwear."" In the three months to 30 September, the firm posted a loss of €28m (£24m; $30m), reflecting a jump in administrative expenses ahead of the listing. That disappointed analysts expecting a small profit, after a summer sales surge sparked by the Barbie film, in which the title character ditches her heels for a pastel pink pair of the firm's sandals. But Birkenstock said it had used money from the share sale to pay down debt and saw growth opportunity as shoppers increasingly head directly to the brand to buy, bypassing stores. Mr Reichert said that so far, the brand had seen no significant slowdown since the 22% sales growth in the three months ending in September. He said it was opting for a conservative full-year forecast because of risks from inflation and because executives were ""rookies"" in navigating the shifting sentiments of financial markets. It is forecasting sales growth of 17-18% in its 2024 financial year. ""We want to make sure that we are on the right side,"" he said. "
investors sentiments,Stocks surge to record high marking market rebound,2024-09-15,2024-01-20,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68035276,"Shares in the US rose to record highs on Friday, fuelled by tech stocks and rising hopes about the economy. The S&P 500 index, which tracks shares of America's biggest companies, ended the day up 1.2% to close at 4,839.8, topping the previous record set in January 2022.  The new high means it has recovered from the tumble it took two years ago. Then, markets were worried over inflation and how the economy would respond. Now, as inflation eases and threats of economic downturn recede, investors have piled back into stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks firms meant to be representative of the economy, rebounded to hit its own record late last year, as optimistic investors bought up shares.  It notched another new high on Friday, rising 1% on the day.  The Nasdaq, where many tech firms are listed, surged 1.7% but remains about 4% lower than its 2021 peak.  For Wall Street, the new S&P record definitively marks out the current period, as shares recovered 35% from the October 2022 low, as one of rising share prices known as a bull market.  Investors have been cheered by hopes that the US central bank, which raised interest rates sharply in 2022 to try to cool the economy and slow price increases, is close to declaring victory and potentially starting to reverse course later this year.  That would lower borrowing costs and lift a weight on the economy, helping companies. At the same time, rate cuts would push investors away from investments tied to interest rates and towards shares, in a further boost to prices.  Tech companies have also been lifted by hopes that advances in artificial intelligence will unleash  new growth.  The improvement in sentiment is also trickling out to the public, who have seen retirement and investment accounts recover, while gas prices come down and price increases in other items ease.  The University of Michigan's monthly survey of consumers, a closely tracked barometer of mood, on Friday reported that sentiment this month had risen to the highest level since 2021, up more than 21% from a year ago. ""Consumer views were supported by confidence that inflation has turned a corner and strengthening income expectations,"" the survey said.  ""Over the last two months, sentiment has climbed a cumulative 29%, the largest two-month increase since 1991 as a recession ended."""
investors sentiments,Why Indonesia's next leader will need China,2024-09-15,2019-04-12,By Karishma Vaswani,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47905090,"Whoever wins Indonesia's upcoming election will have to navigate a tricky relationship with China. Beijing is a crucial player in the country's economic growth but increasingly unpopular with voters.  Indonesia's economy is South East Asia's largest. It has a population of 250 million and an average annual growth rate of about 5%.  By 2050 it is expected to be the fourth largest economy in the world, after China, India and the United States, according to PwC .  But analysts routinely say that Indonesia isn't punching its weight, because it's been plagued by decades of under-investment in infrastructure, as well as suffering from corruption and red tape. So, for the 193 million going to the polls next week to choose their next president, economic growth is a key election issue.  But that economic growth isn't going to happen without significant investment in Indonesian infrastructure, which is impeding trade and hindering the country's potential. Enter China. Beijing has been keen to develop infrastructure projects in Indonesia, and add it to the growing list of countries that it is investing in for its Belt and Road Initiative.  ""Traditionally the biggest sources of international investment in Indonesia have been Japan and Korea,"" says Tom Lembong, the head of Indonesia's investment co-ordinating board.  ""I do have to note that over the last five years China has gone from being the number 13 largest international investor in Indonesia to today to arguably number one."" Although there is no official Belt and Road project underway in the country yet, China has beaten Japan to some high profile infrastructure projects in Indonesia. But at least one of these projects has been plagued by controversy. The Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway is a $5.9bn project being built by a Chinese consortium and some Indonesian partners. Reportedly, at least 75% of the project is being funded by China Development Bank. Once completed, it will be one of South East Asia's first high-speed rail projects, connecting Jakarta to one of Indonesia's top three cities, Bandung.  But it's faced delays because of land acquisition problems, and critics have asked what the point of building a new railway to Bandung is, given there are cheaper options currently available, including travel by bus or existing train services.  Chinese investment has become a contentious issue in this election, as the incumbent Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, has been courting Beijing to invest in infrastructure in the country. This is partly because no one else has the financial might to match China's, and partly because Indonesia is such a cumbersome place to invest that most foreign investors can't be bothered. But Mr Lembong says foreign investors are attracted to Indonesia, and are willing to deal with some of the difficulties. He also said that in order for Chinese investment to reach its full potential in Indonesia it must be managed properly.  ""I think most countries that I'm aware of wish to work closely with China to continue to fine tune and evolve investment to make it less and less controversial over time,"" he says, comparing Chinese investment with Japanese investment around the world in the 80s and 90s.  ""Today Japanese investment around the world has become well accepted and completely uncontroversial. Believe it or not I actually think we are headed to some kind of situation where we will work things out."" But Chinese investment has also become the bogeyman Mr Jokowi's rival Prabowo Subianto has used to undermine him. Mr Prabowo has accused Mr Jokowi of being too soft on China, and allowing millions of Chinese workers in to work on Chinese-funded projects.  Mr Prabowo has said if he becomes president, he will review all of Beijing's projects in the country.  That's a sentiment that is widely shared by many Indonesians, who are increasingly wary of Beijing's influence. There has long been a deep-seated resentment of Chinese Indonesians that has at times boiled over into violence, partly driven by an economic jealousy of Chinese Indonesians who many perceive to be wealthier than ethnic Malay Indonesians.  While many of the big Indonesian business families are Chinese Indonesians, the reality is the vast majority of this community are middle class Indonesians, struggling to make ends meet just like everybody else. This anti-Chinese sentiment has also been exacerbated by what many Indonesians see as encroaching economic and political hegemony by Beijing.  In a recent report by the Pew Research Center, the share of Indonesians who hold favourable views of China has declined over time. In 2018, 53% held favourable views of China, compared with 66% in 2014 the last Indonesian election.  Still, it is highly likely whoever wins the election will need to depend on China to achieve economic growth rates that can sustain Indonesia's growing population.  The reality is that Indonesia's future success depends on navigating its relationship with Beijing, whatever its candidates may tell their voters."
investors sentiments,Modi Mania defines India's optimism,2024-09-15,2015-01-11,Simon Atkinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30772884,"This video can not be played The BBC's Sameer Hashmi reports from Vibrant Gujarat 2015 Stalls selling clothes don't usually feature at conferences dedicated to foreign investment.  At Vibrant Gujarat 2015 they have made an exception though - shoppers can choose between just two items: a collarless jacket or a collarless shirt, traditional garments popularised by the fashion tastes of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Take home the original souvenir,"" says the sign above a photo of the ""Modi Jacket"". ""Made in India, loved by the world."" The conference plays unashamedly on Mr Modi's popularity both with business leaders and more widely in Gujarat, the state where he was chief minister for 13 years. His face looms from almost every billboard, while another stall lets visitors take a virtual ""selfie"" with the Prime Minister.  Delegates stand in line for a virtual ""selfie"" with India's prime minister The official photos will be a touch more formal - with A-list guests including US Secretary of State John Kerry, heads of the United Nations and World Bank and dozens of government ministers and global chief executives. And while the event is billed as attracting investment to Gujarat, Mr Modi's speech, a rare one in English, was pushing the message that India as a whole is open for business. ""We have a large number of hands to work and, we have even larger number of dreams to be realised,"" he said. Tens of billions of dollars were committed by Indian firms on the first day of the conference, though observers said these events had a history of pledges that were never followed through.  A $1.5bn (£987m) UK investment in a new power plant was one of the few solid foreign investments unveiled. And UK Trade Minister Lord Livingston told the BBC that Mr Modi was a big factor in that investment. ""What he wants to do is bring that degree of pro-business friendly environment to India. I certainly see among Indian and UK businessmen excitement and possibilities. And we are starting to see some changes and I think we expect a lot more on the way."" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pushing the message that India is open for business A film played to the thousands of delegates highlighted policy decisions taken by the government since coming to power, from raising the foreign direct investment levels for insurance, defence and railways, to overhauling labour laws.  But some say more real action is needed on the ground, with delays in approving projects still a big issue according to Edward Monser, president of US manufacturing and technology firm Emerson.  ""We look at a great backlog of identified projects,"" he told the BBC . ""The faster they can get that approved, the faster the economy can grow."" The economy was at the heart of Mr Modi's election campaign last year, with a pledge that he could do for India what he had managed in his home state.  But opponents say Gujarat failed to outperform several other states. Others argue it fared less well on social indicators, including malnutrition and literacy rates.  And while World Bank President Jim Yong Kim used his speech at the summit to describe India as ""a bright spot in an otherwise mediocre global economic outlook"", he also pointed to changes needed if growth is to benefit more people. Critics say the Indian government has done little for the poor ""The Indian society has an enduring exclusion that is based, among other things, on caste identities,"" he said. ""This bias can impede shared prosperity, serving as a basis for discrimination in many spheres."" It was a sentiment shared by some locals outside the conference centre too. Waiting in line for a rickshaw, a middle-aged woman complained to my colleague that the state government had spent heavily on the summit, while doing little for the poor. Cooking gas prices had doubled, she said. And a new policy giving her a bank account meant she was spending money travelling to the nearest branch to withdraw cash. Mr Modi has arguably won over Indian business and is showing signs of doing the same with would-be investors, but convincing many of his own people to believe in his vision could be a much trickier task.

investors sentiments,New era for NI with new leaders at helm - O'Neill,2024-09-15,2024-03-14,By Raymona Crozier,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-68562048,"It's a new era for Northern Ireland with a new generation of leaders at the helm, according to Michelle O'Neill. The first and deputy first ministers are in Washington DC ahead of St Patrick's Day celebrations. They will take part in a series of events before attending the annual ceremony at the White House on Sunday. Speaking to an audience of Irish-Americans on Wednesday night, Ms O'Neill said she hoped to seize the opportunities of the Windsor Framework. She also pledged to continue to work for prosperity. ""A new generation of leaders are at the helm and we're all about building that better future, that shared future, for everyone,"" she said. Ms O'Neill also said society in Northern Ireland is moving forward, and urged the Ireland Funds dinner attendees to ""help us deliver that hope and opportunity we're so desperate to try to bring about for all of the people we collectively serve."" Joining Ms O'Neill on stage, Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly continued the positive partnership reflecting on the pair's contrasting backgrounds. ""We stand here tonight, Irish and Ulster Scots representing the two great traditions of our island,"" she said. ""We are determined to set a positive tone for all identities."" Mrs Little-Pengelly thanked the audience for being with the people of Northern Ireland ""through the difficult times"" and hoped they would continue their journey adding that Northern Ireland was ""open for business"". Politicians in Northern Ireland recently returned to power-sharing devolved government after a two-year gap. The first and deputy first ministers have denied they have had to compromise their political identities in their new roles. Michelle O'Neill said ""none of us are being asked to surrender who we are"" and said we should ""have the courage to be comfortable in our own skin"".  Speaking alongside Deputy First Minister Emma Little Pengelly in their first joint sit-down interview with BBC News NI, Ms O'Neill was responding to the challenges they both now face in office. Ms Little Pengelly echoed those sentiments and added that as joint ministers they ""are not planning to fail"". ""Moving forward we won't agree on everything and there will be challenges,"" she added. Speaking in Washington after the annual Northern Ireland Bureau breakfast, Ms O'Neill reinforced that Emma Little Pengelly was the joint head of government and she has been keen to send that message out in all her meetings in the US and Northern Ireland. A delegation from Trade NI - an alliance of retail, hospitality and manufacturing representatives - are also in Washington. Manufacturing NI's chief executive Stephen Kelly said there has been ""massive interest"" in Northern Ireland so far. He told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme the delegation are hoping to build relationships and establish long-lasting connections to secure more investment for the trade sector. ""For the first time in a long time, there's a stake placed in the ground for Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""This pitch here is about tourism, it's about actually Northern Ireland companies selling more in the US and we've seen increasingly now businesses from Northern Ireland making investments in the US. ""So this is about trade, it's about tourism, as well as about bringing jobs home."" Mr Kelly added the recent return to devolution and NI's ""unique"" dual-market access has fascinated potential investors. ""They know that 10 million, 20 million, 30 million dollars of investment is going to be safe, and Northern Ireland's a good place to put it,"" he said. Earlier on Wednesday the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) said any reform of the political institutions in Northern Ireland should happen before the next assembly elections. Leo Varadkar said any changes, such as how first and deputy first ministers were elected or the capacity for one party to have a veto, should happen before voters go to the polls again. However, he added that Stormont parties would need to agree on any changes. Mr Varadkar also acknowledged that elections were ""a while away"". Responding to those comments, Ulster Unionist Mike Nesbitt warned there's a need to be careful when it comes to reform.  ""If you speak to the 90 MLA's who all know if it collapses again perhaps it will be for a generation and very, very few want that outcome,"" he told BBC News NI. ""On reform, I'm certainly prepared to look at but there's a certain element of a be careful what you wish for, because St Andrew's did not work out well.  ""We need to be careful of how we manage that."""
investors sentiments,Morning business round-up,2024-09-15,2012-07-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-18982410,"What made the business news in Asia and Europe this morning? Here's our daily business round-up: In Europe, French car firm Peugeot has reported a loss of 819m euros ($994m) for the first half of the year and has detailed 1.5bn euros of cost savings. The firm said sales in the six months to the end of June had fallen by 5.1%. Peugeot, which made a profit of 806m euros in the first half of 2011, said it would not break even until 2014. It's in the process of cutting 8,000 jobs and closing two production centres. The UK recession has deepened, latest official figures have shown, after the output of the economy fell by 0.7% between April and June.  The contraction was much bigger than expected and follows a 0.3% drop in the first three months of the year.  The Office for National Statistics said the fall was largely due to a sharp slowdown in the construction sector.  It said it was not yet sure of the size of the effect of the poor weather and the extra June bank holiday.  Deutsche Bank reported a profit warning in advance of its second quarter results due to be published on 31 July. There are fears the bank may have to seek new capital to strengthen its balance sheet. It is one of the 15 banks and financial institutions being investigated for trying to fix the Libor and Euribor inter-bank lending rates. This video can not be played Biz Heads The European Commission has proposed making interest rate fixing a criminal offence in the wake of the scandal. Manipulating benchmark rates, such as Libor and Euribor, will be added to insider dealing as criminal offences, the Commission said. Justice commissioner Viviane Reding said the move would help ""put an end to criminal activity in the banking sector"". Meanwhile, German business confidence fell in July to its lowest level in 28 months, according to a closely-watched survey. The Ifo think tank's index stood at 103.3, down from 105.2 in June, citing a ""significant deterioration"" in the manufacturing business climate. It was the third month in a row the Ifo registered a fall in sentiment. There are continuing concerns about Spain's ability to repay its debts, prompting the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to warn that the worsening debt crisis in the eurozone poses a ""key risk"" to China's growth. It said China faced its own domestic risks as well, not least of which was a slowing property market and economic growth at a three-year low. But it felt the country was in a strong position to respond to any such threats.  Staying in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan posted a record trade deficit for the first six months of the year. Exports have weakened and increased demand for fuel has resulted in a jump in imports, resulting in a trade deficit of 2.9tn yen ($37bn) for the period. Finally, shares in Asia's biggest hospital operator IHH Healthcare jumped on their debut as investors hope for good returns amid growing demand for healthcare in the region. The firm's shares rose 9.6% to 3.07 ringgit on the Malaysian Stock Exchange. They also rose 9.6% to 1.22 Singapore dollars on Singapore's main exchange.  IHH, which opted for a dual listing, had raised $2.1bn via its share sale, the world's third biggest this year.

investors sentiments,The Indians protesting in freezing cold for statehood,2024-09-15,2024-03-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68573281,"In India's high-altitude Ladakh region, thousands are protesting in sub-zero temperatures. In 2019, the government fulfilled their longstanding demand for a region separate from Indian-administered Kashmir. But since 2020, they have frequently taken to streets, accusing the government of ""betrayal"" and unkept promises. Srinagar-based freelance journalist Auqib Javeed reports on what's changed. Ladakh, India's northern-most region, is a desert inhabited by 300,000 people from the Muslim and Buddhist communities. The Leh region is dominated by Buddhists while the Kargil region is inhabited by Shia Muslims.  For decades, the Buddhist community demanded a separate region for its people, while those in Kargil wanted to be integrated with the Muslim-majority region of India-administered Kashmir. In 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked Article 370 of the constitution which accorded special status to the former state of Jammu and Kashmir and gave it significant autonomy. The state was then divided into two parts - Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir - and both are federally administered territories.  A year later, Kargil and Leh districts joined hands and formed the Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), aimed at addressing people's concerns. The civil society groups have held massive rallies against the federal government. Earlier this week, shops closed and thousands took to the streets in Kargil to demand statehood. In Leh, protesters have planned a border march next week. ""We were demanding a separate territory with a legislature,"" says Chhering Dorjey Lakrook, a veteran Buddhist leader from Leh. ""But we were granted only a federally governed territory.""  For people in Ladakh, who depend primarily on agriculture, the move also sparked fears it would affect the region's culture and identity as it made it easier for those from outside the region to buy land in the area. According to India's home ministry, as of 5 April 2023, no Indian company had invested in Ladakh in the past three years, nor had anyone from outside purchased any land. But residents remain apprehensive about an influx like in Jammu and Kashmir where, data shows, 185 outsiders have bought land between 2020-22.   Their demands include statehood for Ladakh, jobs, protection of their land and resources, and a parliamentary seat each for Leh and Kargil districts. They also want implementation of the Sixth Schedule, a constitutional provision that protects tribal populations and allows them to set up autonomous organisations that frame laws on land, health and agriculture. Nearly 97% of Ladakh's population is tribal. ""The Sixth Schedule was designed to protect the rights of indigenous and tribal groups,"" says Chhering Dorjey Lakrook, who until 2020 was president of the regional unit of India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This, he adds, will save them from exploitation by industrialists.  The federal home ministry set up a committee to discuss these demands, but locals say there has been no progress. Young people in the region are also concerned about not getting government jobs.  Padma Stanzin, who heads Ladakh Students' Environmental Action Forum (Leaf), says since 2019, not a single person has been recruited in a senior government role. ""We fear our jobs will be taken over by outsiders,"" she adds. Ladakh's BJP MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal did not respond to BBC's request for comments. Ladakh holds significant geostrategic importance for India as it shares borders with both China and Pakistan, the two countries which strongly condemned India's decision to revoke Article 370.  While Indian-administered Kashmir witnessed a protracted armed uprising against Delhi's rule starting in late 1980s, the militancy never spread to Ladakh.  In the 1999 Kargil war with Pakistan, residents in Ladakh volunteered support by supplying food and other essentials to Indian soldiers.  Residents now wonder if they are paying the price for being ""loyal"".   ""The spirit of that voluntarism will not remain if the government hurts the sentiments of the people,"" says Sonam Wangchuk, an engineer, innovator and climate activist, who has worked for years to address local community needs. Mr Wangchuk, who gained fame after Bollywood star Aamir Khan played a character based on him in the 2009 blockbuster Three Idiots, is on a 21-day-long fast ""to remind the government of its promises to safeguard Ladakh's environment and tribal indigenous culture"".  People of Ladakh, he says, have offered support to Indian soldiers, including to personnel from the plains who have struggled to adapt to high altitude. ""Any kind of disturbance will impact this spirit,"" he adds.  Experts say China and Pakistan would watch for any sign of ""weakness"" in the region.  ""Unrest and discontent, especially if sustained, is something that Beijing and Islamabad could try to exploit,"" says Michael Kugelman, director of Washington-based think-tank South Asia Institute at the Wilson Centre. Beijing didn't recognise the creation of Ladakh as a federally-governed territory in 2019. The region lies along the disputed 3,440km (2,100 mile)-long de facto border along the Himalayas - called the Line of Actual Control, or LAC - which is poorly demarcated. Since 2020, tensions between India and China have been high after their forces clashed in the Galwan river valley in Ladakh, which left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead.  Following the clashes, both Delhi and Beijing increased troop movement and built massive military infrastructure along the LAC. China launched incursions in Ladakh, claiming over 1,000 sq km of India-claimed territory. India has repeatedly denied China's claim. Incidents of Chinese soldiers entering Ladakh and restricting residents from grazing their herds have added to local grievances.  In January, a group of local herders clashed with Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers after they were prevented from taking their cattle to traditional grazing lands near the LAC. Mr Kugelman argues that while India cannot afford an unstable Ladakh, it is also not possible to reverse the changes made in 2019.  Delhi's position has always been that the repeal of Article 370 and moves associated with it were final and would bring an end to any disputes and instability within the regions affected.   ""Changing the status of Ladakh and giving it statehood would undermine that position and raise questions about the merits of making those moves back in 2019 and that's not the impression that Delhi would like to convey,"" he explains.  Praveen Donthi, a senior analyst for the International Crisis Group, a Delhi think-tank, says this is most likely why India refuses to extend powers to the local government in Ladakh.  ""The LAC is unstable since the Galwan clash and the government probably would like to tread carefully,"" he says.  Ladakh residents, however, hope the strength of their unity - the joint action by the Muslim and Buddhist communities - will eventually force the authorities to address their grievances. ""Our unity will compel the government to hear us and address our demands,"" says Jigmat Paljor, a student-activist in Leh. ""They can't ignore us for too long."" "
investors sentiments,Crash diet,2024-09-15,2013-12-13,Andy Martin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25351493,"Ireland's bailout exit has boosted the mood in the country Although Ireland's exit from the bailout programme does not in any way reduce the eye-watering level of debt it took on in 2010, it is hugely important, both inside and outside the country. The sense of reliance on the troika of the EU, the IMF and the European Central Bank has been lifted, and the country, to an extent, has regained its economic sovereignty. The view of Ireland held by other eurozone leaders is greatly improved.  The Irish enjoy their status as members of the common currency, and the excellent transport infrastructure across the country owes much to EU funding.  Ireland has atoned for the reckless lending of its banks. Its people have endured harsh new taxes, reductions in wages, jobs losses and heart-breaking levels of emigration, and they have done so without overt dissent or disorder on the streets. Its prime minister Enda Kenny has been praised by German Chancellor Angela Merkel for implementing brutal cuts in public spending, and Ireland has proved to be the poster boy of the austerity she insisted upon.  The benefits are of course practical, as well as psychological:  Angela Merkel insisted that Enda Kenny (right) impose austerity measures Ireland has kept up its interest payments on the £57.4bn it was forced to borrow The bailout has been rather like an endowment mortgage: the capital remains, but the government no longer needs to draw down cash from Europe  Ireland is funded for the year ahead, having already returned to the bond markets to borrow sufficient monies to run its services for 2014, but its status as an investment pariah has diminished Interest rates on government bonds are manageable; some even describe them as favourable During the bailout, unemployment reached 15%, but that figure has fallen month-on-month for almost a year-and-a-half.  Some small business owners feel the remarkable feature is that 85% of people managed to stay in work, given the crippling effects the bailout had on international trading. Small to medium enterprises have had to shed staff, improve quality and many have been forced to close.  Some, however, take that typically Irish approach and now feel able to reflect on the benefits of the bailout.  One CEO, whose company managed to weather the storm, says that because banks stopped lending, he could not afford to buy new machinery, and had to balance his income and outgoings. While it has streamlined his workflow, it meant losing some valued colleagues. Taoiseach Enda Kenny insists that exports are at an all-time high, due in no small part to the country's reliance on multi-national pharmaceutical companies.  A critical feature of Ireland's tentative recovery has been its low corporation tax rate, which is just over half that of the UK.  Ireland's low corporation tax rate has attracted international investment Foreign direct investment is strong, benefiting from a well-educated workforce, and, in turn, adding skills.  The tech sector, particularly, is booming; hundreds of young people have joined the IT and social network giants who have headquartered in Dublin and Cork. Many spend a few years there, and leave with their own start-up ideas.  While there are many reasons to be cheerful, all of this masks the fact that Ireland has 300,000 fewer people than it did four years ago.  Of those who emigrated, 40% were Irish nationals, victims of the search for work.  Critics of the government's austerity plan say this explains the fall in unemployment.  There is also a ticking bomb in internal lending: about 100,000 mortgages are in arrears, prompting the troika to express concern about the precarious position of Irish banks.  Thousands will be forced to enter into personal insolvency agreements, whereby half of their mortgage will be parked, while they pay off the remainder.  While unemployment has fallen, critics of austerity blame increased emigration Ireland has chosen not to avail of a precautionary credit line from Europe, which is a signal of its economic confidence.  While the troika will continue to visit and scrutinise its finances, the man in charge of the public purse, Michael Noonan, is considered a steady hand at home and in Brussels.  The minister for finance is understated and unexcitable, and while many in Ireland despise the hurt they have had to endure over the past three years, there is an acknowledgement that the peak may have been reached. When Ireland was bailed out in December 2010, few would have predicted an exit.  The talk then was that it would take generations to clear the debt. It still might, but the mood is different now.  There are solid signs of recovery. Empty office blocks are being bought up, and the tourism, retail and even construction sectors are beginning to re-employ people.  However, Ireland's debt mountain makes it particularly susceptible to shocks elsewhere in the eurozone. If the other bailout countries experience problems, faith in Ireland's recovery will waver.  Internal consumption is also a problem. New household outgoings include a property tax, and a hike in health insurance, which leaves some families struggling to find between 1,188 euros (£1,000) and 2,376 euros (£2,000) extra per annum, leaving less purchasing power across the country. Perhaps what Ireland has going for it most is the attitude of its people.  While the Ireland of the 1980s was an economically grim landscape of dole queues and wastelands across its main cities, these were later replaced by an insatiable appetite to develop every square foot of land and property.  One businessman who works in the vital agri-food sector says the future is bright, ""as long as we play to our strengths and stop playing village pump politics"".  He points out that Ireland has the longest grass-growing period in the world, and the supply of value added foods is as sustainable a business model as any.  Far Eastern economies may be struggling for proteins to feed their burgeoning populations. ""Why do you think the Chinese keep visiting Enda Kenny?"" he asks. There is hope also that some of the money the government haemorrhaged into its banks may eventually be returned.  The Irish have been quietly arguing that its government only shored up the institutions temporarily, and that the EU stepped in just as it was due to get that money back.  A bailout was effectively imposed by Europe. Had the banks been allowed to fail, the crisis across the eurozone would have been much worse. If such a write-off were to occur, it could halve Ireland's debt. Added to this is a growing sense in Ireland that the bailout better served faceless bondholders and investors than the Irish themselves.  The construction sector was badly hit in the downturn but it has begun to re-employ workers New research suggests that the bulk of the capital loaned by the Irish banks actually came from sources in the UK.  Increasingly the Irish are asking who was really bailed out in December 2010, and why have they been asked to pay for it? That is an argument that could go on for years. In the immediate term though, the bailout exit is hugely positive.  The mood is improving, gradually, and the numbers appear to be backing up the government's spin.  It will be a slow burn, but barring external shocks, Ireland is in better shape than many would have predicted.

investors sentiments,Breitbart: The web that connects Trump and Farage,2024-09-15,2016-11-20,Mike Wendling,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-38005983,"A once-fringe online news site has deep connections with Donald Trump and the UK Independence Party. So what's the story behind Breitbart? Just days after the US election, an ebullient Nigel Farage made his way to Trump Tower in New York - the first British politician to meet the president-elect. ""We're just tourists!"" Farage joked to waiting reporters. By his side was his former aide and the London editor of Breitbart News, Raheem Kassam. And Kassam's ultimate boss, Stephen Bannon, has been lined up for a top White House job as Trump's chief strategist. Key figures at Breitbart News - a fast-growing conservative website that has been condemned by some commentators as racist and misogynist - are connected with both the Trump campaign and with the UK Independence Party.  The White House was probably a distant dream when conservative entrepreneur Andrew Breitbart launched Breitbart.tv in 2007. It built on his earlier work for online outlets such as the conservative Drudge Report and liberal Huffington Post, along with an early iteration of his eponymous site which collected news links. The site first gained notoriety with videos targeting liberal groups and politicians. In 2011, it scored a major scoop when it exposed former Democratic congressman Anthony Wiener's sexting scandal, external. In 2012, Andrew Breitbart died of heart failure. Bannon became executive chairman. Andrew Breitbart in 2009 ""The site used to be a hard-hitting, no-holds-barred conservative website that held liberals to account and resisted political correctness,"" says Jesse Singal, a writer-at-large with New York Magazine who's tussled with Breitbart in the past.  ""They've turned much more extreme since Andrew Breitbart died."" From its base in California, the site has expanded, opening bureaus in Texas, Jerusalem and, in 2014, London.  ""We look at London and Texas as two fronts in our current cultural and political war,"" Bannon said at the time, external. At the outset of the marathon US election campaign, the site initially seemed to back Texas Senator Ted Cruz. But a key moment came in March when Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields was grabbed by Corey Lewandowski, Trump's then campaign manager. Charges were filed but later dropped. After Fields was criticised - and Lewandowski defended - by some of her Breitbart colleagues, there were several resignations from the website. In August, Bannon was picked to lead Trump's campaign. It was a sign of the site's influence.  Patrick Howley, a former Breitbart reporter whose beat was the Hillary Clinton campaign, says the site doesn't pretend to balance all sides of an issue. ""The ethic of objectivity as it's traditionally formulated is not practised there,"" he says. However he defends the spin by saying the site is up-front about it. ""I never made any pretence about the fact that I did not want Hillary Clinton to be president."" Future expansion targets include France and Germany.  ""Their model is to identify areas where there are two ingredients, the potential to exploit or inflame racial anxieties, anti-Muslim sentiment, anti-feminist sentiment,"" says Angelo Carusone, executive vice president of the left-wing think tank Media Matters.  He predicts they will back the National Front in France. ""The second ingredient is a political opposition force that they can align with or consume to gain legitimacy."" In Britain, Carusone says, UKIP was that force.

He later withdraws 13 November 2016: Following the election, Bannon is picked to be Trump's chief strategist In the days since the election and Bannon's appointment, there's been a lot of coverage about the site's most provocative content, including a set of much-discussed headlines:  Selection of much-discussed Breitbart headlines This however is just one slice of Breitbart's output, which is a hodgepodge of factual stories provided by news wires, provocative opinion designed to infuriate liberals and whip up conservatives, cheerleading for Trump and right-wing ideas, and attack pieces on celebrities, journalists and other perceived enemies.  The company produces videos, movies, radio shows and podcasts and has a huge social media presence. It's all presented in a tabloid style - and the site has no clear delineations between news, analysis, commentary and opinion.  Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Kassam described the site's style: ""Is it ugly? Yes. Is it varnished? No. But is it truthful? Absolutely."" Howley says the site's approach is straightforward. ""We are honest about it,"" he says. ""If you suspend objectivity you can build great sources and develop an audience and the information is all the same."" Howley, who says there is no written code of ethics or guidelines for Breitbart journalists, argues the site tapped into the ""populist side of the conservative movement which wasn't really represented in the press"". He resigned from Breitbart on election night, saying that the company had grown and changed substantially in his time there and that he was interested in other reporting projects. Raheem Kassam during his brief campaign for the UKIP leadership Editor-at-large Joel Pollak has denied the site is racist or sexist. The staff are ""happy warriors"", Pollak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Andrew Breitbart founded it to take on the mainstream media, to take on the institutional left and to take on the Republican Party establishment. There is in a sense a populist undercurrent in the website but that's not angry.""  Over the last 18 months, Breitbart's fortunes have risen in line with Trump's.  According to web analytics company Comscore, the site has added millions of readers since Donald Trump started his run to the presidency. Its monthly US audience is now more than 19 million, which puts it ahead of many mainstream news sites. In Britain it has a much narrower reach, even factoring in the UK's smaller population - Comscore puts its monthly unique users at under 700,000. If you visit the site and click around, you're just as likely to find straight news (""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he is looking forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump on 'the twin interests of peace and security'"") as you are to see freewheeling pro-Trump hype (""It happened. We won! We now live in the Age of Daddy!"") In that respect, Breitbart is distinct from the ""fake news"" industry that received so much attention after the election. Critics note that its stories might be made up of facts, but spun and deployed hard against its main bugbears - including liberals, refugees (particularly from the Muslim world), and feminism.  In August, the site published a story headlined ""TB spiked 500 percent in Twin Falls during 2012, as Chobani Yoghurt opened plant, external"". The story was one of several the site ran about a small city in Idaho and Chobani, one of America's leading yogurt brands. Chobani is owned by Hamdi Ulukaya, a billionaire immigrant from Turkey. Ulukaya has ties to President Obama and has employed refugees at his plants in Idaho and elsewhere. The story linked a rise in tuberculosis cases to the yogurt plant and refugees living locally. But there was more to the story. The ""500 percent"" spike in the headline represented an increase from one case - to six. Those six cases, according to Tom Shanahan of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, were all diagnosed prior to the Chobani plant opening in December 2012. By 2015, the number of cases was back down to just one.  Shanahan says that the Breitbart story was ""misleading"", that the tuberculosis spike was not statistically significant and that it could not be linked to the yogurt plant or refugees in the area.  Hamdi Ulukaya's yogurt company has found itself under fire from Breitbart In the UK, following the EU referendum in June, several stories on the site poked holes in a reports which suggested that hate crimes had spiked by 57%, external. The cause and effect around current events and hate crimes is complicated and awareness of how to report them boosts statistics. However there was no mention on Breitbart of later analysis by the Home Office which showed a 41% rise in hate crimes after the Brexit vote.  ""It's a more radical Fox News. It's living in a different world, a much more fearful world, where rumour and innuendo are passed around as fact,"" says Singal.  Full report: Trump elected Breitbart also runs sharply critical stories on other journalists and news outlets and mocks reporters who complain about trolls and slurs. ""Every special snowflake reporter with a Twitter account wanted in on the sweet victimhood action,"" taunted one writer, external, criticising journalists who found themselves being shouted at by Trump supporters at campaign rallies. Mainstream media reporters who have been the subject of Breitbart pieces have at times found themselves on the receiving end of online trolling. The BBC has spoken to several who have had rape and death threats against themselves and their families, and several from news outlets in the US and the UK said they or their colleagues have been cautious about writing about the site for fear of the resultant backlash. There's no implication that Breitbart reporters or employees are directing the trolling or participating in it themselves. (Although one Breitbart writer, Milo Yiannopoulos, was banned from Twitter for firing off unpleasant messages to actress Leslie Jones.) And Breitbart is far from the only news source to whip its audience into action.  At the same time the company and its journalists don't hesitate to complain about alleged abuse against themselves.

After dropping out of the race, Kassam said he would pursue a harassment case against journalists from the Times, external, claiming they intimidated his parents in the course of writing a profile on him. The Times characterised the encounter as a ""short, polite conversation with a family member"" in the course of ""standard reporting practice"". The site, which frequently argues in favour of free speech, has vowed to sue an unnamed media outlet, external for calling it a ""white nationalist"" website. Thus far, no legal action has commenced.  Breitbart's funding sources are somewhat obscure. As a private company, Breitbart has declined to reveal its investors or how it makes money.  In 2014, before its overseas expansion, Bannon said that the site wasn't quite profitable, external. There are ads on the site and it also sells merchandise such as campaign coffee cups. It has been reported that the company has been funded by Robert Mercer, a hedge-fund manager who is the founder of Cambridge Analytica, a data firm which worked for the Leave.EU campaign as well as Trump's bid for the White House.   Mercer's daughter Rebekah is part of Trump's transition team.  Another big Leave.EU backer was UKIP donor Arron Banks, who accompanied Farage and Kassam to Trump Tower.  In Washington, the big question people have been asking about Bannon is how he will act in the Trump administration, and what the role of Breitbart will be once he's there.  Prior to the election, Bannon said he would return to the company - but that was before Trump's victory and his White House appointment. Under ethics rules, Bannon has 30 days from taking office in January to declare his financial ties to Breitbart, external. Kurt Bardella, a former Breitbart spokesman who resigned after the Fields incident, says in his view the site's function won't change when Trump becomes president. ""It will be the propaganda arm of the administration,"" he says.  ""Their mandate is to create conflict, controversy and divisiveness - as well as propping up President Trump,"" he says.  But conservative journalist Cathy Young, who clashed with Breitbart after denouncing what she saw as the site's whitewashing of the extremist alt-right, argues that those might take a back seat to a more pragmatic political style. ""My guess would be that Bannon will be less of a champion of the alt-right than a political pit bull who will use whatever weapon he can to pursue the victory of the person he's promoting."" For his part, Farage has offered to act as a conduit between the US and the UK - a proposal that Downing Street quickly rebuffed.   Breitbart did not respond to requests to comment for this story, and several reporters and staff members also did not respond to questions.  Carusone, from Media Matters, thinks that calling Breitbart ""propaganda"" slightly misstates its role, and says its real function in a Trump White House could be to shore up support on the far right.  ""There's been a consensus in some parts of the media that Trump is softening on some of his policies,"" he says. ""Part of the role of Breitbart will be to give a wink and a nod to Trump's most fervent supporters to let them know he's still on their side.""

investors sentiments,SA rift over finance minister sacking,2024-09-15,2017-03-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39451040,"This video can not be played South Africa's night of the long knives South Africa's Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has described the sacking of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan as ""totally unacceptable"".  His late night dismissal on Thursday led to a 5% plunge in the value of the currency, the rand. Mr Gordhan was seen as a bulwark against corruption in an administration that is facing growing criticism. He was one of several victims as President Jacob Zuma conducted a major overhaul of his cabinet. Mr Zuma said the midnight reshuffle was about a ""radical socio-economic transformation"". Mr Ramaphosa told public broadcaster SABC that he would not resign in response to the sacking but continue to ""serve the people"". Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories Fallout from South Africa's ministerial 'massacre' Mr Gordhan remained defiant in the wake of his sacking Pravin Gordhan was seen by many as a safe pair of hands when it came to managing the economy. He was keen to keep a tight rein on spending and resisted calls from the president to increase government expenditure. This was Mr Gordhan's second stint as finance minister after first serving from 2009 to 2014. He was reappointed in 2015 to replace little-known David van Rooyen. Mr Van Rooyen's selection was controversial and he was in place for less than a week. It is unclear why Mr Gordhan was sacked but local media are pointing to an alleged intelligence report which accuses him of working with foreigners to undermine Mr Zuma's administration.  In a spirited farewell press conference at the treasury's office in Pretoria, Mr Gordhan defended his economic record, and dismissed speculation that he had recently held meetings in London aimed at undermining the president. Referral to his dismissal and that of his deputy Mcebisi Jonas he said: ""Our souls are not for sale."" Mr Gordhan and Mr Zuma did not see eye to eye on government spending, the BBC's Milton Nkosi reports, and that led to a rift between them. Ultimately, though, this is being seen as a political issue with the president rewarding loyalists. Earlier this week, the president recalled his finance minister from planned events in the UK. Last October, Mr Gordhan was charged with fraud, but the charges were later dropped. He has described the allegations as politically motivated. Cyril Ramaphosa, Jacob Zuma and Pravin Gordhan pictured just last month on budget day Comments by the Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa that Mr Gordhan's sacking was ""totally unacceptable"" captures the overwhelming sentiment of some top leaders in the ruling African National Congress (ANC).  ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu said Mr Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas had integrity and were incorruptible. The Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, Thabo Makgoba, has said the cabinet sackings ""constitute an assault on the poor of South Africa"".   ANC Youth League leader Collen Maine has however praised the cabinet changes calling the new Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba ""experienced and intelligent"". Demonstrators came out in the capital, Pretoria, in response to the news of Pravin Gordhan's sacking The rand is experiencing a setback just when it had started to recover from the political uncertainty and international volatility that plagued it in the past year.  The bond markets, this is where government debt is sold and the values are directly linked to the prospects of the economy have also reacted negatively. For foreign investors that is a boon, but for South African taxpayers subsidising the state it does not represent value for money.   Ultimately ordinary people will feel the pressure of these political moves, a weaker currency means the cost of basic imports such as fuel and some foods will go up.  A country whose reputation is dented, may ultimately lose face with international ratings agencies and finally be downgraded to ""junk status"" when the economic assessments are done again in June.   Apart from the nine ministers who have been affected by the changes Mr Zuma also appointed 10 deputy ministers.  Sfiso Buthelezi will become Deputy Finance Minister, replacing Mcebisi Jonas. ""I have directed the new ministers and deputy ministers to work tirelessly with their colleagues... to ensure that the promise of a better life for the poor and the working class becomes a reality,"" President Zuma's said in a statement.

investors sentiments,Why Spotify's big bet on Meghan fell flat,2024-09-15,2023-06-17,Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65936228,"When Spotify signed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex with an exclusive deal reportedly worth about $20m (£15.6m) in 2020, the royal couple were taking their first steps into the commercial world and podcasts were positively booming.  How times have changed. These days, Prince Harry and Meghan's brand has waned in the eyes of some and Spotify is reducing its reliance on the big celebrity signings and expensive original content that have weighed on its bottom line. Meghan's podcast became one of the most high-profile casualties this week when Spotify and the duke and duchess's Archewell Audio announced they would be parting ways in a mutual decision. It came after Spotify's deal with Barack and Michelle Obama's production company ended last year. Spotify has let go hundreds of staff since that time, hitting the expansive podcasting division, a hotchpotch of podcasting companies it spent more than $400m acquiring just a few years ago. On a conference call with financial analysts earlier this year, Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek conceded the firm had made some mistakes during the more than $1bn spending spree that followed its 2019 push to establish itself as a key player in the industry. ""You're right in calling out the overpaying and overinvesting,"" he said. ""We're going to be very diligent in how we invest in future content deals,"" he added. ""And the ones that aren't performing, obviously, we won't renew.  ""And the ones that are performing, we will obviously look at those on a case-by-case basis on the relative value."" Spotify clearly still has the stomach for some expensive partnerships. Last year, it resisted calls to cut ties with its controversial star Joe Rogan, who reportedly received $200m in 2020 for giving the streamer exclusive listening rights. But Mr Rogan's show offers several multi-hour episodes each week, which reportedly command an average audience of 11 million people.  Meghan by contrast delivered just 12 episodes of her Archetypes podcast last year. The joint statement announcing the split said the Sussexes and Spotify were ""proud"" of the material they made together.  And a string of accolades showed why. Archetypes' debut last year hit the top of Spotify's charts in six markets, including the US and UK. The show, in which Meghan interviewed fellow celebrities such as Serena Williams, Mariah Carey and Mindy Kaling, also won a People's Choice Award. But crisis communications guru Mark Borkowski says the show may not have been compelling enough when Spotify reviewed the numbers.   ""It's always about the content.... clearly there hasn't been a big enough audience for it,"" he says. ""If you can't deliver your fee, no one's going to pay it."" Mr Borkowski says there is little doubt that the duke and duchess still have value as a media brand. But it may not be what it once was.  Polling for Newsweek earlier this year suggested the couple's popularity in the US suffered following the publicity blitz surrounding their Netflix documentary series and the publication of Harry's memoir, Spare. ""The more Prince Harry and Meghan say, the less Americans like them,"" was Newsweek's headline. Mr Borkowski says the pair, who stepped back as working royals in 2020, will have to ""think hard"" about what they can offer in whatever they do next. ""It's a thread that's been pulled out of the brand,"" he says of the Spotify break-up. ""If they want to stop it unravelling they've really got to think hard. The biggest question is are they going to learn from this setback or are they going to ignore it as just a blip."" A spokesperson for the Hollywood talent agency now representing the duchess told the Wall Street Journal this week: ""Meghan is continuing to develop more content for the Archetypes audience on another platform."" Max Willens, senior analyst at Insider Intelligence, says Spotify is not the only tech giant that spent heavily in recent years to sign talent who failed to live up to the promise implied by the money they commanded.  Those heady days ended last year, as economic sentiment soured and share prices sank.  But shares in Spotify, which continues to add users and has seen its catalogue of podcasts jump to more than five million, are up nearly 90% this year, as investors welcome Mr Ek's promises to stay focused on ""efficiency"".  In announcing the ""next phase"" for its podcasting business this month, the company signalled it would embrace lower-cost, third party creators, while pushing investment towards ""always on"" programming.  ""The platforms that have gotten into [podcasting] had to take some time to figure out what constituted a good investment,"" Mr Willens says. He calls the decision by Spotify and the duke and duchess to part ways an ""understandable and natural part of that that process"".  ""Those were big, big deals designed to generate buzz and grab headlines and they accomplished that. Whether they made good long-term economic sense is a different question."""
investors sentiments,Sunny weather sees people splash out on new clothes,2024-09-15,2023-06-23,Lucy Hooker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65995685,"Shoppers have been splashing out on new outfits and other items for enjoying the summer weather, boosting sales overall, latest retail figures show. After the sun came out in the second half of May, sales volumes rose by a stronger than expected 0.3%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Online retailers and garden centres did particularly well, the ONS said. Fuel sales also rose compared to April, but people bought less food as prices continued to rise. ""Retail sales grew a little in May, with online shops doing particularly well selling outdoor goods and summer clothes, as the sun began to shine,"" Heather Bovill, senior statistician at the ONS said. ""Garden centres and DIY stores also saw growth, as the good weather encouraged people to start home and garden improvements."" Food sales fell 0.5% in May. As well as price pressures, that could be due to the extra bank holiday last month, the ONS said, as more people ordered takeaways or went to the pub. Overall consumers are still buying slightly less than they were before the pandemic. But because prices have risen, they are spending significantly more in total. Prices are still rising, although inflation - the rate at which they are going up - has eased from over 10% at the start of the year to 8.7% in May. On Thursday, the Bank of England put interest rates up by half a percentage point to 5% in an attempt to dampen demand and bring down prices. Interest rates have been rising since December 2021 but that does not yet seem to be having a big impact on consumer spending. ""Retail sales in the UK were stronger than expected which may partly justify the jumbo-sized interest rate increase from the Bank of England,"" said Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors.  ""It's hard to believe that tighter policy won't start having a significant impact sooner rather than later, meaning the consumer will react accordingly."" The online and High Street chocolate chain, Hotel Chocolat, issued a profit warning on Friday saying it expected to make a loss this year and lower than expected profits in 2024. The firm blamed ""ongoing weakness in consumer sentiment and continuing inflationary pressures"" for the shift."
investors sentiments,Tesla profits slump by more than a half,2024-09-15,2024-04-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72pvz18x4lo,"Tesla has announced its profits fell sharply in the first three months of the year to $1.13bn (£910m), compared with $2.51bn in 2023. It caps a difficult period for the electric vehicle (EV) maker, which - faced with falling sales - has announced  thousands of job cuts. Boss Elon Musk remains bullish about its prospects, telling investors the launch of new models would be brought forward. Its share price has risen but analysts say it continues to face significant challenges, including from lower-cost rivals. The company has suffered from falling demand and competition from cheaper Chinese imports which has led its stock price to collapse by 43% over 2024.   Figures for the first quarter of 2024 revealed revenues of $21.3bn, down on analysts' predictions of just over $22bn.  But the decision by Tesla to bring forward the launch of new models from the second half of 2025 boosted its shares by nearly 12.5% in after-hours trading.  It did not reveal pricing details for the new vehicles.  However Mr Musk made clear he also grander ambitions, touting Tesla's AI credentials and plans for self-driving vehicles - even going as far as to say considering it to be just a car company was the ""wrong framework."" ""If somebody doesn't believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy I think they should not be an investor,"" he said. Such sentiments have been questioned by analysts though, with Deutsche Bank saying driverless cars face ""technological, regulatory and operational challenges."" Some investors have called for the company to instead focus on releasing a lower price, mass-market EV. However, Tesla has already been on a charm offensive, trying to win over new customers by dropping its prices in a series of markets in the face of falling sales.  It also said its situation was not unique.  ""Global EV sales continue to be under pressure as many carmakers prioritize hybrids over EVs,"" it said.  Despite plans to bring forward new models originally planned for next year the firm is cutting its workforce.  Tesla said it would lose 3,332 jobs in California and 2,688 positions in Texas, starting mid-June.  The cuts in Texas represent 12% of Tesla's total workforce of almost 23,000 in the area where its gigafactory and headquarters are located. However, Mr Musk sought to downplay the move.  ""Tesla has now created over 30,000 manufacturing jobs in California!"" he said in a post on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday.  Another 285 jobs will be lost in New York.  Tesla's total workforce stood at more than 140,000 late last year, up from around 100,000 at the end of 2021, according to the company's filings with US regulators.  The car firm is also facing other issues, with a struggle over Mr Musk's compensation still raging on. On Wednesday, Tesla asked shareholders to vote for a proposal to accept Mr Musk's compensation package - once valued at $56bn - which had been rejected by a Delaware judge. The judge found Tesla's directors had breached their fiduciary duty to the firm by awarding Mr Musk the pay-out. Due to the fall in Tesla's stock value, the compensation package is now estimated to be around $10bn less - but still greater than the GDP of many countries. In addition, Tesla wants its shareholders to agree to the firm being moved from Delaware to Texas - which Mr Musk called for after the judge rejected his payday."
investors sentiments,Indian boss sparks debate over quitting etiquette,2024-09-15,2022-09-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-62830406,"An Indian start-up co-founder's tweet has sparked a debate on what courtesies potential employers and employees may - or may not - owe each other. Prashant Pitti, co-founder of online travel firm EaseMyTrip, shared a screenshot of a message he said was sent by a candidate on the day they were supposed to join.  In it, the person says they decided not to join because of another job offer. Mr Pitti tweeted that this was a ""hugely prevalent"" problem. Social media discussions on work culture have become common in India, where a number of vocal young professionals have launched or joined start-ups over the past few years. Recently, the CEO of Bombay Shaving Company was criticised for suggesting that new recruits at any job should work 18 hours a day. In Mr Pitti's case, the reaction was mixed. Companies, he said, waste a lot of time and resources when a candidate drops out at the last minute. The sentiment evoked both criticism and support from people, including other start-up founders. Some Twitter users supported the candidate, comparing the situation with companies laying off employees or rescinding job offers - they argued that if one could be justified, so could the other. In a follow-up tweet, Mr Pitti addressed the first situation of employers firing people, calling it a ""false equivalence"".  A ""real equaliser"", he said, would be if companies refused to let candidates join at the last minute after sending them an offer letter. ""Would this be acceptable? Big NO,"" he wrote. Many blamed the long notice periods - sometimes up to three months or more - at companies that allowed candidates to ""shop around"" for better offers. The tweet also generated discussion about what companies could do to prevent this from happening.  Some suggested giving higher salaries or fixing joining dates from two weeks of when a candidate signed an offer letter. Others suggested implementing a ""break-up fee"" on the lines of the penalties usually set for mergers and acquisitions. Mr Pitti also received support from Ashneer Grover, a high-profile entrepreneur, who said that India's ""broken and expensive"" legal system meant that there was ""no value of contract"". It was best, Mr Grover added, for potential employers to tone down expectations."
investors sentiments,TikTok founder defends potential Microsoft sale,2024-09-15,2020-08-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53654703,"The Chinese head of TikTok has defended plans to sell its US operations, describing a deal as the only way to prevent the app from being banned in the US. In a letter to Chinese staff, Zhang Yiming said the critics do not see the ""full context"". The letter comes as US President Donald Trump has threatened to bar the social media company. Chinese state media have said such pressure amounts to ""theft"". On social media, Zhang Yiming, founder of TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance, has also been described as a ""traitor"". In the letter to staff, which was shared by the company, he acknowledged the criticism, but said ""many people misunderstand the current, complex situation"".  He reminded staff of the firm's global ambitions and noted a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment around the world, including in the US and India. ""As a company, we have to abide by the laws of the markets where we operate,"" he said. ""It feels like the goal was not necessarily a forced sale, but given the current macro situation, a ban or even more."" The Trump administration has threatened to ban TikTok, saying the data it collects from its users - including an estimated 100 million in the US - is at risk of exploitation by the Chinese government. Beijing and TikTok deny those claims, which the US has made against other Chinese tech firms. But a sale to a US company is seen as a way to alleviate such concerns.  On Sunday, Microsoft confirmed it was in discussions with ByteDance over buying TikTok's operations in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand - countries that make up four of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. On Tuesday, it was reported that Apple is also interested. When reports of talks between ByteDance - which has received backing from US investors -  and Microsoft surfaced on Friday, Mr Trump said he opposed the deal.  But he later appeared to okay a potential sale, saying the government - which would review any takeover by a US company for national security risks - should receive a ""substantial"" cut of any purchase price. Mr Trump has threatened to ban the app on 15 September if there is no deal. ""The United States should get a very large percentage of that price, because we're making it possible,"" Mr Trump said.  Such a demand is highly unorthodox.  Nicholas Klein, a lawyer at DLA Piper, said generally ""the government doesn't have the authority to take a cut of a private deal through"" the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is the inter-agency committee that reviews some foreign investments in the US. Charlotte Jee, a reporter at MIT Technology Review, a magazine owned by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Mr Trump's comments were ""pretty astonishing"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, she said: ""I hate to say this but it is kind of almost Mafia-like behaviour - threatening a ban which pushes down the price then saying 'oh we should get a cut of that deal afterwards to say thank you for what we've done there'. ""It is extraordinary behaviour as well because last week we had lawmakers in the US trying to look at whether tech companies are too big and now we've got Trump trying to make one of them even bigger so it is a really, really bizarre situation to be in.""  By Dearbail Jordan, business correspondent  Former FBI director James Comey once said that dealing with Donald Trump gave him ""flashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against the Mob"". The US president has certainly made TikTok an offer it can't refuse.  If the video app doesn't break away from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, and sell its US operation to Microsoft, Mr Trump will simply ban it - putting TikTok's access to its 80 million active American users in jeopardy.  Mr Trump has already flexed his muscles against other Chinese firms, such as Huawei. But what makes the situation with TikTok unprecedented is the demand for a cut of the sale price. The US Treasury has not explained how this extraordinary demand for a cut of a private transaction would work. Mr Trump reckons the government should get a big slice of the pie because ""we're making it possible"".  However, the deal wouldn't be happening in the first place but for his administration's claim that the likes of TikTok are feeding users' data directly to the Chinese Communist Party. Beneath the president's bombast, perhaps this is simply payback for the US and its companies, some of whom claim China has stolen intellectual property from them. Perhaps Mr Trump is just doing outwardly what some governments have been doing for years. But one thing is certain, Mr Trump's demand for payment has muddied the waters in an already fraught situation. "
investors sentiments,Profits fall at Standard Life Aberdeen,2024-09-15,2018-08-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-45097375,"Standard Life Aberdeen has blamed ""challenging"" market conditions after reporting a continued outflow of funds. The fund manager said £16.6bn left the business in the first half of the year. Its assets under management and administration stood at £610.1bn, compared with £626.5bn for the same period in 2017. Pre-tax profits from continuing operations fell 12% from a year earlier to £311m - below analyst expectations of £325m. The Scottish fund giant was formed by the merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management last year.  In its half-year report, the company said macroeconomic and political uncertainties continued to affect investor sentiment, driving investors to look for new strategies. Chief executives Martin Gilbert and Keith Skeoch said conditions for the asset management industry were ""challenging"". They added: ""Our investment and distribution teams are winning new mandates and we have a good and diverse pipeline of business from around the world.  ""We are actively taking steps to improve our investment performance in key areas and are encouraged by the impact of these initiatives."" Meanwhile, the company also confirmed that it was accelerating plans to return £1.75bn to shareholders, adding that the first £175m tranche of its share buyback programme would begin ""in the next few days"". The group announced the move in May, saying that it would follow the sale of its European insurance business to Phoenix Group. The transaction is expected to complete in the third quarter. ""Challenging market"" is a familiar euphemism for chief executives facing an uncomfortable ride.  And that's where job-sharing Martin Gilbert and Keith Skeoch appear to be, with the half-year results for Standard Life Aberdeen. The share price is down since they merged, and they readily concede it is undervalued. The share buyback, of £1.75bn, is partly intended to give it a help upwards. That money is partly made available by the sale of the insurance division to Phoenix, which will see around 3,000 people, mainly in Edinburgh, transfer to the new employer by the end of next month. Shareholders are also benefiting from the successful float in Mumbai this week of the joint venture HDFC fund manager in India. The Gilbert/Skeoch strategy is to focus on asset management in Edinburgh, with more than £600bn under management. The biggest asset manager in Europe, that should give them real clout. But it has been losing ground. Instead of being bigger than the sum of the parts, they've become smaller. Assets Under Management have lost another £16bn net, to reach £610bn.  But as the chief executives say, they are facing a market that is ""liquidity-driven"". A lot of it is being driven towards tracker funds rather than the more expensive actively-managed ones. Those who manage funds actively, carrying the cost of research, are finding ""compression"" of charges. Shareholders will be aware that's another euphemism, referring to the downward pressure on what Standard Life Aberdeen can charge in management fees, while rivals are cutting as low as zero (though read the small print carefully). With fees compressed and a net outflow of funds, if the firm can't push up earnings, then the target of cutting its earnings ratio from 69% to 60% (slow progress in recent months) is going to require more than the £350m currently being taken out of its cost base."
investors sentiments,Housebuilder Persimmon's profits top £1bn,2024-09-15,2019-02-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47368308,"Profits have topped £1bn for the first time at housebuilder Persimmon, which was caught in a pay row last year and is under scrutiny over its continued involvement in the Help to Buy scheme. Annual profits jumped 13% to £1.091bn, up from £966m in 2017. The firm also said its interim chief executive, Dave Jenkinson, would now take on the role permanently. Mr Jenkinson's predecessor, Jeff Fairburn, left last year following controversy over his £75m pay package. ""We are the first company to make over £1bn profit in this sector,"" Mr Jenkinson said. ""The whole team are very proud."" The results come a day after shares in Persimmon fell 5% because of questions over its continued involvement in the Help to Buy scheme. The firm sold 7,970 homes under the scheme in 2018, up from 7,682 in 2017. At the weekend, a source close to Housing Minister James Brokenshire said the minister was ""increasingly concerned"" by Persimmon's practices, including its use of leasehold contracts, the quality of its buildings and its leadership. He said this meant its inclusion in the Help to Buy scheme was under review. Mike Amey, managing director of global investment management firm Pimco, told the BBC that profit per house at Persimmon had trebled since Help To Buy was introduced.  And housing expert Henry Pryor told the BBC: ""There is no doubt that Help to Buy has been the crack cocaine of the housing industry. We've all got addicted to it and when we are weaned off it, it is going to be painful."" By Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenter The Persimmon money machine rolls on, profits past the £1bn mark and £2.2bn returned to shareholders in the past seven years, with the promise of more - much more - to come.   Persimmon has been an astonishing success for its investors, and of course its executives, who are benefiting from a giant pay scheme agreed in 2012. Sometimes, though, you can have too much success, particularly when you are a big beneficiary of a taxpayer-funded housing scheme, in this case Help to Buy.   Jeff Fairburn, the former chief executive, had to fall on his sword after public and investor opinion swung sharply against the size of his remuneration - £75m, although he gave some to charity.  The danger now is that a similar shift in sentiment undermines the company as a whole.  Politicians might decide that £1bn a year in profits, a 30% operating margin and giant dividends to shareholders are evidence the new-build housing market is no longer sufficiently competitive, and has instead turned into an oligopoly, a market carved up between a few big players.  There was a hint of that in weekend reports that Persimmon's participation in Help to Buy was under government scrutiny - a hint strong enough to send the shares down nearly 5%.  If the hint were to turn into reality, the Persimmon money machine would judder to a halt. Mr Jenkinson has been with the firm for 22 years and had been interim chief executive since November, following Mr Fairburn's departure. He said: ""2018 has been a year of disciplined high quality growth again for Persimmon Homes. ""We have a lower average selling price than our competitors, but that is a function of our desire to hit all parts of the market."" He added: ""It is important for me as the new CEO to acknowledge that we still have work to do in customer care.""  Chairman Roger Devlin said: ""Persimmon is changing. In his short time as interim CEO, Dave Jenkinson has introduced new approaches to customer satisfaction and colleague engagement, whilst also ensuring that the group delivered another year of growth.""  The company's total group revenue for the year increased by 4% to £3.74bn, up from £3.60bn in 2017. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Conditions are about as good as they can be, with low interest rates, record low unemployment and helpful government schemes like Help to Buy all helping people get on the property ladder.  ""With Persimmon's participation in the Help to Buy programme under heavy scrutiny, following its former use of controversial leasing fees, and poor quality builds, these conditions have to end at some point."" Looking ahead, the company said in its results statement: ""Whilst sales expectations remain subject to a degree of uncertainty at the start of any financial year, the lack of clarity with respect to the UK's exit from the EU is currently creating additional unpredictability."" It added: ""We have worked with our suppliers to identify any material supplies which may be exposed to some disruption to availability as a result of Brexit and we are working with them to adopt appropriate mitigating measures."""
investors sentiments,The UK's growing tech trade ties with Israel,2024-09-15,2018-09-12,By Jonathan Josephs,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45485255,"Ami Daniel doesn't see Brexit as a reason to hold off expanding his company in the UK. ""We intend to invest more and more in London,"" says the Israeli businessman, who recently opened an office in London. Mr Daniel, the founder of Windward, an Israeli maritime data firm, says that the opportunities for his company in the UK are too good to refuse. Speaking at a recent networking event in London for British and Israeli firms, he explains, ""Marine insurance was literally invented here at Lloyd's of London, and it's here to stay, and so are we."" It's a sentiment many of his compatriots share. The amount of Israeli investment in the UK has been growing since a UK government scheme called the UK Israel Tech Hub was launched in 2011, and this investment has continued despite uncertainty over Brexit. The hub aims to boost business links between the two countries, by acting as a one-stop shop to bring British and Israeli companies together. It helps British firms find Israeli technology that could help them, and it assists Israeli technology businesses in selling their products and services in the UK. The scheme also introduces investors to start-ups, can help support visa applications, and indirectly points Israeli companies in the direction of the legal and other professional services they will need as they grow in the UK. Anglo-Israeli business deals totalling £85m have now been secured through the hub, it is claimed,. Meanwhile, hundreds of British and Israeli companies have been involved in its various activities and events. During 2016-17 this included more than 150 UK and 490 Israeli firms. Mr Daniel says that while ""there is a cultural gap, a gap in how you do business"" between the UK and Israel, the UK Israel Tech Hub works as ""a great bridge"" between the two cultures. He adds that ""it puts the people together and creates that ecosystem"" to provide opportunities.  There are now at least 337 Israeli tech companies operating in the UK. Figures from the British Embassy in Israel show a 33% growth in the value of their investments in the year following the UK's decision, in a referendum on 23 June 2016, to leave the European Union. While the increase was only from £114m ($147m) to £152m, the number of new investors has been sustained, and their investments climbed in value to £298m in the year to June 2018. London-based nano-satellite firm Sky and Space Global, set up by a former pilot in the Israeli Air Force, was responsible for a big chunk of that latest increase in investment. Given the success of the UK Israel Tech Hub, and with the Brexit deadline approaching, the UK government is now trying to replicate the model with other countries, starting with Brazil, India and South Africa. Mr Daniel says that these new hubs should help companies from other countries expand into the UK the same way it's helped him. This view is echoed by Hugo Bieber, chief executive of UK Israel Business, a bilateral chamber of commerce that works closely with the UK Israel Tech Hub. He says that new hubs are ""definitely a new source of diplomacy that the UK needs in a post-Brexit environment"".  One of the first Israeli firms to benefit from the UK Israel Tech Hub was electric truck company Tevva Motors. The business, now based at an industrial park on the outskirts of Chelmsford in Essex, is pouring money into the UK. It has a team of more than 45 people who are trying to change the way the world moves its goods around. The extended-range electric trucks they are working on are designed to travel at least 100 miles a day with zero emissions.  Founder Asher Bennett says the UK has many advantages for entrepreneurs, such as access to investors, as well as ""access to great team members, great engineers, and a great market to start and trial your product"". More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Mr Bennett also sees the English language as an advantage, as well as the UK's relative geographical proximity to Israel.  And while he does concede there are risks regarding Brexit, he doesn't see them as insurmountable. ""I would have preferred that there hadn't been this complication called Brexit, but I'm sure we'll overcome anything thrown at us,"" he says. The British government is clear of the benefits of encouraging such Israeli tech firms to develop their businesses in the UK. The hope is that similar tech hubs with much bigger economies than Israel will bring even greater economic benefits.   Sam Gyimah, the UK's Minister for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation, says the hubs are a unique way of building a win-win relationship. ""The benefits of this model are that it allows us to rapidly connect UK businesses with fast-growing disruptive technology businesses that are being developed around the world,"" he says. ""This means UK businesses can either create partnerships, or make acquisitions of those companies, but also it means those companies see what the UK has to offer, and see the UK as a place where they can expand."" Ziv Aviram knows about expanding Israeli companies abroad. He built and grew driverless car technology firm Mobileye. This became the biggest ever acquisition of an Israeli tech company when he sold it to Intel for $15.3bn last year.  Another company he founded, Orcam, is now his focus. Orcam makes wearable technology that helps visually impaired people to see and read, and is also increasing its presence in the UK. He says it is a country with natural advantages for a company with global ambitions, explaining that ""we started with English-speaking countries, the US and UK were our first markets"".  He contends that customer demand will have more influence than trade deals after Brexit. ""Visually impaired and blind people that need technology don't care if it's part of Europe or not part of Europe,"" says Mr Aviram."
investors sentiments,Latvia becomes 18th eurozone state,2024-09-15,2014-01-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25567096,"These people withdrew euros from a cash machine in Riga early on New Year's Day Latvia has begun the new year by joining the eurozone, becoming the 18th member of the group of EU states which uses the euro as its currency.  The former Soviet republic on the Baltic Sea recently emerged from the financial crisis to become the EU's fastest-growing economy.  Correspondents report much scepticism in the country after recent bailouts for existing eurozone members. But there is also hope that the euro will reduce dependency on Russia. EU commissioner Olli Rehn said joining the eurozone marked ""the completion of Latvia's journey back to the political and economic heart of our continent, and that is something for all of us to celebrate"". The government and most business owners also welcomed the single currency, saying it would improve Latvia's credit rating and attract foreign investors.  However, some opinion polls suggested almost 60% of the population did not want the new currency. ""It's a big opportunity for Latvia's economic development,"" Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis said after symbolically withdrawing a 10-euro note as fireworks led celebrations in the capital Riga after midnight. Latvia has its own euro coins The governor of the Latvian central bank, Ilmars Rimsevics, said: ""Euro brings stability and certainty, definitely attracting investment, so new jobs, new taxes and so on. So being in the second largest currency union I think will definitely mean more popularity."" One of those reluctant to give up Latvia's own currency, the lats, was Zaneta Smirnova. ""I am against the euro,"" she told AFP news agency. ""This isn't a happy day. The lats is ours, the euro isn't - we should have kept the lats."" Leonora Timofeyeva, who earns the minimum wage of 200 lats (£237; 284 euros; $392) per month tending graves in a village north of the capital Riga, said: ""Everyone expects prices will go up in January."" But pensioner Maiga Majore believed euro adoption could ""only be a good thing"".  ""To be part of a huge European market is important,"" she told AFP. ""All this talk about price rises is just alarmist."" Alf Vanags, director of the Baltic International Centre for Economic Policy Studies, told Bloomberg news agency he personally did not like giving up the familiar lats but it was an ""entirely irrational sentiment"". Euro adoption was good for Latvia ""on balance"", he argued, since it provided a mutual insurance policy that countries could draw on when they got into trouble. Latvia, with its large ethnic Russian minority, is often seen as having closer economic ties to Russia than its fellow Baltic states Lithuania and Estonia. Russia remains an important export market while its banking system attracts substantial deposits from clients in other ex-Soviet states.

investors sentiments,Robinhood shares surge amid frenzied trading,2024-09-15,2021-08-04,By Daniel Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58091533,"Shares in the trading platform Robinhood have surged, amid speculation the firm could be seeing the same frenzied trading that surrounded the video game retailer Gamestop.  The stock climbed as much as 82% on Wednesday, with trading paused several times due to wild price swings.  It follows a lacklustre stock market debut for the firm, which is popular with young investors but controversial. Some bigger investors have shunned the company for being too risky. Robinhood's commission-free trading has proved hugely popular with amateur traders during lockdown, with the number of account holders doubling to 31 million since January.  However, it faced disappointment last Friday when its shares dived on their first day of trading, ending the day at around $36.  On Wednesday, though, the stock rose as high as $85 before falling back. It meant that at points Robinhood was worth more than famous blue chip companies such as Kraft Heinz and Ford. Part of the reason, analysts believe, is that in line with its mission to ""democratise finance"" the firm has put around a third of its stock into the hands of everyday retail investors - an unusual move on Wall Street.   Now it appears frenzied trading by these investors may be pushing up the price.  It has echoes of the Gamestop saga in Janaury, which saw users of the social media platform Reddit buy up shares in the games retailer to drive up the price.  At the time, much of the action took place on Robinhood, with the platform even suspending trading at one point, angering some investors.  Robinhood was by far the most mentioned stock over the past 24 hours on WallStreetBets, the Reddit thread at the centre of the Gamestop rally, according to research firm SwaggyStocks.  Meanwhile retail trading in Robinhood shares was up tenfold on Tuesday, according to Vanda Research. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, told the BBC: ""This speaks to massive retail interest in this name at the moment and is an eye popping move for Robinhood that reminds investors of the 'meme stock' phenomenon."" A vote of confidence in Robinhood by star stock picker Cathie Wood, who heads the Ark Invest asset management firm, has also helped sentiment.  The firm increased its holding in Robinhood on Tuesday by 89,622 shares, and the stock now amounts to about 1% of its portfolio. It comes after many institutional investors shunned Robinhood's initial public offering over fears it could face a regulatory crackdown.   The platform has faced criticism for exposing amateurs to risky products such as meme stocks and cryptocurrencies. In June, it was fined $70m by a US regulatory body that said it harmed thousands of consumers through ""false and misleading"" communications."
investors sentiments,Vietnam arrests amid anti-China protests,2024-09-15,2018-06-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44436019,"Scores of people have been detained by Vietnamese police amid protests against plans for special economic zones (SEZs) that many fear will be dominated by Chinese investors. Molotov cocktails and rocks were lobbed at the People's Committee Headquarters in south-eastern Binh Thuan province, where police said 102 people were held. The proposed law would give foreign investors 99-year leases on SEZ land. MPs had been set to vote on it this week but this has been delayed. The decision to postpone the vote in an attempt to defuse the protests was seen as a major concession by the ruling communist party in response to large-scale street demonstrations.  The chairwoman of parliament, Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan, said that people's opinions ""will always be heard"". China's embassy in Hanoi has warned its citizens to be careful, referring to the protests as ""illegal gatherings"" that had included some ""anti-China content"". Demonstrators had gathered in various parts of the country over the weekend, including the major urban centres of Hanoi, the capital, and Ho Chi Minh City. Some carried anti-China banners, including one reading: ""No leasing land to China even for one day."" Protests in the cities were quickly suppressed, but authorities faced much greater public anger in Binh Thuan, where demonstrators threw rocks, set vehicles alight, and briefly occupied the local government headquarters. State media outlets said dozens of police officers were injured. On Monday, police formed barricades with their shields across roads into the town, and numerous explosions could be heard, as tear gas was fired into the crowd. At a fire station attacked by protesters, riot police are reported to have laid down their shields and equipment and withdrawn in an apparent peace gesture.  The bill offers companies operating in the SEZs greater incentives and fewer restrictions, in an attempt to promote growth in target areas. But protesters suspect that the communist government will award Chinese investors leases in the three economic zones in the north-east, south-east and south-west of the country, and that this would be a pretext for Chinese control over Vietnamese land. In Binh Thuan, anti-Chinese sentiment combined with simmering anger over industrial pollution and land disputes, to ignite a flammable cocktail of local grievances, says BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head. Demonstrators are also objecting to a cyber security bill, scheduled for a vote on 12 June. Human Rights Watch says it would give the government broad powers to quash dissent online. China once colonised Vietnam, the two countries fought a border war less than 40 years ago, and Vietnam contests Chinese control of a number of islands in the South China Sea.  As a result, our correspondent says, Vietnam's leaders must always tread a delicate line between maintaining relations with their powerful neighbour, and avoiding provoking anti-Chinese sentiment in a fiercely nationalist population.  Roughly $5 trillion worth of global trade passes through the South China Sea annually, and a number of countries claim disputed islands there. Vietnam has seen protests over the maritime disputes in recent years, including in 2014, when Chinese citizens fled the country in their thousands after violence targeting foreign-owned businesses. By Giang Nguyen, Editor, BBC Vietnamese Service This is the biggest challenge for Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc since his government was sworn in more than two years ago with a pledge to stamp out corruption and revitalise the economy.  The three special economic zones are meant to be ""mini Singapores"" - business-friendly environments complete with high-tech hubs. But Mr Phuc appears to have underestimated deep-seated resentments against China, and the speed at which protesters can utilise social media to organise street marches in cities including Hanoi and Saigon. While some are fearful of a perceived Chinese influence in Vietnam under the economic zone proposals, others are concerned about plans for a new cyber security bill. The latter has angered Facebook users in particular, who fear the authorities will be given too much power, while online surveillance could become the norm. Some critics said the government had lost touch with reality as it tried to push two controversial laws through a parliament where many MPs are openly against both. Those against the SEZ law include three advisers to the PM. "
investors sentiments,Saudi billionaire arrest spooks investors,2024-09-15,2017-11-06,By Zahra Hankir,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41885567,"Investors are reacting badly to the arrest of Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the world's wealthiest men. Shares of Kingdom Holding, Prince Alwaleed's investment vehicle, sank for a second day after the chairman was targeted in an anti-corruption sweep. The billionaire was one of 11 princes arrested by a new anti-corruption body headed by the Saudi Crown Prince. Prince Alwaleed holds shares in Citigroup, Twitter and Apple. ""From a sentiment perspective, this will hurt the businesses associated with the prince,"" said Nabil Rantisi, the managing director of brokerage at Menacorp, a United Arab Emirates investment firm.  ""Major investors may shy away from these companies for a while until they have more clarity on the outcome of the situation"". Analysts are speculating that 32-year-old Mohammed bin Salman, heir apparent to the Saudi throne, is consolidating power and asserting his control over the oil-rich kingdom.  The sizes of Prince Alwaleed's holdings in Twitter and Apple have not been disclosed by Kingdom Holding as he has been secretive about his international investments over the years.  Among the prince's other global holdings is Citigroup, in which he has owned shares since 1991, mass media corporation Twenty-First Century Fox and ride-sharing firm Lyft. The prince also owns the majority of Rotana Group, the Arab world's largest entertainment company, and London's Savoy hotel.  Over the weekend, security forces arrested dozens of former top officials and ministers within hours after King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud's decision to crack down on corruption. Prince Alwaleed's whereabouts are currently unknown. Some of the detainees are being held at five-star hotels across Riyadh, the Associated Press reported, citing a Saudi official.  Saudi Arabia's finance ministry has said ""firm decisions"" by the anti-corruption committee will ""help to reinforce the investment environment in the kingdom"". Shares in Al Tayyar Travel Group, a Riyadh-based travel company, also tumbled after non-executive board member Nasser bin Aqeel al-Tayyar was arrested in the sweep.   Investors are ""extremely concerned by the weekend's events and we'll see further falls on Kingdom Holding in particular as it's very hard to define what the company is without Prince Alwaleed,"" said Marcus Chenevix, a Middle East analyst at TS Lombard. ""The government is evidently struggling to find political equilibrium. This was a drastic move and it's hard to see that there won't be aftershocks following the earthquake."" Kingdom Holding has not responded to emails seeking comment on Prince Alwaleed's detention. The stock has lost more than 11% in the past two days, and is currently trading at its lowest level since 2011. ""No one knows how long this is all going to take and no one knows if the prince is going to come out of it the way he entered,"" Menacorp's Mr Rantisi said.  Any investor reaction to the arrests may be premature, however, as ""in the medium to long run, if the Saudis are able to link corruption to whoever was detained and if they sort the mess out, the move will ultimately create more transparency and could attract more foreign investment to the kingdom than ever before"", he added.   The price of oil reached a two-year high after the crackdown. Saudi Arabia is the world's biggest exporter of crude oil and the second-largest producer of the commodity.  Brent crude oil hit $62.90 a barrel on Monday, the highest level for 28 months.  Earlier this month, Forbes said Prince Alwaleed had an estimated net worth of about $17bn (£13bn), making him the 45th richest man in the world. "
investors sentiments,UK economy 'vulnerable' to borrowing shock,2024-09-15,2020-03-11,By Szu Ping Chan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51836555,"A surge in public spending risks exposing the UK economy to a shock rise in borrowing costs, according to the government's spending watchdog. Abandoning long-term goals to balance the books could have consequences, the Office for Budget Responsibility said. Higher annual borrowing and overall debt would leave Britain ""vulnerable"" to changing investor sentiment. The warning came as the chancellor unveiled the biggest Budget giveaway since 1992. Rishi Sunak's first budget included an extra £7bn to support workers and businesses affected by the coronavirus and at least £5bn to help the NHS cope with the outbreak. In total he outlined £30bn of extra spending this year. But higher spending over the long-term would be likely to lead to higher borrowing, which could prompt a rise in the cost of that borrowing. A year ago, the OBR predicted the UK economy would grow by 1.4% this year. Now it says it expects it to grow at just 1.1% this year, the slowest pace since the financial crisis. That does not take into account any hit from the virus, which will slow growth further and could add an additional £6bn to the deficit over the next two years, George Buckley, chief UK economist at Nomura estimates.   The extra £12bn to battle the coronavirus was not costed in this year's Budget, he points out. Public borrowing is already forecast to climb to a six-year high by 2022 without taking into account these additional spending measures. There has been no immediate impact on the cost of government borrowing. Yields on ten year government bonds rose only marginally after the Budget as investors took the near-term planned rise in borrowing in their stride Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, said: ""Markets are not only willing to accept [higher] fiscal spending but are now actively cheering it."" However, the OBR said the government's decision to move away from trying to reduce Britain's debt in relation to the size of the economy, could store up problems for the future. The last government said it aimed to bring down public sector net debt, but it now is projected to remain steady at around 75% of GDP over the next five years. Robert Chote, the chairman of the OBR, said that while he did not see the government spending splurge as a ""gamble"", a sudden increase in inflation and interest rates would make ""the arithmetic a lot more uncomfortable."" Sir Charlie Bean, a member of the OBR's budget responsibility committee, added: ""Clearly the more debt you build up, the more exposed you are if things go wrong.  ""And there's a good general principle that you want to have the debt-to-GDP ratio declining in good times, to build up the space for responding precisely to the events like the coronavirus. ""If you only have the ambition to keep debt constant as a proportion of GDP, every time you get a bad shock, you just ratchet that up again."" Boris Johnson's government has moved away from an previous Tory ambition to eliminate borrowing this decade. In the Budget the chancellor launched a review of the government's current self-imposed spending rule, which requires it to balance the books, excluding investment spending, within three years. Public borrowing is forecast to be lower this financial year at £47.4bn than predicted last March, but after that the deficit is projected to rise sharply. The government is now set to borrow £54.8bn in the coming financial year to plug the gap between the money it spends on public services and the tax revenues it collects. This is much higher than the £40.2bn that was forecast. This will rise to £66.7bn in 2021-22. The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing. The government expects to borrow almost £100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts. And that figure does not include £12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn. Mr Sunak said a weaker global backdrop would drag down UK growth. But the OBR said it expected the economy to rebound in 2021 with the help of the big spending boost. It said growth is forecast to rise to 1.8%, before moderating to 1.5% in 2022 and 1.3% the following year. Higher growth would make it easier to reduce debt as a proportion of the overall size of the economy and make the UK less vulnerable to a shock rise in borrowing costs. However, the growth forecasts were made before the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in the UK became clear. So they do not take into account the impact of the virus, the emergency government stimulus measures, or the cut in UK interest rates announced earlier on Wednesday. Mr Sunak said the coronavirus outbreak would have a ""significant impact"" on the economy, warning that a fifth of Britain's workforce could be off work at the same time during the peak of the outbreak. But he said the extra spending and investment would provide ""security today"" and ""prosperity tomorrow"". Mr Sunak unveiled a three-point plan to tackle the coronavirus, including: Mr Sunak said the government would do ""everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure""."

The amount of Israeli investment in the UK has been growing since a UK government scheme called the UK Israel Tech Hub was launched in 2011, and this investment has continued despite uncertainty over Brexit. The hub aims to boost business links between the two countries, by acting as a one-stop shop to bring British and Israeli companies together. It helps British firms find Israeli technology that could help them, and it assists Israeli technology businesses in selling their products and services in the UK. The scheme also introduces investors to start-ups, can help support visa applications, and indirectly points Israeli companies in the direction of the legal and other professional services they will need as they grow in the UK. Anglo-Israeli business deals totalling £85m have now been secured through the hub, it is claimed,. Meanwhile, hundreds of British and Israeli companies have been involved in its various activities and events. During 2016-17 this included more than 150 UK and 490 Israeli firms. Mr Daniel says that while ""there is a cultural gap, a gap in how you do business"" between the UK and Israel, the UK Israel Tech Hub works as ""a great bridge"" between the two cultures. He adds that ""it puts the people together and creates that ecosystem"" to provide opportunities.  There are now at least 337 Israeli tech companies operating in the UK. Figures from the British Embassy in Israel show a 33% growth in the value of their investments in the year following the UK's decision, in a referendum on 23 June 2016, to leave the European Union. While the increase was only from £114m ($147m) to £152m, the number of new investors has been sustained, and their investments climbed in value to £298m in the year to June 2018. London-based nano-satellite firm Sky and Space Global, set up by a former pilot in the Israeli Air Force, was responsible for a big chunk of that latest increase in investment. Given the success of the UK Israel Tech Hub, and with the Brexit deadline approaching, the UK government is now trying to replicate the model with other countries, starting with Brazil, India and South Africa. Mr Daniel says that these new hubs should help companies from other countries expand into the UK the same way it's helped him. This view is echoed by Hugo Bieber, chief executive of UK Israel Business, a bilateral chamber of commerce that works closely with the UK Israel Tech Hub. He says that new hubs are ""definitely a new source of diplomacy that the UK needs in a post-Brexit environment"".  One of the first Israeli firms to benefit from the UK Israel Tech Hub was electric truck company Tevva Motors. The business, now based at an industrial park on the outskirts of Chelmsford in Essex, is pouring money into the UK. It has a team of more than 45 people who are trying to change the way the world moves its goods around. The extended-range electric trucks they are working on are designed to travel at least 100 miles a day with zero emissions.  Founder Asher Bennett says the UK has many advantages for entrepreneurs, such as access to investors, as well as ""access to great team members, great engineers, and a great market to start and trial your product"". More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Mr Bennett also sees the English language as an advantage, as well as the UK's relative geographical proximity to Israel.  And while he does concede there are risks regarding Brexit, he doesn't see them as insurmountable. ""I would have preferred that there hadn't been this complication called Brexit, but I'm sure we'll overcome anything thrown at us,"" he says. The British government is clear of the benefits of encouraging such Israeli tech firms to develop their businesses in the UK. The hope is that similar tech hubs with much bigger economies than Israel will bring even greater economic benefits.   Sam Gyimah, the UK's Minister for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation, says the hubs are a unique way of building a win-win relationship. ""The benefits of this model are that it allows us to rapidly connect UK businesses with fast-growing disruptive technology businesses that are being developed around the world,"" he says. ""This means UK businesses can either create partnerships, or make acquisitions of those companies, but also it means those companies see what the UK has to offer, and see the UK as a place where they can expand."" Ziv Aviram knows about expanding Israeli companies abroad. He built and grew driverless car technology firm Mobileye. This became the biggest ever acquisition of an Israeli tech company when he sold it to Intel for $15.3bn last year.  Another company he founded, Orcam, is now his focus. Orcam makes wearable technology that helps visually impaired people to see and read, and is also increasing its presence in the UK. He says it is a country with natural advantages for a company with global ambitions, explaining that ""we started with English-speaking countries, the US and UK were our first markets"".  He contends that customer demand will have more influence than trade deals after Brexit. ""Visually impaired and blind people that need technology don't care if it's part of Europe or not part of Europe,"" says Mr Aviram."
investors sentiments,Hong Kong stock market takes a tumble on reopen,2024-09-15,2020-01-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51278558,"Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock market index fell 3% when it re-opened on Wednesday as investors feared the economic impact of the coronavirus. Almost all of the 50 Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies that make up the Hang Seng Index were in the red. Travel and casino operators were hit the hardest as traders assess the economic impact of the deadly virus. Coronavirus has already claimed more than 130 lives with more than 9,000 suspected cases. China's main stock markets, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, will only reopen on 3 February after Chinese authorities extended the Lunar New Year break by three days. Other stock markets around Asia saw more upbeat trading having already taken a hit from negative investor sentiment earlier in the week. One of the biggest fallers on the Hang Seng Index was Sands China which fell by up to 6%. The firm is a subsidiary of Las Vegas Sands and has a casino in Macau, a popular destination for mainland Chinese tourists. Since Friday, the numbers of visitors to Macau has dropped 69% according to official figures, leaving it as a near-ghost town during what is typically the busiest time of year. The Hang Seng ended the day 2.8% lower. The economic fallout from the coronavirus is not just reserved to stock markets. Businesses are also being affected as companies remain closed until at least 9 February following orders from Beijing. Airlines, hotel operators and casinos were the first to be affected as Chinese travellers stayed at home over the normally-busy festive period. The impact is now being felt across the Chinese economy from manufacturing through to retailers. Foreign firms are also worried about the effects on their Chinese operations. Starbucks has announced that it is temporarily closing around 2,000 stores in China to protect staff and help contain the virus. McDonald's is also closing restaurants in five Chinese cities and introducing new health protocols."
investors sentiments,TikTok founder defends potential Microsoft sale,2024-09-15,2020-08-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53654703,"The Chinese head of TikTok has defended plans to sell its US operations, describing a deal as the only way to prevent the app from being banned in the US. In a letter to Chinese staff, Zhang Yiming said the critics do not see the ""full context"". The letter comes as US President Donald Trump has threatened to bar the social media company. Chinese state media have said such pressure amounts to ""theft"". On social media, Zhang Yiming, founder of TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance, has also been described as a ""traitor"". In the letter to staff, which was shared by the company, he acknowledged the criticism, but said ""many people misunderstand the current, complex situation"".  He reminded staff of the firm's global ambitions and noted a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment around the world, including in the US and India. ""As a company, we have to abide by the laws of the markets where we operate,"" he said. ""It feels like the goal was not necessarily a forced sale, but given the current macro situation, a ban or even more."" The Trump administration has threatened to ban TikTok, saying the data it collects from its users - including an estimated 100 million in the US - is at risk of exploitation by the Chinese government. Beijing and TikTok deny those claims, which the US has made against other Chinese tech firms. But a sale to a US company is seen as a way to alleviate such concerns.  On Sunday, Microsoft confirmed it was in discussions with ByteDance over buying TikTok's operations in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand - countries that make up four of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. On Tuesday, it was reported that Apple is also interested. When reports of talks between ByteDance - which has received backing from US investors -  and Microsoft surfaced on Friday, Mr Trump said he opposed the deal.  But he later appeared to okay a potential sale, saying the government - which would review any takeover by a US company for national security risks - should receive a ""substantial"" cut of any purchase price. Mr Trump has threatened to ban the app on 15 September if there is no deal. ""The United States should get a very large percentage of that price, because we're making it possible,"" Mr Trump said.  Such a demand is highly unorthodox.  Nicholas Klein, a lawyer at DLA Piper, said generally ""the government doesn't have the authority to take a cut of a private deal through"" the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is the inter-agency committee that reviews some foreign investments in the US. Charlotte Jee, a reporter at MIT Technology Review, a magazine owned by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Mr Trump's comments were ""pretty astonishing"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, she said: ""I hate to say this but it is kind of almost Mafia-like behaviour - threatening a ban which pushes down the price then saying 'oh we should get a cut of that deal afterwards to say thank you for what we've done there'. ""It is extraordinary behaviour as well because last week we had lawmakers in the US trying to look at whether tech companies are too big and now we've got Trump trying to make one of them even bigger so it is a really, really bizarre situation to be in.""  By Dearbail Jordan, business correspondent  Former FBI director James Comey once said that dealing with Donald Trump gave him ""flashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against the Mob"". The US president has certainly made TikTok an offer it can't refuse.  If the video app doesn't break away from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, and sell its US operation to Microsoft, Mr Trump will simply ban it - putting TikTok's access to its 80 million active American users in jeopardy.  Mr Trump has already flexed his muscles against other Chinese firms, such as Huawei. But what makes the situation with TikTok unprecedented is the demand for a cut of the sale price. The US Treasury has not explained how this extraordinary demand for a cut of a private transaction would work. Mr Trump reckons the government should get a big slice of the pie because ""we're making it possible"".  However, the deal wouldn't be happening in the first place but for his administration's claim that the likes of TikTok are feeding users' data directly to the Chinese Communist Party. Beneath the president's bombast, perhaps this is simply payback for the US and its companies, some of whom claim China has stolen intellectual property from them. Perhaps Mr Trump is just doing outwardly what some governments have been doing for years. But one thing is certain, Mr Trump's demand for payment has muddied the waters in an already fraught situation. "
investors sentiments,'Elon Musk has made me embarrassed to drive my Tesla',2024-09-15,2023-01-29,By Natalie Sherman & Samira Hussain,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64376727,"When Anne Marie Squeo received her fiery red Tesla sports utility vehicle in 2020, the 55-year-old marketing and communications professional felt like she had joined a special ""club"" of people who were doing something to help the environment, while still driving with style.  But last year, as Tesla boss Elon Musk shared right-wing conspiracy theories on Twitter, posted a picture of guns by his bedside, and proposed terms to resolve the war in Ukraine that were adamantly rejected by many of the country's top leaders, Anne Marie's satisfaction gave way to shame.  ""It's been very depressing, and sometimes embarrassing to be driving this car around,"" says Anne Marie, a former journalist who lives in Connecticut and wrote an article about her discomfort. ""I wondered if people were making a judgement about me that I wasn't looking for."" Once hailed as the secret to Tesla's success, Elon Musk now appears to be one of its biggest problems, as his steady stream of politically charged social media posts alienates key parts of Tesla's customer base, just as increased competition starts to eat away at the firm's dominance of the electric car market. The value of Tesla shares plunged by roughly two-thirds last year - the biggest decline since the company went public in 2010 - reflecting the worries, as well as concerns about disruptions to production and the effect of high borrowing costs and a weaker economy on demand. In December, major investors - many of them long-time allies of Mr Musk - went public with their alarm, accusing him of abandoning Tesla after his $44bn (£36.4bn) takeover of Twitter in October and damaging the car company's brand.  The fact that Mr Musk sold roughly $20bn worth of Tesla shares last year - sales that weighed on the stock and were prompted at least in part by the Twitter purchase - did not help.  ""It's cost everybody a tonne of money. Certainly it didn't protect Tesla shareholders,"" says investor Ross Gerber, who is now seeking a seat on Tesla's board of directors and calling for changes, including starting to spend money on advertising, which Tesla has long prided itself on being able to do without.  Mr Gerber, the head of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management and a self-described friend of Mr Musk, says he remains optimistic about the company's fortunes, and has increased his firm's holdings as the stock has tumbled.  But he says the company needs to have a dedicated chief executive and create its own voice, one distinct from Mr Musk.  ""It's very hard to believe now that Elon is a positive advertising force for Tesla,"" he says.  Mr Musk, who has more than 127 million followers on Twitter, this week rejected suggestions that his unfiltered style on social media was hurting the Tesla brand, saying his mass following ""speaks for itself"". But in recent weeks, facing concerns about buyer demand, Tesla announced major price cuts in the US, Europe and China - running as high as 20% on some models in the US.   Analysts expect the move to blunt some of the brand damage, as financial considerations outweigh buyers' moral qualms. But the move will hurt the firm's profit margins, and for some car purchasers there is no turning back.  Indie Grant, who works in the insurance industry in New Zealand, ruled out a Tesla due to Mr Musk's politics when buying an electric car last year, opting for a Peugeot instead.   ""With him being so tied to the brand, buying a Tesla feels very much like a passive but regular announcement of 'I think Elon is great. I love everything he does,'"" the 35-year-old says. ""That really wasn't the message we wanted to give and with so many options, taking that out of the running didn't affect the choices too much.""  There is little that would prompt a Tesla purchase now, Indie says. ""My opinion of Tesla would only change if he weren't associated with it anymore."" Mr Musk has landed in hot water for his social media posts before.  One - about considering taking Tesla private in 2018 - sparked fraud accusations from regulators, which the firm and Mr Musk each paid $20m to settle. He was in court again this week defending the post in a class-action suit brought by shareholders who said they lost money in the share price gyrations that followed its publication.  Another - calling a man involved in the rescue of Thai schoolboys a ""pedo guy"" - led to a defamation case, which Mr Musk won, after saying he did not think the insult would be taken seriously.  Now, though, Mr Musk isn't just another person tweeting; he is the owner of the platform. That has raised the prospect of his political views, which he shares with increasing frequency, affecting how Twitter moderates the content on its site - a matter described by many, including Mr Musk, as important to American democracy. After taking over, Mr Musk moved quickly to remove the ban on former US President Donald Trump, also issuing a tweet that read: ""My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci"" - referring to Dr Anthony Fauci, the public face of the US Covid-19 response - causing outrage among liberals, who are the most likely to buy electric cars in the US,Tesla's biggest market.  ""This is largely a political story,"" says Jordan Marlatt, tech analyst at Morning Consult, which tracks public perception of thousands of brands in the US, and has seen a sharp decline in favourability towards Tesla among Democrats since April, when Mr Musk first announced the Twitter deal.  ""He's been a lot more outspoken on his personal politics than he has before and that's bleeding over to consumer sentiment."" Mr Marlatt says brands typically recover from damage stemming from politically charged incidents within 90 days. ""What's different for Twitter and for Tesla is that steady drumbeat,"" he says. ""It's every day, almost every hour sometimes."" Anne Marie, who has voted for both Democrats and Republicans, says prior controversies felt like one-off events, but the flood of commentary last year wore her down.  ""Elon Musk being a bit of a wild card is not new,"" she says. ""What was different was this level of consistency in doing it every day and the fact that he was really going after social issues with the seeming intent of riling people up."" She says at the moment she can't imagine buying a Tesla the next time she needs a car. ""At the end of the day, there's a lot of variety to choose from - are you going to really align yourself with a company that maybe doesn't represent your values anymore? I wouldn't feel comfortable doing it."""
investors sentiments,EA says NFTs are the future of games industry,2024-09-15,2021-11-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59167668,"Game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) has told investors that collectible NFTs are ""an important part of the future of our industry"". NFTs have erupted in popularity in recent months as a way to buy and sell digital-only art and collectible items.  EA makes the Fifa football series, which uses ""card packs"" to ""collect"" players in its Ultimate Team mode. Chief executive Andrew Wilson told investors he believes Fifa players want to see NFTs in the franchise. ""[Players] want more modalities at play inside the game, which go beyond just straight 11-on-11 football,"" he told an earnings call. ""They want more digital experiences outside the game - esports, NFTs, broader sports consumption and they want us to move really, really quickly."" But he also said that NFT ideas were ""still really, really early"" and came with a ""a lot of hype"". ""It's still early to kind of figure out how that's going to work,"" he warned. Bringing NFTs into gaming is sometimes presented as an idea called ""play to earn"", based around the idea that unique digital items can increase in value over time - and be sold off later for profit. PC Gamer reports that recent job listings at EA have included references to NFTs and the underlying technology they run on, the blockchain. But the idea is controversial among gamers.  Major PC gaming platform Steam has banned blockchain and NFT-based games from its platform, while its rival Epic has not.  Some game designers believe the concept is bad for gaming overall, but other studios - including major player Ubisoft - are apparently embracing the idea. Games industry analyst Piers Harding-Rolls from Ampere said NFT and blockchain games ""are new disruptive forces within the games sector"". He said all major publishers would be looking at the potential of these formats to make money - and ""EA is no exception"". ""It would be bad commercial practice not to be analysing how these technologies could impact its existing business,"" he said. NFTs are already seeing use in the sports collectables market, he added: ""I see a strong fit between [Fifa's card-based] Ultimate Team and the use of NFTs, but there are implications that need to be considered - not least the ongoing value and utility of NFTs, especially in the context of the season renewal which drives most activity within this mode of the game."" On the earnings call, Mr Wilson seemed to echo that seasonal sentiment - in which sports games such as FIFA are released annually and reflect the current sports calendar. ""Collectability in games like Fifa and Madden and NHL, is really built on driving value through the traditional sports season,"" he said. ""Is there an opportunity, particularly as we think about NFTs and other digital ecosystems to expand that value over time? I think the short answer to that is 'yes'. ""I mean the slightly longer answer to that is we need to work and make sure we continue to appropriately tune and balance the experience for our players… but we will continue, as we have evolved the Ultimate Team experience over the last decade, we will continue to look for ways to add value for our players."""
investors sentiments,ECB says no quick end to stimulus,2024-09-15,2017-07-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40666236,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has insisted there is still a long way to go before it can call a halt to its economic stimulus programme. ECB president Mario Draghi threw cold water on speculation that the bank might wind the programme down soon. The bank is still buying 60bn euros (£53bn) of bonds a month as part of its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The ECB also kept the key interest rate for the countries that use the euro currency unchanged at 0%. Mr Draghi said: ""After a long time we are finally experiencing a robust recovery, where we only have to wait for wages and prices to follow a course towards our objective.  ""The last thing the governing council wants is an unwanted tightening and for conditions that may either slow down this process or even jeopardise it."" Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The comment on inflation which is sticking in our head is Mr Draghi's notice to markets that: 'We are not there yet.'"" However, the euro did move sharply to a 14-month high against the dollar when at one point Mr Draghi hinted that the governing council of the ECB might start discussing reducing QE in the autumn. Neil Wilson from ETX Capital commented: ""It wasn't much but the market is super-sensitive to anything from Draghi at the moment."" Last month, Mr Draghi's speech in Sintra in Portugal was interpreted by many economists as meaning the eurozone's economic recovery would allow QE to end and for interest rates to rise. Patrick O'Donnell, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said: ""This is a well-choreographed attempt by Mr Draghi to make sure that financial markets don't get ahead of themselves after his more hawkish comments of late."" The QE bond-buying programme, together with ultra-low interest rates, was designed to encourage lending and fend off the threat of deflation in the eurozone. Mr Draghi said the policy had been a success: ""We have created in the last three years six million jobs, much more than any time before the crisis in the same amount of time. ""All the economic sentiment indicators and survey indicators are either at all time highs or close to them so the policies have been successful."" However, the inflation rate in the eurozone was 1.3% in June, down slightly from 1.4% in May, some way below the ECB's target of close to, but below, 2%. Mr Draghi said: ""Measures of underlying inflation remain low and have yet to show convincing signs of a pick-up, as domestic cost pressures, including wage growth, are still subdued. Underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to rise only gradually over the medium term."" Aberdeen Asset Management's Mr O'Donnell said: ""We probably won't hear anything significant out of the ECB until September, which is plenty of time for investors to digest Mr Draghi's caveat laden hawkishness. ""Mr Draghi will be hoping that today's performance is enough to give him a quiet summer."""
investors sentiments,Five reasons why China's economy is in trouble,2024-09-15,2022-10-04,By Suranjana Tewari,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-62830775,"China's economy is slowing down as it adapts to a punishing zero-Covid strategy and weakening global demand. Official growth figures for the July to September quarter are expected soon - if the world's second-largest economy contracts, that increases chances of a global recession. Beijing's goal - an annual growth rate of 5.5% - is now out of reach although officials have downplayed the need to meet the target. China narrowly avoided contraction in the April to June quarter. This year, some economists do not expect any growth. The country might not be battling steep inflation like the US and the UK, but it has other problems - the factory of the world has suddenly found fewer customers for its products both domestically and internationally. Trade tensions between China and major economies such as the US are also hampering growth.   And the yuan is on course for its worst year in decades as it plummets against the US dollar. A weak currency spooks investors, fuelling uncertainty in financial markets. It also makes it difficult for the central bank to pump money into the economy.  All of this is happening at a time when the stakes are especially high for President Xi Jinping - he is expected to secure an unprecedented third term at the Communist Party Congress which begins on 16 October.  So what exactly has gone wrong? Covid outbreaks in several cities, including manufacturing hubs like Shenzhen and Tianjin, have been hurting economic activity across industries. People are also not spending money on things like food and beverages, retail or tourism, putting major services under pressure. On the manufacturing side, factory activity appears to have climbed back up in September, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.  The rebound could be because the government is spending more on infrastructure.  But it came after two months in which manufacturing did not expand. And it has raised questions, especially since a private survey showed that factory activity actually fell in September, with demand hitting output, new orders and employment. Demand in countries like the US has declined too because of higher interest rates, inflation and the war in Ukraine. Experts agree that Beijing could do more to stimulate the economy, but there is little reason in doing so until zero Covid ends.  ""There is not a lot of point in pumping money into our economy if businesses cannot expand or people cannot spend the money,"" said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at S&P Global Ratings.  Beijing has stepped in - in August it announced a 1 trillion yuan ($203bn; £180bn) plan to boost small businesses, infrastructure and real estate. But officials can do a lot more to trigger spending to meet growth targets and create jobs. This includes investing more in infrastructure, easing borrowing conditions for home buyers, property developers and local government, and tax breaks for households. ""The response of the government to the weakness in the economy has been quite modest compared to what we have seen during previous economic bouts of weakness,"" Mr Kuijs said.  Weak real estate activity and negative sentiment in the housing sector has undoubtedly slowed growth. This has hit the economy hard because property and other industries that contribute to it account for up to a third of China's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  ""When confidence is weak in the housing market, it makes people feel unsure about the overall economic situation,"" Mr Kuijs said. Home buyers have been refusing to make mortgage payments on unfinished buildings and some doubt their houses will ever be completed. Demand is down for new homes and that has reduced the need for imports of commodities used in construction. Despite Beijing's efforts to prop up the real estate market, home prices in dozens of cities have declined by more than 20% this year. With property developers under pressure, analysts say authorities might have to do far more to restore confidence in the real estate market.  Extreme weather is starting to have a lasting impact on China's industries. A severe heatwave, followed by a drought, hit the south-western province of Sichuan and the city of Chongqing in the central belt in August.  As the demand for air conditioning spiked, it overwhelmed the electricity grid in a region that almost entirely relies on hydropower.  Factories, including major manufacturers like iPhone maker Foxconn and Tesla, were forced to cut hours or shut altogether.  China's Statistics bureau said in August that profits in the iron and steel industry alone were down by more than 80% in the first seven months of 2022, compared to the same period last year. Beijing eventually came to the rescue with tens of billions of dollars to support energy companies and farmers.  A regulatory crackdown on China's tech titans - which has already lasted two years - is not helping.  Tencent and Alibaba reported their first drop in revenue in the most recent quarter - Tencent's profits fell by 50%, while Alibaba's net income fell by half. Tens of thousands of young workers have lost work - adding to a jobs crisis where one in five people aged 16 to 24 are unemployed. This could hurt China's productivity and growth in the long run.  Investors are also sensing a shift in Beijing - some of China's most successful private companies have come under greater scrutiny as Mr Xi's grip on power grows.   As state-owned companies appear to be gaining favour, foreign investors are taking money off the table.   Japan's Softbank pulled out a huge amount of cash from Alibaba, while Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway is selling its stake in electric vehicle maker BYD.  Tencent has had more than $7bn worth of investments withdrawn in the second half of this year alone.  And the US is cracking down on Chinese companies listed on the American stock market. ""Some investment decisions are being postponed, and some foreign companies are seeking to expand production in other countries,"" S&P Global Ratings said in a recent note. The world is becoming accustomed to the fact that Beijing may not be as open for business as it used to be - but Mr Xi is risking the economic success that has powered China in recent decades."
investors sentiments,Can India's Adani Group recover from $100bn loss?,2024-09-15,2023-02-07,By Archana Shukla,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64495573,"India's Adani Group has seen its market value plunge after a US investment firm made fraud allegations against it. Can its ambitious growth plans survive?  Until two weeks ago, the ports-to-energy conglomerate which operates seven publicly traded companies had a combined valuation of $220bn.  But since 24 January, when short seller Hindenburg Research accused the group of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud, its valuations have nearly halved. The group's founder Gautam Adani has seen billions wiped off his personal wealth and has dropped out of the list of the world's top 20 richest people. The Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them ""malicious"" and ""baseless"" and says it plans have not changed. But investors are clearly still nervous.  On Monday, the group said in a statement that it would prepay loans worth $1.1bn, taken using shares as collateral, ahead of their maturity date next year. This, it said, was partly due to ""continued market volatility"" and to assure investors that the group's promoters would ""prepay all shares-backed financing"". The announcement led to a rally in the flagship company's stock - on Tuesday, shares of Adani Enterprises closed 15% higher on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Last week, the group also called off its secondary share sale. The 2.5bn (£2bn) it had raised was meant to pay off debt and fund projects, including airport renovation, expressway construction and an ambitious green hydrogen ecosystem. They indicate investors are losing confidence in a company. Analysts are now watching to see how the stock price slide affects the company's operations, cash flow and expansion plans. ""Most of their ambitious projects will have to be heavily scaled back in ambition and timetable, because they will have next to no capacity to raise funds right now,"" says Tim Buckley, director at Climate Energy Finance, a think-tank that works on financial issues related to transition from fossil fuel to clean energy. It could borrow money to fund projects and acquisitions - a common strategy for infrastructure companies, which helped fuel the Adani Group's rapid growth. But the group's debt has grown at a faster pace than revenues and profitability, which some fear could raise risks of a default - a concern flagged by both the Hindenburg report as well as some analysts. The group already has total debt of nearly two trillion rupees ($24bn; £20bn) - it almost doubled over the past three years as Mr Adani's ambitions extended to areas such as 5G and green hydrogen. Nearly two-thirds of Adani's debt is from overseas sources such as bonds or foreign banks, according to a report by global brokerage Jefferies. Until now, the group has mostly raised funds by using its infrastructure assets or shares as collateral. But with stock prices plunging, the value of this collateral has also dipped. The private wealth units of two big banks, Credit Suisse and Citigroup, have stopped accepting Adani bonds as collateral, Bloomberg has reported.  Many Indian banks have also loaned billions of dollars to companies linked to the group and state-owned insurance firm Life Insurance Corporation of India has invested in it. Market observers say that the Hindenburg report and the reaction to it will make lenders cautious - which means loans could become costlier. ""There is pressure on the company's credibility. It will make it extremely difficult to raise fresh loans, especially in the overseas market,"" an Indian corporate banker said on condition of anonymity as he didn't want to be seen commenting on the Adani Group. Another observer, a former banker with an international wealth fund, said that the group may be forced to delay some projects until the issue settles down. He also did not want to be named. The BBC sent a list of questions to the Adani Group. A spokesperson replied: ""All our ongoing projects continue according to the plan. Adani Group's core fundamentals remain unchanged.""  Scrutiny on the group has now increased. Investors and credit rating agencies are closely assessing its ability to raise money and repay loans. S&P Global Ratings has downgraded its outlook on two Adani companies to negative. ""New investigations and negative market sentiment may lead to increased cost of capital and reduce funding access for rated entities,"" it said.   In a video statement after the group's share sale was called off, Mr Adani had said that its balance sheet was ""healthy and assets robust"". He added that the group has an ""impeccable track record of fulfilling our debt obligations"". But credit rating agency ICRA said in a statement last week that the group's large, debt-funded capital spending programme remains a key challenge. Most of the group's capital-guzzling new businesses such as green energy, airports and roads are housed under flagship company Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) and depend on it for funds. AEL has enough cash but could come under pressure if it has to pay interest for even its subsidiaries. Some of the group's firms will be shielded from the current volatility because they own and operate strong physical assets such as ports, airports and factories. ""Adani Ports and Adani Power are the strongest and most well-capitalised [firms], which means their assets are backed by long-term government contracts. Most of the loans taken by these companies are against these revenue and profit-accruing assets,"" says the corporate banker quoted above. However, this isn't the case for some of the group's newer businesses. Companies such as Adani Gas and renewable energy arm Adani Green already have immense debt on their books and are still building up their cash flows. This could make them more vulnerable to market shocks and reduce their creditworthiness. The banker points out that while the prices of bonds issued by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd have fallen only marginally, those issued by Adani Green had lost more than a quarter of their value in three days. Deferring new projects and selling some assets to raise money could be a way out. ICRA has said that some of the planned capital spending is discretionary in nature and can be deferred, depending on how much liquidity it has. ""The company has built assets that are valuable to a developing country like India, and there will be many strategic investors interested,"" said a corporate adviser who didn't want to be named. Some analysts remain optimistic. ""I have seen varied operating [Adani] projects from ports, airports, cements to renewables which are solid, stable and generating a healthy cash flow. They are completely safe from the ups and downs of what happens in the stock market,"" says Vinayak Chatterjee, an infrastructure expert who is founder and managing trustee of the Infravision Foundation.  Analysts are also watching to see if there will be a regulatory enquiry into the group's corporate governance. The issue has also set off a political row over Mr Adani's perceived closeness to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which both deny.  On Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi from the main opposition Congress party brought up the allegations in parliament, accusing Mr Modi of helping the Adani Group - his comments caused uproar, with a federal minister accusing Mr Gandhi of levelling ""wild allegations"" without proof.    A day earlier, the party had held protests across the country, demanding an investigation into the allegations. Mr Buckley says that as pressure mounts, the Adani Group's ability to win government contracts easily to ramp up revenues will be challenged. It will also find it difficult to restore its credit credibility.  Since the group has to repay a significant amount, it will have to do a strategic asset sale, he says. "
investors sentiments,Japan's yen rises after N Korea warning,2024-09-15,2017-09-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41356777,"The yen edged up 0.3% against the dollar on Friday after North Korea suggested it might test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean. It is not unusual for Japan's currency to climb during a crisis, as investors seek a safe haven until risks ease. But this crisis is slightly different, because the additional risks could be to Japan itself.   Analysts, however, say things would have to be catastrophic for investors to flee the currency.        The yen is an extremely resilient currency, and it has risen during previous times of crisis in Japan.  It climbed 0.8% against the dollar when North Korea fired a missile over Japan in late August, and also gained during a second launch two weeks later.   After the 2011 tsunami and nuclear disaster at Fukushima, there was such a surge that the government and the G7 countries had to intervene.  So what would it take to send investors running from the yen?   ""It'd have to be a really, really extreme event. Even if there is a war, I'd expect the yen to strengthen,"" said Takuji Okubo from Japan Macro Advisors. This latest crisis is nowhere near that level.  In fact, Mr Okubo said one reason the yen is strengthening right now is that Japanese investors actually think the risk of armed conflict is very low.  Instead, they are worried about the possible impact of a trade blockade or a drop in consumer sentiment hitting sales of homes or cars. If the main risks are economic, then investors might not see much difference between this crisis and any other risk.       ""If the risk is financial and economic, you would want to increase your cash reserve and generally curtail your risk exposure,"" he said.   Other analysts think investors simply lack other good options if their main goal is to to keep their money somewhere safe until conditions improve. That includes the other traditional safe haven, the US dollar, in part because the Federal Reserve's current monetary policies might not be carried out if Janet Yellen is not reappointed as chair next year.  ""Directionless, rudderless and leaderless America is looking unattractive"" said David Kuo from the Motley Fool. ""Investors are therefore bereft of places to park their money. Switzerland is not big enough. Nor is Singapore. The eurozone is in a mess. So that just leaves Japan,"" he said."
investors sentiments,US shares set records as investor optimism grows,2024-09-15,2020-11-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55064041,"US shares hit fresh records on Tuesday with the Dow Jones index closing above 30,000 points for the first time amid hopes of a strong economic recovery and end of political uncertainty. The S&P 500 also hit an all-time high as investors bought economically sensitive financial and energy stocks. Trading was fuelled by positive Covid vaccine news and moves to start the Joe Biden presidential transition. Europe's main markets also jumped, with London's FTSE 100 closing up 1.5%. President Donald Trump has given the green light for the formal transfer of power to begin following Mr Biden's election victory. And positive news about coronavirus vaccines has boosted hopes that the US and global economies could be on the path to normality next year.  Asian markets followed Wall Street's lead, with Japan's Nikkei up nearly 2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index 1.4% higher.  Indexes in South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore have all edged higher. ""The possibility of having a vaccine next year increases the odds that we're going to see demand return in the new year,"" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at US-based Baird, said: ""If 2020 has shown us anything it is that stock markets have a tremendous ability to look past bad news if there is sun on the horizon."" Analysts say market sentiment was also helped by news suggesting Mr Biden wants former Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen as his treasury secretary. Yellen tipped as first US female treasury secretary Fed fights move to end some Covid support measures Among the big Wall Street share movers were plane-maker Boeing, up 3.3%, and oil company Chevron, 5% ahead. Investment banks Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase closed up 3.8% and 4.6% respectively. Other big gainers included Disney, American Express and IBM. A rise in Tesla shares took the electric carmaker's market value above $500bn (£374bn). At the close, the Dow Jones was up 1.54% at 30,046.2, while the S&P 500 gained 1.62% to 3,635.4. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose 1.3%, to 12,036.7. Oil prices also rose, with US crude up 4.25% to $44.89 a barrel and Brent up 4% at $47.89. The gold price, a favoured asset when investors are fearful, fell 1.6% to $1,806 an ounce. But the bullish sentiment comes despite US coronavirus cases surging and millions of Americans still unemployed, and some analysts fear shares are due a reality check. Rising Covid-19 cases and delayed economic stimulus measures are red flags, said James McDonald, chief executive of Hercules Investments. But it is not just in the US where shares are surging. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.91%, while the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.44%, putting it on track to close at a record high."
investors sentiments,UK tech talent shortage threatens to stifle growth,2024-09-15,2022-07-15,By Shiona McCallum,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-62098767,"The UK technology sector has a talent shortage which could ""stifle growth"", an industry body has warned. Liz Scott, from TechNation, said it was ""a real issue"" which must be rectified.  There were more than two million UK job vacancies in tech last year, more than any other labour area, but an industry coalition says nearly 12 million workers lack essential digital skills.  The government told the BBC it was working very closely with industry on digital skills training.  However, schemes like boot camps, apprenticeships and degree apprenticeships do not seem to be enough to address the gap.  Michelle Donelan, former education minister, said: ""Employers both large and small are crying out for more people to be trained in digital skills.  ""An apprenticeship is a fantastic way to achieve that. Not just for young people, but also those looking to upskill."" But, according to government figures, nearly half of all apprentices across all sectors, not only in tech, dropped out last year.  Data cited in the latest UK jobs report from professional services network KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation showed candidate numbers for job vacancies has been falling. The report said this is because of: One place which is teaching young people important tech subjects is ADA, the National College for Digital Skills, in London.  It encourages students towards core Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and mathematics - that form the backbone of the industry. Principal Tina Gotschi said: ""A lot of the jobs that these students will do in the future don't even exist at this point - a lot of those will be digital jobs.  ""The college was initially founded to address the skills gap, but unfortunately over time, it is just getting greater.  ""The pipeline of students coming through is shrinking and there is a lack of computer science teachers too."" There is a financial incentive to getting digital skills. According to TechNation, tech salaries are nearly 80% higher, on average, than salaries for non-tech jobs in the UK.  The average tech salary is £62,000, which is more than double the average household income in the UK.  Ronan Harris, managing director of Google (UK and Ireland) told the BBC that big tech companies are trying to play a part in providing people with qualifications. ""We've trained over 800,000 people in the UK in a range of digital skills,"" he said. ""We want people to be excited about technology. But increasingly, what we're seeing is all jobs that are being advertised have some form of digital requirement to them.""  It's a sentiment with which Ben Francis, founder of online clothing apparel company Gymshark, agrees. ""The historical view of someone that works in tech, he's probably, you know, a bit more of like a geeky sort of person.  ""But I think the more unconventional view of techies is that tech is a creative outlet.""  Gymshark is a UK tech start-up success story. The company achieved unicorn status in 2020, meaning it is valued at $1bn (£848m) or higher. ""If you're a great graphic designer, if you're a great web designer, if you want to create great apps or NFTs - all of that is done through tech and understanding of tech,"" said the entrepreneur. James Hallahan, director at recruitment company Hays, said: ""Due to the increase in digital transformation over the past few years - the demand for tech talent shows no signs of slowing down."" He added that roles with skill shortages included software developers, data scientists, data analysts, enterprise architects and programme and project managers. However, a sizeable chunk of the British workforce is nowhere near skilled enough to apply for positions like those, according to industry coalition FutureDotNow. It says that some 11.8 million workers lack basic digital skills - let alone more complex ones. However, Ms Scott says: ""There are good jobs available here. We just need people to understand that they're available and then know how to access them and know where to get the right signpost in for retraining or reskilling courses."" Where people live may also be becoming less of a barrier. Over the last decade, UK companies like Deliveroo, Darktrace and Depop have been started, funded and scaled by driven entrepreneurs and investors.  Fintech companies are also growing, with the likes of Monzo, Starling, Marshmallow and Cazoo all achieving unicorn status.  The majority of them have had major ties to London, but that is slowly changing. Demand for tech talent is increasing across the UK with the number of professionals with the right skills expanding at a faster pace in the north of England than in London, according to information technology company Accenture.  Shaheen Sayed, its technology lead in the UK, said: ""Businesses have been bullish in investing in technology and hiring - particularly in skills such as AI, cloud and robotics. ""The pool of technology professionals is also expanding, with growth in the north [of England] outpacing growth in the south [of England], and emerging technology hubs in Edinburgh and Manchester starting to compete with the capital.""

investors sentiments,Asia markets join global stock plunge,2024-09-15,2018-02-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42956234,"Asian markets plunged on Tuesday as investors dumped stocks following the biggest US market fall for six years At one point Japan's Nikkei 225 index was down 7%, but recovered some of those losses to close 4.7% lower. London, Frankfurt and Paris all fell sharply when they opened on Tuesday with new losses of up to 3%. In the US overnight the Dow lost 4.6%. The falls follow some good years for investors. In 2017 the Dow was up 25%, helped by a resurgent economy. Strong profits and low interest rates also underpinned the positive investment climate. This global sell-off began last week after a solid US jobs report fuelled expectations that the economy's strength was such the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates faster than expected.  The softness of markets over the last few days is down to one thing. As monetary policy begins its long journey away from the trillions of pounds of stimulus pumped into the system to keep the economic ship from the rocks, shareholders are beginning to wonder how much of their investments are in companies with strong fundamentals. And how much is simply holding up an asset bubble - frothy prices led ever higher in an era of ultra low interest rates and cheap money.  Fingers are hovering over the ""sell"" button. And once investors start looking at their portfolio and selling out of the froth, automatic algorithmic trading tends to ""chase the dip"". Read more from Kamal here: Jane Sydenham, investment director at the stockbrokers Rathbones, told the BBC the falls did not appear to herald a serious change of sentiment: ""It is always a bit too early to tell, but I think these recent market falls are in the nature of a correction.  ""What we have to remember is stock markets have had a very smooth ride upwards and we've not had a fall of more than 3% for 15 months. There's been a real lack of volatility, which is very unusual."" She added that bear markets tend to happen ahead of a recession and at the moment growth forecasts were being upgraded. Erin Gibbs, portfolio manager for S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""This isn't a collapse of the economy.  ""This is concern that the economy is actually doing much better than expected and so we need to re-evaluate."" One country whose immediate economic outlook remains stagnant is Japan. The authorities there said there was little chance of interest rates being increased. The Bank of Japan's governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, ruled out the possibility of raising interest rates in the near future. He said it was ""inappropriate"" to do so with inflation still about half its 2% target. But markets in Asia typically follow the lead from the US.  Elsewhere in the region, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed down 1,649.8 points - or 5.12% - at 30,595.42 and South Korea's Kospi index gave up 2.6%. Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 lost 3.2%.  On Monday the Dow Jones Industrial Average index tumbled 1,175 points, or 4.6% to close down at 24,345.75.  The decline was the largest in percentage terms for the Dow since August 2011, when markets dropped in the aftermath of ""Black Monday"" - the day Standard & Poor's downgraded its credit rating of the US.  The drop on the Dow was closely followed by the wider S&P 500 stock index, down 4.1% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq, which lost 3.7%.  The White House moved to reassure investors saying it was focused on ""long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong"". Analysts say that in the short term, investors should be prepared for choppier stock markets. Joel Prakken, chief US economist for IHS Markit, predicts share price gains will be limited over the next two years. ""The difference between this year and last year is we're going to see more periods of volatility like this as the market reacts to higher inflation,"" he said.  ""We're just not used to it because it's been so long since we've had a significant correction."" However, he added that markets would need to deteriorate more significantly for him to start to worry about the broader economy. Asian markets, on the other hand, have benefitted from record low US interest rates in the last decade because money has flowed into Asia in search of stronger returns. Analysts say the expected rate rises could impact Asia over the longer term."
investors sentiments,What's knocked markets off course?,2024-09-15,2018-12-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46515773,"Just a few months ago, US financial markets seemed headed for a third year in a row of hefty increases. But shares have tumbled since October, retreating to lower levels than at the start of the year.  That decline continued on Friday, as weak economic data in Europe and China sparked a late afternoon sell-off, sending all three major US share indexes lower. The Nasdaq dropped almost 2.3%, the Dow fell 2% and the S&P 500 sank 1.9%. For those invested in US stocks, the double-digit gains in seven of the last 10 years may still feel pretty good. But as Wall Street debate turns to just when a recession might begin, many investors are bracing for a rough patch.  What's behind the shift in sentiment? At their peaks this year, the Dow and S&P 500 were up about 8% since the start of 2018. The Nasdaq had increased 15%. But the stock market surge was always a bit suspect. It outpaced other economic measures by a large margin and was driven by the tech sector, which accounted for roughly half of the gains on the S&P 500 up until mid-August of this year. Now some of the biggest winners - such as Apple and Facebook - have stumbled, dragging down the markets and making the weakness elsewhere more visible. All three indexes are off 10% from their earlier peaks - a decline often considered a correction. Until tech recovers, a broader market bounce is unlikely, said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. ""Looking to 2019, volatility is likely to represent the norm rather than the exception,"" he says. ""By many measures, the degree of investment difficulty is on the rise.""  US central bankers have been raising interest rates since 2015, moving away from the unusually low rates put in place during the financial crisis as economic growth rebounds. Analysts are worried about how much more expensive borrowing might get - and whether companies and households will be able to handle the increased costs. Fears have been tempered recently by signals from the US Fed suggesting it may enact fewer rates rises in 2019 than previously expected. But some still worry about the risks from corporate debt levels, which have hit historic highs - with an increasing percentage of the loans made to companies with already large debt loads. US growth is expected to slow to 2.5% in 2019, down from about 3% this year, according to the IMF and Federal Reserve. Some closely watched industries and financial indicators are already flashing warning signs of a more serious contraction. In October, sales of existing homes had fallen more than 5% compared to 2017. Construction spending has started to slip and growth in consumer spending been less robust than expected. Meanwhile, business optimism is in retreat. Indeed, nearly half of US financial officers believe the nation's economy will enter a recession by the end of 2019, a recent Duke University survey found. Investors loved US President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts. But his trade policy has them tied up in knots. In March, Mr Trump ordered tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium, as well as on billions of dollars worth in annual trade from China. He's threatened more, including on foreign cars. The tariffs have already raised costs for US companies - and economists warn they threaten to slow growth, adding to recession worries. Markets aren't sure about White House strategy, and an ongoing investigation of Mr Trump's election campaign ties to Russia has only added to uncertainty emanating from Washington. ""If these investigations produce some sort of smoking gun that throws us into a constitutional crisis, that might prove destabilising,"" says Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities. The IMF expects the global economy to expand 3.7% in 2019, but the growth has become more uneven. The US Federal Reserve recently flagged issues in Europe, China and emerging markets as some of the biggest threats to the American economy, with Brexit high on the list. Indeed, as much as US indexes are down, financial markets elsewhere have dropped even farther.  The Global Dow is down around nearly 9% so far this year, and the MSCI world index is down about 8%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index has fallen about 6%; Hong Kong's Hang Seng index is about 13% lower in 2018. The Shanghai Composite has dropped more than 20%. The Stoxx Europe 600 is off almost 11%. France's CAC 40 has dropped almost 9%, London's FTSE 100 has declined nearly 11%. and Germany's DAX is down more than 15%. So stormy seas likely lie ahead."
investors sentiments,Will Argentine and Turkish crises spread?,2024-09-15,2018-09-06,By Ana Nicolaci da Costa ,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45191872,"Economic crises in Turkey and Argentina have led to talk of ""contagion"" - the danger of financial problems in one country spilling over into others. Turkey has struggled with a falling currency and worsening relations with the US. A spiralling crisis in Argentina prompted the government to announce austerity measures and to ask the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an early release of a $50bn loan. The sharp falls in the value of Turkey's lira and Argentina's peso have led to fears that currencies from South Africa to Russia will follow suit. In Asia, India's rupee and Indonesia's rupiah have already been hit. So should Asian economies be concerned? Put simply, contagion is a self-fulfilling process, whereby economic problems in one country prompt investors to sell assets in economies with similar risks. In a globalised world, a crisis in one country can also quickly spread to others through trade links or lending by banks.  That is why a downturn in Turkey or Argentina matters abroad -  beyond making holidays there cheaper. Trade is the obvious way for trouble in one country to affect another.  When an economy begins to falter, companies tend to cut production and then jobs. As a result, consumers have less money to spend on goods, including imports. This is bad news for global businesses that export a lot of goods to the country.    If a crisis also causes a country's currency to weaken, the cost of imports rise, further hurting demand. However, Joseph Gagnon at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, says Asia has ""very low trade links"" with Argentina and Turkey, ""so that is not much of a worry"". Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist for IHS Markit, also says trade with Turkey is an unlikely channel of contagion for Asia, since the region relies more heavily on big economies such as China, Europe and the US for their exports. ""The more significant concern for Apac [Asia Pacific] nations would be if the Turkish economic crisis results in contagion to emerging markets currencies and equities, which could potentially trigger significant capital outflows from emerging markets,"" he said. The phrase ""emerging markets"" refers to developing countries in Africa, Latin America or Asia, while major economies such as the US, the UK and Japan tend to have higher living standards and more developed financial systems. During an economic crisis, investors tend to sell riskier assets, such as emerging market currencies or stocks, and hold on to safer ones, such as the US dollar or government bonds issued by major economies.  Julian Evans-Pritchard, a senior China economist at Capital Economics, says countries that rely on money from overseas and have foreign inflows of cash into their stock and bond markets are particularly at risk of contagion. ""The risk is that when sentiment turns more negative, foreign investors start to pull out those funds, which has an impact on the exchange rate,"" he said. ""For countries that borrowed a lot in foreign currency, usually in US dollars, this can make it difficult for them to repay their foreign currency denominated debt. That's what happened in 1997 during the Asian financial crisis, for example."" In Asia, both India and Indonesia rely heavily on foreign capital inflows, which is why their currencies have suffered in particular. India, an oil importing country, has seen its import bill rise along with higher oil prices and this has caused its current account deficit to widen, said Mr Biswas of IHS Markit. A country that runs a current account deficit may rely on inflows of foreign money to finance spending and investments. Indonesia, meanwhile, has low foreign exchange reserves and a high level of foreign ownership in the local equity and bond markets, Mr Biswas added.  This makes it particularly vulnerable to investors pulling their money out of the country. Another way contagion can spread is when banks in one country own assets in another country which is in trouble. The economic problems can cause the value of these assets to fall. When that happens, investors worry how a bank will cope with the falling value of the assets, and how this will affect its ability to lend money to consumers and other borrowers. Such concerns weighed on European bank shares recently, with investors worried about how much Turkish assets they own. The Financial Times reported that a wing of the European Central Bank was concerned about the exposure of some of the eurozone's biggest lenders to Turkey. The report said Spain's BBVA, Italy's UniCredit and France's BNP Paribas, all of which have significant operations in Turkey, were particularly exposed. Spain's banks are the most exposed to Turkey, according to IHS Markit, citing data from the Bank for International Settlements. They have about €81bn of exposure to Turkish assets, and French banks have exposure to about €35bn. But IHS Markit's Mr Biswas said Asian banks' exposure to Turkey was limited. ""In the big picture of the banking sectors of the Asian countries, this would not be a serious negative factor in their outlook,"" he said."
investors sentiments,What next for Hull UK City of Culture?,2024-09-15,2017-12-31,By Pritti Mistry,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-humber-42338276,"When Hull was announced as the UK's City of Culture for 2017, it triggered a wave of jibes about its cultural and socio-economic credentials. As the year draws to a close can the city build on its ""one Hull of a year"" and have the last laugh? Hull is a city out on a limb, sandwiched between the end of a motorway and the North Sea. Until this year it was not generally thought of as a beacon of the arts, or as a tourist destination. Flick through the pages of the Lonely Planet's 2003 edition guidebook on Great Britain and you will find descriptions such as ""a gruff no-nonsense feel"" and ""lacking in overt charm"". But the latest edition strikes a different note, applauding new attractions such as The Ferens Art Gallery, the historic Old Town district and The Deep aquarium. ""Hull's image has definitely changed,"" said David Else, travel writer for the tourism tome. ""While Hull isn't quite topping 'must-visit' lists for England just yet, it's definitely seen an increased profile and offers more to visitors than it did a decade ago."" Among those impressed by the city are American brothers Marko and Alex Ayling. Known online as the Vagabrothers, the travel vloggers made a video about Hull for their YouTube channel, which has nearly 500,000 subscribers. Alex confesses the pair had not previously heard of the city until they were invited by the Visit Britain tourism board. Unexpectedly, Marko compares Hull's transformation to the Spanish city of Bilbao - where Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum kick-started a cultural renaissance - and said it had a similar reputation and industrial aesthetic. ""We didn't have any pre-conceptions when we visited,"" Alex added. ""It wasn't, like, a bad place to visit. When we published the video there were a lot of comments like 'why would you visit Hull?' and I think as a traveller and a visitor we had a really fun time."" In front of Hull Minster, a series of City of Culture robotic installations aptly titled 'Where Do We Go From Here?' stand proud. It is one of 2,000 or so events and activities that has drawn 3.5m visitors to the port this year. Across the road, 25-year-old Georgia Allenby sips on her coffee in the cafe next to the 15-bed apartment Hideout Hotel she opened back in August. She says it has since been fully booked nearly every weekend. ""We've seen a massive increase in footfall just around the Old Town.  ""When we first acquired the property you'd maybe get a few people wander past each day but now there's a few each minute really."" Ms Allenby believes too much has happened in the last year for its success to come to an abrupt halt. ""It's going to carry on, it's not going to be a culture hangover next year. What City of Culture has done is get people here. ""People have been staying one night, maybe two nights here and all of them are saying 'that's not long enough' and 'damn, I wish I could stay longer, I need to come back'.  ""So I think we will get repeat visitors coming back again and again in the future years."" Echoing her enthusiasm is 58-year-old Jayne Yates, store manager of Yorkshire Linen. ""It's been amazing. Footfall has increased. We've had visitors from out of town who've come to see the events and shopped and then decided to come back shopping again, which I think is absolutely fantastic for Hull."" She added: ""I've been the manager for Yorkshire Linen here for 17 years and this is the first year that we've had to take on any extra staff for the Christmas period, so I think that says it all, that we are getting more people through the door."" But not every business in Hull shares the same sentiment.  Standing opposite an empty department store in the heart of Hull's shopping area is 40-year-old independent retailer, Brookes Menswear. It faces the former BHS building emblazoned with ""Welcome to Hull UK City of Culture 2017"". Shift your eyes ground-level and your sight is met with rough sleepers in the doorway. Mark Harris, who took over Brookes 14 years ago, said the celebrations had not brought him any extra custom as many of the events were in the evenings and in a different area of the city. He added: ""When the [Weeping Window] Poppies were here - they were located in our area - them months were pretty good. ""But most of the events are on the other side of town - the Fruit market area - and that's quite a distance from us, as a retailer.  ""I think the people who's made money this year from the City of Culture are the food retailers and the hoteliers."" He is holding on to the hope the city council will deliver on its proposal to improve the neighbouring Albion Square and Bond Street areas. The council's ""£250m legacy plan"" also includes the regeneration of a dock, refurbishment of the city's Maritime attractions and the continuation of the Culture Company to programme arts and cultural events. And it is that key word - 'legacy' - which is on every official's lips. Londonderry, in Northern Ireland, was the first UK City of Culture in 2013. Oonagh McGillion, director of legacy at Derry City & Strabane District Council, said the award brought in new tourism jobs and money from visitors. ""You can tangibly see it in the streets,"" she said. ""You can see more visitors, you can see more spend in the shops as a result of those increased visitors and you can see a private sector, which is much much more interested in investing in the city and investing in our key regeneration sites."" Dominic Gibbons, managing director of Hull-based property developers Wykeland Group, said: ""What's been fantastic is the level of collaboration. There's a feeling of 'one Hull', where you'll find cultural companies talking to private businesses, private businesses talking more to councils and the health services etc.  ""There's more discussion between the different sectors, which can drive the city forward. ""I think the biggest part of the legacy that's been left by this year is probably being a more collaborative city, which I think is paramount to the future growth of the economy."" However, one economist thinks differently.  Paul Swinney, from think tank Centre for Cities, says while big cultural activities are ""great for boosting civic pride"" they ""don't and won't change the economy"" in the long term. ""If we're thinking of this [City of Culture] being a tool to try improve the economies of places that aren't doing very well then actually that's not really what it's meant to do and it's not really designed to try and achieve that sort of thing. ""I'm sure hoteliers and restaurateurs will definitely have had a positive impact. But what we have to think about in terms of the challenges facing cities like Hull is what are the barriers that are preventing businesses coming in to invest, particularly higher-skilled type businesses? ""And I think the key challenge there is skills."" When Liverpool became European Capital of Culture in 2008, visitor figures increased by 34% generating £754m for the local economy, which has ""grown from £2bn to £4bn in the eight years after"", said Phil Redmond, chairman of the UK City of Culture panel and the Institute of Cultural Capital. The Grange Hill, Brookside and Hollyoaks creator led Liverpool's Culture year and initiated the UK City of Culture scheme on the back of Liverpool's success.  He believes putting on ""big ticket, high exposure"" events regularly will boost tourism and in turn, the economy. ""Culture is the sum of everything we do. Culture is the sum of all our creativity. Culture lays the foundations to build the tourism industry. ""If you put on a big event, if you put on a big attraction, you bring in hundreds of thousands of people into the city and it's the hundreds and thousands of people who bring the cash and cash is the real fuel of regeneration."" But when the City of Culture curtain finally comes down, will the light shows, giant artworks and star-studded festivals be a catalyst for permanent change? "
investors sentiments,India's online game tax could kill a booming industry,2024-09-15,2023-07-13,By Nikhil Inamdar and Meryl Sebastian,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66161596,"The Indian government's decision to impose a 28% tax on online gaming poses an ""existential threat"" to the booming industry and could spell its death knell, say experts.  Shares of Indian online gaming platforms and casinos have crashed following the GST (Goods and Services Tax) Council's decision.  The country's 900+ gaming start-ups had been paying a small tax on the fee they charged for offering games. But the imposition of a 28% GST on the full face value of a gaming transaction will mean the entire amount collected from players will now come under the ambit of taxation. According to industry estimates, total tax collection on player winnings will go beyond 50%, including GST, platform commissions and income taxeswhen the new law is implemented.  In effect, for every $100 (£76.8) spent by a player, there will be a ""sunk cost"" of $28 towards GST, in addition to a $5-15 charge by the gaming platform and a 30% tax deducted at source (TDS) on any winnings drawn. This will ""disincentivise players and is totally inconsistent with global standards"" where VAT or GST is levied at a median rate, and that too only on platform fees or commissions, said Sudipta Bhattacharjee, partner at corporate law firm Khaitan & Co. ""The move has completely blindsided the industry. It will shake investor confidence and lead to a funding winter,"" Mr Bhattacharjee added. The online gaming industry has seen a massive boom in India over the last five years, with an annual compounded growth rate of 28-30%. Driven by easy access to affordable smart phones and cheap mobile data, the sector attracted $2.5bn in foreign direct investment, including from the likes of Tiger Global.  But these growth rates will now be called into question as the GST council's decision will impact startups at ""multiple levels"", including their user base, revenues as well as investor sentiment, according to Soham Thacker, Founder & of CEO of GamerJi - an eSports tournament company. ""Many gaming companies, in order to limit the impact on the investors side, may choose to relocate their business outside India,"" Mr Thacker added. ""They have killed the multibillion-dollar industry with a single stroke. And at the same time the decision could give a massive boost to illegal and illegitimate operators in the country,"" Gaurav Gaggar, Promoter of Poker High, a poker site, said. Terming the decision ""unconstitutional, irrational, and egregious"", the All India Gaming Federation said the government had ignored over 60 years of ""settled legal jurisprudence"" by lumping online skill gaming with gambling activities. Gambling, which is seen as a chance-based game, is illegal in many India states and is frowned upon. But most states have allowed online games which are seen as skill-based.  The industry body expects hundreds of thousands of job losses in the online gaming sector because of the latest move. Gaming startups in India currently employ 50,000 people and were expecting to create another 350,000 direct and 1,000,000 indirect jobs by 2028. Many gaming companies the BBC spoke to said there was a lack of consistency behind the ruling. ""It is very unfortunate that when the government has been supporting the industry… such a legally untenable decision has been taken,"" Roland Landers, CEO of the All India Gaming Federation said in a statement. ""It will be catastrophic for the $1tn digital economy dream of the prime minister."" Indian PM Narendra Modi has on more than one occasion praised the gaming industry as a sunrise sector that had the potential to create jobs and cater to the global market.  ""This kind of extortionist tax regime flies in the face of these steps and advocacy needs to happen at multiple levels to retract this proposal,"" said Mr Bhattacharjee. He expects the gaming industry to unite and mount a strong legal challenge if the federal and state governments go ahead and enact the amendments into their tax laws. But India's revenue secretary called the move a ""unanimous"" decision that would not be reviewed or rolled back. Announcing the decision late on Tuesday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the GST council, which comprises of federal and state finance ministers, said ""no one wanted to kill an industry"". ""But they can't be encouraged to such an extent over essential goods and services,"" she said.   The 28% tax is a ""step in the right direction"", Siddhartha Iyer, a Supreme Court lawyer who has been fighting to ban online gaming told the BBC. Mr Iyer called gaming a ""speculative activity"". ""Every week there is a story of someone killing themselves because of this [debts incurred due to online gaming],"" he said. ""Here, under the GST regime, the government has taken the view that [these games] are gambling and that is correct in my opinion because you are putting a wager on the performance of something not in your control,"" Mr Iyer added. ""We tax alcohol and cigarettes because we want to discourage people from these activities, it should be the same for this [online gaming] as well."" Others like Faisal Maqbool, a former gaming addict who lost close to 400,000 rupees ($5,000, £3,750) while playing an online card game in 2022, say even stricter measures are needed. ""This is an addiction. And it has afflicted children and teenagers. Along with higher taxes, the government needed to put in restrictions on the basis of age, income etc. I vouch for a total ban on these activities,"" Mr Maqbool told the BBC."
investors sentiments,Hong Kong stocks sink as violent protests continue,2024-09-15,2019-11-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50400073,"Hong Kong stocks have fallen again as another day of anti-government protests cast a shadow over the city and rattled investors. The Hang Seng index lost 2.2%, outpacing falls across Asia, continuing a downward path since Monday. It comes amid more clashes between protesters and police, and the partial closure of the transport network. Unrest has gripped the Asian financial hub for nearly five months, knocking the economy and business confidence. This week has seen a marked escalation in violence with intense street battles, violent clashes at universities and flashmob lunchtime protests in the financial heart of Hong Kong. ""The situation in Hong Kong has taken a decidedly dark turn this week with the violence and economic disruption seemingly gathering pace,"" Oanda analyst Jeff Halley said.  He said worries about intervention by Beijing have ""ratcheted materially higher"" keeping Asian markets ""cautious at best"". The protests have dealt a blow to the local economy and Hong Kong recently tipped into recession. Tourism and retail businesses have been among those hardest hit as travellers stay away.  ""Social unrest, coupled with uncertainty from the US-China trade tensions, have dampened overall business sentiment in Hong Kong,"" IHS Markit analyst Maojun Ye said.  At the Chinese University of Hong Kong police fired tear gas and rubber bullets as protesters started fires and threw petrol bombs. Fresh lunchtime protests in the financial district saw crowds gather to chant slogans. Some black-clad protesters also vandalised a branch of the mainland Bank of Communications. Hong Kong is part of China, but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights. The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would erode the city's freedoms. The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continued and now call for full democracy and an inquiry into police behaviour. Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent and in October the city banned all face masks."
investors sentiments,World's most profitable company to go public,2024-09-15,2019-11-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50070823,"Saudi Aramco has confirmed it is planning to list on the Riyadh stock exchange, in what could be the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO). The state-owned oil giant will determine the IPO launch price after registering interest from investors. Business sources say the Saudis are expected to make shares available for 1% or 2% of the firm, and the offer will be for existing company shares. Saudi Aramco is thought to be worth about $1.2tn (£927bn). The firm said it has no current plans for a foreign share listing, saying long-discussed plans for a two-stage IPO including an offering on a foreign exchange had been put aside for now. ""For the (international) listing part, we will let you know in due course. So far it's only on Tadawul,"" Aramco chair Yasir al-Rumayyan told a media conference, referring to the Saudi stock exchange. Saudi Aramco flotation 'coming soon' Saudi Arabia denies calling off Aramco float Saudi Arabia to open up to foreign tourists Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at derivatives traders IG Group, said:  ""Investing in Aramco carries risks, of course, and not only that oil prices will struggle to move higher.  ""Political and strategic risks are high for any firm operating in the region, not least one which is an arm of the Saudi state.  Aramco also has limited control in output policy, a key part of Saudi Arabia's Opec management."" Those potential risks were highlighted in September when drone attacks hit the Abqaiq oil facility and the Khurais oil field in Saudi Arabia, both owned by Aramco. But Aramco boss Amin Nasser, who called the plans ""historic"", told a media conference after the IPO statement was published that the firm was still the most reliable oil company globally. In its launch announcement Aramco said: ""The company does not expect the impact of these attacks to have a material impact on its business, financial condition or results of operations."" Saudi Aramco traces its roots to 1933 when a deal was struck between Saudi Arabia and the Standard Oil Company of California, which later became Chevron, to survey and drill for oil, creating a new firm to do so. Between 1973 and 1980, Saudi Arabia bought the whole company. Saudi Arabia has the second-biggest oil reserves after Venezuela, according to the Energy Information Administration. It is also second in production, after the US. But it gets its prominence because it has the monopoly on all that oil in the country, and because of how cheap it is to extract. It's essentially the world's largest unquoted company; it's a massive global oil producer,"" said David Hunter, director of market studies at Schneider Electric. ""This is the absolute mother of all oil and gas companies."" Saudi Aramco is worth $1.2tn, according to analysis from financial news service Bloomberg, although Riyadh would prefer a valuation of $2tn, which is one reason the company's share sale has been delayed a number of times. Mr Beauchamp from IG Group says: ""Aramco is a world away from the tech IPOs that have been all the rage lately, but the valuation problem still haunts them like it does the firms of Silicon Valley."" He adds: ""$2 trillion probably overstates the worth of the firm in a world of high oil supply and uncertain demand, but $1.2 trillion is too low for a vital part of the Saudi state"". Once shrouded in mystery, Aramco has been transformed in the last few years as it geared up for this moment It has begun publishing financial results, holding question and answer sessions about the company and even bringing journalists to its sites following recent drone attacks. And it has hired female Westerners to some of its top jobs. The language in today's document speaks to international concerns. It describes ""long-term value creation through crude oil price cycles"" and improving sustainability ""by leveraging technology and innovation to lower our climate impact"".  Local people - even ""Saudi female divorcees"" - will be eligible to buy shares, and will receive a bonus share for every 10 they hold. Either way, it is phenomenally profitable. For the first half of 2019, it posted a net profit of $46.9bn, almost all of which was paid out in dividends to the Saudi state.  Any company that profitable will attract a high price. By comparison, for the same time period, Apple, the world's largest company by value currently, posted a net profit of $21.6bn, and Exxon Mobil, the largest listed oil company, made $5.5bn. Another aspect is the cost of production. Whereas extracting North Sea oil is expensive due to its location under hundreds of feet of water, oil in Saudi Arabia is relatively close to the surface. Saudi has many of the cheapest oil fields for extraction, with some per-barrel costs below $10, says Mr Hunter. With Brent crude at more than $60, much of the difference can be profit. Saudi Arabia is keen to sell shares in its state oil firm because it is trying to reduce its reliance on oil.  Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman wishes to diversify his country's economy in the next decade under a programme dubbed Vision 2030. The plan includes more solar power, making use of the country's vast desert, says Mr Hunter. The first Saudi CEO of the company, Ali al-Naimi, had a vision that Aramco could become a global integrated energy company.  Over his years as CEO, he expanded Aramco's assets to include downstream (refining) and other assets in the US, South Korea, China, Indonesia, Japan and Europe.   He and his successors also expanded Aramco's footprint in Saudi Arabia with joint ventures in refining and petrochemicals.  Saudi Arabia is the largest oil exporter today and is the only oil producer that maintains at least 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity that can be brought onto the market very quickly. The fact that it is a national oil company means it has exclusive access to the best and least-expensive-to-produce oil resources in the world.  This makes it hugely valuable.  But there are downsides.  Saudi Arabia's upstream assets aren't diversified like other major international oil companies upstream assets are.  It also means that the Saudi government plays a role in the company.  Historically, Saudi Arabia allowed Aramco to operate independently and did not make decisions about spending for strategy for the company. There are troubling signs that this is changing now and the government is taking a more active, and detrimental, role.  How much Aramco is really worth will be determined by the market.  Banks have put forth their valuations, but the market will show how much it is really worth. Different sources have quoted valuations ranging from $1.2 tn to $2 tn.  The most common number floated right now seems to be about $1.5 tn, perhaps $1.7 tn, though public sentiment probably indicates that this is too high a number. In 30 years, who knows how much Aramco will be worth.  We don't know what other energy technologies will develop, or not, in that time, nor what Aramco's strategic vision will produce. In September, the kingdom said it will open its doors to international tourists for the first time, launching a visa regime for 49 countries and relax strict dress codes for female visitors. Tourism Minister Ahmad al-Khateeb described it as a ""historic moment"" for the country. It wants tourism to rise from 3% to 10% of gross domestic product by 2030. The push comes as the kingdom faces a tarnished international image amid criticism of its human rights record following last year's murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and a recent crackdown on women's rights activists. Politically, matters are rather complicated for Saudi Aramco right now, in light of the recent Kashoggi scandal, said Mr Hunter. ""And the fact of Saudi Arabia's human rights record. Anything to do with Saudi Arabia is always seen through that prism."" Another wrinkle in the crown prince's plan is the surge in anti-fossil fuel sentiment around the world, plus the comparatively low oil price compared to late last year, where prices were above $80. ""The listing could be controversial because it's a massive fossil fuel listing in a time investors are becoming increasingly ethical,"" said Mr Hunter. ""There are a lot of new and existing funds looking to divest from fossil fuel assets."" In May, fellow oil producer Norway's $1tn sovereign wealth fund said it expected to sell some of its oil and gas holdings, albeit to make it less reliant on price swings in the commodity."
investors sentiments,Amazon warns of slower sales as economy weakens,2024-09-15,2022-10-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63421170,"Apple and Amazon sales are being hit by the weakening global economy, the tech giants have warned, adding to fears about their upcoming profits. Amazon shares tumbled more than 15% after the US stock market closed, as the firm forecast far weaker sales for the festive season than expected. Apple shares also slipped after warning of a slowing demand for gaming and advertising. Both cited the rising cost of living as a factor eroding consumer buying power. ""We're very optimistic about the holiday but we're realistic that there are various factors weighing on people's wallets"", Amazon's chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts on a call to discuss the results. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who remains chairman of the company, recently warned about worrying signals coming from the economy, writing on Twitter that it was time to ""batten down the hatches"". Apple, seen as one of the steadiest of the tech giants, has not been immune.  In its update on Thursday, Apple reported that sales rose by 8% to $90.1bn in the three months to September compared with the same period the year before. That was a quarterly record, albeit one dented by weaker-than-expected iPhone sales and soft growth in China. But Apple executives warned investors that they were seeing weakness in digital advertising and gaming and expecting a sharp fall in Mac computer sales. They added that a strong dollar would hit business. ""Apple's ability to sell highly priced hardware in the current environment defies all the rules,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""The key festive season is a crucial barometer for consumer sentiment, and there's a possibility Apple is going to lose some steam year-on-year when it comes to Christmas sales."" Both Apple and Amazon saw business boom during the pandemic, as more activity moved online.  But sales have softened significantly over the past year, as consumers do more of their shopping in person once again, and shift their buying habits in response to rising prices. At Amazon, overall sales in the three months to September rose 15% year-on-year to $127.1bn, but its international business shrank. Growth slowed in its lucrative cloud services unit. While Amazon sales were strong in July, they weakened in August and September, especially in Europe, said Mr Olsavsky, blaming the problems on a ""tougher recessionary environment"". Costs for items such as fuel are also rising, which is likely to hit profits, he added. ""Worrying times for Amazon, in line with other big tech,"" said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight. ""This is set to be a winter of discontent."" Executives at major tech firms, including Microsoft, Google's parent company Alphabet, and Facebook have also discussed weakness in recent financial updates. "
investors sentiments,Klarna to cut 10% of staff as it warns of recession,2024-09-15,2022-05-24,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61562651,"Buy now pay later firm Klarna has announced plans to cut around 700 staff as it warned of a ""likely recession"". The Swedish firm blamed a combination of rising prices, a change in consumer sentiment and the war in Ukraine for the move. ""What we are seeing now in the world is not temporary or short-lived, and hence we need to act,"" said chief executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski. The cuts equate to around 10% of Klarna's 7,000-strong workforce.  ""When we set our business plans for 2022 in the autumn of last year, it was a very different world than the one we are in today,"" said Mr Siemiatkowski. ""Since then, we have seen a tragic and unnecessary war in Ukraine unfold, a shift in consumer sentiment, a steep increase in inflation, a highly volatile stock market and a likely recession."" In a blog, Mr Siemiatkowski advised staff - who the company refers to ""Klarnauts"" - to ""take care of yourselves and each other"". Klarna is one of many tech companies warning that the months ahead will be difficult and taking steps to cut jobs or freeze hiring, as consumer spending weakens and ad sales slow. Social media firm Snap shares tumbled roughly 40% on Tuesday after it cut sales and profit targets set a month ago. The owner of the Snapchat messaging app said it would slow its rate of hiring after it said ""macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further and faster than anticipated"". The update prompted a wider sell-off, with shares in Facebook-owner Meta down roughly 10%, Google-owner Alphabet falling 8% and smaller firms such as Pinterest down 26%. In the UK, the central bank has warned the economy could fall into recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive quarters - after official figures revealed the economy shrank in March. Higher prices are beginning to bite into household budgets and people have started spending less and cutting down on car journeys due to high fuel costs. Soaring energy bills and food prices are also having an impact and inflation - the rate at which prices rise - jumped to 9% in April and is expected to reach more than 10% by the end of the year. Commenting on the cuts, Klarna said its affected employees in Europe will be offered ""to leave Klarna with an associated compensation"", but added outside of the continent, ""the process for impacted employees will look different depending on where you work"". Klarna staff were asked to work from home this week ""in consideration of the privacy of the people affected by these changes"". Mr Siemiatkowski said it had been ""a very tumultuous year"" so far. It contrasts with 2021 when, thanks to the shift in consumer spending to online during Covid restrictions, Klarna saw the value of the company soar to $46bn when it raised millions of dollars from investors. Since then, however, The Wall Street Journal has reported it is seeking a new round of investment and its valuation could sink by as much as $16bn to $30bn. Klarna dismissed the report as ""pure speculation"". Buy-now-pay-later providers should have a pretty good insight of consumer sentiment. After all, it is a product that has been used by 17 million people in the UK, including 30% of those aged in their 20s. No doubt Klarna has decided that those customers are likely to tighten their belts, spending less on fashion and the like as food and fuel take a bigger and bigger chunk out of their disposable incomes. But there are likely to be wider factors at play here too. Firstly, this kind of credit is facing greater scrutiny from regulators. Will shoppers think twice about clicking the Klarna box if they know that, in doing so, other potential lenders will be aware of how they are funding their purchases or they have to undergo affordability checks? Secondly, Klarna has expanded fast, but so have its losses, and those in charge need to chart a sustainable course for the business. Over its last financial year, Klarna's operating losses swelled to 6.58bn Swedish krona (£540m) from 1.62bn Swedish krona.  In its annual report, the company said losses were growing but that was ""entirely explained by Klarna's growth, expansion to new markets and massive inflow of new customers"". Danni Hewson, financial analyst for AJ Bell, said Klarna's job cuts ""might be the sensible option even if it takes a great big chunk out of the company's valuation"". ""Markets are adjusting, those sky-high market caps that some growth businesses have attained over the last couple of years are coming under considerable scrutiny and many investors are deciding they don't hold up,"" said Ms Hewson. ""Klarna's caught between a rock and hard place as it needs to keep up its expansion momentum if it's to grow revenue and start generating profits. ""It could delay fundraising, wait for a more favourable moment, but there's no telling how long that wait would be particularly when recession is looming over the global economy."" Buy-now-pay-later is now a popular payment method across many stores, especially for people in their 20s. However, one in 10 people using them already had debt arrears elsewhere, a review by the Financial Conduct Authority last year found. It has led to criticism the schemes encourage shoppers to buy more than they can afford. Earlier this month, Klarna announced it would start telling credit agencies who pays on time and who falls behind. From June, banks and credit card firms will be able to see people's Klarna habits when making credit checks."
investors sentiments,The week Facebook's value plunged $58bn,2024-09-15,2018-03-23,By Josh Martin,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43517995,"Facebook ended the week $58bn lower in value after its handling of a historic data breach. Its founder Mark Zuckerberg apologised for data breaches that affected 50 million users. The apology did not stop investors from selling shares in Facebook, with many wondering just how bad the damage would be for the social network. The breach was called a ""light bulb"" moment for users, spawning the social media trend #deletefacebook. All the negative headlines led to some advertisers saying ""enough is enough"". Shares in the social media company fell from $176.80 on Monday to around $159.30 by Friday night. Facebook's initial public offering in 2012 priced shares at $38 each, giving the company a market valuation of close to $104bn. Following steady user growth and a dominant space in the digital advertising market ensuring revenues, Facebook's share price climbed to $190 by February this year. Brian Wieser, senior analyst at Pivotal Research, said he had one of the most negative outlooks for Facebook's share price on Wall Street. ""I had a $152 price target on Facebook for 2018 - and that was before the events of this week"". Mr Wieser said the share price slump showed investors were wary of increased regulation and users leaving the platform ""but there's little risk of advertisers leaving Facebook. Where else would they go?"" Hargreaves Lansdown senior analyst Laith Khalaf said the week had been a ""damaging episode"" in Facebook's history. ""One of the secrets of Facebook's success has been that the more people who use Facebook, the more integral it becomes to its customers. Unfortunately for Facebook, the same dynamic cuts in the opposite direction if it loses a meaningful number of users as a result of this scandal. "" Advertising firm M&C Saatchi's founding director David Kershaw said the revelations that a 2014 Facebook quiz essentially harvested data from users and their connected friends without consent have led to a backlash from advertisers. ""Clients have come to the point, quite rightly, where enough is enough, "" Mr Kershaw said. Advertisers Mozilla and Commerzbank on Wednesday suspended ads on the social media platform. On Friday tech entrepreneur Elon Musk had the official Facebook pages for his companies Telsa and Space X deleted. ""Make no mistake Facebook is an amazing medium from the advertiser's point of view because of the accuracy of its targeting - which comes from data. But I think those large companies are very nervous to be associated with a medium where the data is being abused, particularly in a political context,"" Mr Kershaw said. Mr Kershaw told the BBC any change in Facebook's data protection policy was more likely to come from the threat of a withdrawal of ""hard money from advertisers rather than consumers running hashtag [campaigns] on Twitter,"" referring to the #DeleteFacebook and #BoycottFacebook hashtags that have become popular. UK advertising group ISBA met Facebook on Friday and said its ""constructive and challenging"" summit had convinced the group that the social media company was taking steps to ""rapidly address public and advertiser concerns"", including app audits and face-to-face meetings with individual UK advertising clients. It will take some time before it becomes clear if the advertising industry's dissatisfaction with Facebook leads to them actually pulling their money out of the social network, or whether the howls of condemnation amount to mere posturing from a group of concerned clients. The Facebook founder tried to reassure users ""the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago."" However, Passion Capital tech investor Eileen Burbidge, who is also on the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Group, said Facebook's reassurance to users and clients took too long. ""The fact that it took them five days to come out with a statement, which happened to be a fair, sensible and comprehensive statement, was just far too long,"" Mrs Burbidge said. ""I think they were just really tone deaf for too many days."" The technology venture capitalist said Facebook underestimated the consumer backlash that occurred once their data was used for political purposes. Cambridge Analytica is at the centre of a row over whether it used the personal data of millions of Facebook users to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum. ""Some people are using the term 'political manipulation'. ""They [Facebook] assumed they had already taken care of this... as they had already changed their terms of service, for example,"" Mrs Burbidge said. In Mr Zuckerberg's online statement he offered a timeline of how Facebook's data permission agreements with users and other companies had changed since the 2014 personality quiz app was able to scrape data from quiz takers and their contacts without their express permission. Mrs Burbidge said there may need to be new regulation over political campaigning ""which really hasn't kept up with social media"". Technology writer Kate Bevan said the week's events have woken Facebook's users up to the fact that the platform's games, quizzes and apps could harvest their data for more serious intents.  ""This week feels to me like a real light bulb moment where people are understanding that it's not just clicking 'like' on Facebook, it's giving your data away"". The sentiment was echoed by the European Union's commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality Vera Jourova who said the Cambridge Analytica allegations had been  about the demand for their data. ""The tiger has gotten out of the cage""."
investors sentiments,Start-ups with strong basics will get funds: Vinod Khosla,2024-09-15,2023-03-28,By Savita Patel,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65023054,"Indian start-ups with ""strong fundamentals"" will continue to be funded even as investor exuberance wanes, says Indian-origin Silicon Valley veteran Vinod Khosla. Mr Khosla, who co-founded technology giant Sun Microsystems in 1982, was speaking to the BBC about the likely impact of the current financial climate on the start-up ecosystem in India and globally, and the  recent problems in the banking sector.  The US Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in a bid to stabilise prices, but this has caused strains in the banking system - two US banks, including Silicon Valley Bank which lent largely to the tech sector, collapsed earlier this month. Many central banks have also announced measures to keep credit flowing through banking systems. Mr Khosla, a billionaire investor who has funded several Silicon Valley start-ups, warns, however, that company valuations on offer will be lower as the availability of capital declines. That's because inflation, higher interest rates and lower revenue growth at tech companies - after a period of robust hiring and expansion - have impacted availability of funds, changing investor sentiment. Earlier, says the 68-year-old, it was easy for a start-up ""to get a billion-dollar valuation which made no sense. I think that will moderate down"". Over the past few years, several tech companies have gone public with huge valuations in the US and other parts of the world. Vast amounts of wealth generation and near-zero interest rates had created an easy supply of venture capital. Many prominent funds poured money into India, and ""everything [valuations] got bid up, which made no economic sense"". But as the supply of capital contracts, this won't be sustainable anymore - and it could actually be positive in the long term.  ""The wheat will get separated from the chaff,"" Mr Khosla says, adding that ""not-so-good Indian start-ups will not get funded and go bust"" this year.  As a result, there will be fewer but larger start-ups. These companies could use their capital more efficiently as they won't have to compete with smaller firms, Mr Khosla says, although he adds a caveat that he is not in India ""day to day"" and hence ""doesn't know the ground reality"". Given global headwinds, investors could benefit from taking a steady, long-term approach, he says, rather than making sporadic or hype-driven impulsive investments. Mr Khosla believes that technology has driven a large part of GDP growth in the US and defined the country's global competitiveness. Now, he sees India getting the same opportunity. ""There is long-term opportunity in India as a major developing country with lots of GDP growth to be captured by start-ups,"" Mr Khosla says. He adds that these companies can also benefit from supportive government policies.  ""India Stack, UPI [Unified Payments Interface] and others are good infrastructure for the start-up ecosystem to develop on,"" Mr Khosla says, referring to India's unique digital infrastructure that aids cashless transactions across sectors. The venture firm Mr Khosla founded in 2004, Khosla Ventures, is based in Menlo Park, California, and focuses on investing in a range of areas including enterprise, semiconductors, biomedicine, big data, and robotics.  The firm was the first to invest in OpenAI, the San Francisco-headquartered Artificial Intelligence (AI) research lab whose products include the chatbot ChatGPT, which is now used by millions of people. Mr Khosla, whose firm manages over $15bn (£12bn) in assets, says that when stock markets were buoyant, new venture funds proliferated. When capital becomes easily available, investing becomes cheap; and because it's ""other people's money"" - as referred to in the investment community - speculative investments become rampant.  ""It's free money at zero interest rates and suddenly there's a lot of bets that make sense. That's the problem,"" he says. But once this ""hype phase"" peters out, venture funds that don't have access to good entrepreneurs or enjoy a reputation among them will have poor returns and will either consolidate or not get more funds. ""That's already happening; a lot of funds that got funded three years ago are not getting funded today,"" he says. Talking about the recent collapse of America's Silicon Valley Bank, Mr Khosla says he thinks that the crisis has been handled, but it raises questions about the fragility of the banking sector. The $212bn bank collapsed after its clients - including large and small tech companies and prominent venture firms - withdrew $42bn in one day, fearing for its fiscal health. A rival bank has bought its assets and loans. Mr Khosla says that the banking sector in the US and other countries is plagued by unrealised losses - which arise from assets that have decreased in value. In the current climate, this decline could can be attributed to rising interest rates.  Unless regulators handle this fundamental problem well, problems in the banking sector could escalate, affecting businesses all over the world, including the tech innovation ecosystem, he says.  But the current slump, he says, is just a natural part of a capitalistic fluctuating cycle and the technology sector will ultimately benefit from the tightening of capital as ""money will get focused on the best opportunities"". ""There will be phoenixes rising from the ashes. Really innovative ideas will get funded; they won't get the valuation they got before, but four years from now, we'll be in the middle of another hype cycle. When that happens, fewer companies will do well, they'll be much bigger and better,"" he says. And he has one prediction for the future: ""AI will be dominant everywhere.""

investors sentiments,Hong Kong shares hit lowest level since 2009,2024-09-15,2022-10-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63324124,"Shares in Hong Kong have slumped to the lowest level since the global financial crisis, after a major speech by the city's leader on Wednesday. The benchmark Hang Seng index fell by more than 3% to its lowest level since May 2009, before regaining some ground. Investors are also concerned about the threat of a global economic slowdown as central banks around the world raise interest rates to tackle rising prices. One financial expert told the BBC that the ""panic selling is ridiculous"". In his first policy address yesterday, Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee announced measures to boost security and plans to attract more overseas talent to the territory. However, he did not elaborate on economic targets for the city, which has lost ground to rival Asian financial centres like Singapore. Hong Kong's economy is currently in a technical recession, after seeing two three-month periods in a row of contraction this year. Until recently the city had some of the world's toughest coronavirus rules as it followed China's zero Covid policies. ""The Hang Seng has hit a 13-year low and nothing is really helping the fragile sentiment,"" Dickie Wong, executive director of Kingston Securities said. ""There's also a sense that tax rebates are not enough to draw foreigners back to Hong Kong,"" he added. Traders were also concerned about the Hong Kong government's ""unprecedented silence on key economic indicators,"" Kelvin Tay, regional chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management said. However, Mr Tay added that investors were mostly concerned about ""the economic outlook [of China] and a rise of Covid cases in the middle of the party congress in Beijing"". More than 2,000 delegates have gathered this week in Beijing to elect leaders and debate key policies at the Communist Party congress. On Sunday, President Xi Jinping is expected to be confirmed for a historic third term as party chief. Other stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region were also lower on Thursday, with benchmark share indexes in Japan, South Korea and Australia losing ground. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen weakened to a fresh 32-year low of more than 150 to the US dollar. That triggered further speculation that Japanese authorities will attempt to prop up the currency for the second time in the space of just a few weeks."
investors sentiments,Investors seize on positive news but rally fades,2024-09-15,2020-04-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52200851,"A global rally on financial markets faded as US shares shed gains despite hopes that the spread of coronavirus in some hotspots may be easing. The Dow Jones and the S&P 500 dipped 0.1%, while the Nasdaq fell 0.3%, dropping back from earlier increases and a 7% surge on Monday. In London, Paris and Frankfurt stocks had closed more than 2% higher, while earlier Asian markets also gained. A drop in oil prices contributed to the afternoon slide. However, Tuesday's declines were modest compared to the dramatic swings in recent weeks, reflecting signs of renewed investor optimism for many companies - including travel companies and retailers, which had seen shares plunge as governments impose lockdown measures. In the US, department store Kohl's jumped 20%, while Royal Caribbean Cruises climbed more than 13%. In the UK, Easyjet rose more than 15%, while British Airways' owner IAG increased 7%.  The FTSE 250, considered to be more representative of the UK economy, finished more than 5% higher. Investor sentiment was buoyed by news that the death toll in Spain, which has been badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic, had fallen for a fourth consecutive day, in a sign that the country may have passed its peak.  There was also a slowdown of new infections in Italy, which has also been ravaged by the virus. News that some countries, including Austria and Denmark, have made small steps to relax their lockdowns, also helped sentiment. But New York, which had earlier seen signs its outbreak might be easing, reported a large jump in Covid-19 deaths. ""Investors are reacting to indications that lockdown measures in the UK, US and Europe are beginning to 'flatten the curve' of coronavirus infections and fatalities,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. However, he added: ""The market's relief is only likely to last so long, and attention will soon turn to how countries intend to exit the current containment measures which have in effect hit the pause button on the global economy."" Despite gains on Monday and Tuesday, the FTSE 100 is still down by 25% compared to its highest level in January, before the pandemic led to lockdowns across Europe and the US. Adding to the positive financial news were further measures to support economies, including a trillion-dollar package in Japan and central bank moves in China. And with the ink barely dry on a $2 trillion rescue plan passed by Congress last month, Donald Trump said he favoured another massive spending programme, this time targeting infrastructure projects. There are also reports that European Union leaders are close to a rescue package for countries worst hit by the pandemic."
investors sentiments,Hong Kong stock market takes a tumble on reopen,2024-09-15,2020-01-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51278558,"Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock market index fell 3% when it re-opened on Wednesday as investors feared the economic impact of the coronavirus. Almost all of the 50 Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies that make up the Hang Seng Index were in the red. Travel and casino operators were hit the hardest as traders assess the economic impact of the deadly virus. Coronavirus has already claimed more than 130 lives with more than 9,000 suspected cases. China's main stock markets, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, will only reopen on 3 February after Chinese authorities extended the Lunar New Year break by three days. Other stock markets around Asia saw more upbeat trading having already taken a hit from negative investor sentiment earlier in the week. One of the biggest fallers on the Hang Seng Index was Sands China which fell by up to 6%. The firm is a subsidiary of Las Vegas Sands and has a casino in Macau, a popular destination for mainland Chinese tourists. Since Friday, the numbers of visitors to Macau has dropped 69% according to official figures, leaving it as a near-ghost town during what is typically the busiest time of year. The Hang Seng ended the day 2.8% lower. The economic fallout from the coronavirus is not just reserved to stock markets. Businesses are also being affected as companies remain closed until at least 9 February following orders from Beijing. Airlines, hotel operators and casinos were the first to be affected as Chinese travellers stayed at home over the normally-busy festive period. The impact is now being felt across the Chinese economy from manufacturing through to retailers. Foreign firms are also worried about the effects on their Chinese operations. Starbucks has announced that it is temporarily closing around 2,000 stores in China to protect staff and help contain the virus. McDonald's is also closing restaurants in five Chinese cities and introducing new health protocols."
investors sentiments,Turkey: Could the US damage its economy?,2024-09-15,2019-01-16,By Reality Check,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-46866661,"President Trump has said the US will ""devastate Turkey economically"" if Ankara decides to attack Kurdish groups in Syria. Mr Trump was referring to his plan to pull US forces out of Syria, where they have been fighting alongside a Kurdish militia against the group calling itself Islamic State (IS). Turkey regards the Kurdish group as terrorists. The US president's comments drew a sharp response from Turkey, which said Mr Trump would not get anywhere by threatening the country economically. After Mr Trump's tweet, the Turkish lira dropped in value against the US dollar. It then recovered its value, suggesting that his remarks had limited impact. So how could the US damage Turkey economically - if it wanted to? The relationship between Washington and Ankara has historically been close - politically, economically and militarily. Turkey - a Nato member - is a vital partner for the US but there have been significant strains in the partnership. These came out into the open last August, when the US slapped sanctions on Turkey over the continued detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson. It marked a new low in relations and was a further blow to an already fragile economy. The US also doubled tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium that month, leading to further falls in the value of the Turkish lira - some 40% since the beginning of 2018. Turkey responded in kind, raising tariffs on cars from the US to 120%, on alcoholic drinks to 140% and on leaf tobacco to 60%. In fact, only 5% of Turkish exports head to the US and Turkey imports only slightly more from there. Turkey's trading relationships with China, Russia and Germany are more important.  But even though overall trade with US is not as large, there are key vulnerable sectors: air transport, iron and steel and machinery - and this is where the US has chosen to target previous sanctions. Turkey has historically had a deficit in international trade, in that it imports more from the rest of the world than it exports. However, the trade gap did narrow considerably in 2018 on the back of the weakness of the lira, which made Turkey's exports more competitive and imports more expensive. Turkey may be vulnerable over its high levels of debt. As of the end of September 2018, its external debt amounted to over 50% of its gross domestic product (GDP) - the value of all the goods and services it produces in a year - according to official figures. ""This is Turkey's Achilles heel,"" says York University economist Gulcin Ozkan.  ""It puts the country at the mercy of international investors and makes it vulnerable to exchange rate movements."" There are two features of Turkey's foreign debt increase that are concerning. It has a relatively high level of short-term debt, which is due for repayment in the near future. That means having a greater reliance on external finance. In addition, most of its overall debt is in foreign currencies such as the US dollar and the euro. So, the debt becomes more expensive as the Turkish currency loses value and other currencies - such as the US dollar - strengthen. In fact, the lira had been struggling for most of last year, recording its worst decline since 2001. This currency weakness also aggravates Turkey's persistent inflation problem, which at one point in 2018 peaked at over 25%.   It's important to point out that the Turkish economy has been growing strongly for most of the period since 2001. But confidence in Turkey was beginning to wane last year over concerns that the economy was overheating due to huge spending and borrowing. In addition, the Turkish government has taken away some power from the central bank, leading investors to worry about the direction of fiscal policy. So any fallout with the US could further sour the financial markets' view of the health of the Turkish economy. ""This could lead to a decline in capital inflows and impact the value of the Turkish currency,"" says economist Gulcin Ozkan. But given the importance of the political and strategic relationship with Turkey, which shares borders with Syria, Iraq and Iran, the US may want to tread carefully. Turkey is the biggest recipient of US defence equipment after Israel and the UAE and the vast majority of its air force is US supplied. It also hosts US and Nato forces at its Incirlik airbase, in the south of the country. So Turkey may be economically vulnerable but politically and strategically it remains very important.

investors sentiments,Price rises could hit highest rate in 30 years,2024-09-15,2021-10-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59062392,"The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the government's forecaster has warned. Its latest forecast says inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% in 2022. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says figures released since its report was compiled suggest inflation could hit almost 5%. The chancellor acknowledged that household budgets are strained. Rishi Sunak described the overall economic picture as ""strong"" in the short term, with the OBR now expecting the economy to return to its pre-pandemic level six months earlier than it had forecast previously. However, he acknowledged the inflation rate was ""likely to rise further"" from its 3.1% rate in September. He said it was due to increased demand for energy and supply chain issues as economies and factories reopening following coronavirus lockdowns. ""The pressures caused by supply chains and energy prices will take months to ease,"" Mr Sunak said. ""It would be irresponsible for anyone to pretend that we can solve this overnight."" The UK's exit from the European Union (EU) has exacerbated supply chain problems such at hold-ups at ports or with deliveries, the OBR said in its latest report. The OBR also said the fact that the energy price cap has risen was a big factor behind the rising cost of living. The cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The independent forecaster suggested that had its figures been more up-to-date, its inflation forecasts would have painted a more bleak picture for consumers and businesses.  It previously said it had ended any updates to its forecast on 24 September, earlier than usual, and ""in response to a request from the chancellor"". Richard Hughes, chairman of the OBR, told BBC News that if inflation started feeding into wages, rather than just products in the shops, the problem could persist for longer. But the OBR lifted its prediction for economic growth in 2021 to 6.5%, up from its previous forecast of 4%. It has also reduced its estimate of the long-term ""scarring"" effect of Covid-19 on the economy from 3% to 2%. The effectiveness of Covid vaccines and the adaptability of consumers and businesses had sped up the recovery, the OBR said. But it forecast that economic growth would be lower next year than it previously thought, partly down to a better performance in 2021. In 2022, gross domestic product (GDP), which measures all the activity of companies, governments and people in an economy, will increase by 6%, the OBR said, rather than the 7.3% it predicted in March. Growth is forecast to be 2.1% in 2023, 1.3% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025. While the economy is in a stronger state than had been expected, whether in terms of growth, employment or the public finances - the official analysis makes clear the obstacle inflation poses to standards of living in the coming months.  The OBR reckons inflation will hit 4.4.%; it warns it may go as high as 5%. And, it makes clear that leaving the EU has heightened the UK's experience of the bottlenecks that are bumping up business costs, that in turn will lead to higher prices.   That higher cost of living, together with looming tax rises will dampen the effect of wage rises over the next couple of years.  Strip out inflation and the OBR reckons that household income after tax will only recover to pre-pandemic levels in mid-2023. And those lost years of prosperity increases could weigh on growth - and sentiment in the run up to the next election. Higher inflation is also likely to put pressure on how much the chancellor is able to spend in the future. But Mr Sunak has been offered some room for manoeuvre, as the improving economic picture and higher tax incomes means the government will not have to borrow as much. Borrowing hit a record £319.9bn during the 2020 financial year as the government poured money into pandemic support schemes such as furlough. It is now forecast to fall every year between 2021 and 2026.  Jane Mackay, head of tax at audit, tax, advisory and risk firm Crowe, said there was still a ""huge"" Covid bill to deal with, though. ""The Budget statement hasn't really given us clarity on who will pay that bill.  ""The tax increases that were announced before the Budget, including corporation tax rising to 25%, and the NHS and social care levy additional NICs of 1.25%, might suggest the strategy will spread the burden as widely as possible, rather than to make the structural changes to our tax system that may be what is really needed."" A risk of rising inflation as well is that it will increase the amount of interest the government needs to pay back on what it has borrowed for pandemic spending. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned in September that it ""will have to act"" over rising inflation. The Bank has already said UK inflation is set to exceed 4%, before falling back as the economy recovers from Covid. The UK's central bank can raise interest rates in an attempt to tackle inflation if prices are rising quickly. In theory, when borrowing costs rise - which would make loans such as mortgages more expensive - people spend less and prices are driven down. Mr Sunak said on Wednesday that he had written to the Bank to ""reaffirm their remit to achieve low and stable inflation"".  Investors are expecting interest rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022, in an effort to bring inflation back down to the Bank's 2% target. However, he gave no suggestion of when the Bank might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%. The governor said that rising energy bills could push inflation higher for longer than previously thought."
investors sentiments,Celebrations as Swansea turns 50,2024-09-15,2019-07-02,By Neil Prior,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-48841868,"Fifty years ago, the place once dubbed ""ugly, lovely town"" became the city of Swansea. On 3 July 1969, Prince Charles stood on the steps of Swansea Guildhall to confirm its new status.  Coming just two days after his investiture as Prince of Wales, the visit was part of a celebratory tour of the nation. The announcement was the culmination of almost a millennium of Swansea's clamour for recognition. Cultural historian Prof Peter Stead, who was part of the thousands-strong crowd who gathered to greet the prince, said the proclamation had been a well-kept secret. ""Singleton Park had been opened up to allow people to watch the procession to the Guildhall, but at that stage we didn't know it was anything but a normal royal visit. ""Nowadays there would almost certainly have been a leak on social media or something, but as the news filtered back through the crowd we were dumbstruck, the young prince had really pulled a rabbit out of the hat.""   Though perhaps Prof Stead should not have been so surprised. Swansea first petitioned for a town charter from William de Newburgh, Lord of Gower, in the 12th Century.  This was backed up by a more binding royal charter, granted by King John in 1215. Swansea began campaigning to be recognised as Wales' first city in the early 19th Century as it grew into the ""Copperopolis"" which smelted a third of the world's copper, with a larger economic output and greater population than Cardiff at the time. However, the first unsuccessful bid for city status did not come until 1911, by which time metallurgy in Swansea was already in decline and coal had made Cardiff king. It would take another 58 years for Swansea to achieve its goal - city status finally being granted in recognition of efforts to regenerate after the devastation of the Three Day Blitz. But Prof Stead believes Swansea has not always taken full advantage of its city status. ""I think sometimes we take the 'ugly lovely town' epithet a bit too far,"" he said.  ""Swansea people don't take themselves too seriously and over the years we've played up to the second city, Cardiff's scruffy younger brother image. ""That makes Swansea a charming and relaxing place to live, but it does mean we haven't pushed our natural advantages - our environment, culture and universities - nearly hard enough. ""That's something we're going to have to take far more seriously in the next 50 years."" These are sentiments echoed by Swansea council leader Rob Stewart, who argues making a success of the £1.3bn Swansea Bay City Deal may be their only chance at securing the city's future. ""We've already started a major regeneration as part of the city deal, with a £129m arena, retail and leisure development around the city centre and Oystermouth Road - that's not planned work, this is work which is already on-site. ""But if the city deal is going to be successful, it can only be a kick-start for private investment, which is why we've issued a £750m call to arms for investors to share in the city's transformation and prosperity."" He said the UK government's decisions not to go ahead with electrification of the south Wales mainline and to shelve the proposed tidal lagoon hampered regeneration attempts, but must not be an excuse.    ""Of course I'm disappointed, but our job now is to concentrate on what we can do, by creating an integrated metro system using unused railway capacity linked intelligently with buses and other public transport. ""If we succeed with that, in the next 50 years we can look forward to a positive future, based around a green economy, technology and tourism.""     Swansea is marking its birthday with Prince Charles - along with The Duchess of Cornwall - back in Swansea for the occasion. It is part of a year of events culminating on 15 December, the day Swansea formally received its letters patent from the Queen. A weekend of street parties across the city kicked off on Thursday when St Helen's Road closed for five hours to celebrate its reputation as Swansea's most diverse street. People from 22 ethnic backgrounds shared Tai Chi from the Chinese community, music from the Aber Taiko drummers, food from the street's vast range of Asian restaurants, a papier mache Indian elephant, a world music stage and open day at the neighbourhood mosque. The party formed the background for the video of the official Swansea at 50 anthem - This Is Our City - written by Michael Mullan and performed by 12-year-old Justine Afante. Mr Mullan said he was looking forward to it being performed in front of the Prince of Wales. ""It would be great to speak to him and let him know what a wonderful city full of wonderful people we live in.  ""When the video comes out, we want everyone to share it and make sure everyone around the world  knows what an amazing city we live in."" Another musical offering comes from singer and broadcaster Mal Pope, with the opening of his Calon Lan The Musical, at Swansea's Grand Theatre on Wednesday night. Next season's Swansea City football kit will carry a commemorative 1969 logo to mark the occasion. "
investors sentiments,Start-ups with strong basics will get funds: Vinod Khosla,2024-09-15,2023-03-28,By Savita Patel,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65023054,"Indian start-ups with ""strong fundamentals"" will continue to be funded even as investor exuberance wanes, says Indian-origin Silicon Valley veteran Vinod Khosla. Mr Khosla, who co-founded technology giant Sun Microsystems in 1982, was speaking to the BBC about the likely impact of the current financial climate on the start-up ecosystem in India and globally, and the  recent problems in the banking sector.  The US Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in a bid to stabilise prices, but this has caused strains in the banking system - two US banks, including Silicon Valley Bank which lent largely to the tech sector, collapsed earlier this month. Many central banks have also announced measures to keep credit flowing through banking systems. Mr Khosla, a billionaire investor who has funded several Silicon Valley start-ups, warns, however, that company valuations on offer will be lower as the availability of capital declines. That's because inflation, higher interest rates and lower revenue growth at tech companies - after a period of robust hiring and expansion - have impacted availability of funds, changing investor sentiment. Earlier, says the 68-year-old, it was easy for a start-up ""to get a billion-dollar valuation which made no sense. I think that will moderate down"". Over the past few years, several tech companies have gone public with huge valuations in the US and other parts of the world. Vast amounts of wealth generation and near-zero interest rates had created an easy supply of venture capital. Many prominent funds poured money into India, and ""everything [valuations] got bid up, which made no economic sense"". But as the supply of capital contracts, this won't be sustainable anymore - and it could actually be positive in the long term.  ""The wheat will get separated from the chaff,"" Mr Khosla says, adding that ""not-so-good Indian start-ups will not get funded and go bust"" this year.  As a result, there will be fewer but larger start-ups. These companies could use their capital more efficiently as they won't have to compete with smaller firms, Mr Khosla says, although he adds a caveat that he is not in India ""day to day"" and hence ""doesn't know the ground reality"".

He adds that these companies can also benefit from supportive government policies.  ""India Stack, UPI [Unified Payments Interface] and others are good infrastructure for the start-up ecosystem to develop on,"" Mr Khosla says, referring to India's unique digital infrastructure that aids cashless transactions across sectors.

However, he added: ""The market's relief is only likely to last so long, and attention will soon turn to how countries intend to exit the current containment measures which have in effect hit the pause button on the global economy."" Despite gains on Monday and Tuesday, the FTSE 100 is still down by 25% compared to its highest level in January, before the pandemic led to lockdowns across Europe and the US. Adding to the positive financial news were further measures to support economies, including a trillion-dollar package in Japan and central bank moves in China. And with the ink barely dry on a $2 trillion rescue plan passed by Congress last month, Donald Trump said he favoured another massive spending programme, this time targeting infrastructure projects. There are also reports that European Union leaders are close to a rescue package for countries worst hit by the pandemic."
investors sentiments,US moves to reassure jumpy investors,2024-09-15,2018-12-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46669300,"US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has made calls to the heads of the country's six largest banks, in an unusual move aimed at reassuring investors after big falls in US stocks. Last week, US stocks suffered one of the worst weekly falls in a decade, as an interest rate rise and US-China trade tensions rattled markets. Mr Mnuchin said banks confirmed they had ""ample liquidity"" for operations.  It also comes amid a partial government shutdown over spending plans. ""The [bank's chief executives] confirmed that they have ample liquidity available for lending to consumer, business markets, and all other market operations,"" the Treasury said in a statement attached to a tweet from Mr Mnuchin. ""[Mr Mnuchin] also confirmed that they have not experienced any clearance or margin issues, and that the markets continue to function properly,"" the Treasury's statement said.  The BBC Today programme's business presenter, Dominic O'Connell, said the statement was ""very odd"" and could ""spook markets, not reassure them"". ""People are wondering whether this is really a role for the US Treasury secretary,"" he said.  Analysts also warned the unexpected statement could make investors nervous. ""More than anything else right now, Washington and politics are absolutely driving investor sentiment and market direction and that can turn on a dime,"" said Oliver Pursche, a board member at Bruderman Asset Management. Mr Mnuchin also tried to dismiss reports that President Donald Trump had discussed the possibility of firing Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, after the US central bank raised interest rates last week.  The US Treasury secretary tweeted that he had spoken to the president, who insisted he ""never suggested firing"" Mr Powell and did not believe he had the right to do so. Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, said the fact that Mr Mnuchin had said the White House did not have the power to remove Mr Powell, rather than saying it did not want to remove him, would be more comforting for investors.  ""The administration hasn't been all that stable when it comes to changing their mind. Politically, these are very strange times,"" he said.  All three US indexes closed lower last week, with the technology-focused Nasdaq down 20% since its peak, placing it in so-called ""bear market"" territory.  US investors are worried about a range of factors including slowing economic growth at home and internationally.  In addition, a partial US government shutdown began at midnight on Friday after opposition Democrats resisted President Donald Trump's demand for $5bn (£4bn) for his Mexico border wall. The shutdown over budget spending could continue right up to the opening of the next Congress on 3 January. Mr Mnuchin is now set to meet with the President's Working Group on Monday, the Treasury statement said.  The group includes market regulators and Federal Reserve governors, among others.  They will discuss ""coordination efforts to assure normal market operations"", the statement said."
investors sentiments,Drop in consumer confidence sends US stocks lower,2024-09-15,2020-03-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52068549,"Financial markets reversed course on Friday after a three day rally, dropping as consumer confidence plummets amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Dow Jones led US indexes lower, sliding more than 4%. European markets also declined. The falls came despite US approval of a massive aid bill as the number of virus cases in the US surpassed China. University of Michigan data also showed US consumer confidence dropped to its lowest level in three years in March. ""The outlook for the national economy for the year ahead weakened dramatically in March, with the majority now expecting bad times financially in the entire country,"" the director of the survey said in a statement. More than 3 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, a record high that follows widespread forced business, school and other closures as authorities try to limit the spread of the virus. Concerns about the economic impact have prompted market gyrations and wiped trillions of dollars worth off of value off shares since February, but prices had recovered some ground this week as governments and central banks around the world moved forward with plans to blunt the economic impact of the pandemic. On Friday, President Donald Trump was expected to sign a more than $2tn (£1.7tn) relief package, after the US Congress approved the aid for households and companies. It follows unprecedented steps by the Federal Reserve to shore up the economy.  The Dow and the S&P 500 on Thursday had marked their biggest three-day gains since the Great Depression in anticipation of the measure. They remained up about 10% for the week.  However, analysts have said they expect investors to remain on edge until the pandemic is under control. The University of Michigan survey found consumer sentiment fell 11.9 points in March - the biggest one month drop since October 2008, at the height of the global financial crisis. Wells Fargo analysts said the figures signalled another ""body blow"" to the economy. ""We are in the early stages of this crisis and are only now beginning to see its severity in the economic data,"" they wrote in a report. The S&P 500 fell more than 3.3% and the Nasdaq dropped 3.8% on Friday. London's FTSE 100 tumbled more than 5%, while main indexes in France and Germany also fell. Earlier Asian markets had gained, with the Nikkei 225 up 3.8%. Cruise companies, including Norwegian and Carnival, were among the biggest losers on US indexes. Boeing, which had seen share prices surge this week on expectations it would received, also dropped more than 6%, after officials rebutted the idea."
investors sentiments,Indian social media unicorn fires 20% of staff,2024-09-15,2023-01-17,By Meryl Sebastian,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64286674,"Indian unicorn ShareChat has laid off around 20% of its workforce in a bid to cut costs amid global headwinds. Mohalla Tech, which owns the video-sharing app, said it made the ""difficult"" decision due to concerns of a sustained economic downturn. The company, which employs around 2,200 people, laid off hundreds of people who were in management roles, financial website Moneycontrol reported. Sharechat is the latest in a series of tech firms that have cut jobs recently. Tech giants such as Meta, Twitter and Amazon have laid off thousands of employees over the past few months, affecting several Indians working in the US who are on visas such as the H-1B. Many of them may have to return to India if they don't find another job in time. According to the Layoffs.fyi website, which tracks tech job cuts, more than 24,000 workers around the world have been laid off just in 2023 so far. The website, set up by a US-based entrepreneur named Roger Lee, sources the figures from media announcements.  In India, tech start-ups Unacademy, Moglix, upGrad, and LEAD have all announced layoffs since 1 January.  Several Indian unicorns are facing pressure from investors to cut costs amid concerns over high valuations and global economic conditions. Sharechat, India's first homegrown social network, offers content in Indian languages. It is backed by tech firms such as Google and Temasek and had raised $300m (£246m) in fresh funding last year. It also counts Twitter, Snap Inc and Tiger Global among its investors. In December, however, the company shut down its online fantasy gaming platform Jeet11 and laid off nearly 100 employees. In a statement, a ShareChat spokesperson said that ""as capital becomes expensive, companies need to prioritise their bets and invest in the highest-impact projects only"". ""The decision to reduce employee costs was taken after much deliberations and in light of growing market consensus that investment sentiments will remain very cautious throughout this year,"" the spokesperson added.  ShareChat, which is based in Bangalore (also known as Bengaluru), is valued at around $5b and says it has around 180 million monthly active users. "
investors sentiments,Turkey: Could the US damage its economy?,2024-09-15,2019-01-16,By Reality Check,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-46866661,"President Trump has said the US will ""devastate Turkey economically"" if Ankara decides to attack Kurdish groups in Syria. Mr Trump was referring to his plan to pull US forces out of Syria, where they have been fighting alongside a Kurdish militia against the group calling itself Islamic State (IS). Turkey regards the Kurdish group as terrorists. The US president's comments drew a sharp response from Turkey, which said Mr Trump would not get anywhere by threatening the country economically. After Mr Trump's tweet, the Turkish lira dropped in value against the US dollar. It then recovered its value, suggesting that his remarks had limited impact. So how could the US damage Turkey economically - if it wanted to? The relationship between Washington and Ankara has historically been close - politically, economically and militarily. Turkey - a Nato member - is a vital partner for the US but there have been significant strains in the partnership. These came out into the open last August, when the US slapped sanctions on Turkey over the continued detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson. It marked a new low in relations and was a further blow to an already fragile economy. The US also doubled tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium that month, leading to further falls in the value of the Turkish lira - some 40% since the beginning of 2018. Turkey responded in kind, raising tariffs on cars from the US to 120%, on alcoholic drinks to 140% and on leaf tobacco to 60%. In fact, only 5% of Turkish exports head to the US and Turkey imports only slightly more from there. Turkey's trading relationships with China, Russia and Germany are more important.  But even though overall trade with US is not as large, there are key vulnerable sectors: air transport, iron and steel and machinery - and this is where the US has chosen to target previous sanctions. Turkey has historically had a deficit in international trade, in that it imports more from the rest of the world than it exports. However, the trade gap did narrow considerably in 2018 on the back of the weakness of the lira, which made Turkey's exports more competitive and imports more expensive. Turkey may be vulnerable over its high levels of debt. As of the end of September 2018, its external debt amounted to over 50% of its gross domestic product (GDP) - the value of all the goods and services it produces in a year - according to official figures. ""This is Turkey's Achilles heel,"" says York University economist Gulcin Ozkan.  ""It puts the country at the mercy of international investors and makes it vulnerable to exchange rate movements."" There are two features of Turkey's foreign debt increase that are concerning. It has a relatively high level of short-term debt, which is due for repayment in the near future. That means having a greater reliance on external finance. In addition, most of its overall debt is in foreign currencies such as the US dollar and the euro. So, the debt becomes more expensive as the Turkish currency loses value and other currencies - such as the US dollar - strengthen. In fact, the lira had been struggling for most of last year, recording its worst decline since 2001. This currency weakness also aggravates Turkey's persistent inflation problem, which at one point in 2018 peaked at over 25%.   It's important to point out that the Turkish economy has been growing strongly for most of the period since 2001. But confidence in Turkey was beginning to wane last year over concerns that the economy was overheating due to huge spending and borrowing. In addition, the Turkish government has taken away some power from the central bank, leading investors to worry about the direction of fiscal policy. So any fallout with the US could further sour the financial markets' view of the health of the Turkish economy. ""This could lead to a decline in capital inflows and impact the value of the Turkish currency,"" says economist Gulcin Ozkan. But given the importance of the political and strategic relationship with Turkey, which shares borders with Syria, Iraq and Iran, the US may want to tread carefully. Turkey is the biggest recipient of US defence equipment after Israel and the UAE and the vast majority of its air force is US supplied. It also hosts US and Nato forces at its Incirlik airbase, in the south of the country. So Turkey may be economically vulnerable but politically and strategically it remains very important.

investors sentiments,Ted Baker to 'learn lessons' of hugs probe,2024-09-15,2019-03-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47649883,"Troubled fashion chain Ted Baker has said it is ""determined to learn lessons"" from the ""forced hugs"" scandal that forced out its boss Ray Kelvin. The pledge came in its annual results statement, less than three weeks after Mr Kelvin resigned in the wake of the misconduct allegations. Pre-tax profit for the year to 26 January was down 26% to £50.9m, from £68.8m a year earlier. The figures were in line with a profit warning issued last month. The firm is continuing an investigation into the allegations against Mr Kelvin. Its shares fell more than 5% in early Thursday trading. In its results statement, Ted Baker said it wanted all employees to feel ""respected and valued"" and would ensure that ""appropriate changes"" were made. The scandal over Mr Kelvin, who founded the chain and was its chief executive, broke in December, when employees launched an online petition accusing him of inappropriate comments and behaviour. The petition, on the workplace website Organise, said that more than 200 Ted Baker staff were finally breaking their silence after at least ""50 recorded incidents of harassment"" at the fashion group.  Staff claimed that as well as engaging them in unwelcome embraces, the brand's founder had asked young female members of staff to sit on his knee, cuddle him or let him massage their ears. At the time, Mr Kelvin took a voluntary leave of absence. He stepped down on 4 March. The firm said its investigation was continuing and would now focus on Ted Baker's ""policies, procedures and handling of HR-related complaints"". Acting chief executive Lindsay Page said that ""despite difficult trading conditions"", the firm's sales performance over the year had been ""resilient"". The results showed a marked divergence between the fortunes of its online and High Street operations, reflecting current consumer trends. E-commerce sales rose 20.4% to £121.7m, but overall retail sales were just 4.2% higher at £461m. At the same time, retail sales per sq ft of High Street store space decreased by 5.5% to £786. ""Performance was impacted by competitive discounting across the retail sector, consumer uncertainty, the well-publicised challenges facing some of our UK trading partners and the unseasonable weather across our global markets at different points throughout the year,"" the retailer said. ""Despite this, growth was driven by continued investment across the retail channel in new and existing stores and our e-commerce platform."" George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""These are turbulent times for Ted. The top line is still heading in the right direction, but only on account of the continued addition of new sales space and the strong contribution from online sales.  ""However, Ted had already braced investors to expect a drop in profits this year, and sentiment was already frayed on the back of the ongoing investigation into the former CEO's conduct.  ""We think the share price movement is more to do with Ted's notably downbeat outlook - which will be a surprise to many after the positive trading statement in January."" "
investors sentiments,Amazon warns of slower sales as economy weakens,2024-09-15,2022-10-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63421170,"Apple and Amazon sales are being hit by the weakening global economy, the tech giants have warned, adding to fears about their upcoming profits. Amazon shares tumbled more than 15% after the US stock market closed, as the firm forecast far weaker sales for the festive season than expected. Apple shares also slipped after warning of a slowing demand for gaming and advertising. Both cited the rising cost of living as a factor eroding consumer buying power. ""We're very optimistic about the holiday but we're realistic that there are various factors weighing on people's wallets"", Amazon's chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts on a call to discuss the results. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who remains chairman of the company, recently warned about worrying signals coming from the economy, writing on Twitter that it was time to ""batten down the hatches"". Apple, seen as one of the steadiest of the tech giants, has not been immune.  In its update on Thursday, Apple reported that sales rose by 8% to $90.1bn in the three months to September compared with the same period the year before. That was a quarterly record, albeit one dented by weaker-than-expected iPhone sales and soft growth in China. But Apple executives warned investors that they were seeing weakness in digital advertising and gaming and expecting a sharp fall in Mac computer sales. They added that a strong dollar would hit business. ""Apple's ability to sell highly priced hardware in the current environment defies all the rules,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""The key festive season is a crucial barometer for consumer sentiment, and there's a possibility Apple is going to lose some steam year-on-year when it comes to Christmas sales."" Both Apple and Amazon saw business boom during the pandemic, as more activity moved online.  But sales have softened significantly over the past year, as consumers do more of their shopping in person once again, and shift their buying habits in response to rising prices. At Amazon, overall sales in the three months to September rose 15% year-on-year to $127.1bn, but its international business shrank. Growth slowed in its lucrative cloud services unit. While Amazon sales were strong in July, they weakened in August and September, especially in Europe, said Mr Olsavsky, blaming the problems on a ""tougher recessionary environment"". Costs for items such as fuel are also rising, which is likely to hit profits, he added. ""Worrying times for Amazon, in line with other big tech,"" said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight. ""This is set to be a winter of discontent."" Executives at major tech firms, including Microsoft, Google's parent company Alphabet, and Facebook have also discussed weakness in recent financial updates. "
investors sentiments,Klarna to cut 10% of staff as it warns of recession,2024-09-15,2022-05-24,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61562651,"Buy now pay later firm Klarna has announced plans to cut around 700 staff as it warned of a ""likely recession"". The Swedish firm blamed a combination of rising prices, a change in consumer sentiment and the war in Ukraine for the move. ""What we are seeing now in the world is not temporary or short-lived, and hence we need to act,"" said chief executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski. The cuts equate to around 10% of Klarna's 7,000-strong workforce.  ""When we set our business plans for 2022 in the autumn of last year, it was a very different world than the one we are in today,"" said Mr Siemiatkowski. ""Since then, we have seen a tragic and unnecessary war in Ukraine unfold, a shift in consumer sentiment, a steep increase in inflation, a highly volatile stock market and a likely recession."" In a blog, Mr Siemiatkowski advised staff - who the company refers to ""Klarnauts"" - to ""take care of yourselves and each other"". Klarna is one of many tech companies warning that the months ahead will be difficult and taking steps to cut jobs or freeze hiring, as consumer spending weakens and ad sales slow. Social media firm Snap shares tumbled roughly 40% on Tuesday after it cut sales and profit targets set a month ago. The owner of the Snapchat messaging app said it would slow its rate of hiring after it said ""macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further and faster than anticipated"". The update prompted a wider sell-off, with shares in Facebook-owner Meta down roughly 10%, Google-owner Alphabet falling 8% and smaller firms such as Pinterest down 26%. In the UK, the central bank has warned the economy could fall into recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive quarters - after official figures revealed the economy shrank in March. Higher prices are beginning to bite into household budgets and people have started spending less and cutting down on car journeys due to high fuel costs. Soaring energy bills and food prices are also having an impact and inflation - the rate at which prices rise - jumped to 9% in April and is expected to reach more than 10% by the end of the year. Commenting on the cuts, Klarna said its affected employees in Europe will be offered ""to leave Klarna with an associated compensation"", but added outside of the continent, ""the process for impacted employees will look different depending on where you work"". Klarna staff were asked to work from home this week ""in consideration of the privacy of the people affected by these changes"". Mr Siemiatkowski said it had been ""a very tumultuous year"" so far. It contrasts with 2021 when, thanks to the shift in consumer spending to online during Covid restrictions, Klarna saw the value of the company soar to $46bn when it raised millions of dollars from investors. Since then, however, The Wall Street Journal has reported it is seeking a new round of investment and its valuation could sink by as much as $16bn to $30bn. Klarna dismissed the report as ""pure speculation"". Buy-now-pay-later providers should have a pretty good insight of consumer sentiment. After all, it is a product that has been used by 17 million people in the UK, including 30% of those aged in their 20s. No doubt Klarna has decided that those customers are likely to tighten their belts, spending less on fashion and the like as food and fuel take a bigger and bigger chunk out of their disposable incomes. But there are likely to be wider factors at play here too. Firstly, this kind of credit is facing greater scrutiny from regulators. Will shoppers think twice about clicking the Klarna box if they know that, in doing so, other potential lenders will be aware of how they are funding their purchases or they have to undergo affordability checks? Secondly, Klarna has expanded fast, but so have its losses, and those in charge need to chart a sustainable course for the business. Over its last financial year, Klarna's operating losses swelled to 6.58bn Swedish krona (£540m) from 1.62bn Swedish krona.  In its annual report, the company said losses were growing but that was ""entirely explained by Klarna's growth, expansion to new markets and massive inflow of new customers"". Danni Hewson, financial analyst for AJ Bell, said Klarna's job cuts ""might be the sensible option even if it takes a great big chunk out of the company's valuation"". ""Markets are adjusting, those sky-high market caps that some growth businesses have attained over the last couple of years are coming under considerable scrutiny and many investors are deciding they don't hold up,"" said Ms Hewson. ""Klarna's caught between a rock and hard place as it needs to keep up its expansion momentum if it's to grow revenue and start generating profits. ""It could delay fundraising, wait for a more favourable moment, but there's no telling how long that wait would be particularly when recession is looming over the global economy."" Buy-now-pay-later is now a popular payment method across many stores, especially for people in their 20s. However, one in 10 people using them already had debt arrears elsewhere, a review by the Financial Conduct Authority last year found. It has led to criticism the schemes encourage shoppers to buy more than they can afford. Earlier this month, Klarna announced it would start telling credit agencies who pays on time and who falls behind. From June, banks and credit card firms will be able to see people's Klarna habits when making credit checks."
investors sentiments,Stock markets hit by Ukraine invasion fears,2024-09-15,2022-02-14,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60374581,"Europe's stock markets closed sharply lower on Monday, but recouped some losses in afternoon trading on hopes of a deal to resolve Ukraine tensions. The FTSE 100 ended 1.7% down, and the main markets in Paris and Frankfurt 2% lower, with travel stocks hard hit. Reports from Russia that talks with the West over Ukraine should continue helped improve investor sentiment. That limited losses on Wall Street, where at lunchtime in New York the Dow Jones was down 0.5% and Nasdaq up 0.7%. According to reports, Sergei Lavrov has suggested to Russia's President Vladimir Putin that diplomatic efforts should continue because there might be a chance of doing a deal. On the FTSE 100, IAG, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, fell 5.6%. Shares in the major banks closed between 4% and 5% down. The biggest loser was London-listed Russian mining company Evraz, which tumbled 29%. The FTSE 100's fall, the worst session in three weeks, followed a fall in Asian stock markets. ""The fact that the door has not been shut to further talks... is a good thing,"" said Patrick O'Hare, at Briefing.com. ""Hence, the negativity seen earlier has dissipated some, yet there is still a major cloud of uncertainty hanging over the market."" Oil initially rose sharply with Brent crude topping $95 (£70) per barrel, stoking fresh inflationary worries, although the price has eased back slightly.  With oil demand high as global economies emerge from lockdown, there are fears a war or severe sanctions on Russia will cut supplies, sending the price above $100 a barrel, something not seen since 2014. ""Just as the storm of Covid appeared to be receding, the growing expectation of an invasion of Ukraine is the fresh threat now unnerving investors, with confidence plunging in many parts of the world,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter.  She added: ""With worries that inflation is already running far too hot, the possibility Russian troops could move across the border has led to another surge in the oil price. Energy markets are clearly on edge and if supplies are threatened there is a risk oil will shoot up even higher."" Analysts at Capital Economics estimate war or sanctions could add to inflation in Europe, forcing central banks to lift interest rates faster and further. ""Over the longer term, whether Russia ends up invading or not, this geopolitical flare-up is likely to speed up the process of Russia's decoupling from the West,"" Capital Economics said in a research note. Moscow has amassed an estimated 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border but denies any intent to invade.  Despite this, more than a dozen countries have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine, with the US saying Moscow could begin an attack ""at any time"". "
investors sentiments,Will Argentine and Turkish crises spread?,2024-09-15,2018-09-06,By Ana Nicolaci da Costa ,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45191872,"Economic crises in Turkey and Argentina have led to talk of ""contagion"" - the danger of financial problems in one country spilling over into others. Turkey has struggled with a falling currency and worsening relations with the US. A spiralling crisis in Argentina prompted the government to announce austerity measures and to ask the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an early release of a $50bn loan. The sharp falls in the value of Turkey's lira and Argentina's peso have led to fears that currencies from South Africa to Russia will follow suit. In Asia, India's rupee and Indonesia's rupiah have already been hit. So should Asian economies be concerned? Put simply, contagion is a self-fulfilling process, whereby economic problems in one country prompt investors to sell assets in economies with similar risks. In a globalised world, a crisis in one country can also quickly spread to others through trade links or lending by banks.  That is why a downturn in Turkey or Argentina matters abroad -  beyond making holidays there cheaper. Trade is the obvious way for trouble in one country to affect another.  When an economy begins to falter, companies tend to cut production and then jobs. As a result, consumers have less money to spend on goods, including imports. This is bad news for global businesses that export a lot of goods to the country.    If a crisis also causes a country's currency to weaken, the cost of imports rise, further hurting demand. However, Joseph Gagnon at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, says Asia has ""very low trade links"" with Argentina and Turkey, ""so that is not much of a worry"". Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist for IHS Markit, also says trade with Turkey is an unlikely channel of contagion for Asia, since the region relies more heavily on big economies such as China, Europe and the US for their exports. ""The more significant concern for Apac [Asia Pacific] nations would be if the Turkish economic crisis results in contagion to emerging markets currencies and equities, which could potentially trigger significant capital outflows from emerging markets,"" he said. The phrase ""emerging markets"" refers to developing countries in Africa, Latin America or Asia, while major economies such as the US, the UK and Japan tend to have higher living standards and more developed financial systems. During an economic crisis, investors tend to sell riskier assets, such as emerging market currencies or stocks, and hold on to safer ones, such as the US dollar or government bonds issued by major economies.  Julian Evans-Pritchard, a senior China economist at Capital Economics, says countries that rely on money from overseas and have foreign inflows of cash into their stock and bond markets are particularly at risk of contagion. ""The risk is that when sentiment turns more negative, foreign investors start to pull out those funds, which has an impact on the exchange rate,"" he said. ""For countries that borrowed a lot in foreign currency, usually in US dollars, this can make it difficult for them to repay their foreign currency denominated debt. That's what happened in 1997 during the Asian financial crisis, for example."" In Asia, both India and Indonesia rely heavily on foreign capital inflows, which is why their currencies have suffered in particular. India, an oil importing country, has seen its import bill rise along with higher oil prices and this has caused its current account deficit to widen, said Mr Biswas of IHS Markit. A country that runs a current account deficit may rely on inflows of foreign money to finance spending and investments. Indonesia, meanwhile, has low foreign exchange reserves and a high level of foreign ownership in the local equity and bond markets, Mr Biswas added.  This makes it particularly vulnerable to investors pulling their money out of the country. Another way contagion can spread is when banks in one country own assets in another country which is in trouble. The economic problems can cause the value of these assets to fall. When that happens, investors worry how a bank will cope with the falling value of the assets, and how this will affect its ability to lend money to consumers and other borrowers. Such concerns weighed on European bank shares recently, with investors worried about how much Turkish assets they own. The Financial Times reported that a wing of the European Central Bank was concerned about the exposure of some of the eurozone's biggest lenders to Turkey. The report said Spain's BBVA, Italy's UniCredit and France's BNP Paribas, all of which have significant operations in Turkey, were particularly exposed. Spain's banks are the most exposed to Turkey, according to IHS Markit, citing data from the Bank for International Settlements. They have about €81bn of exposure to Turkish assets, and French banks have exposure to about €35bn. But IHS Markit's Mr Biswas said Asian banks' exposure to Turkey was limited. ""In the big picture of the banking sectors of the Asian countries, this would not be a serious negative factor in their outlook,"" he said."

Those potential risks were highlighted in September when drone attacks hit the Abqaiq oil facility and the Khurais oil field in Saudi Arabia, both owned by Aramco. But Aramco boss Amin Nasser, who called the plans ""historic"", told a media conference after the IPO statement was published that the firm was still the most reliable oil company globally. In its launch announcement Aramco said: ""The company does not expect the impact of these attacks to have a material impact on its business, financial condition or results of operations."" Saudi Aramco traces its roots to 1933 when a deal was struck between Saudi Arabia and the Standard Oil Company of California, which later became Chevron, to survey and drill for oil, creating a new firm to do so. Between 1973 and 1980, Saudi Arabia bought the whole company. Saudi Arabia has the second-biggest oil reserves after Venezuela, according to the Energy Information Administration. It is also second in production, after the US. But it gets its prominence because it has the monopoly on all that oil in the country, and because of how cheap it is to extract. It's essentially the world's largest unquoted company; it's a massive global oil producer,"" said David Hunter, director of market studies at Schneider Electric. ""This is the absolute mother of all oil and gas companies."" Saudi Aramco is worth $1.2tn, according to analysis from financial news service Bloomberg, although Riyadh would prefer a valuation of $2tn, which is one reason the company's share sale has been delayed a number of times. Mr Beauchamp from IG Group says: ""Aramco is a world away from the tech IPOs that have been all the rage lately, but the valuation problem still haunts them like it does the firms of Silicon Valley."" He adds: ""$2 trillion probably overstates the worth of the firm in a world of high oil supply and uncertain demand, but $1.2 trillion is too low for a vital part of the Saudi state"". Once shrouded in mystery, Aramco has been transformed in the last few years as it geared up for this moment It has begun publishing financial results, holding question and answer sessions about the company and even bringing journalists to its sites following recent drone attacks. And it has hired female Westerners to some of its top jobs. The language in today's document speaks to international concerns. It describes ""long-term value creation through crude oil price cycles"" and improving sustainability ""by leveraging technology and innovation to lower our climate impact"".  Local people - even ""Saudi female divorcees"" - will be eligible to buy shares, and will receive a bonus share for every 10 they hold. Either way, it is phenomenally profitable. For the first half of 2019, it posted a net profit of $46.9bn, almost all of which was paid out in dividends to the Saudi state.  Any company that profitable will attract a high price. By comparison, for the same time period, Apple, the world's largest company by value currently, posted a net profit of $21.6bn, and Exxon Mobil, the largest listed oil company, made $5.5bn. Another aspect is the cost of production. Whereas extracting North Sea oil is expensive due to its location under hundreds of feet of water, oil in Saudi Arabia is relatively close to the surface. Saudi has many of the cheapest oil fields for extraction, with some per-barrel costs below $10, says Mr Hunter. With Brent crude at more than $60, much of the difference can be profit. Saudi Arabia is keen to sell shares in its state oil firm because it is trying to reduce its reliance on oil.  Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman wishes to diversify his country's economy in the next decade under a programme dubbed Vision 2030. The plan includes more solar power, making use of the country's vast desert, says Mr Hunter. The first Saudi CEO of the company, Ali al-Naimi, had a vision that Aramco could become a global integrated energy company.  Over his years as CEO, he expanded Aramco's assets to include downstream (refining) and other assets in the US, South Korea, China, Indonesia, Japan and Europe.   He and his successors also expanded Aramco's footprint in Saudi Arabia with joint ventures in refining and petrochemicals.  Saudi Arabia is the largest oil exporter today and is the only oil producer that maintains at least 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity that can be brought onto the market very quickly. The fact that it is a national oil company means it has exclusive access to the best and least-expensive-to-produce oil resources in the world.  This makes it hugely valuable.  But there are downsides.  Saudi Arabia's upstream assets aren't diversified like other major international oil companies upstream assets are.  It also means that the Saudi government plays a role in the company.  Historically, Saudi Arabia allowed Aramco to operate independently and did not make decisions about spending for strategy for the company. There are troubling signs that this is changing now and the government is taking a more active, and detrimental, role.  How much Aramco is really worth will be determined by the market.  Banks have put forth their valuations, but the market will show how much it is really worth. Different sources have quoted valuations ranging from $1.2 tn to $2 tn.  The most common number floated right now seems to be about $1.5 tn, perhaps $1.7 tn, though public sentiment probably indicates that this is too high a number. In 30 years, who knows how much Aramco will be worth.  We don't know what other energy technologies will develop, or not, in that time, nor what Aramco's strategic vision will produce. In September, the kingdom said it will open its doors to international tourists for the first time, launching a visa regime for 49 countries and relax strict dress codes for female visitors. Tourism Minister Ahmad al-Khateeb described it as a ""historic moment"" for the country. It wants tourism to rise from 3% to 10% of gross domestic product by 2030. The push comes as the kingdom faces a tarnished international image amid criticism of its human rights record following last year's murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and a recent crackdown on women's rights activists. Politically, matters are rather complicated for Saudi Aramco right now, in light of the recent Kashoggi scandal, said Mr Hunter. ""And the fact of Saudi Arabia's human rights record. Anything to do with Saudi Arabia is always seen through that prism."" Another wrinkle in the crown prince's plan is the surge in anti-fossil fuel sentiment around the world, plus the comparatively low oil price compared to late last year, where prices were above $80. ""The listing could be controversial because it's a massive fossil fuel listing in a time investors are becoming increasingly ethical,"" said Mr Hunter. ""There are a lot of new and existing funds looking to divest from fossil fuel assets."" In May, fellow oil producer Norway's $1tn sovereign wealth fund said it expected to sell some of its oil and gas holdings, albeit to make it less reliant on price swings in the commodity."
investors sentiments,What next for Hull UK City of Culture?,2024-09-15,2017-12-31,By Pritti Mistry,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-humber-42338276,"When Hull was announced as the UK's City of Culture for 2017, it triggered a wave of jibes about its cultural and socio-economic credentials. As the year draws to a close can the city build on its ""one Hull of a year"" and have the last laugh? Hull is a city out on a limb, sandwiched between the end of a motorway and the North Sea. Until this year it was not generally thought of as a beacon of the arts, or as a tourist destination. Flick through the pages of the Lonely Planet's 2003 edition guidebook on Great Britain and you will find descriptions such as ""a gruff no-nonsense feel"" and ""lacking in overt charm"". But the latest edition strikes a different note, applauding new attractions such as The Ferens Art Gallery, the historic Old Town district and The Deep aquarium. ""Hull's image has definitely changed,"" said David Else, travel writer for the tourism tome. ""While Hull isn't quite topping 'must-visit' lists for England just yet, it's definitely seen an increased profile and offers more to visitors than it did a decade ago."" Among those impressed by the city are American brothers Marko and Alex Ayling. Known online as the Vagabrothers, the travel vloggers made a video about Hull for their YouTube channel, which has nearly 500,000 subscribers. Alex confesses the pair had not previously heard of the city until they were invited by the Visit Britain tourism board. Unexpectedly, Marko compares Hull's transformation to the Spanish city of Bilbao - where Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum kick-started a cultural renaissance - and said it had a similar reputation and industrial aesthetic. ""We didn't have any pre-conceptions when we visited,"" Alex added. ""It wasn't, like, a bad place to visit. When we published the video there were a lot of comments like 'why would you visit Hull?' and I think as a traveller and a visitor we had a really fun time."" In front of Hull Minster, a series of City of Culture robotic installations aptly titled 'Where Do We Go From Here?' stand proud. It is one of 2,000 or so events and activities that has drawn 3.5m visitors to the port this year. Across the road, 25-year-old Georgia Allenby sips on her coffee in the cafe next to the 15-bed apartment Hideout Hotel she opened back in August. She says it has since been fully booked nearly every weekend. ""We've seen a massive increase in footfall just around the Old Town.  ""When we first acquired the property you'd maybe get a few people wander past each day but now there's a few each minute really."" Ms Allenby believes too much has happened in the last year for its success to come to an abrupt halt. ""It's going to carry on, it's not going to be a culture hangover next year. What City of Culture has done is get people here. ""People have been staying one night, maybe two nights here and all of them are saying 'that's not long enough' and 'damn, I wish I could stay longer, I need to come back'.  ""So I think we will get repeat visitors coming back again and again in the future years."" Echoing her enthusiasm is 58-year-old Jayne Yates, store manager of Yorkshire Linen. ""It's been amazing. Footfall has increased. We've had visitors from out of town who've come to see the events and shopped and then decided to come back shopping again, which I think is absolutely fantastic for Hull."" She added: ""I've been the manager for Yorkshire Linen here for 17 years and this is the first year that we've had to take on any extra staff for the Christmas period, so I think that says it all, that we are getting more people through the door."" But not every business in Hull shares the same sentiment.  Standing opposite an empty department store in the heart of Hull's shopping area is 40-year-old independent retailer, Brookes Menswear. It faces the former BHS building emblazoned with ""Welcome to Hull UK City of Culture 2017"". Shift your eyes ground-level and your sight is met with rough sleepers in the doorway. Mark Harris, who took over Brookes 14 years ago, said the celebrations had not brought him any extra custom as many of the events were in the evenings and in a different area of the city. He added: ""When the [Weeping Window] Poppies were here - they were located in our area - them months were pretty good. ""But most of the events are on the other side of town - the Fruit market area - and that's quite a distance from us, as a retailer.  ""I think the people who's made money this year from the City of Culture are the food retailers and the hoteliers."" He is holding on to the hope the city council will deliver on its proposal to improve the neighbouring Albion Square and Bond Street areas. The council's ""£250m legacy plan"" also includes the regeneration of a dock, refurbishment of the city's Maritime attractions and the continuation of the Culture Company to programme arts and cultural events. And it is that key word - 'legacy' - which is on every official's lips. Londonderry, in Northern Ireland, was the first UK City of Culture in 2013. Oonagh McGillion, director of legacy at Derry City & Strabane District Council, said the award brought in new tourism jobs and money from visitors. ""You can tangibly see it in the streets,"" she said. ""You can see more visitors, you can see more spend in the shops as a result of those increased visitors and you can see a private sector, which is much much more interested in investing in the city and investing in our key regeneration sites."" Dominic Gibbons, managing director of Hull-based property developers Wykeland Group, said: ""What's been fantastic is the level of collaboration. There's a feeling of 'one Hull', where you'll find cultural companies talking to private businesses, private businesses talking more to councils and the health services etc.  ""There's more discussion between the different sectors, which can drive the city forward. ""I think the biggest part of the legacy that's been left by this year is probably being a more collaborative city, which I think is paramount to the future growth of the economy."" However, one economist thinks differently.  Paul Swinney, from think tank Centre for Cities, says while big cultural activities are ""great for boosting civic pride"" they ""don't and won't change the economy"" in the long term. ""If we're thinking of this [City of Culture] being a tool to try improve the economies of places that aren't doing very well then actually that's not really what it's meant to do and it's not really designed to try and achieve that sort of thing. ""I'm sure hoteliers and restaurateurs will definitely have had a positive impact. But what we have to think about in terms of the challenges facing cities like Hull is what are the barriers that are preventing businesses coming in to invest, particularly higher-skilled type businesses? ""And I think the key challenge there is skills."" When Liverpool became European Capital of Culture in 2008, visitor figures increased by 34% generating £754m for the local economy, which has ""grown from £2bn to £4bn in the eight years after"", said Phil Redmond, chairman of the UK City of Culture panel and the Institute of Cultural Capital. The Grange Hill, Brookside and Hollyoaks creator led Liverpool's Culture year and initiated the UK City of Culture scheme on the back of Liverpool's success.  He believes putting on ""big ticket, high exposure"" events regularly will boost tourism and in turn, the economy. ""Culture is the sum of everything we do. Culture is the sum of all our creativity. Culture lays the foundations to build the tourism industry. ""If you put on a big event, if you put on a big attraction, you bring in hundreds of thousands of people into the city and it's the hundreds and thousands of people who bring the cash and cash is the real fuel of regeneration."" But when the City of Culture curtain finally comes down, will the light shows, giant artworks and star-studded festivals be a catalyst for permanent change? "
investors sentiments,India's online game tax could kill a booming industry,2024-09-15,2023-07-13,By Nikhil Inamdar and Meryl Sebastian,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66161596,"The Indian government's decision to impose a 28% tax on online gaming poses an ""existential threat"" to the booming industry and could spell its death knell, say experts.  Shares of Indian online gaming platforms and casinos have crashed following the GST (Goods and Services Tax) Council's decision.  The country's 900+ gaming start-ups had been paying a small tax on the fee they charged for offering games. But the imposition of a 28% GST on the full face value of a gaming transaction will mean the entire amount collected from players will now come under the ambit of taxation. According to industry estimates, total tax collection on player winnings will go beyond 50%, including GST, platform commissions and income taxeswhen the new law is implemented.  In effect, for every $100 (£76.8) spent by a player, there will be a ""sunk cost"" of $28 towards GST, in addition to a $5-15 charge by the gaming platform and a 30% tax deducted at source (TDS) on any winnings drawn. This will ""disincentivise players and is totally inconsistent with global standards"" where VAT or GST is levied at a median rate, and that too only on platform fees or commissions, said Sudipta Bhattacharjee, partner at corporate law firm Khaitan & Co. ""The move has completely blindsided the industry. It will shake investor confidence and lead to a funding winter,"" Mr Bhattacharjee added. The online gaming industry has seen a massive boom in India over the last five years, with an annual compounded growth rate of 28-30%. Driven by easy access to affordable smart phones and cheap mobile data, the sector attracted $2.5bn in foreign direct investment, including from the likes of Tiger Global.  But these growth rates will now be called into question as the GST council's decision will impact startups at ""multiple levels"", including their user base, revenues as well as investor sentiment, according to Soham Thacker, Founder & of CEO of GamerJi - an eSports tournament company. ""Many gaming companies, in order to limit the impact on the investors side, may choose to relocate their business outside India,"" Mr Thacker added. ""They have killed the multibillion-dollar industry with a single stroke. And at the same time the decision could give a massive boost to illegal and illegitimate operators in the country,"" Gaurav Gaggar, Promoter of Poker High, a poker site, said. Terming the decision ""unconstitutional, irrational, and egregious"", the All India Gaming Federation said the government had ignored over 60 years of ""settled legal jurisprudence"" by lumping online skill gaming with gambling activities. Gambling, which is seen as a chance-based game, is illegal in many India states and is frowned upon. But most states have allowed online games which are seen as skill-based.  The industry body expects hundreds of thousands of job losses in the online gaming sector because of the latest move. Gaming startups in India currently employ 50,000 people and were expecting to create another 350,000 direct and 1,000,000 indirect jobs by 2028. Many gaming companies the BBC spoke to said there was a lack of consistency behind the ruling. ""It is very unfortunate that when the government has been supporting the industry… such a legally untenable decision has been taken,"" Roland Landers, CEO of the All India Gaming Federation said in a statement. ""It will be catastrophic for the $1tn digital economy dream of the prime minister."" Indian PM Narendra Modi has on more than one occasion praised the gaming industry as a sunrise sector that had the potential to create jobs and cater to the global market.  ""This kind of extortionist tax regime flies in the face of these steps and advocacy needs to happen at multiple levels to retract this proposal,"" said Mr Bhattacharjee. He expects the gaming industry to unite and mount a strong legal challenge if the federal and state governments go ahead and enact the amendments into their tax laws. But India's revenue secretary called the move a ""unanimous"" decision that would not be reviewed or rolled back. Announcing the decision late on Tuesday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the GST council, which comprises of federal and state finance ministers, said ""no one wanted to kill an industry"". ""But they can't be encouraged to such an extent over essential goods and services,"" she said.   The 28% tax is a ""step in the right direction"", Siddhartha Iyer, a Supreme Court lawyer who has been fighting to ban online gaming told the BBC. Mr Iyer called gaming a ""speculative activity"". ""Every week there is a story of someone killing themselves because of this [debts incurred due to online gaming],"" he said. ""Here, under the GST regime, the government has taken the view that [these games] are gambling and that is correct in my opinion because you are putting a wager on the performance of something not in your control,"" Mr Iyer added. ""We tax alcohol and cigarettes because we want to discourage people from these activities, it should be the same for this [online gaming] as well."" Others like Faisal Maqbool, a former gaming addict who lost close to 400,000 rupees ($5,000, £3,750) while playing an online card game in 2022, say even stricter measures are needed. ""This is an addiction. And it has afflicted children and teenagers. Along with higher taxes, the government needed to put in restrictions on the basis of age, income etc. I vouch for a total ban on these activities,"" Mr Maqbool told the BBC."
investors sentiments,Asia markets drop sharply after US falls,2024-09-15,2018-02-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42998819,"Major Asian markets suffered sharp losses on Friday, following another day of steep falls on Wall Street. In a volatile week for global investors, Japan's Nikkei 225 index slid 2.3%, while China's Shanghai Composite slumped by 4.1%.  Earlier, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,000 points for the second time this week. Sell-offs around the world have been pinned partly on concerns over higher interest rates. Elsewhere in Asia on Friday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3.1%, while South Korea's Kospi index traded down 1.8% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 eased 0.9%. Those losses came as little surprise, with moves in major US markets providing the cue for global investors.  On Thursday, the Dow Jones ended 4.2% lower at 23,860, the S&P 500 closed down 3.8%, while the Nasdaq sank 3.9%. European exchanges also headed south on Thursday.  China was the worst performer in Asia on Friday as losses deepened from declines seen earlier this week.  Chinese stock markets tend to be volatile and are dominated by retail investors, rather than big institutions like many other major markets.  But falls in China can spark nervousness around the world over sentiment in the world's second largest economy.  As well as the broader sell-off, analysts said stocks in China were weighed down by people selling ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. This is a common trend as the need for cash grows during this period - a time when Chinese companies typically pay bonuses and people also traditionally exchange cash and gifts during the period. This global sell-off began last week after a solid US jobs report fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates faster than expected because of the strength of the economy. That concern has prompted the pull-back from stocks.  On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for the view that rates are on the up. The Bank left interest rates at 0.5% at its meeting, but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting. Also worrying investors was a government budget proposal announced by US lawmakers, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation.  Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates. Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity. At the same time, higher interest rates can make investment alternatives to stocks, such as bonds, more attractive. The uptick in volatility comes as investors react to the shifting conditions. And more turbulence could be on the way.  ""The return of volatility after two relatively calm days supports the idea there are further losses to come in the days and weeks ahead,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy.  The chaotic week on global markets also comes as several markets around the world sit on, or near record highs.  Analysts have said for months that financial markets were due a correction, after a long period of rising prices. Thursday's declines mean the Dow and S&P 500 have now fallen by more than 10% from the record highs set in January, a threshold analysts call a correction. Fidelity International's chief investment officer for Japan, Takashi Maruyama, said the ""massive volatility"" was a reaction to the rapid rise on the Japanese market since last year.  He added the sell-off presented a opportunity to buy shares at more ""reasonable"" prices. "
investors sentiments,Japan's yen rises after N Korea warning,2024-09-15,2017-09-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41356777,"The yen edged up 0.3% against the dollar on Friday after North Korea suggested it might test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean. It is not unusual for Japan's currency to climb during a crisis, as investors seek a safe haven until risks ease. But this crisis is slightly different, because the additional risks could be to Japan itself.   Analysts, however, say things would have to be catastrophic for investors to flee the currency.        The yen is an extremely resilient currency, and it has risen during previous times of crisis in Japan.  It climbed 0.8% against the dollar when North Korea fired a missile over Japan in late August, and also gained during a second launch two weeks later.   After the 2011 tsunami and nuclear disaster at Fukushima, there was such a surge that the government and the G7 countries had to intervene.  So what would it take to send investors running from the yen?   ""It'd have to be a really, really extreme event. Even if there is a war, I'd expect the yen to strengthen,"" said Takuji Okubo from Japan Macro Advisors. This latest crisis is nowhere near that level.  In fact, Mr Okubo said one reason the yen is strengthening right now is that Japanese investors actually think the risk of armed conflict is very low.  Instead, they are worried about the possible impact of a trade blockade or a drop in consumer sentiment hitting sales of homes or cars. If the main risks are economic, then investors might not see much difference between this crisis and any other risk.       ""If the risk is financial and economic, you would want to increase your cash reserve and generally curtail your risk exposure,"" he said.   Other analysts think investors simply lack other good options if their main goal is to to keep their money somewhere safe until conditions improve. That includes the other traditional safe haven, the US dollar, in part because the Federal Reserve's current monetary policies might not be carried out if Janet Yellen is not reappointed as chair next year.  ""Directionless, rudderless and leaderless America is looking unattractive"" said David Kuo from the Motley Fool. ""Investors are therefore bereft of places to park their money. Switzerland is not big enough. Nor is Singapore. The eurozone is in a mess. So that just leaves Japan,"" he said."
investors sentiments,Oil industry ire at fuel tax plan,2024-09-15,2011-03-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12831894,"Soaring motoring costs burden both private individuals and companies Motoring costs should fall for families and businesses as a result of fuel duty changes announced in the Budget. Chancellor George Osborne announced a 1p per litre cut in fuel duty, effective from 1800 GMT, while also cancelling a fuel duty escalator and delaying other planned duty rises. But he got a cool reception from the oil industry after saying the cut would be funded by taxing North Sea oil more. Meanwhile, shadow chancellor Ed Balls blamed rising VAT for high pump prices. ""The idea that drivers around the country should be grateful for a 1p cut in fuel duty when George Osborne's VAT rise is adding 3p to the price of petrol is laughable,"" Mr Balls said. The moves by Mr Osborne come in response to a recent surge in global oil prices. As well as cutting fuel duty this year, he said that an inflation-linked rise in duty planned for next week would be delayed until next year. He also scrapped the fuel duty escalator, which was initially introduced by the previous government. ""The fuel duty escalator, that adds an extra penny on top of inflation every year, will be cancelled,"" he said, ""not just for this year, or next year, but for the rest of this Parliament"". Under the old system the fuel duty would have risen by the rate of inflation, plus 1p per litre.  Instead, the fuel duty will fall by 1p per litre. ""We will delay the inflation rise in duty planned for next week until next year - and also delay the April 2012 inflation rise until the following summer."" ""It's about doing what we can to help with the high cost of living and the high cost of oil,"" the chancellor said. The cut will be financed by taxing the oil industry, Mr Osborne said. ""The price of oil has risen 35% in just five months,"" he said. ""Oil companies are making unexpected profits."" Hence, he would introduce what he described as a ""fair fuel stabiliser"". ""From tomorrow the supplementary charge levied on oil and gas production will increase from 20% to 32%,"" he said. This, he said, would raise an additional £2bn ($3.3bn). ""I don't want important investment in the North Sea lost,"" Mr Osborne continued. Hence, ""if the oil price sustains a fall below $75 - and we will consult on the precise figure - we will reintroduce the escalator and reduce the new oil tax in proportion"". In other words, there would be no fuel duty escalator when oil prices are high, and no additional oil tax when oil prices are low, he explained. But the plans were given a cool reception by the petrochemicals industry. ""This tax hike could have a chilling impact on future investment in the North Sea,"" said Mark Hanafin, managing director of Centrica Energy. ""With more than 50% of Britain's gas now imported, it is vital for our energy security and for the economy that investment is maintained to ensure we extract all of the untapped hydrocarbons we can."" The government was backtracking on a promise given at the previous budget, nine months ago, to deliver a stable tax regime which provided certainty for investors, according to Malcolm Webb, chief executive of Oil & Gas UK. ""The industry is shocked to now be hit by a tax increase that raises the tax rate to at least 62%, with some of the most mature and therefore vulnerable fields now paying up to 81%,"" he said. ""This change in the tax regime will decrease investment, increase imports and drive UK jobs to other areas of the world."" Motoring organisations welcomed the changes in fuel duty. RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: ""Thirty-four million drivers will welcome this, as will hauliers.""  AA president Edmund King said ""this action has probably stopped a 'summer of discontent'"". This video can not be played Watch: George Osborne announces changes to motoring costs ""For many it will be more important than all the other tax announcements put together,"" said John Lewis, chief executive of the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association. But environmentalists disapproved. ""In the face of a global oil crisis, this Budget will increase the UK's oil addiction,"" said Andy Atkins, executive director of Friends of the Earth. Business leaders have warned about the effect of rising fuel prices on consumer sentiment. ""Fuel and fuel price inflation is playing its part in driving the pressure on customers' budgets,"" said Justin King, chief executive of supermarket chain and petrol retailer Sainsbury's.

investors sentiments,Digital doodles and electric bees,2024-09-15,2011-05-19,Andrew Webb,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-13443240,"This video can not be played Ellie Gibson plays with a giant Etch-A-Sketch imitation game and walks among a ""swarm"" of motors at Manchester's FutureEverything Festival   If there was ever a winning formula to whip up interest in an invention, it must be to evoke memories of an age gone by. So the giant Etch-A-Sketch that formed part of Manchester's FutureEverything festival could hardly fail to please. The annual event celebrates the work of tech tinkerers and professional researchers. Created by the MadLab inventors group, the giant doodling toy was the first thing seen by visitors to the Victoria Baths Handicraft faire - one of the main venues of the festival. Instead of powdered aluminium being squirted along the Etch-A-Sketch screen, the Project-A-Sketch uses an Arduino microcontrolller to detect when knobs are turned to control where a line is drawn. A computer projects an electronic representation of the toy's screen onto the Project A Sketch screen. The makers' microcontroller: open source Arduino boards are used by many design enthusiasts It has even captured the imagination of BBC engineers. ""They connected it to an Xbox Kinect motion controller during the Royal Wedding celebrations"", said MadLab co-founder Hwa Young Jung.  People approaching it at the Manchester group's workshop could change the volume of a video showing the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra. The fascination in tinkering with the established world is what drives MadLab. Funded in part by local art bodies, this week its DIY Biology Group is waiting eagerly to see what bacteria it has cultivated on swabs taken from bus stops. Ms Jung says ""We have no idea what we'll find."" Motor swarm Swarm of motors: Antony Hall suspended electric fans from the Victoria Baths rafters In the drained swimming pool next door to the handicraft fair, audio artist Antony Hall was putting the final touches to a display of plastic motorised fans. They were suspended by long cables from the ceiling and swayed above electric guitar pickups mounted, which are built to convert the sound of vibrating strings into electricity. As the motors approached the pole-mounted pickups, they caused electromagnetic interference, making the huge room sound as though angry electric bees were buzzing about. ""The idea is for people to walk among them and adjust them"", Mr Hall said. ""As they swing towards you they move, so it's impossible to make them do what you want them to."" The task proved so difficult that one of the amused participants caused a collision between a pole and a fan, making one pickup smash onto the hard tiled floor.  Sound workshop Mr Hall's residency at the Baths included a workshop for artists to experiment with electrical appliances.

""We looked at the materials we had and we tried to fill the space (the room) with as much sound as possible."" Open data The technique of making an everyday item work in a way it is not designed to has sparked a new fad over the last year. Countless hacks of the Xbox motion controller have taken place since its 2010 launch. This video can not be played The Lit Tree is an artistic work which uses LEDs and an xBox Kinect camera to mimic movement, as Ellie Gibson reports FutureEverything has been sporting one such example. The Lit Tree uses the Kinect camera to monitor the position of hands and fingers placed beneath it.  A computer processes the camera image and illuminates a tree in a pattern that matches wherever the hand is placed. The work is part of a display about reinterpreting data. Drew Hemment, director and founder of FutureEverything, introduced the concept of open data to the show. The aim is to enable electronic information to be more tangible for people who are not ""geeks"", as he put it. ""It's making these huge data bases that public organisations now control and sit on, freely available,"" he said. ""It could be data on anything, from where the buses are, to the environment, to our local neighbourhoods. People can build applications and artwork on top of that"". OurCity While some open data projects may be very technical, the OurCity project is intended to interpret information in a way everyone can relate to.  OurCity, designed by Adam Nieman and Will Simm, displays comments by members of the public and categorises them by location and whether they are positive or not Manchester residents and visitors are being asked to pass comment on the city by text message or via a website, external. Each message appears as a thought bubble on a table-top display, linked into the location that the observation was made. ""It's not all Coronation Street"", says one. ""It's a shame that witches were dunked here"" says another - a reference to the city's less savoury history of drowning suspected witches. ""We're using software developed by the University of Lancaster"", explains project artist Adam Nieman. ""It organises comments by theme or sentiment or actionability. We're asking about people's feelings about Manchester and the values they attribute and also their hopes for Manchester's future."" The comments provide a snapshot of life in the city, even if some may seem a little trivial. A hot debate over whether the Arndale shopping centre is ""great"" or ""rubbish"" has ensued. Whatever your views on such burning issues, few could argue with the sentiments of one view that floats around the display board: ""Football is more important to Manchester than other cities.""

investors sentiments,China fires officials over crash,2024-09-15,2011-07-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-14271163,"This video can not be played The two high-speed trains collided in eastern China, state media reports China has fired three senior railway officials following a high-speed train crash that left 35 people dead. The government has also halted services of 58 other trains and called for a nationwide safety check. The accident is the latest in a series of problems for the high-speed network, which has been dogged by controversies, including accusations of corruption. On Saturday, two train coaches fell off a bridge, after derailing close to Wenzhou in Zhejiang province. The railway ministry said it had sacked the head of the Shanghai railway bureau, his deputy and the bureau's Communist Party chief. ""As leaders... they should take ultimate responsibility for the main cause of the accident,"" railways ministry spokesman Wang Yongping said.  The accident comes at a time when China has been spending billions of dollars to build a high-speed rail network across the country. Last month it inaugurated the Beijing-Shanghai link, reducing the travel time between the two cities by half. However, the project has come under fire for various reasons. The first amongst those has been the high cost. The Beijing-Shanghai line cost 215bn yuan ($33bn; £21bn). To make matters difficult for the authorities, the high-profile link suffered problems due to a series of power outages soon after its launch. That raised doubts about the reliability of the high-speed network. The latest crash has fuelled those concerns with questions being raised about safety. However, Mr Wang of the railway ministry sought to quell fears. ""There will be many people who think that this is a safety problem caused by high-speed rail itself,"" he said.  ""I should still say to people that China's high-speed rail technology is up to date and up to standard, and we still have faith in it.""  While Chinese officials have reiterated their faith in the high-speed network, investor confidence in the sector has been dented.  Shares of Chinese rail equipment makers fell, as investors were concerned about the impact of the accident on companies associated with the sector. Shares of China South Locomotive and Rolling Stock Corp Limited, the company that made the trains that collided, slumped as much as 16% to hit at 12-month low on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  China Northern Locomotive, another key player in the sector saw its shares fall 6.5% in Shanghai. On the other hand, shares of Chinese airlines rose as investors picked up their stocks in the hope that people will prefer flights over rail travel in wake of the accident, thereby boosting the profits of the carriers. Shares of Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines all gained more than 4%. Analysts said that markets were concerned that orders at the country's rail equipment makers may also be hit.  ""Sentiment was dampened by the accident,"" said Mark Po of UOB Kay Hian. ""This is adding more uncertainties to the already weak sector as safety checks may delay the process of awarding contracts to the equipment providers,"" he added. China is expected to spend up to 4tn yuan on its rail sector as part of its five year plan to 2015. However, Mr Po said the accident could see that change. ""Nobody can tell whether these targets are still intact,"" he said. Aftermath of train collision. VideoAftermath of train collision Dozens die in China train crash China tests new bullet train.

investors sentiments,US shares set records as investor optimism grows,2024-09-15,2020-11-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55064041,"US shares hit fresh records on Tuesday with the Dow Jones index closing above 30,000 points for the first time amid hopes of a strong economic recovery and end of political uncertainty. The S&P 500 also hit an all-time high as investors bought economically sensitive financial and energy stocks. Trading was fuelled by positive Covid vaccine news and moves to start the Joe Biden presidential transition. Europe's main markets also jumped, with London's FTSE 100 closing up 1.5%. President Donald Trump has given the green light for the formal transfer of power to begin following Mr Biden's election victory. And positive news about coronavirus vaccines has boosted hopes that the US and global economies could be on the path to normality next year.  Asian markets followed Wall Street's lead, with Japan's Nikkei up nearly 2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index 1.4% higher.  Indexes in South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore have all edged higher. ""The possibility of having a vaccine next year increases the odds that we're going to see demand return in the new year,"" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at US-based Baird, said: ""If 2020 has shown us anything it is that stock markets have a tremendous ability to look past bad news if there is sun on the horizon."" Analysts say market sentiment was also helped by news suggesting Mr Biden wants former Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen as his treasury secretary. Yellen tipped as first US female treasury secretary Fed fights move to end some Covid support measures Among the big Wall Street share movers were plane-maker Boeing, up 3.3%, and oil company Chevron, 5% ahead. Investment banks Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase closed up 3.8% and 4.6% respectively. Other big gainers included Disney, American Express and IBM. A rise in Tesla shares took the electric carmaker's market value above $500bn (£374bn). At the close, the Dow Jones was up 1.54% at 30,046.2, while the S&P 500 gained 1.62% to 3,635.4. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose 1.3%, to 12,036.7. Oil prices also rose, with US crude up 4.25% to $44.89 a barrel and Brent up 4% at $47.89. The gold price, a favoured asset when investors are fearful, fell 1.6% to $1,806 an ounce. But the bullish sentiment comes despite US coronavirus cases surging and millions of Americans still unemployed, and some analysts fear shares are due a reality check. Rising Covid-19 cases and delayed economic stimulus measures are red flags, said James McDonald, chief executive of Hercules Investments. But it is not just in the US where shares are surging. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.91%, while the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.44%, putting it on track to close at a record high."
investors sentiments,UK tech talent shortage threatens to stifle growth,2024-09-15,2022-07-15,By Shiona McCallum,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-62098767,"The UK technology sector has a talent shortage which could ""stifle growth"", an industry body has warned. Liz Scott, from TechNation, said it was ""a real issue"" which must be rectified.  There were more than two million UK job vacancies in tech last year, more than any other labour area, but an industry coalition says nearly 12 million workers lack essential digital skills.  The government told the BBC it was working very closely with industry on digital skills training.  However, schemes like boot camps, apprenticeships and degree apprenticeships do not seem to be enough to address the gap.  Michelle Donelan, former education minister, said: ""Employers both large and small are crying out for more people to be trained in digital skills.  ""An apprenticeship is a fantastic way to achieve that. Not just for young people, but also those looking to upskill."" But, according to government figures, nearly half of all apprentices across all sectors, not only in tech, dropped out last year.  Data cited in the latest UK jobs report from professional services network KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation showed candidate numbers for job vacancies has been falling. The report said this is because of: One place which is teaching young people important tech subjects is ADA, the National College for Digital Skills, in London.  It encourages students towards core Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and mathematics - that form the backbone of the industry. Principal Tina Gotschi said: ""A lot of the jobs that these students will do in the future don't even exist at this point - a lot of those will be digital jobs.  ""The college was initially founded to address the skills gap, but unfortunately over time, it is just getting greater.  ""The pipeline of students coming through is shrinking and there is a lack of computer science teachers too."" There is a financial incentive to getting digital skills. According to TechNation, tech salaries are nearly 80% higher, on average, than salaries for non-tech jobs in the UK.  The average tech salary is £62,000, which is more than double the average household income in the UK.  Ronan Harris, managing director of Google (UK and Ireland) told the BBC that big tech companies are trying to play a part in providing people with qualifications. ""We've trained over 800,000 people in the UK in a range of digital skills,"" he said. ""We want people to be excited about technology. But increasingly, what we're seeing is all jobs that are being advertised have some form of digital requirement to them.""  It's a sentiment with which Ben Francis, founder of online clothing apparel company Gymshark, agrees. ""The historical view of someone that works in tech, he's probably, you know, a bit more of like a geeky sort of person.  ""But I think the more unconventional view of techies is that tech is a creative outlet.""  Gymshark is a UK tech start-up success story. The company achieved unicorn status in 2020, meaning it is valued at $1bn (£848m) or higher. ""If you're a great graphic designer, if you're a great web designer, if you want to create great apps or NFTs - all of that is done through tech and understanding of tech,"" said the entrepreneur. James Hallahan, director at recruitment company Hays, said: ""Due to the increase in digital transformation over the past few years - the demand for tech talent shows no signs of slowing down."" He added that roles with skill shortages included software developers, data scientists, data analysts, enterprise architects and programme and project managers. However, a sizeable chunk of the British workforce is nowhere near skilled enough to apply for positions like those, according to industry coalition FutureDotNow. It says that some 11.8 million workers lack basic digital skills - let alone more complex ones. However, Ms Scott says: ""There are good jobs available here. We just need people to understand that they're available and then know how to access them and know where to get the right signpost in for retraining or reskilling courses."" Where people live may also be becoming less of a barrier. Over the last decade, UK companies like Deliveroo, Darktrace and Depop have been started, funded and scaled by driven entrepreneurs and investors.  Fintech companies are also growing, with the likes of Monzo, Starling, Marshmallow and Cazoo all achieving unicorn status.  The majority of them have had major ties to London, but that is slowly changing. Demand for tech talent is increasing across the UK with the number of professionals with the right skills expanding at a faster pace in the north of England than in London, according to information technology company Accenture.  Shaheen Sayed, its technology lead in the UK, said: ""Businesses have been bullish in investing in technology and hiring - particularly in skills such as AI, cloud and robotics. ""The pool of technology professionals is also expanding, with growth in the north [of England] outpacing growth in the south [of England], and emerging technology hubs in Edinburgh and Manchester starting to compete with the capital.""

investors sentiments,Asia markets join global stock plunge,2024-09-15,2018-02-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42956234,"Asian markets plunged on Tuesday as investors dumped stocks following the biggest US market fall for six years At one point Japan's Nikkei 225 index was down 7%, but recovered some of those losses to close 4.7% lower. London, Frankfurt and Paris all fell sharply when they opened on Tuesday with new losses of up to 3%. In the US overnight the Dow lost 4.6%. The falls follow some good years for investors. In 2017 the Dow was up 25%, helped by a resurgent economy. Strong profits and low interest rates also underpinned the positive investment climate. This global sell-off began last week after a solid US jobs report fuelled expectations that the economy's strength was such the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates faster than expected.  The softness of markets over the last few days is down to one thing. As monetary policy begins its long journey away from the trillions of pounds of stimulus pumped into the system to keep the economic ship from the rocks, shareholders are beginning to wonder how much of their investments are in companies with strong fundamentals. And how much is simply holding up an asset bubble - frothy prices led ever higher in an era of ultra low interest rates and cheap money.  Fingers are hovering over the ""sell"" button. And once investors start looking at their portfolio and selling out of the froth, automatic algorithmic trading tends to ""chase the dip"". Read more from Kamal here: Jane Sydenham, investment director at the stockbrokers Rathbones, told the BBC the falls did not appear to herald a serious change of sentiment: ""It is always a bit too early to tell, but I think these recent market falls are in the nature of a correction.  ""What we have to remember is stock markets have had a very smooth ride upwards and we've not had a fall of more than 3% for 15 months. There's been a real lack of volatility, which is very unusual."" She added that bear markets tend to happen ahead of a recession and at the moment growth forecasts were being upgraded. Erin Gibbs, portfolio manager for S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""This isn't a collapse of the economy.  ""This is concern that the economy is actually doing much better than expected and so we need to re-evaluate."" One country whose immediate economic outlook remains stagnant is Japan. The authorities there said there was little chance of interest rates being increased. The Bank of Japan's governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, ruled out the possibility of raising interest rates in the near future. He said it was ""inappropriate"" to do so with inflation still about half its 2% target. But markets in Asia typically follow the lead from the US.  Elsewhere in the region, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed down 1,649.8 points - or 5.12% - at 30,595.42 and South Korea's Kospi index gave up 2.6%. Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 lost 3.2%.  On Monday the Dow Jones Industrial Average index tumbled 1,175 points, or 4.6% to close down at 24,345.75.  The decline was the largest in percentage terms for the Dow since August 2011, when markets dropped in the aftermath of ""Black Monday"" - the day Standard & Poor's downgraded its credit rating of the US.  The drop on the Dow was closely followed by the wider S&P 500 stock index, down 4.1% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq, which lost 3.7%.  The White House moved to reassure investors saying it was focused on ""long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong"". Analysts say that in the short term, investors should be prepared for choppier stock markets. Joel Prakken, chief US economist for IHS Markit, predicts share price gains will be limited over the next two years. ""The difference between this year and last year is we're going to see more periods of volatility like this as the market reacts to higher inflation,"" he said.  ""We're just not used to it because it's been so long since we've had a significant correction."" However, he added that markets would need to deteriorate more significantly for him to start to worry about the broader economy. Asian markets, on the other hand, have benefitted from record low US interest rates in the last decade because money has flowed into Asia in search of stronger returns. Analysts say the expected rate rises could impact Asia over the longer term."
investors sentiments,The week Facebook's value plunged $58bn,2024-09-15,2018-03-23,By Josh Martin,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43517995,"Facebook ended the week $58bn lower in value after its handling of a historic data breach. Its founder Mark Zuckerberg apologised for data breaches that affected 50 million users. The apology did not stop investors from selling shares in Facebook, with many wondering just how bad the damage would be for the social network. The breach was called a ""light bulb"" moment for users, spawning the social media trend #deletefacebook. All the negative headlines led to some advertisers saying ""enough is enough"". Shares in the social media company fell from $176.80 on Monday to around $159.30 by Friday night. Facebook's initial public offering in 2012 priced shares at $38 each, giving the company a market valuation of close to $104bn. Following steady user growth and a dominant space in the digital advertising market ensuring revenues, Facebook's share price climbed to $190 by February this year. Brian Wieser, senior analyst at Pivotal Research, said he had one of the most negative outlooks for Facebook's share price on Wall Street. ""I had a $152 price target on Facebook for 2018 - and that was before the events of this week"". Mr Wieser said the share price slump showed investors were wary of increased regulation and users leaving the platform ""but there's little risk of advertisers leaving Facebook. Where else would they go?"" Hargreaves Lansdown senior analyst Laith Khalaf said the week had been a ""damaging episode"" in Facebook's history. ""One of the secrets of Facebook's success has been that the more people who use Facebook, the more integral it becomes to its customers. Unfortunately for Facebook, the same dynamic cuts in the opposite direction if it loses a meaningful number of users as a result of this scandal. "" Advertising firm M&C Saatchi's founding director David Kershaw said the revelations that a 2014 Facebook quiz essentially harvested data from users and their connected friends without consent have led to a backlash from advertisers. ""Clients have come to the point, quite rightly, where enough is enough, "" Mr Kershaw said. Advertisers Mozilla and Commerzbank on Wednesday suspended ads on the social media platform. On Friday tech entrepreneur Elon Musk had the official Facebook pages for his companies Telsa and Space X deleted. ""Make no mistake Facebook is an amazing medium from the advertiser's point of view because of the accuracy of its targeting - which comes from data. But I think those large companies are very nervous to be associated with a medium where the data is being abused, particularly in a political context,"" Mr Kershaw said. Mr Kershaw told the BBC any change in Facebook's data protection policy was more likely to come from the threat of a withdrawal of ""hard money from advertisers rather than consumers running hashtag [campaigns] on Twitter,"" referring to the #DeleteFacebook and #BoycottFacebook hashtags that have become popular. UK advertising group ISBA met Facebook on Friday and said its ""constructive and challenging"" summit had convinced the group that the social media company was taking steps to ""rapidly address public and advertiser concerns"", including app audits and face-to-face meetings with individual UK advertising clients. It will take some time before it becomes clear if the advertising industry's dissatisfaction with Facebook leads to them actually pulling their money out of the social network, or whether the howls of condemnation amount to mere posturing from a group of concerned clients. The Facebook founder tried to reassure users ""the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago."" However, Passion Capital tech investor Eileen Burbidge, who is also on the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Group, said Facebook's reassurance to users and clients took too long. ""The fact that it took them five days to come out with a statement, which happened to be a fair, sensible and comprehensive statement, was just far too long,"" Mrs Burbidge said. ""I think they were just really tone deaf for too many days."" The technology venture capitalist said Facebook underestimated the consumer backlash that occurred once their data was used for political purposes. Cambridge Analytica is at the centre of a row over whether it used the personal data of millions of Facebook users to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum. ""Some people are using the term 'political manipulation'. ""They [Facebook] assumed they had already taken care of this... as they had already changed their terms of service, for example,"" Mrs Burbidge said. In Mr Zuckerberg's online statement he offered a timeline of how Facebook's data permission agreements with users and other companies had changed since the 2014 personality quiz app was able to scrape data from quiz takers and their contacts without their express permission. Mrs Burbidge said there may need to be new regulation over political campaigning ""which really hasn't kept up with social media"". Technology writer Kate Bevan said the week's events have woken Facebook's users up to the fact that the platform's games, quizzes and apps could harvest their data for more serious intents.  ""This week feels to me like a real light bulb moment where people are understanding that it's not just clicking 'like' on Facebook, it's giving your data away"". The sentiment was echoed by the European Union's commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality Vera Jourova who said the Cambridge Analytica allegations had been  about the demand for their data. ""The tiger has gotten out of the cage""."
investors sentiments,Stock markets sink amid alarm at Covid surge,2024-09-15,2020-10-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54723911,"Financial markets have tumbled around the world for a second day this week amid concerns that a rise in coronavirus cases will hurt still tentative economic recoveries. Major US indexes sank 3.4% or more, while European bourses also saw steep falls.  The UK's FTSE 100 ended almost 2.6% lower, and Germany's Dax dropped 4.2%. The declines were widespread, as investors sold-off shares in favour of less risky assets like the US dollar. In the US, travel and energy firms, which are sensitive to concerns about the pandemic, suffered some of the steepest losses.  Tech companies were also hit. Shares in Google, Facebook and Twitter all slid more than 5%, as their bosses were grilled by senators in Washington about how the firms should moderate speech on their platforms. The negative sentiment spilled over into Asian markets on Thursday with Australia's ASX 200 down 1.6% while in Hong Kong the Hang Seng index slipped 1.2%. However, these falls were modest compared to US and European bourses. In the UK, mining companies on the FTSE 100 took a hit, while on France's CAC 40 index, which dropped 3.4%, carmaker Renault was the biggest loser with an 8% drop. The declines mark a second day of steep falls this week, which has seen many countries report record numbers of new coronavirus cases, leading to strains in health systems and fresh lockdown restrictions in France and Germany. The Dow closed 3.4% lower, shedding more than 900 points to end at a level last seen in late July. The wider S&P 500 and Nasdaq retreated to September levels, falling 3.5% and 3.7% respectively.  By contrast, financial markets in Asia, where the virus is seen as being under better control, have fared better. On Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei and Hong Kong's Hang Seng indexes closed down about 0.3%. In the US, investors are also on edge ahead of a close US presidential election. A defeat of current President Donald Trump could lead to tougher regulation for some sectors, including technology and oil and gas.  Analysts say fears that the results could remain uncertain for some time are also weighing on sentiment."
investors sentiments,Shares surge as political and trade tensions ease,2024-09-15,2019-12-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50814766,"UK shares rose again on Monday as investors welcomed more political certainty following the election and easing of global trade tensions. New York's indexes closed at record closing highs after Washington and Beijing agreed to pause their ongoing trade dispute. London's FTSE 100 rose another 2.6% on top of Friday's gains to reach its highest level in more than four months.  The FTSE 250, which reflects the UK economy more closely, rose 1.8%. Will Hobbs, chief investment officer for Barclays Investment Solutions, said assets closely  related to the outlook for the UK economy ""had laboured under a black cloud of UK related political and economic uncertainty for a few years"". ""Following the recent election results, and a clearer path out of the EU in sight, this cloud seems to have dissipated a little. Nonetheless, for the world's investors, there have been more important developments to digest, namely the progress made towards a phase 1 trade deal between the US and China,"" he added. UK shares surged on Friday after it became clear that Boris Johnson's Conservative Party would have a decisive parliamentary majority, allowing them to pass legislation and move ahead with the stalled Brexit process. The prime minister now plans to submit his Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament on Friday. While many businesses oppose Brexit they have also struggled to plan for the future due to the prolonged period of uncertainty. Beyond the UK's domestic climate investors have also been encouraged by the agreement between the US and China which avoided a new round of tariffs being imposed at the weekend. US and European indexes all traded higher on Monday.  Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG, said ""positive sentiment over an impending US-China trade deal"" was continuing to cheer investors. The so-called phase one agreement was agreed on Friday, and includes elements dealing with intellectual property protections, technology, currency and financial services. Under the deal Phase One trade deal Washington will reduce some tariffs on Chinese imports and China will purchase US agricultural, manufactured and energy products.  The Dow Jones closed up 0.35% at 28,234. The S&P 500 gained 0.71% to close at 3,191 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.91% to reach  8,814."
investors sentiments,Energy and food drive US inflation to 40-year high,2024-09-15,2022-06-10,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61762131,"Prices in the US rose faster than expected last month, as rising energy and food costs pushed inflation to the highest rate since 1981. The annual inflation rate rose to 8.6% in May, the Labor Department said, after easing in April. The rising cost of living has been squeezing households and putting pressure on policymakers to bring the issue under control. The US central bank has been raising interest rates since March. Analysts had hoped that the moves were starting to work to cool economic activity, easing the price pressures. But the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has driven up the price of oil and commodities like wheat as it disrupts exports from the two countries, has made tackling the problem more difficult. Food prices were up more than 10% last month compared to May 2021, while energy surged more than 34%. But Friday's report showed the increases continue to spread throughout the economy, pushing the cost of everything from airline tickets and clothing to medical services higher. ""So much for the idea that inflation has peaked. Consumer prices blew past expectations - and not in a good way with the 8.6% annual increase the fastest in more than 40 years,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.  ""Worse the increases were nearly ubiquitous. Just no place to hide."" The US has been grappling with rising prices since last year, when an unexpectedly strong economic rebound from the shock of the pandemic - driven by large doses of US government spending, including direct cheques to households - overwhelmed supplies, prompting companies to raise prices. Now the war in Ukraine has spread the problem around the world, with Covid-related shutdowns in China this spring contributing. As the rising costs hit household purchasing power and prompt a pullback in spending, officials are warning that growth in many countries is at risk of a sharp downturn. ""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" World Bank President David Malpass said this week. US stock markets fell in the wake of the inflation reports, with all three major indexes dropping more than 2%. The falls added to weeks of declines in US shares, as investors become nervous about the path for the economy. ""Even if inflation peaks soon, it's unlikely to decelerate quickly."" said Richard Flynn, managing director of Charles Schwab UK. ""High prices may put pressure on consumer spending into the medium term.  ""Add ongoing supply-chain problems and the economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine to the threat of inflation, and it's easy to see why fears of a downturn have risen swiftly.""  For now, the US labour market has continued to add jobs, a sign that growth is continuing. But wages have not kept pace as prices climb. The rising cost of living has especially hit lower income households, for whom basics like food and energy make up large portions of spending. Polls show a majority of Americans see inflation as the top problem facing the country. Consumer sentiment has plunged and US President Joe Biden's approval ratings have sunk as Republicans criticise him over the issue. Over the month, prices gained 1%, driven by the rising cost of petrol, which has hit new records in the US, approaching an average of nearly $5 a gallon. In hearings in Washington this week, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said bringing down prices was the ""number one priority"". In a statement, Mr Biden said ""we must do more - and quickly - to get prices down here in the United States"". ""I'm doing everything in my power to blunt Putin's price hike, and bring down the cost of oil and food,"" the president later pledged at a speech at the Port of Los Angeles in California. Roberto Perli, head of global policy research at Piper Sandler investment bank, said he expected prices to come under control as America's central bank, the Federal Reserve, increases interest rates. But he warned that raising borrowing costs will hurt economic growth. ""For now, the US economy is very healthy and you see it reflected in the fact that there is such a strong demand for pretty much everything, goods and services.

The proposed Afan Valley Adventure Resort near Port Talbot promises the equivalent of 700 full-time jobs. However, ITV News and The Guardian have made claims of a multi-million pound ""black hole"" in Gavin Woodhouse's hotel and care homes businesses.  Mr Woodhouse said he would contest the claims and insisted it was ""full steam ahead"" for the adventure resort. Plans for the resort on forestry land at Pen-y-Bryn were given outline conditional planning approval by Neath Port Talbot councillors in March. In May, Mr Woodhouse told the Local Democracy Reporting Service that his hotels were financed by the sale of rooms to investors who would then lease them back to him for an income. He said a very similar model was being used in the early days of the adventure resort project. However, the ITV/Guardian investigation claimed three of four care homes Mr Woodhouse had raised millions of pounds to open had not been built. Seven investors who put their savings into businesses owned by Mr Woodhouse have now begun legal action, applying to the High Court to have four of his companies taken into administration.  Speaking again to the Local Democracy Reporting Service on Thursday, Mr Woodhouse defended himself against the investigation's claims and insisted: ""The resort will still go ahead. ""They've got two and two, and come up with 65,"" he said. ""We disagree with the sentiments of the article and we will be contesting it through the correct channels. ""It's full steam ahead, it's not going to stop us achieving our goals."" In a statement, Mr Woodhouse's Northern Powerhouse Developments said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the ITV/Guardian investigation, describing it as ""misleading and inaccurate"". ""We remain committed to delivering the projects we have promised our investors,"" the statement added, saying ""the vast majority"" had not voiced concerns. The company also said it was in dialogue with Neath Port Talbot council about finalising the ""detailed and complex"" obligations needed for full planning permission for the resort.   Scott Jones, the local county councillor for the area, said: ""The news has shocked a lot of people. ""However, as far as I am concerned from the information I have received it's not dead in the water."""
investors sentiments,Boycotts: 'The dustbin of outrage',2024-09-15,2023-08-30,Meredith Turits,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230829-why-boycotts-eventually-fall-into-the-dustbin-of-outrage,"Some boycotts garner a lot of attention. Yet people generally move on, leaving even the hottest-button issues of consumer umbrage in the past. For the first time in six years, Target announced a sales drop: a decline of 5% in the April to June 2023 period, compared with the same time in 2022. During that time, the big-box retailer was also embroiled in a controversy over their collection of merchandise for Pride Month, which spurred consumer backlash and boycotts from some politically conservative shoppers. Coincidence? Perhaps not, said Christina Hennington, Target's executive vice president, on the company's Q2 2023 earnings call. She attributed the sales decline in part to a ""strong reaction to this year's Pride assortment"" that affected store traffic, and also cut the company's full-year forecast.  A couple weeks before Target announced its sales slump, international beverage giant Anheuser-Busch InBev also noted a sharp decline in US sales and profits, in part due to a conservative-led boycott of Bud Light. After collaborating with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, the brand said its Q2 revenue had fallen 10.5% compared to the same period last year – ""primarily due to the volume decline of Bud Light"", according to the earnings report. These high-profile boycotts are just two in a string of recent consumer pushbacks that have put popular brands in the crosshairs. Yet as powerful as these movements seem while they're in motion – and as much they can cut into companies' bottom lines – expert say many eventually pass.  Emotion and affinity Most movements against products and companies are emotionally charged, says Maurice Schweitzer, a professor of management who researches behavioural decision making at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, US. When companies take a stance, it often lights a fire under consumers, who have a strong psychological and gut response that causes them to act. But people must remain upset for a boycott to stick, and the early intensity of the driving emotion usually diminishes – the feeling of urgency to boycott fades along with it, even if it's hard to imagine it ever will. ""It feels intense and overwhelming in the moment, but it tapers. And that's true for every emotion. It works against boycotts' effectiveness,"" says Schweitzer. After a while, sustaining a boycott often becomes inconvenient and potentially expensive, too. As much as consumers may react strongly to perceived company missteps, he says they also don't want to make their own lives harder – whether that means driving an extra 15 minutes to go to another retailer for supplies, or paying more for a substitute product. He points to the American boycott of BP after the disaster at the Deepwater Horizon rig in 2010. Thousands of people signed an online commitment to boycott BP's petrol stations, yet the vow didn't seem to take hold on a wide scale. ""You think there are a million gas stations, and it's easy to change. But the gas station locations are incredibly well selected,"" he says. ""Even making an extra left turn to go to another gas station – people prefer not to do that."" If there are more alternatives, such as in the case of Bud Light, consumers may be willing to hold back their dollars longer. ""Bud Light is a mainstream staple beer, and there's a lot of equal-quality beers sitting right next to it in the refrigerator of any grocery store. So, it's very substitutable,"" says Brayden King, a professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, US. The nature of beer specifically, he says, makes it an easier product to boycott for ""an audience highly motivated to switch over"". (Indeed, Bud Light lost the spot at the US's top-selling beer in June.). Consumers may also hold onto their boycotts a little longer if the product is wrapped up in their social identities. Schweitzer compares Bud Light to Target: at a bar, the people around you will notice you choosing to drink Bud Light instead of another brand; yet ""fourth graders aren't saying, 'hey, where did you get your pencils?'"". Boycott backfire Although the outraged groups are usually the loudest, they're often not the biggest. Even if boycott movements cut into corporate profits in the short term as opponents mobilise, Schweitzer says the slice of consumers who choose to boycott – and sustain doing so – usually isn't big enough to move the dial long-term. In some cases, he adds, boycotts can even boost sales for small periods. In 2018, when Nike debuted an advert with American football quarterback and racial-justice advocate Colin Kaepernick, the brand was met with uproar – along with calling for boycotts, some consumers even burnt their trainers in protest alongside the hashtag #JustBurnIt. Yet Nike's online sales grew by 31% during the bank holiday weekend following the ad's launch; the stock soared, and some analysts estimated Nike notched a $6bn (£4.75bn) gain throughout the following weeks, propelled largely by groups endorsing Nike's move. It was a kind of backlash to the backlash – pleased shoppers patronised Nike in support of their public stance in favour of Kaepernick's values. And although boycotts are meant to drag companies into the spotlight to punish them, increased visibility can sometimes have an upside. After Robert Unanue, CEO of Latin food purveyor Goya, praised then-President Donald Trump at a July 2020 White House meeting, boycotts broke out against the company, especially among liberals and Latino leaders. Yet the boycott may have been primed to fail, especially with the intense brand loyalty around Goya, and the fact that many of their products don't have comparable substitutes.  In fact, Northwestern University researchers showed that the spike in exposure actually drove up sales immediately after Unanue's remarks. This was especially the case among first-time purchasers, and those in heavily Republican areas. Perfect timing As for the current environment of boycotts, both experts say perfect timing is making the controversy around both Target and Bud Light stick, for now. At the core of these boycotts is one of the hottest-button issues in the deeply polarised US: gender, sexuality and identity. Especially as the US presidential election cycle begins, politicians are heightening the importance of these conflicts as they make the issues central to their campaigns, says King. In some cases, they're inserting themselves into the boycott conversations directly; in July, Florida governor and Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis announced an inquiry into Anheuser-Busch InBev regarding its partnership with influencer Mulvaney. What's more, adds Schweitzer, these conflicts centre on physical products and spokespeople, giving the controversies a visible presence in consumer consciousness. People can tangibly latch onto these images and share them to mobilise outrage, especially on social media. Specifically for Bud Light, King says the boycott may endure for a while as the brand is in a particularly difficult position, with few easy concessions to make. It's a more straightforward move to nix offensive products from shelves, for instance, but it's harder for a company to address ideological qualms, especially when they risk course-correcting too far in one direction. Yet again, however, the issues of the moment change, as do shoppers' attention. Especially as the amount of US consumer backlash skyrockets, especially among anti-""woke"" sentiment, people simply get overloaded and re-directed over and over. ""This is about attention – like, how long can we sustain people's attention to one grievance?"" says King. ""The public attention span is pretty limited. The people focus on one thing for a little bit, and they move on to the next thing … especially when there are so many targets out there."" Plus, the pull of consumer affinity for these brands may simply be too strong to make people quit them entirely. Schweitzer points to Disney, which has been at the centre of many boycotts. With immense loyalty and few replacements, former boycotters have returned to its parks. Similarly, Starbucks, Nike, Coca-Cola – all these oft-boycotted brands also have devoted fanbases who aren't willing to let go. That said, even if most consumers do abandon this boycott, King notes there still may be longer-term effects. ""Most of the impact of a boycott is the effect on company reputation, brand equity and also through the employee culture – people don't want to work for companies that are constantly being targeted by boycotts,"" says King. He adds that stock prices tend to dip following consumer backlashes, effects that can stick around. ""Investors care about boycotts, not only because they threaten their reputation, but also sometimes because they just reveal new information about the leadership of a company."" For now, Bud Light and Target's boycott problems endure. Yet Schewitzer expects these to eventually peter out, too. Practically everything, he says, ""joins the dustbin of outrage""."
investors sentiments,Morning business round-up,2024-09-15,2011-12-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-16198776,"What made the business news in Asia and Europe this morning? Here's our daily business round-up: The downturn in the 17 economies that share the euro eased slightly in December, according to a closely watched survey. The composite survey of thousands of firms by research firm Markit showed a continued contraction - but at a slower rate than in November. Manufacturing in Germany - the eurozone's strongest economy - shrank for the third month in a row. Japanese manufacturers' sentiment has turned pessimistic due to a strong yen and Europe's debt crisis, the latest Tankan survey has found. In its quarterly survey, the Bank of Japan said that confidence among large manufacturers in the three months to December dropped to a reading of minus four, down from plus two three months ago. The survey is one of the factors considered by the bank's rate-setters.  The merger of two major Latin American airlines has been approved, creating the largest carrier in the region.  Brazil's anti-trust authorities said they had approved the merger of the Brazilian airline TAM with Chile's LAN, first proposed in 2010. The new airline, LATAM, is valued at about $14.5bn (£9.4bn) and will represent 6% of global air transport. Last year, TAM and LAN flew more than 45 million passengers and 754,777 tonnes of cargo. Insurer Old Mutual is to sell its Nordic business to Skandia Liv for 22.5bn Swedish crowns ($3.2bn; £2bn). The division being sold includes savings and banking operations in Denmark, Norway and Sweden operating under the Skandia brand.  Money from the sale will be used to cut debt, with any surplus proceeds returned to shareholders. Japan's scandal-hit camera maker Olympus has retained its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange but has seen its shares fall sharply again. It filed five years' worth of reports on Wednesday, just three hours before a deadline set by the Tokyo exchange. However, Olympus's stock fell 20.8% on Thursday as investors worried that the company may be running short of cash.

investors sentiments,HK 'no longer autonomous from China' - Pompeo,2024-09-15,2020-05-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52824839,"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has told Congress that Hong Kong no longer merits special treatment under US law. The declaration could have major implications for Hong Kong's trade hub status and is likely to anger Beijing. ""No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground,"" he said in a statement. It follows Beijing's plan to impose a controversial new security law on the territory. The security law was ""only the latest in a series of actions that fundamentally undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms,"" Mr Pompeo said. ""It is now clear that China is modelling Hong Kong after itself,"" he added. Hong Kong police have arrested hundreds of people amid new anti-mainland unrest. Until now the US has given Hong Kong - a global financial and trading hub - special status under US law. The provision dates from when the territory was a British colony and gives it favourable trading terms. But since last year this status has been conditional on the US secretary of state regularly certifying that Hong Kong maintains sufficient autonomy from mainland China. If the secretary of state fails to certify this, the US Congress can revoke Hong Kong's special trade status. This would mean treating Hong Kong the same as mainland China for trade and other purposes. It could jeopardise billions of dollars worth of trade between Hong Kong and the US and could dissuade people from investing there in the future. It would also hurt mainland China, which uses Hong Kong as a kind of middleman for transactions with the rest of the world. Mainland companies and multinational firms use the territory as an international or regional base. Shortly after Mr Pompeo's declaration, prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong called on US, European and Asian leaders to follow his lead and reconsider Hong Kong's special trade status if Beijing imposes the security law. ""Once the law is implemented, Hong Kong will be assimilated into China's authoritarian regime, on both rule of law and human rights protections,"" he warned. The security law would create ""massive damage to expats and investors in Hong Kong"", he said. Maintaining the city's autonomy was the ""only way"" to protect business, he added. Zhaoyin Feng, BBC Chinese, Washington Mr Pompeo's latest declaration serves as a warning to Beijing that the special administrative region's preferential treatment is at risk. It has huge economic implications, but the geopolitical implications may be even greater. The move will likely meet angry reaction from Beijing and further jeopardise already fragile US-China relations, which appear to be in free fall amid tensions over trade, the pandemic and technological rivalry. A key question to ask is how much removing Hong Kong's special trade status helps Hongkongers fighting for their autonomy and freedoms. Or does it mostly punish people in Hong Kong while adding limited strategic leverage over China?  Beijing has proposed imposing it in Hong Kong. It would ban treason, secession, sedition and subversion and China says it is needed to combat violent protests that have grown in the territory. The anti-mainland sentiment was fuelled last year by a proposed - and later scrapped - bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to China. Critics say the security law is a direct attempt to curtail the freedoms given Hong Kong in the mini-constitution that was agreed when sovereignty was handed back to China in 1997. Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam has denied that the law, which is set to go to a vote this week and could be in force as early as the end of June, will curtail the rights of Hong Kong residents. A group of 200 senior politicians from around the world have issued a joint statement criticising China's plan. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump said the US would announce a ""very powerful"" response to the proposed legislation before the end of the week. China's plans had already been condemned by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who described them as a ""death knell"" for the city's freedoms. The UK, Australia and Canada have also expressed their ""deep concern""."
investors sentiments,Apple Daily shares rocket after HK crackdown,2024-09-15,2020-08-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53732436,"The holding company of Hong Kong's Apple Daily newspaper has seen its stock rise fourfold, a day after the arrest of its owner Jimmy Lai. Mr Lai was arrested on Monday under a controversial security law imposed by Beijing, but has now been bailed. The pro-democracy tycoon was among 10 people detained on charges including colluding with foreign forces. But Hong Kongers have rallied behind the newspaper, buying stocks in the company.  The stock closed on Tuesday at HK$1.10, up from its close of HK$0.255 just 24 hours before.  The paper, which offers a rare, unvarnished take on Hong Kong and China's leadership, said more than 500,000 copies were printed, five times the usual number. In extraordinary scenes streamed by the paper on Monday, a handcuffed Mr Lai was led through his newsroom as nearly 200 police officers raided the building. The move sparked global condemnation of the escalating crackdown on dissent.  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China had ""eviscerated Hong Kong’s freedoms"". On Tuesday, the newspaper's front page showed an image of Mr Lai in handcuffs with the headline: ""Apple Daily must fight on."" He was released on bail early on Wednesday local time and greeted by a crowd of cheering supporters.  In some parts of the city Hong Kongers were seen queuing for a copy as early as 02:30 as vendors reported selling out of the popular tabloid founded by Mr Lai. ""(I bought these) to hand them out to others, I'm afraid a lot of people can`t get their copies,"" a woman, who only gave her name as Chan, told the BBC while buying 16 copies.  Online subscriptions are also reportedly up 20,000 this week. Shares of holding company Next Digital, which had initially dropped on Monday, almost reached a 12-year high on Tuesday. This came as activists called for supporters to buy the stock. However, there are concerns that investors with ties to the mainland could also be buying up shares. Louise Wong, a senior executive at Next Digital, told the Nikkei Asian Review that ""if someone could get over 5% of the holdings, he or she could ask for a seat on the board"". Mr Lai, who is viewed as a hero by many in Hong Kong for his direct criticism of Beijing’s top leadership, is the highest-profile detainee under use of the new legislation so far. But on the mainland, he has long been labelled a traitor.  Hours after his arrest, prominent youth activist Agnes Chow and Wilson Li, a freelance journalist, were also arrested under the same law. Ms Chow was released on bail late on Tuesday. She told reporters: ""It's very obvious that the regime is using the national security law to suppress political dissidents."" The arrests renewed criticism from Washington, London and the United Nations of attacks on the city’s freedoms. ""I’m deeply troubled by reports of the arrest of @JimmyLaiApple under Hong Kong’s draconian National Security Law,"" tweeted US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  “Further proof that the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] has eviscerated Hong Kong’s freedoms and eroded the rights of its people,” he wrote. Similar sentiments were expressed in Britain, which has already said it will suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and offer a pathway to citizenship for many of the city's residents, in the light of the new law.  ""This is further evidence that the national security law is being used as a pretext to silence opposition,"" a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Reuters. ""The Hong Kong authorities must uphold the rights and freedoms of its people."" The controversial security law introduced to Hong Kong in June had already prompted some of the city’s highest-profile activists to flee overseas in anticipation of a broader clampdown on the city’s freedoms. Pro-democracy protests flared in Hong Kong last year over plans to allow extradition from the territory to mainland China. While this proposal was eventually withdrawn, the demonstrations carried on, to reflect widespread demands for democratic reforms. "
investors sentiments,"UK risks losing investment in net-zero race, MPs warn",2024-09-15,2023-03-29,By Ione Wells,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-65110764,"The UK is at risk of losing jobs and investment in the ""net-zero race"", senior cross-party MPs have warned. The government is set to announce its revised energy strategy on Thursday. It argues the UK is a ""world-leader"" in working towards net-zero. But cross-party MPs fear investors - and jobs - could move elsewhere if the strategy is not ambitious enough. A Department for Business and Trade official said the government was having ""almost daily"" conversations with companies so they know the UK is committed to supporting green technology. Why is the government outlining yet another energy and net-zero strategy, when it had one last year? In part, it's out of necessity. In July 2022, the High Court ruled its existing net-zero strategy ""unlawful"" for not showing how the UK will hit legally binding carbon targets.   Ministers also want to produce a plan for how UK net-zero policies can help grow the economy - one of the prime minister's priorities, even if net-zero is not.   They also need to respond to a government-commissioned net-zero review by Conservative MP Chris Skidmore.   It said the UK was ""falling behind"" on some climate targets, needed to be more ambitious, and should speed up the rollout of renewable energy, heat pumps, and insulation among other recommendations.  It's not though, I'm told by government insiders, meant to be the UK's response to a huge green subsidies programme in the US yet - that'll come later - which is concerning some climate-watchers in Westminster.  Reaching net-zero is often dubbed a ""race"".   Not just against time - with the impacts of climate change becoming more apparent - but economically too.   In the US, President Biden has introduced a multi-billion dollar package - the Inflation Reduction Act - to speed up the production of green technology such as solar panels and wind turbines and to subsidise people to make environmentally friendly purchases like electric cars.   Billions of dollars are being given to communities who have suffered most from fossil fuel production.   Extra tax incentives are also on offer for businesses investing in green jobs and technology in low-income areas.   The EU has responded with plans for a Net Zero Industry Act to increase subsidies for green industry.   The US's move has vocal critics in the UK government.  Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch has described it as ""protectionist"", Energy Secretary Grant Shapps as ""dangerous"".  Some fear it's given the US an unfair competitive advantage, and that it's an attempt to lure high-tech manufacturing companies to the US.   Some electric car and wind turbine manufacturers, among others, are already looking to relocate - taking good jobs with them, from areas of the UK that need them.   The government claims its existing plans to invest in renewable and nuclear technologies will support up to 480,000 green jobs and secure up to £100bn of private investment by 2030.   A Department of Business and Trade official told the BBC Ms Badenoch will bring forward an ""Advanced Manufacturing Plan"" in the coming months to make the UK a more competitive place for green industries to do business and ""one of the best places in the world to manufacture electric vehicles and develop critical supply chain technologies"".  They added that the government was having daily conversations with companies in this space.  The chancellor also said at the budget he'd use his Autumn Statement to ""complete our response to the challenges created by the US Inflation Reduction Act"".  But opposition parties, as well as some business leaders, green groups and Conservatives, fear time is running out to respond to the US's ambition. The independent climate think tank E3G said the government's decision not to announce any new public investment or tax breaks for green industry in the Budget was a ""disappointment"" to UK business.   Labour's shadow climate change and net-zero secretary Ed Miliband has argued for a British equivalent of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and a national wealth fund to invest in green technology alongside the private sector.   ""We need to stop moaning about the IRA and start matching its ambition,"" he said.   Mr Shapps has accused Labour of having a ""£28bn plan for borrowing, nothing more"". More concerning for the government may be some of the critics in its own ranks.   Mr Skidmore, who authored the government's net-zero review, told the BBC: ""We have a vanishingly small window to act. There is a net-zero race, there are net-zero markets that will go elsewhere.""   He added that the ""real risk"" on Thursday is that if the government does not provide certainty that ""demonstrates that this is a place to invest"" then ""investors will say this doesn't deliver"".  ""From Thursday they will begin to take strategic decision to go elsewhere.""   Thursday is not a ""fiscal event"" or Budget, so it's not expected new investment will be announced.  But Mr Skidmore said this is not just about money, but also demonstrating how welcoming the UK's planning and regulation systems are to green infrastructure.   For example, current planning rules make it very hard to build new onshore wind turbines and there are concerns the UK's national grid - electricity network - needs more capacity to accommodate further renewable energy. ""Ultimately,"" he said, ""investors will look at what is being proposed and say 'yes this is a country we can do business' or move elsewhere.""   It's a sentiment echoed by the UK's former COP26 President Alok Sharma, who said: ""We are fast approaching a crossroads.""   The Tory MP added that the US Inflation Reduction Act was attracting billions of dollars of private sector investment in green industries and that the government must set out a meaningful response like financial incentives on Thursday or ""we can allow others to win this critical race"".  He said mixed signals of delayed delivery of policies will ""not cut the mustard"" for businesses. The government insists it is committed to net-zero, making it easier for supportive communities to host onshore wind farms, growing solar capacity and doubling hydrogen production.   But it has said the government will seek to make use of North Sea oil and gas reserves as the UK transitions to cleaner energy.   A decision on whether to approve the new Rosebank oil and gas field in the North Sea may be made on Thursday - along with announcements on hydrogen, energy efficiency, electric cars and moving from gas boilers to heat pumps.   Green groups and MPs critical, and supportive, of net-zero alike will pour over the detail.   But some argue the key political judgement for the government will come from the business community.   If any decide it doesn't go far enough, get impatient, and up sticks, it could prove difficult to claw them back - and MPs warn that could have environmental and economic consequences for years to come.

investors sentiments,US moves to reassure jumpy investors,2024-09-15,2018-12-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46669300,"US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has made calls to the heads of the country's six largest banks, in an unusual move aimed at reassuring investors after big falls in US stocks. Last week, US stocks suffered one of the worst weekly falls in a decade, as an interest rate rise and US-China trade tensions rattled markets. Mr Mnuchin said banks confirmed they had ""ample liquidity"" for operations.  It also comes amid a partial government shutdown over spending plans. ""The [bank's chief executives] confirmed that they have ample liquidity available for lending to consumer, business markets, and all other market operations,"" the Treasury said in a statement attached to a tweet from Mr Mnuchin. ""[Mr Mnuchin] also confirmed that they have not experienced any clearance or margin issues, and that the markets continue to function properly,"" the Treasury's statement said.  The BBC Today programme's business presenter, Dominic O'Connell, said the statement was ""very odd"" and could ""spook markets, not reassure them"". ""People are wondering whether this is really a role for the US Treasury secretary,"" he said.  Analysts also warned the unexpected statement could make investors nervous. ""More than anything else right now, Washington and politics are absolutely driving investor sentiment and market direction and that can turn on a dime,"" said Oliver Pursche, a board member at Bruderman Asset Management. Mr Mnuchin also tried to dismiss reports that President Donald Trump had discussed the possibility of firing Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, after the US central bank raised interest rates last week.  The US Treasury secretary tweeted that he had spoken to the president, who insisted he ""never suggested firing"" Mr Powell and did not believe he had the right to do so. Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, said the fact that Mr Mnuchin had said the White House did not have the power to remove Mr Powell, rather than saying it did not want to remove him, would be more comforting for investors.  ""The administration hasn't been all that stable when it comes to changing their mind. Politically, these are very strange times,"" he said.  All three US indexes closed lower last week, with the technology-focused Nasdaq down 20% since its peak, placing it in so-called ""bear market"" territory.  US investors are worried about a range of factors including slowing economic growth at home and internationally.  In addition, a partial US government shutdown began at midnight on Friday after opposition Democrats resisted President Donald Trump's demand for $5bn (£4bn) for his Mexico border wall. The shutdown over budget spending could continue right up to the opening of the next Congress on 3 January. Mr Mnuchin is now set to meet with the President's Working Group on Monday, the Treasury statement said.  The group includes market regulators and Federal Reserve governors, among others.  They will discuss ""coordination efforts to assure normal market operations"", the statement said."
investors sentiments,African cricket aiming to 'swap AK-47s for bats',2024-09-15,2022-11-29,Kevin Hand,https://www.bbc.com/sport/africa/63421201,"African cricket authorities hope to inspire children across the continent, with the launch of its own Hundred competition among its aims Africa must prevent some of the continent's children from wielding AK-47 guns and ""let them hold a cricket bat"" instead, says the chief executive of the Africa Cricket Association (ACA). Cassim Suliman hopes the launch of the continent's own Hundred competition next year can help deliver this aim.  The ACA has previously used cricket as a social tool, particularly in Uganda where it helped set up an initiative, external a decade ago to help children recovering from the brutal 20-year insurgency led by the Lord's Resistance Army in the north of the country.  ""The ACA is not just about cricket development, it's holistic life skills too,"" Suliman told BBC Sport Africa.  ""Basically, we teach a kid about accountability, responsibility, dedication, determination, and, above all, leadership.  ""We also promote prevention of HIV and AIDS, hunger and starvation - and - taking out the kids that are fighting with AK-47s in wars and let them hold a cricket bat. Bring them back to normality in sport."" A proposed Africa-wide Hundred will be the second time the format will be used following its invention and patenting by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), which has run the competition twice since 2021. It also comes off the back of September's inaugural T20 Africa Cup for International Cricket Council (ICC) Associate Members in Africa. Suliman also revealed that a bigger budget T20 Africa Premier League will be launched in 2024 to run every two years, while the Hundred will be played annually with a more domestic-focused agenda in the hope that the shortest formats will unlock engagement across the continent. Meanwhile, the ACA is also on the verge of reviving the Afro Asia Cup, which ran for two series in 2005 and 2007. Suliman says the ACA will now speak to the ECB about the rights to stage the Hundred, which is a further expansion they had not envisaged. ""We were approached by potential sponsors to go down that route,"" Suliman continued. ""I watch (the Hundred) always. It is exciting, it's great fun and to have that introduced into Africa will be good for spectator viewership. We have a sponsor that is very interested. They were also quite interested in the T20 Africa Cup - it opened up a lot of avenues for us.  ""We are looking at the registration of it (the Hundred) by the ECB. We'll definitely write to them, engage with them and tell them to look [at it] as part of cricket developing in what they call a third-world country and see how it goes from there.  ""I'm sure they'll be very accommodating. If not, we'll just change the format. ""Further on, we want to launch the Africa Premier League, like the IPL. You can get a sponsor, an investor, very quickly - no problem. We are busy working with investors."" Zimbabwe shocked Pakistan at the men's T20 World Cup and the ACA hopes its expansion plans can inspire the next generation As well as the national level plans for an Afro Asia Cup, the ACA launched the inaugural T20 Africa Cup in September in South Africa.  Uganda beat Senegal in the final, with Suliman reporting tournament viewing figures, which are still to be finalised with the latter stages, of 52 million after it was broadcast to 168 countries. Qualifying was open to every African country up to ICC Associate Member level, although Namibia missed out as the Eagles had already agreed to other commitments.  ""The potential is there and we don't want to lose the moment,"" Suliman continued. ""The Africa Cup is going to carry on, it's not going to die off as a one-off thing.  ""We found it very productive, giving a lot of opportunities to African countries. I think by the end of December, we will have 33 African countries affiliated to it."" Zimbabwe coach Dave Houghton is keen for his side and South Africa to be included in an expanded T20 Africa Cup, and Namibia's former South Africa all-rounder David Wiese echoes the sentiment that more options are needed on the continent. ""There's still a long way to go with cricket in Africa,"" Wiese told BBC Sport Africa. ""(ACA) is putting in a lot of funding and effort to grow the game and it was nice for us to play against teams like Uganda, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, who have played top tier for a while now.  ""But it would also be great to have something like the European League. If there could be an African league or cup, that would be awesome to see because I do feel like there is a lot of talent out there. ""Uganda, Tanzania, Botswana, there's a lot of development going on in these countries, but I still feel a lot more can happen. I didn't know what to expect with associate cricket but I realised quickly there's a lot of talented players. It's just the opportunity that's lacking."" Wiese believes the Afro Asia Cup, which saw select XIs from both continents play One-Day Internationals and T20s, could benefit the Eagles. ""If a couple of Namibian guys can be included, we could close the gap [to cricket's top international sides] quite quickly,"" the 37-year old said. ""Namibia will only get better if they play against better opposition, so that means we've got to play against Test nations. Unfortunately, for associates, that [option] is just not there.  ""I'd also love to see these (domestic) T20 tournaments enforce that they have to have an associate player in the squad, just to grow the game."" Namibia failed to qualify for the Super 12 phase of the men's T20 World Cup this year after first-round defeats by the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates Wiese, who made his debut for South Africa in 2015 but switched to Namibia in time for the 2021 World Cup, believes with the rise of the shortest forms of the game and some unified future tour planning, the time is right to raise the standard of African cricket.  ""Look at Afghanistan, who focused purely on T20 cricket,"" Wiese said. ""They got some quality T20 players, developed their skills and kicked on into different formats - that's the way to go.  ""The only challenge is, and it's getting a little bit deeper, but you need funding for these things. That funding comes from having ODI status and not necessarily T20 World Cups. So it is a little bit of a catch-22 situation.  ""But if the ICC can look at a different model and get a couple more associate teams involved in playing triangular series - for example, let Namibia piggyback on a South African series playing at home - that could be massive.  ""Again, it all depends on the ICC and where they see the game moving in the next couple of years but once we start playing better teams, we can inspire younger generations of Africans to come through and then it can be a snowball effect.""  If so, the ACA might be happy that the continent's youngsters have different targets in very different sights. "
investors sentiments,African cricket aiming to 'swap AK-47s for bats',2024-09-15,2022-11-29,Kevin Hand,https://www.bbc.com/sport/africa/63421201,"African cricket authorities hope to inspire children across the continent, with the launch of its own Hundred competition among its aims Africa must prevent some of the continent's children from wielding AK-47 guns and ""let them hold a cricket bat"" instead, says the chief executive of the Africa Cricket Association (ACA). Cassim Suliman hopes the launch of the continent's own Hundred competition next year can help deliver this aim.  The ACA has previously used cricket as a social tool, particularly in Uganda where it helped set up an initiative, external a decade ago to help children recovering from the brutal 20-year insurgency led by the Lord's Resistance Army in the north of the country.  ""The ACA is not just about cricket development, it's holistic life skills too,"" Suliman told BBC Sport Africa.  ""Basically, we teach a kid about accountability, responsibility, dedication, determination, and, above all, leadership.  ""We also promote prevention of HIV and AIDS, hunger and starvation - and - taking out the kids that are fighting with AK-47s in wars and let them hold a cricket bat. Bring them back to normality in sport."" A proposed Africa-wide Hundred will be the second time the format will be used following its invention and patenting by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), which has run the competition twice since 2021. It also comes off the back of September's inaugural T20 Africa Cup for International Cricket Council (ICC) Associate Members in Africa. Suliman also revealed that a bigger budget T20 Africa Premier League will be launched in 2024 to run every two years, while the Hundred will be played annually with a more domestic-focused agenda in the hope that the shortest formats will unlock engagement across the continent. Meanwhile, the ACA is also on the verge of reviving the Afro Asia Cup, which ran for two series in 2005 and 2007.

investors sentiments,Shares fall on concerns of further China lockdowns,2024-09-15,2022-04-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61239151,"Shares in the US and Asia have fallen on fears about the impact of lockdowns in China on global economic growth. On Tuesday, the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index closed at its lowest level since late 2020. Tesla was a big faller, with more than $125bn (£99.3bn) wiped off its market value as boss Elon Musk moves ahead with his takeover of Twitter. Concerns about earnings reports from some of the world's biggest technology firms also weighed on markets. At the same time, news that Russia will cut gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria also added to the negative sentiment. Investors were already worried about the prospects for aggressive interest rate hikes in the US and around the world to combat rising global inflation and the war in Ukraine. Authorities in Beijing are trying to stamp out a Covid-19 outbreak and avoid a repeat of the city-wide restrictions that have kept Shanghai in lockdown for a month. That has raised concerns about the prospects for growth in the world's second largest economy and the potential knock-on effect globally. Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed 1.2% lower, while South Korea's Kospi index fell by 1.1%. That followed stock market falls in New York, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing 2.4% lower and the Nasdaq losing almost 4% on Tuesday. Alvin Tan, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told the BBC that there were concerns over a possible lockdown of Beijing. ""The extended lockdown in Shanghai and other parts of the country has seriously damaged economic activity and consumer sentiment,"" Mr Tan said. ""Beijing alone contributes about 3.5% of China's GDP, while Shanghai contributes around 4%. So it would be a massive blow to the overall economy if these two cities were to be locked down at the same time,"" he added. However, shares in mainland China rose after losses earlier in the week. On Wednesday, the Shanghai Composite added 2.5% and the CSI 300 gained 2.9%. Meanwhile, Tesla shares lost more than 12% as its chief executive moved ahead with his takeover of Twitter. ""The only thing we know for sure is that Musk considers himself a free speech absolutist, so that will be what the platform will primarily focus on from now,"" said Dexter Thillien, lead analyst for technology and telecoms at Economist Intelligence Unit. After US markets closed, Google's parent company Alphabet said the war in Ukraine hurt YouTube advertising sales, which helped send its shares lower in after-hours trade."
investors sentiments,Metro Bank shares continue to slide,2024-09-15,2019-05-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48252997,"Metro Bank's share price has fallen another 8% as concerns persist over its financial health. The bank's shares have lost three-quarters of their value since January, when it announced it needed money to boost their capital after an accounting error. It said it was in ""final discussions"" with shareholders and new investors over its plans to raise £350m. ""Feedback continues to be positive,"" it added. The bank said it expected to raise the money by the end of June.Metro Bank shares continue to slide It said it would raise the money via a share placing, with additional shares created and offered to new and existing investors. If you live outside London and the South East of England, it might be entirely unfamiliar to you. It has no branches north of Peterborough and none west of Bristol and Bath. However, inside that restricted area, it now has 67 branches and is arguably the best-known of the ""challenger"" banks that sprang up in the wake of the financial crisis, taking on the established names such as Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC, RBS and Santander. When it opened its first branch in London's Holborn in 2010, it was the first High Street Bank to set up in the UK in more than 100 years.  It now has 1.7 million customer accounts. Its founder and chairman is billionaire American Vernon Hill. Mr Hill shook up the US banking scene in 1973, when at the age of 26 he founded the US chain Commerce Bank with just one branch. By the time he sold it in 2007 for $8.5bn (£6.5bn), he had built it into a major player across the US with 440 stores.  ""They misclassified a whole host of commercial property loans and buy-to-let loans, giving them the incorrect risk rating,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. ""Commercial property generally is a slightly more risky form of loan than a buy-to-let."" Mr Hewson told the BBC's Today programme that incorrectly categorising those commercial property loans as buy-to-let loans meant that ""they weren't holding enough capital on their balance sheet as a result"". The bank's new share placing is aimed at making up for the shortfall on its books. Last week, the bank said pre-tax profits in the three months ending 31 March 2019 had halved -  from £8.6m to £4.3m -  compared with the same time last year. The bank also said it had lost key clients in the wake of the mistake.  ""Adverse sentiment following January's update impacted deposit growth in the quarter, with a small number of large commercial and partnership customers making withdrawals,"" said Metro Bank's chief executive, Craig Donaldson. Mr Donaldson has said there are ""absolutely no question marks"" over the bank's future. He said he had offered to resign when the accounting error was first discovered, but he had the confidence of the board to carry on. However, he was foregoing his bonus as a result. Over the weekend, queues formed at some bank branches in the west London area, after a WhatsApp message advised customers to check their safety deposit boxes. ""We're aware there were increased queries in some stores about safe deposit boxes following false rumours about Metro Bank on social media and messaging apps,"" a spokesperson said.  ""There is no truth to these rumours and we want to reassure our customers that there is no reason to be concerned."" Customers with up to £85,000 in their account are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which guarantees that if a bank runs into trouble, depositors will get their money back up to that level. On its website, Metro Bank bills itself as a ""different kind of High Street bank"", with branches open seven days a week, from 08:00 to 20:00 on weekdays, where no appointment is necessary and you can open an account and get a debit card straight away. The branches are open-plan, with no glass barriers between the customers and staff. There are also giant ""Dogs rule"" posters featuring Mr Hill's Yorkshire terrier, Sir Duffield - officially the bank's chief canine officer - advertising its policy of welcoming dog owners. Each branch is stocked with bowls of dog biscuits and water and there are even canine-sized, logo-emblazoned neckerchiefs. The branches are also customer-friendly in other ways, with lollipops for children and free pens prominently displaying the Metro brand."
investors sentiments,Holidaymakers hit as pound slides,2024-09-15,2019-05-21,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48348607,"The pound has fallen to its lowest level for five months just as many UK holidaymakers get ready to head off for the late-May half-term break. Against the US dollar, the pound fell below $1.27 for the first time since January on Tuesday. It also fell early in the day against the euro. But it picked up again later in the day in a sign of its current volatility. Cabinet backing for Prime Minister Theresa May's latest Brexit plan led to the rebound. Currency experts say Brexit uncertainty and the US-China trade war have both contributed to the pound's recent fall. Sterling had gained some ground in recent months, but in recent days rates have fallen back to the kind of levels seen during the Christmas holidays. It is a very different picture from March 2008, when the pound was briefly worth more than $2. Holidaymakers heading off for an early summer break in Europe or the US may be saving money by avoiding the even higher costs of travelling in July and August. However, they are finding that their money will not go as far as it did a few years ago. Anyone leaving it to the last minute and changing money at the airport will always get the worst rates. At some airports, they will find an exchange rate little better than parity between the pound and the euro. James Hickman, chief commercial officer at currency traders FairFx, said that the best rates were given to those who ordered their holiday money ahead. He suggested that would also be a good plan for anyone thinking about their holiday money for later this summer. At present, the best rates on pre-loaded currency cards sees a pound buy just over $1.27 and just over €1.13. For those collecting from an exchange bureau, the best deals will see the pound get slightly less than $1.26 and just under €1.13. The Post Office - the most popular bureau for UK holidaymakers - sees anyone changing more than £400 receiving slightly over $1.24 and just over €1.11 for their pound. The recent drop in the value of the pound has come amid speculation over the future of Brexit. ""When sentiment moves towards a higher likelihood of a hard Brexit, then we see a fall in the pound,"" Mr Hickman said. The reverse is also true, shown by the rebound after the cabinet gave its backing to Mrs May's plan for her Withdrawal Agreement Bill, including compromises intended to attract the support of Labour MPs. Sterling is also affected indirectly by the continuing trade war between the US and China. Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, said the pound was ""suffering from the renewed uncertainty of Brexit, while investors flood to the relatively safer US dollar amidst the ongoing trade war"".  ""Looking forward, headwinds look stronger than tailwinds for the pound, particularly with another Brexit vote not set to take place for a few weeks yet. But perhaps the only real hope would come from Donald Trump pressing the pause button with regards to the trade war,"" he added. Alana Parsons, from foreign exchange firm Caxton, said: ""Getting the most value for your travel money can be tricky, but not if we spend as much time planning our finances as we do researching our holiday destinations."""
investors sentiments,Dumb money behaviour explained,2024-09-15,2014-11-03,Ari Weinberg,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20131029-dumb-money-behaviour-explained,"Harold Evensky, who leads financial planning for the firm Evensky & Katz, has long tried to protect his clients from allowing their personal psychological hang-ups to undermine sound financial decisions.   While such is the goal of most, if not all, financial planners, some of Evensky's inspiration has come from an unlikely source — a client. But not just any client. Evensky has gleaned valuable insights into behavioural economics from Nobel Prize-winning psychologist, Daniel Kahneman. Kahneman was awarded a Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002 for helping develop behavioural economics, a field of study that delves into the psychology that clouds otherwise rational economic decision-making.  In his popular writing, Kahneman, a psychologist by training, walks readers through the mental cues that help us make up our minds. When it comes to financial decisions, we can often be tricked (or trick ourselves) into believing that we are making the right choice with our money because we often base those decisions on rosy projections, past performance, linked events or even mushy things like emotion and sentiment.  But that rarely leads to smart decisions or financial gains when it comes to investments. These insights are particularly important for financial planners, who often become voices of reason when we are faced with challenging financial or economic choices.  While Evensky won’t talk about his famous client’s financial tendencies, he spoke with BBC Capital about how he incorporates teachings from behavioural economics in his own work. BBC Capital: What have you learned from Kahneman's academic discipline that either stands out to you, or that you use with your other clients?   Evensky: The first is managing expectations…to help clients understand how they handle issues in different situations. [Behavioural finance shows that] if you give someone a choice of, say, a 100% chance that they will get $800,000 or an 80% chance that they will get $1,000,000 and a 20% chance they get nothing, they take the sure thing. Turn that around, a 100% chance of losing $800,000 or an 80% chance that they lose $1,000,000 and a 20% chance of losing nothing, they gamble.  It’s exactly the same question, but it helps client’s understand the difference between being risk averse and loss averse. People are used to thinking that they don’t want to take risk. The reality is that most investors don’t want to take a risk to get rich, but they will take a risk not to get poor. This helps frame why investors need to be in stocks and not 100% bonds. There’s more risk than just the market going up or down, it’s [the risk of] not having enough money to live off of. BBC Capital: Is there any area where faulty logic like that comes up again and again? Evensky: People have significant challenges when it comes to mental accounting, or mental math. One example is dealing with linked probabilities. If you have a chain of four events, each assigned a 90% probability of occurring, the actually likelihood of your expected outcome is actually 66%. Which number are you making your decision on — 90% or 66%? Similarly, losses hurt more than gains. A client came in after the tech bust — a retired surgeon, the classic curmudgeon. He said, “I don’t get it, I was up 80% last year, but down 60% this year and I’m under water. Shouldn’t I be up 20%?” Mental math prevents you from realizing that the gain from one year and loss from the next are not on the same basis. BBC Capital: Have you found that people’s behaviour outside of their finances is reflective of how they act with money? Evensky: In our experience, there’s really no correlation. Someone may like to bungee jump, but that doesn’t mean that they wouldn’t be a conservative investor. Those deeply concerned with the high cost of medical care down the road [and the need to have money to pay for it], may be highly comfortable [with the risks in] the financial markets. And someone who’s not as concerned may be scared to death of taking risk! BBC Capital: How do you respond to a client who brings you a hot tip or investment idea? Evensky: In these cases, we utilise some of the concepts in behavioural finance, the first is framing. [I say]  “I don’t know anything about that, tell me about it.” Then we hear all of the great things that could happen to their money…and [we] probe more about what could go wrong. Then we go back through their financial plan — and look at capital needs. [Then I explain] If it works, you can take an annual cruise around the world. If it doesn’t work, you have to work three more years. This gives them completely different visions. BBC Capital: What about the biases people have around what they see as obvious — but might be wrong about? Evensky: People often confuse certainty and safety. If they tell me “I don’t want to take risk,” I say “Go bury [your cash] in the backyard, but let’s look at the consequences to your life style.” Don’t trust social security? Then keep working. There are consequences to conservative decisions that might make them anything but conservative [choices]. BBC Capital: How do you get people to focus on decisions that are decades away, like their estate? Evensky:  [The sentiment is:] ‘Who needs it? I’m not going to live that long.’ What they forget is that it’s not just about the probability. If you start giving everything away and don’t die early, you’re stuck. Like everything, there has to be a balance. If they want to give away a lot of money to avoid taxes down the road, we’ll walk them back. If you have enough money to do everything you want to do, that’s fine, but don’t take the risk of going overboard to avoid taxes when you’re dead and then not be dead.

investors sentiments,How modern singing was invented,2024-09-15,2023-05-12,Zaria Gorvett,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230511-how-singing-has-changed-over-the-centuries,"Modern singing – whether on the charts or Eurovision – is radically different to the kind familiar to our ancestors. There was hysteria in the air at 81st Street Theatre in New York. Deep within the building, behind its white neoclassical arches and away from the steady chatter of crowds of adoring fans outside, a new kind of celebrity singer was walking onto a black-and-silver stage. It was February 1929, and just a few months earlier, Rudy Vallée had been an obscure graduate best known to the listeners of WABC radio in New York. He wasn't considered particularly good looking: one biting critic later called him ""a young man whose eyes are too close together and small to be called handsome"". His singing style, too, was highly unusual. But that night, as Vallée began the opening lines of a characteristically sentimental song, the crowd exploded with rapturous applause. The venue had achieved record-breaking sales, mostly with women: so many had turned up, the police had to be called to contain them. His was no longer just a voice for radio. As it happens, the evening did more than catapult Vallée to global stardom. The singer was one of the first singers to practice the art of ""crooning"". This new style was a kind of soft, intimate singing, often likened more to lullabies than to the belting operatic or classical performances audiences were used to in the early 20th Century. Today the term is less well-known, but the style is still as popular as ever. In fact, this was the birth of modern singing as we know it. A matter of projection   For much of the Middle Ages, singing may have sounded distinctly odd. Though the echoes of these ancient voices have been lost forever, there are hints in the historical record that the style of the day was somewhat 'nasal', to match the tones of the woodwind and string instruments popular at the time.   By the 17th and 18th Centuries, a number of famous European singers were castrati – men who had been castrated as children, and consequently never experienced the voice-deepening effects of puberty. Their powerful, 'metallic' voices were the dominant sounds at concerts, churches and palaces for generations, often moving audiences to tears and standing ovations. However, eventually genital mutilation of this sort came to be viewed as unethical and the castrati's distinctive sound went out of fashion. Their 'angelic' singing vanished – and somebody had to fill the void. ""They had had such extraordinary voices, being a large male body just with a tiny childlike larynx, they had incredible vocal facility,"" says John Potter, a singer and author based in the UK. In their place emerged conservatoires and music schools, ""where people learnt to do extraordinarily complicated things, loud things."" The idea that singing should be studied soon became well established, and soon technique came to be valued above all else. The best performers, it was agreed, had clear, dramatic voices. Flourishes such as vibrato, which involved rapid oscillations in pitch, became ubiquitous. ""That hadn't really happened much before that, "" says Potter. ""Before the 18th Century, people more or less sung as they spoke, as far as we can tell."" This included their regional accents: if you were from the British Midlands, this is what you sounded like as a singer, he explains.  A diversity of styles There have always been many different singing traditions outside the Western world, such as throat singing – a guttural style indigenous to peoples in Mongolia, Siberia, and Tuva, a republic in Russia. It's also historically been practiced by Inuit cultures in the Canadian Arctic, Greenland and Alaska. After years of oppression by colonists, throat singing had been dying out in some regions. But recently the practice has seen a popular revival. (Read more from BBC Travel about the comeback of indigenous throat singing.)   ""We do see a major shift during the period,"" says Allison McCracken, a professor of American studies at DePaul University, Chicago, and author of Real Men Don't Sing: Crooning in American Culture. Criteria emerged for what constituted a good singer. ""Often the qualifications were that they would be able to project, that they would be able to enunciate in certain ways, and that they would have what we would consider a trained voice."" For example, one of the most venerated singers of the late 19th century was German soprano Lilli Lehmann. In the manual How to Sing, she provides minutely detailed instructions for aspiring professionals, such as how to keep a breath vibrating in the mouth to achieve a certain note.  However, while tastes for different styles of singing have been continually evolving, all professional singers before the 1930s had one thing in common. In an era before artificial amplification, they had to be loud. That was the only way for their voices to fill a large concert hall. A transformational technology  This changed with the carbon microphone, which was thought up simultaneously by three inventors in the 1870s. These early devices used carbon granules sandwiched between two metal plates to convert sound into electrical signals. The technology was an immediate hit and became an essential part of radio and telephone technology. It also led to a public and bitter feud over whose version came first, including accusations of theft and plagiarism. Meanwhile, the technology was being quietly improved. By the 1920s, microphones were so good, they could be used to broadcast reasonable-quality audio around the world. The popularity of radio boomed – and the way people sung started to change. ""The big advantage was that you didn't have to project your voice in the back of a hall,"" says Potter. ""So you could just sing in a much more natural way. And you get the colours of your own personality coming through."" Enter the first crooners. This group of charismatic, mostly male performers pioneered a style of soft, seductive singing, typically involving romantic lyrics, that rapidly became wildly popular with young women. It was ""said to be peculiarly devastating in its effect on the heart of the emotional flapper"", wrote one journalist in 1929. Unlike their contemporaries, these musicians sounded as though they weren't performing at all, but rather whispering sweet sentiments directly into the listener's ear. This new type of singing was assessed by different criteria, centred on conveying feeling, says McCracken. Technical considerations like projection or hitting high notes became less salient. ""What becomes most important is that they sound sincere."" Crooners weren't allowed to be anonymous voices performing for an audience. They had to seem authentic – and for that, they needed personality too. An unwelcome development    Like all cultural innovations, crooning had its critics. Traditionalists were horrified, with one cardinal publicly condemning the style as a ""degenerate form of singing"" and ""imbecile slush"" – even going so far as to criticise its perpetrators as ""whiners and bleaters defiling the air"". Established musicians and conservatoires weren't thrilled either: crooners were accused of lacking skill and corrupting the youth. However, the crooners weren't finished, and the march of technology enabled musicians to push the style still further. The 1930s saw the development of directional microphones, a variety that pick up sound from a particular direction, minimising background noise. Singers who got close to those microphones discovered the 'proximity effect', which created an even more intimate tone, says McCracken. ""People really liked that sound."" You might also like: With these new singing techniques came a new kind of celebrity. ""Rudy Vallée was really the first pop idol,"" says McCracken. And along with this new lofty status came another invention: the adoring superfan. ""The fan letters to him basically say, 'I don't know why I'm in love with the voice, I don't understand why this is happening to me.'"" The term crooning eventually fell out of fashion, but the trend still lingers in popular music today. ""Anyone who's using popular music in order to communicate their emotions is crooning,"" says McCracken. “They're using microphones, they're singing love songs to a popular audience… that's what crooning is.” We might imagine that people have always sung like Taylor Swift, or the contestants on Eurovision. But for most of history they didn’t. Singing as we now know it was invented in the 1920s. Ubiquitous as the style now is, in those early days it seemed like a fad. One critic predicted, rather hopefully, that crooning would soon go the way of ""tandem bicycles, mah jong and [miniature] golf"". Given that all those things remain popular, he wasn't wrong. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

investors sentiments,How algorithms select World Cup winners,2024-09-15,2018-06-14,Richard Gray,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180613-how-algorithms-predict-the-winners-of-the-world-cup,"World Cup match-day nerves can improve your decision-making: algorithms used in the stock market could divine the victors of football's biggest competition With a half-hearted mew, a white cat called Achilles hovers lazily between two bowls of food adorned with the national flags of Russia and Saudi Arabia. The preferences of this rather ordinary-looking feline, which lives in the basement of the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, Russia, have come under surprising scrutiny in recent weeks. The reason for the attention? He is the official animal oracle for the 2018 Fifa World Cup. The clairvoyant cat signals who will win matches by choosing between two boxes with bowls of food outside them. According to curators at the Hermitage, Achilles has a good track record for predicting the outcome of football matches after successfully picking the winners of games in last year’s Confederation Cup. Feline lucky? Achilles is just the latest in a succession of mystic animals used to predict the outcomes of the World Cup. During the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, an octopus named Paul was shown on national German television predicting the results of matches. The last World Cup in Brazil was blessed by several ""psychic"" animals, including kangaroos, guinea pigs and camels. Not everyone, however, is content to leave predictions to prophetic beasts. Bookmakers employ a more methodical approach to set odds using not only historical data on a team’s performance, but also events such as players’ form and injuries to find their favourites. According to bookmakers Paddy Power, the current favourites to win the 2018 World Cup are Brazil at 4/1, followed by Germany at 5/1. Some, however, are turning the power of sophisticated statistical models on the beautiful game. Algorithms more commonly used by banks to forecast rising oil prices or changes in the stock market are being tweaked to predict the results of fancy footwork by star players like Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Wayne Rooney. In many ways, according to some analysts, making an accurate call on the results of the World Cup, is far easier than their day job of tracking the ups and downs of the stock markets. “We know quite a lot about the World Cup because Fifa puts out the game schedule, the rules of the tournament and ranks the teams” ahead of time, says Michael Bolliger, head of emerging markets asset allocation at investment bank UBS, who has turned the financial algorithms he uses day to day onto predicting who might win the World Cup. “So we know a lot more about what we want to model than we do when looking at the investment markets.” Bolliger tested hundreds of possible variables that can influence the outcome of a football match. He found there were just four that made a real difference to his ability to predict games when testing his model against the results in the past ten World Cup tournaments. The first was an objective ranking of the teams using their Elo ratings, which orders the national teams using a measure of the relative skill of each team. He also incorporated how well the teams performed in the past 12-18 months during the qualification stages of the World Cup. While past performance is often used to warn investors against betting on a stock’s future performance, past participation in the World Cup and experience of winning played a significant role in predicting future winners in Bolliger’s modelling. “These countries – Brazil, Germany, Italy and Uruguay – have played in most tournaments and have won it,” says Bolliger. “They know how to win a World Cup, but the current players also have more confidence because of the previous guys winning, they believe they can win again.” Bolliger also incorporated another psychological factor into his model – home advantage. Teams playing on their home turf tend to perform far better than might be expected, because having the crowd behind them gives them a boost. But interestingly he also layered in an algorithm that deliberately introduces an element of chance to the model. This is because in sport, much like in the wider world, upsets do happen. The best team doesn’t always win and footballing minnows can become giant killers. “In the world of investments we do something similar – we bring in this element of unpredictability that helps us make better conclusions,” says Bolliger.   Bolliger’s algorithms crunched the data about team ranking, past performance, recent results, and home advantage to calculate the possible outcomes of 10,000 tournaments. Adding a random element to account for upsets that might disrupt the expected results produced a range of outcomes, allowing outliers to do better than expected, for example. He then counted how many times each of the 32 participating teams won, made it to the semi-finals or was eliminated at group stages. It showed that Germany and Brazil were most likely to meet in the final. Forecasting the unpredictable The idea that uncertainty can make predictions more accurate might at first seem rather strange, but the world is an unpredictable place. And the business world is one in particular that is subject to the vagaries of human nature. One certainty about the World Cup is that the tournament will always feature some things that just cannot be predicted. Who, for example, could have guessed that Uruguay striker Luis Suárez would bite an opposing Italian player on the shoulder during a group stage match at the 2014 tournament in Brazil? Suárez was given a nine-match ban for the incident, something many pundits say contributed to Uruguay crashing out of the next round of the competition. Similarly the surprise decision by the Spanish Football Association to sack their national coach Julen Lopetegui just one day before the start of the World Cup in Russia could easily introduce similar levels of unpredictability to this year’s tournament. Unpredictable events and temperamental player behaviour can swing the result of a match, just as they can in business negotiations or the stock market. Pre-game nerves, match-day pressure and trouble at home can turn even a team of footballing superstars into a shambles. “Players' mindset will play a massive role in successes and failures at the World Cup this summer,” says Jennifer Cumming, a sports psychologist at the University of Birmingham. This can introduce a random element to matches that is difficult to predict. “On average, about 86% of a result in a match between two teams is random,” says Andreas Heuer, professor of complex systems theory at the University of Münster, who has studied how to predict football scores. “If the players were robots of equal skill, the chances of winning would be like throwing a dice. With the right data, you can predict a match. “But when the psychology of the players comes in, prediction gets a lot harder.” Heuer points to a well-studied phenomenon known as loss aversion, which was first identified by Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman. It says that humans objectively feel losses far more than they do gains. And it seems to play a major role in matches where the score is 0-0 in the 80th minute, according to Heuer’s analysis. “There are far fewer goals in the final 10 minutes of a football match than one might expect statistically,” says Heuer. “The activity of the teams goes down and they take less risks. They seem to see a one-point draw as being a better option than the chance of getting no points.” On the other hand, a draw is not a good result given that teams might get three points for a win. Yet football players and managers seem to prefer to play it safe, especially in the early stages of a tournament like the World Cup where table points matter. “This is just irrational behaviour,” adds Heuer. “But people tend to avoid losses.” Teams can also become stuck in a particular strategy during matches because of the time and effort they have already invested in this. In economics, this is known as the sunk cost fallacy, where people have a tendency to persist in a failing endeavor because they see what they have already invested as being too good to lose. These are problems that regularly crop up in business decision making, too. Those who understand when it is worth ignoring their human instincts to take a risk are likely to do better, says Heuer. Steve Begg, professor of decision-making and risk analysis at the University of Adelaide in Australia, normally spends his time modelling how uncertainty can impact the oil and gas industry. He too has applied this financial markets-modelling work to predicting the outcome of the World Cup. Using a technique known as a ‘Monte Carlo simulation’, which was initially developed by scientists working on the atomic bomb in the Manhattan Project, to calculate how the form of each team might change during the tournament. He ran 100,000 simulations of possible outcomes in the forthcoming 63 matches of the tournament. “Uncertainty is crucial in predicting the chance of an oil or gas field being economic,” says Begg. “In the World Cup, it determines the many ways the whole tournament might play out. Probability is subjective, it depends on what you know. It doesn’t need data – you use what information you have to assign a degree of belief in what might happen, and thus make decisions or, in this case, a judgement on who wins. The crucial thing is that your information and reasoning is not biased.” This is something Bolliger insists is important too – emotion, no matter how much you want your national side to win, has to be taken out of the equation. “Investors can learn a lot from the qualities of successful soccer players,” says Bolliger, who ran his simulations during late night shifts at work. “Agility, balance and calm are all things I will try to use in my interactions with clients.” And the winners of the 2018 World Cup, according to some of the most powerful forecasting tools in the business world? According to UBS, Germany will be the winners, while Beggs predicts that Brazil have the best chance of being champions. But for those wanting to take a gamble on the winners of the World Cup, there might be another option alternative to popping to the bookies. One study published in 2007 found that a country’s stock market can respond both positively and negatively to World Cup results, perhaps driven by changes in investor sentiment or mood. The researchers from the Norwegian School of Management found stock prices could slide by up to 49 points the day after a national team lost at the World Cup. Of course, you could just take a day off and enjoy the football. -- To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook  page or message us on Twitter.

investors sentiments,New Bitcoin trading funds get go-ahead in US,2024-09-15,2024-01-10,By Joe Tidy,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67916142,"The US has made the long-awaited decision to allow Bitcoin to be part of mainstream investing funds.  It has approved what are known as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which can be purchased by anyone from pension funds to ordinary investors.  The announcement from the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission was accompanied by a stern warning about risks associated with the asset. But cryptocurrency fans reacted with glee - and memes about becoming rich. The US financial watchdog had repeatedly rebuffed earlier requests for approvals, citing concerns about potential for fraud and manipulation.  But a US court said last year its justification was inadequate. The go-ahead comes after a false start on Tuesday, when the regulator had to rapidly withdraw an ""unauthorised"" post announcing the decision early. SEC chairman Gary Gensler said on Wednesday that investors should not mistake the new approvals for an endorsement of the cryptocurrency. ""Bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that's also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing,"" he said.  ""Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto."" ETFs are portfolios that allow investors to bet on multiple assets, without having to buy any themselves.  Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time. An ETF could comprise a combination of gold and silver bullion, for example, or a mixture of shares in both top technology and insurance companies. Some ETFs already contain Bitcoin indirectly - but a spot Bitcoin ETF will buy the cryptocurrency directly, ""on the spot"", at its current price, throughout the day. About a dozen investment companies, including Blackrock and Fidelity, have been waiting for months for the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to give them the green light to start buying Bitcoin for their own ETFs.  And after weeks of wrangling over wording, the first have now been given the nod. This means a new group of investors can now enter the speculative world of Bitcoin, without having to worry about getting digital wallets or navigating crypto exchanges.  Billions of dollars are expected to pour into the Bitcoin market, as these financial companies start buying the digital coin. A minority of analysts say the cryptocurrency's price will be little affected, as spot Bitcoin ETFs are already established in other countries.  But with the US giants entering the market, most people are expecting the value of bitcoins to rise with demand. The price is notoriously volatile, however. It rose to nearly $70,000 (£55,000) a coin in 2021, before falling to $16,000 in 2022 as scandals shook the industry.  But in 2023, it rose steadily, partly due to the hype around the Bitcoin ETF approval, and is now at $44,000.  Based on an idea published online in 2008, by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most valuable and famous. Its price is often seen as a barometer for the whole industry of thousands of other coins, tokens and products built on the same blockchain technology.  And with an influx of new money into the ecosystem, many expect a surge in interest in cryptocurrency technology in general. Some say this landmark decision shows the establishment is finally taking Bitcoin seriously, at least as a speculative asset.  For those who consider Bitcoin legitimate ""digital gold"", what better proof could there be than the biggest wealth-management institutions flocking to buy, overseen by regulators?  Others say cryptocurrency is about rejecting traditional financial systems in favour of a decentralised, people-powered alternative. And investment bankers buying Bitcoin just to get rich on US dollars is not what Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind. But judging from the excitement on social media, the prevailing sentiment is hope the cash injection will make existing Bitcoin investors rich.  The price of Bitcoin can change rapidly and often without warning or explanation.  So investors will have to weigh that up when they opt for ETFs linked to the digital coin.  But ETFs are often sold as high-risk, high-reward products anyway.  Another potential risk is cyber-crime. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been subject to huge and costly attacks that have seen crypto companies drained of sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars overnight.  And if the likes of Blackrock become major holders of Bitcoin, their cyber-security will be tested in ways to which they are unaccustomed. Another downside is the cost to the environment. Bitcoin relies on a huge number of powerful computers around the world, to process transactions and create coins. Renewable energy use is growing - but it remains to be seen how investment companies can square the potential environmental cost of Bitcoin with buyers worried about environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) compliance."
investors sentiments,China new home prices see biggest fall since 2015,2024-09-15,2021-11-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59286413,"China's property slump has deepened official data showed, with new home prices seeing their biggest month-on-month decline since 2015. New construction starts in January to October also fell 7.7%, compared to a year earlier. The country's property market has been shaken in recent months as real estate giant Evergrande struggles to keep up interest payments on its huge debts. China has also been hit by a new wave of Covid cases and major power cuts. The 0.2% drop in new home prices in October was the biggest fall seen in China since February 2015. It also marks the first decline in new home prices +since March 2015. Sentiment in China's property market, which accounts for about a quarter of the country's economic activity by some measures, has been rocked as major property developers grapple with huge debts. The industry has come under intense scrutiny as fears continue over the future of companies including real estate giant Evergrande. Last week, Evergrande, which is saddled with around $300bn (£223bn) of debt, avoided defaulting on overdue interest payments of $148m. Just days before a 30-day grace period on the payments was set to expire it sold a 5.7% stake in media firm HengTen Networks Group for around $145m. The previous week Evergrande's car making business sold its UK-based electric motor business Protean for an undisclosed sum. Other Chinese home builders have also struggled to find the money to make debt repayments. Shares of developer Fantasia plunged by 50% last week after it said there was no guarantee it would be able to meet its other financial obligations following a missed payment of $205.7m in October. And earlier this month, trading in shares of Kaisa Group and three of its units was halted in Hong Kong after one of its businesses missed a payment on a wealth management product. The debt crisis faced by Chinese property giants had triggered concerns amongst some international investors that it could have a major impact on global financial markets. However, in recent weeks a number of high-profile figures have moved to help calm those fears. On Monday, the governor of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda said that he believed that China's property woes were unlikely to trigger a global shock as the amount of money owed to creditors outside the country was relatively low. ""We don't expect China's property woes to have a big impact on Japan's economy or financial institutions. We also don't see a huge risk of the woes triggering a big, global shock,"" Mr Kuroda told business leaders in the city of Nagoya, central Japan."
investors sentiments,Is prison time for 'fake news' fair?,2024-09-15,2018-04-04,By Jonathan Head,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43637744,"Everybody is talking about it: fake news.  President Trump decries it every time he sees a critical article, the Pope has condemned it, governments are fretting about its influence, holding parliamentary hearings.  And now Malaysia has passed a law criminalising it, with a penalty of up to six years in jail. Yet no-one has defined what it is. The term first came to prominence during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. But the problem of deliberately falsified news articles, masquerading as properly-researched journalism, goes back centuries.  However, the Malaysian government's definition in the recently-passed law is far more sweeping than that.  It has criminalised the dissemination of ""any news, information, data and reports, which is or are wholly or partly false, whether in the form of features, visuals or audio recordings or in any other form capable of suggesting words or ideas"".  Human rights groups have been quick to point out that this could be used against anyone who makes an error in their reporting or social media posts.  Moreover at least one member of the government has already stated that, when it comes to articles critical of Prime Minister Najib Razak, especially over the notorious 1MDB scandal, where billions of dollars of a government-run investment board are alleged to have been misappropriated, any information not verified as true by the government will be viewed as fake news. The fact that this law has been rushed through right before what is likely to be a hard-fought general election has raised suspicions that its real purpose is to intimidate government critics. It is not clear anyway that Malaysia has a serious fake news problem.  In a response to the concerns expressed about the new law, the communications and multimedia minister Salleh Said Keruak highlighted the foreign media's failure to get the sometimes complicated string of official titles for high-ranking Malaysians right - irritating, yes, but hardly a threat to national security. The article goes on to excoriate mainstream media which have published negative pieces about Mr Najib, calling them fake news, and thus rather confirming suspicions that the law is aimed at them, rather than the manipulation of social media opinion through fraudulent Facebook accounts and automated Twitter bots. Singapore is the other country which has raised the alarm over fake news, holding 50 hours of parliamentary hearings. Facebook's policy director Simon Milner was publicly dressed down by the law and home affairs minister K Shanmugam over his failure to acknowledge the full extent of data taken by the data analysis company Cambridge Analytica when he testified to the British parliament earlier this year.  Academics speaking at the Singapore hearings presented an alarming scenario of disinformation campaigns launched by foreign actors bent on attacking the island state, of cyber armies in neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore working as proxies for other countries in undermining national security.  It also gave Singapore academics and officials an opportunity to snipe at the US belief in free expression, the ""marketplace of ideas"", which had allowed the abuse of personal data on Facebook to take place, in contrast to Singapore's ""better safe than sorry"" belief in a more tightly regulated society. But the actual examples of fake news which have come up during this national debate have mostly been prosaic; a hoax photo showing a collapsed roof at a housing complex, which sent officials rushing unnecessarily to the scene; and an erroneous report of a collision between two trains on the light rail transit line.  Irritating and worrying for some, for a while, but hardly likely to bring Singapore society to its knees. In any case both Singapore and Malaysia already have plenty of laws capable of penalising false, inflammatory or defamatory comment. In the country where social media misinformation has had the most devastating impact, by contrast, there is no clamour for a fake news law.  Myanmar too has a raft of existing harsh laws sweeping enough to stifle any reporting deemed a threat to the state or society, laws which all too often have been used to jail journalists.  But these laws have been unable to prevent a poisonous tide of hate speech on social media, which has helped ignite anti-Muslim sentiment. Myanmar famously leapt from being a society largely without even old-fashioned telephone lines, to one with more than 40 million mobile phone accounts, in just three years.  Seventeen million people have Facebook accounts, and as in so much of Asia, this is how most Burmese send messages and get their news.  Most don't bother with email accounts. This has coincided with the end of strict military censorship, and the emergence in the mainly Buddhist population of a primeval fear of the small Muslim minority. It has been all too easy to find cartoons and doctored photographs on Facebook which depict Muslims in a sinister and derogatory way. Worse still, large numbers of posts about Muslims are completely false, with photographs purporting to show atrocities against Buddhists by Muslims which are from a completely different part of the world.  The government has done nothing to stem this tide of disinformation, at times appearing to encourage it.  For example the Facebook page of the Myanmar armed forces still has on it a gruesome photograph with a caption stating that the dismembered bodies of infants, being dragged by apparently Muslim men, are Rakhine Buddhists killed by Rohingya militants in 1942.  In fact the photograph is from the Bangladesh independence war in 1971.  When journalists, myself among them, were given photographs in September 2017 during a government-run tour of Rakhine state, supposedly showing Muslims burning down their own homes, backing the assertion by officials that this was the cause of the destruction of Rohingya villages, we were quickly able to ascertain that the perpetrators in the photos were actually displaced Hindus dressed up as Muslims.  Yet the government spokesman posted one of the photos on his Twitter feed proclaiming ""It's Truth"", although he later removed it. I was told in all seriousness in one Rakhine village that Muslims used to cut up Buddhists and cook them with their beef stew.  These kinds of stories are circulating unchallenged in Myanmar, creating a tide of fear and hate which then intimidates anyone trying to advocate a more tolerant approach into silence. The UN Special Rapporteur to Myanmar Yanghee Lee, who has herself been subjected to vicious online abuse for her focus on human rights in Rakhine, and has now been banned from entering the country, has described Facebook there as ""a beast"".  Facebook says it takes the problem of hate speech very seriously, but has yet to stop the site being used to stir up sectarian conflict. The other country where social media has had a profound impact is the Philippines, where critics of President Duterte have accused his supporters of ""weaponising"" Facebook and Twitter to twist public opinion and silence dissent. Filipinos are among the heaviest users of Facebook in Asia, with more than one third of the population visiting the social media site regularly.  This is has made it a potentially game-changing arena for political actors who know how best to use it, in a country which has long had a lively and competitive traditional media. Long before the 2016 election which propelled Rodrigo Duterte, a late candidate with outsider status, to the presidency, the internet was already being exploited by public relations experts promoting products and opinions with so-called ""click factories"", where thousands of low-paid workers raised the clicks for specific websites, and companies openly offering hundreds of fake Facebook or Twitter accounts in support of the online profile of clients. After announcing his candidacy in November 2015 Rodrigo Duterte hired social media experts to craft a strategy which outflanked the usual dependence on endorsement from mainstream newspapers and television channels.  It worked brilliantly, tapping into a hitherto unarticulated yearning for change among many Filipinos. But researchers have also detected what they believe is the use of automated bots and fake Facebook accounts to amplify the pro-Duterte message, something the president's team has denied.  The online news site Rappler published a detailed report about this in October 2016, enraging Mr Duterte's supporters, and, it believes, prompting the ruling in January this year by the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission that the site is illegally owned by foreign investors, a claim first made by the president last year.  Rappler also highlighted the way Facebook's algorithms could be ""gamed"" to ensure certain content dominates users' newsfeeds. Leaving aside the allegations of social media manipulation, what President Duterte's supporters have succeeded in doing is using Facebook and other sites to wage a war of words against his critics, or anyone publishing unfavourable reports.  I experienced this in September 2016 after the BBC published a report on Mr Duterte's campaign against drugs dealers and users which has resulted in thousands of police and extrajudicial killings.  I received a flood of hostile messages, and a few death threats on my Facebook page, and the BBC complaints site was swamped with almost identical protests over ""erroneous and biased"" reporting. Maria Ressa, the CEO and founder of Rappler, was at one point getting 90 hate messages an hour. In part this militant response has been shaped by Mr Duterte's own depiction of his presidency, more as an existential struggle to save his country than just another administration.  Mr Duterte uses emotive and bellicose language to describe his mission, openly threatening to kill those who stand in his way, including journalists, and suggesting he may in turn be killed, by unnamed enemies. Having successfully motivated those who voted for him into believing he could be a one-man saviour for the many ailments afflicting the Philippines, he, like President Trump in the US, has also instilled in his supporters a deep mistrust of traditional mainstream news sources, as controlled by powerful vested interests set on ensuring the failure of his presidency - ""presstitutes"", in their preferred term. Nowhere has the political climate been more polarised than in Myanmar and the Philippines.  Yet hearings at the Philippines Senate concluded that a specific fake news law was unnecessary, and possibly counterproductive.  Clarissa David, a professor of mass communications at the University of the Philippines, testified to the Senate about the dangers of an information environment she described as ""polluted"", with no one sure any more what is real and reliable, and what is fake.  But she warned against easy definitions of fake news. And trying to outlaw it, she argued, is not worth the inevitable cost there will be for media freedom. Hers is an argument which was made, but lost, in Malaysia."
investors sentiments,Digital doodles and electric bees,2024-09-15,2011-05-19,Andrew Webb,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-13443240,"This video can not be played Ellie Gibson plays with a giant Etch-A-Sketch imitation game and walks among a ""swarm"" of motors at Manchester's FutureEverything Festival   If there was ever a winning formula to whip up interest in an invention, it must be to evoke memories of an age gone by. So the giant Etch-A-Sketch that formed part of Manchester's FutureEverything festival could hardly fail to please. The annual event celebrates the work of tech tinkerers and professional researchers. Created by the MadLab inventors group, the giant doodling toy was the first thing seen by visitors to the Victoria Baths Handicraft faire - one of the main venues of the festival. Instead of powdered aluminium being squirted along the Etch-A-Sketch screen, the Project-A-Sketch uses an Arduino microcontrolller to detect when knobs are turned to control where a line is drawn. A computer projects an electronic representation of the toy's screen onto the Project A Sketch screen. The makers' microcontroller: open source Arduino boards are used by many design enthusiasts It has even captured the imagination of BBC engineers. ""They connected it to an Xbox Kinect motion controller during the Royal Wedding celebrations"", said MadLab co-founder Hwa Young Jung.  People approaching it at the Manchester group's workshop could change the volume of a video showing the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra. The fascination in tinkering with the established world is what drives MadLab. Funded in part by local art bodies, this week its DIY Biology Group is waiting eagerly to see what bacteria it has cultivated on swabs taken from bus stops. Ms Jung says ""We have no idea what we'll find."" Motor swarm Swarm of motors: Antony Hall suspended electric fans from the Victoria Baths rafters In the drained swimming pool next door to the handicraft fair, audio artist Antony Hall was putting the final touches to a display of plastic motorised fans. They were suspended by long cables from the ceiling and swayed above electric guitar pickups mounted, which are built to convert the sound of vibrating strings into electricity. As the motors approached the pole-mounted pickups, they caused electromagnetic interference, making the huge room sound as though angry electric bees were buzzing about. ""The idea is for people to walk among them and adjust them"", Mr Hall said. ""As they swing towards you they move, so it's impossible to make them do what you want them to."" The task proved so difficult that one of the amused participants caused a collision between a pole and a fan, making one pickup smash onto the hard tiled floor.  Sound workshop Mr Hall's residency at the Baths included a workshop for artists to experiment with electrical appliances.  Antony Hall, left, ran a sound workshop at Victoria Baths attended by artist Tony Watt, right The group set motorised wheels cascading across the empty pool. They introduced ""brush bots"" to the mix - a collection of floor and vegetable scrubbing brushes that vibrated their way across the tiles. ""We were doing a sound intervention"", explained James Bloomfield, a paint artist who aims to branch out into technological pieces. ""We looked at the materials we had and we tried to fill the space (the room) with as much sound as possible."" Open data The technique of making an everyday item work in a way it is not designed to has sparked a new fad over the last year. Countless hacks of the Xbox motion controller have taken place since its 2010 launch. This video can not be played The Lit Tree is an artistic work which uses LEDs and an xBox Kinect camera to mimic movement, as Ellie Gibson reports FutureEverything has been sporting one such example. The Lit Tree uses the Kinect camera to monitor the position of hands and fingers placed beneath it.  A computer processes the camera image and illuminates a tree in a pattern that matches wherever the hand is placed. The work is part of a display about reinterpreting data. Drew Hemment, director and founder of FutureEverything, introduced the concept of open data to the show. The aim is to enable electronic information to be more tangible for people who are not ""geeks"", as he put it. ""It's making these huge data bases that public organisations now control and sit on, freely available,"" he said. ""It could be data on anything, from where the buses are, to the environment, to our local neighbourhoods. People can build applications and artwork on top of that"". OurCity While some open data projects may be very technical, the OurCity project is intended to interpret information in a way everyone can relate to.  OurCity, designed by Adam Nieman and Will Simm, displays comments by members of the public and categorises them by location and whether they are positive or not Manchester residents and visitors are being asked to pass comment on the city by text message or via a website, external. Each message appears as a thought bubble on a table-top display, linked into the location that the observation was made. ""It's not all Coronation Street"", says one. ""It's a shame that witches were dunked here"" says another - a reference to the city's less savoury history of drowning suspected witches. ""We're using software developed by the University of Lancaster"", explains project artist Adam Nieman. ""It organises comments by theme or sentiment or actionability. We're asking about people's feelings about Manchester and the values they attribute and also their hopes for Manchester's future."" The comments provide a snapshot of life in the city, even if some may seem a little trivial. A hot debate over whether the Arndale shopping centre is ""great"" or ""rubbish"" has ensued. Whatever your views on such burning issues, few could argue with the sentiments of one view that floats around the display board: ""Football is more important to Manchester than other cities.""

investors sentiments,Asia markets drop sharply after US falls,2024-09-15,2018-02-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42998819,"Major Asian markets suffered sharp losses on Friday, following another day of steep falls on Wall Street. In a volatile week for global investors, Japan's Nikkei 225 index slid 2.3%, while China's Shanghai Composite slumped by 4.1%.  Earlier, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,000 points for the second time this week. Sell-offs around the world have been pinned partly on concerns over higher interest rates. Elsewhere in Asia on Friday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3.1%, while South Korea's Kospi index traded down 1.8% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 eased 0.9%. Those losses came as little surprise, with moves in major US markets providing the cue for global investors.  On Thursday, the Dow Jones ended 4.2% lower at 23,860, the S&P 500 closed down 3.8%, while the Nasdaq sank 3.9%. European exchanges also headed south on Thursday.  China was the worst performer in Asia on Friday as losses deepened from declines seen earlier this week.  Chinese stock markets tend to be volatile and are dominated by retail investors, rather than big institutions like many other major markets.  But falls in China can spark nervousness around the world over sentiment in the world's second largest economy.  As well as the broader sell-off, analysts said stocks in China were weighed down by people selling ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. This is a common trend as the need for cash grows during this period - a time when Chinese companies typically pay bonuses and people also traditionally exchange cash and gifts during the period. This global sell-off began last week after a solid US jobs report fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates faster than expected because of the strength of the economy. That concern has prompted the pull-back from stocks.  On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for the view that rates are on the up. The Bank left interest rates at 0.5% at its meeting, but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting. Also worrying investors was a government budget proposal announced by US lawmakers, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation.  Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates. Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity. At the same time, higher interest rates can make investment alternatives to stocks, such as bonds, more attractive. The uptick in volatility comes as investors react to the shifting conditions. And more turbulence could be on the way.  ""The return of volatility after two relatively calm days supports the idea there are further losses to come in the days and weeks ahead,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy.  The chaotic week on global markets also comes as several markets around the world sit on, or near record highs.  Analysts have said for months that financial markets were due a correction, after a long period of rising prices. Thursday's declines mean the Dow and S&P 500 have now fallen by more than 10% from the record highs set in January, a threshold analysts call a correction. Fidelity International's chief investment officer for Japan, Takashi Maruyama, said the ""massive volatility"" was a reaction to the rapid rise on the Japanese market since last year.  He added the sell-off presented a opportunity to buy shares at more ""reasonable"" prices. "
investors sentiments,The idea that shaped the world,2024-09-15,2016-10-06,Tom Hodgkinson,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160920-how-utopia-shaped-the-world,"In the nearly-500 years since its publication, Thomas More’s Utopia has influenced everything from the thinking of Gandhi to the tech giants of Silicon Valley, writes Tom Hodgkinson. An English lawyer, statesman, writer and saint, Thomas More was a strange character. Born in 1478, he was progressive in some ways (he educated his daughters to a very high level) while also clinging to archaic customs (he wore hair shirts). An establishment figure, he was also an enemy of the Protestant Reformation and is known today as a Catholic martyr, having been beheaded by King Henry VIII. Today, though, we may know More best for his invention of a word – and for his development of an idea that would be exported around the world. This concept would shape books, philosophies and political movements as varied as Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, Mahatma Gandhi’s doctrine of passive resistance and the founding of the state of Pennsylvania. The idea, of course, was ‘utopia’. More coined the word to describe an island community with an ideal mode of government. First published in Latin in 1517, the book Utopia means “no place” in Greek; some scholars have said that it may also be a pun on “happy place”. More’s Utopia was not the first literary work to play around with policy ideas: dreaming of a better life is an innate part of being human. In 380 BC, Plato wrote his dialogue The Republic, in which Socrates describes a communistic, egalitarian city-state ruled by philosopher-kings called guardians, made up of both men and women. Instead of procreating within a family unit, these leaders leave the city once a year for a wild sex orgy. The resulting children, happily ignorant of their real parentage and brought up by the state, become the new generation of guardians. Various medieval works also imagined what an ideal society might look like. The great writer Christine de Pizan, who worked for the royal court in France, published The Book of the City of Ladies in 1405. Illustrated by a gorgeous painting of medieval ladies building a city brick by brick, the book defends women’s accomplishments over the aeons and sets up a symbolic city populated by a pantheon of “all women who have loved and do love and will love virtue and morality” – a city meant to be a refuge from patriarchy. Written more than 500 years before Germaine Greer’s feminist milestone The Female Eunuch, it deserves a mention: for most of history, utopian ideas – at least those that made it to publication – have generally been written by men. A very different idea of utopia, meanwhile, also entered the mainstream by the mid-14th Century. This was the Land of Cockaygne, a utopia concocted by medieval peasants and preserved in the Kildare Poems, compiled around 1330 in Ireland. Memorably imagined by Pieter Brueghel the Elder in his 1567 painting, Cockaygne was a land of no work, equality between men and women and no authority figures. It shared one or two features with More’s Utopia – notably a lack of private property – but was a lot more fun. As the poem goes: There are rivers broad and fine Of oil, milk, honey and of wine Every man may drink his fill And needn’t sweat to pay the bill. A key feature of the Land of Cockaygne? Free love. Monks and nuns cavort freely. After prayers, the nuns throw their clothes off and jump into the lake: When the young monks see that sport, Straightway thither they resort, And coming to the nuns anon, Each monk taketh to him one, And, swiftly bearing forth his prey, Carries her to the Abbey grey, And teaches her an orison, Jigging up and jigging down. But though there may always have been fantasies of a communistic Golden Age stretching back through the Middle Ages to antiquity, Thomas More’s genius was to give it a name and create a handy philosophical idea. Man with a plan In part, Utopia was an attempt to cling to the medieval ideal of the contemplative life – an ideal that the Reformation, which privileged action and change, was ‘disrupting’, to use the modern coinage. Monkish life itself was under attack from the forces of the Reformation, and was soon to reach a climax with the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536. More writes of the Utopians: “They think that the contemplation of nature, and the praise thereof coming, is to God a very acceptable honour.” However, like a good modern politician, More also emphasises that Utopia is a land of hard-working families: “idleness they utterly forsake and eschew, thinking felicity after this life to be gotten and obtained by busy labours and good exercise.” More’s ideal state is puritanical. His vision of a perfect society was a long way from the sensual self-indulgence dreamt of by the peasants in Cockagyne. Forget free love and lying around doing nothing. Instead, in Utopia, there is a class of bosses – called the Syphograuntes – who look out for work-shy slackers. And citizens are constantly being watched. More writes: “You see how it is – wherever you are, you always have to work. There’s never any excuse for idleness. There are also no wine-taverns, no ale-houses, no brothels, no opportunities for seduction, no secret meeting-places. Everyone has his eye on you, so you’re practically forced to get on with your job, and make proper use of your spare time.” Utopia has communistic elements too. More had been influenced by the travel literature of the time, particularly Amerigo Vespucci’s accounts, which circulated widely. Vespucci had apparently met tribes of natives who lived in decidedly non-capitalist fashion, as the explorer describes in his memoirs: “They neither sell not buy nor barter, but are content with what nature freely gives out of her abundance. They live in perfect liberty, and have neither king nor lord. They observe no laws. They have their habitations in common, as many as six hundred sharing one building.” Like Plato’s Republic, More’s Utopia is the creation of a well-meaning member of the upper classes with a plan, rather than the live-for-the-moment dream of a peasant or worker. In Utopia, private property is abolished. “There is nothing within the houses that is private or any man’s own,” writes More. Every three months, the people pile up loads of stuff in the market place; anyone can come along and take what they need – like a recycling centre. Above all, Utopia was the earnest attempt to create a fair society, not one which benefited only the rich. “I can perceave nothing but a certein conspiracy if rich men procuring their own commodities under the name and title of commonwealth,” More writes. Designs for living More’s fantasy opened the floodgates for a new wave of utopian writing in the 17th Century. Most of these visions looked either backward or forward: they celebrated an old-fashioned ideal of community or envisioned a future paradise where the machines did all the work. In 1619 came Christianopolis, a Christian utopia by German theologian mystic Johann Valentin Andrea; and in 1623, Italian writer and Dominican friar Thomas Campanella published his City of the Sun. Then in 1627, polymath and Lord Chancellor of England Francis Bacon produced a book called New Atlantis, proclaiming science as saviour. Bacon argued that the state should endow a scientific college, which would invent machines to guarantee England’s pre-eminence on the world stage. His was a tech-based utopia and featured aeroplanes and submarines. As he wrote: “We imitate also the flights of birds: for we have some degree of flying in the air... we have ships and boats for going under water.” In the 17th Century, some attempted to move beyond theory and create living, breathing alternative societies. This was a turbulent period. In Britain, there was a Puritan revolution, the king was overthrown and Cromwell’s Leninist-style Commonwealth endured for 15 years – during which time Christmas, dancing, theatre and maypoles were banned. But rather like later communist governments, the natural tendency of the ordinary people to buy and sell products, celebrate pagan rituals and try to enjoy themselves overcame. Cromwell’s experiment came to an end with the Restoration of the popular libertine King Charles II. In the middle of all this ferment, a farmer called Gerrard Winstanley attempted to create an ideal colony. His followers were called Diggers – and they were the Occupy movement of their day. In 1649, they started digging the common land at St George’s Hill near Weybridge, Surrey, intending to cultivate it. In Winstanley’s pamphlets, he advocated a communistic philosophy: “The earth ought to be a common treasury to all.” The Diggers were attacked by both local men and landlords. Undeterred, Winstanley and his 20 or so followers moved to nearby Cobham Manor where they built four wooden houses. State troops pulled the houses down so the Diggers built “some few little hutches like half-cribs” and planted crops. But the local vicar paid a bunch of men – rather like when security guards are paid to remove protestors from road-building projects – to roust them and pull down any more houses or tents they made. The Diggers gave up that particular battle. But Winstanley went on to write books of utopian schemes and to join another movement with socialist overtones: the Quakers. The charismatic George Fox was the leader of the Quakers. He believed that he and his followers were returning to a pure form of Christianity based on the importance of charity. Unlike some utopian movements, therefore, he did not create a colony of like-minded individuals and escape to it. Instead, Quaker efforts were based around projects to help the poor and to educate people on the arts of self-sufficiency. In 1696, one of the Quakers wrote a pamphlet called Proposals for Raising a College of Industry of all Useful Trades and Husbandry – an idea closely related to More’s medieval notion that everyone should have a trade or craft in order to make an honest living. In fact, handicrafts and small-scale husbandry have been an enduring feature of utopian schemes to this day. (I myself attempted to create a little utopia, too: I lived on a farmhouse in Devon for 12 years and attempted some basic carpentry, kept chickens and pigs and grew vegetables, with varying degrees of success.) Romantic feelings Another charming production of this period was a book called The Isle of Pines by republican wit Henry Neville. Published in 1668, it was the Robinson Crusoe of its day: the hero is stranded on a beautiful island. This utopia is more Land of Cockaygne than tightly controlled socialist system. As Neville writes: “The country was so very pleasant, being always clothed in green, and full of pleasant fruits, and variety of birds, and ever warm, and never colder than in England in September; so that this place, had it the culture that skilful people might bestow on it, would prove a paradise.” A few years later, in the early 18th Century, Daniel Defoe wrote Robinson Crusoe and Jonathan Swift wrote Gulliver’s Travels. Both owed much to More’s Utopia – and both became far better known. Gulliver’s Travels is a journey round a series of utopias, some good and some bad. In it Swift, like previous utopists, rails against the injustice of the modern world in quasi-Marxist terms, complaining that: “The rich man enjoyed the Fruit of the poor Man’s Labour, and the Latter were a Thousand to One in Proportion to the former. That the bulk of our People was forced to live miserably by labouring every day for small wages to make a few live plentifully.” The later 1700s saw a marked decline in utopian writings and utopian experiments. But toward the end of the century came both a revolution in France and a Romantic backlash against the Industrial Revolution. The English Romantic William Blake complained about the “dark satanic mills” where men and women toiled to create enormous wealth for a few. He imagined a utopia called Jerusalem: The fields from Islington to Marylebone, To Primrose Hill and Saint John’s Wood, Were builded over with pillars of gold, And there Jerusalem’s pillars stood. The Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, for his part, hatched plans to sail away from England to America and create what he called a Pantisocracy: a place on the banks of the Susquehanna, Pennsylvania where he and his friends would combine buffalo hunting with philosophising. All property would be in common. The scheme got as far as a flat-share in Bristol and collapsed. One significant, and more successful, utopian figure of the 19th Century was Robert Owen. A progressive mill-owner from Wales, he improved conditions for workers at his Manchester mill, joining the Manchester Board of Health to improve sanitary conditions and in 1817 introducing an 8-hour day for his workers with the slogan “Eight hours labour. Eight hours recreation. Eight hours rest.” Owen launched a more ambitious scheme, though, in 1813, buying a school and ballroom with a group of Quakers in New Lanark, Scotland. It was the first of Owen’s “cooperative villages” – which spread, along with the idea of socialism, throughout Britain. The Victorian period was filled with earnest discussion among do-gooders and intellectuals on how to alleviate the conditions of the poor. In the mid-19th Century, dozens of Owenite experiments sprang up: small co-operative farms and communities, so-called ‘village colonies’ that provided every family with both a piece of land and farming lessons. Most of these schemes failed – or at least did not last long. They did, however, give birth to the co-operative movement which is still with us today and to organisations like Britain’s National Trust. We can even trace the roots of the trade unions back to Owen’s efforts. Also still with us are the model communities of Bournville near Birmingham and Port Sunlight near Liverpool, the first built with chocolate money by the Cadbury family, the second with soap money by Lord Leverhulme, founder of Sunlight Soap (now owned by Unilever). Both were capitalist attempts to build comfortable environments for workers. I went to visit Port Sunlight in the early ’90s and found it to be pretty and well cared for – though residents of the surrounding villages viewed the inhabitants of Port Sunlight as a bit dim and brain-washed. Less successful was a town called Pullman near Chicago, Illinois. In 1880, railroad entrepreneur George Pullman of Pullman Palace Car fame launched the ambitious model village, named after himself. He aimed for the town to run as a business and return a profit to investors. The whole town was carefully planned and built according to what were called “scientific principles” – which made for a number of very unappealing features. First off, like More’s Utopia, there were no wine-taverns or ale-houses and no booze was allowed – though an exception was made for wealthy visitors staying at the grand Hotel Florence. Second, there were no public gatherings of any size. Third, workers had to buy goods in the over-priced Pullman shops. And fourth, no blacks were allowed. In short, it was a disastrous mixture of the worst of centrally-controlled socialism and grasping capitalism – with racism thrown in for good measure. Following the great market collapse of 1893, Pullman hiked rents. The workers were so squeezed, one man paid $9 a month in rent and received a wage check for $9.07. In 1894, 4,000 Pullman residents, like thousands of workers across the US at that time, went on strike. The situation got violent; troops went in to quell the uprising. The government forced Pullman to sell his town. He died in 1897 so widely loathed, he had to be buried 12 feet underground for fear that his body would be dug up and desecrated by disgruntled employees. Pullman’s capitalist utopia demonstrated the fundamental problem in creating perfect worlds: people don’t like being told what to do. Everyone’s utopia is different. And since most utopias are inflexible, what happens to your ideal community when market conditions – which are outside your control – change? New patterns At around the same time in England, William Morris was concocting a far gentler version of paradise. The generously bearded Victorian hero wrote one of the great utopian fantasies, News from Nowhere – a book full of charm, wit and good ideas. Morris also created the company Morris & Co, which had the Thomas More-like aim of restoring medieval attitudes, in particular handicrafts, and providing enjoyable work for people. Morris himself was absurdly energetic, managing to pursue simultaneous careers as a poet, artist, novelist, printer, pamphleteer, painter, designer, typesetter, business man, socialist pioneer and rabble-rouser (he was thrown in jail for attending an anti-war rally). He had little tolerance for the lazy and memorably declared: “If a chap cannot compose an epic poem while he’s weaving tapestry, he had better shut up, he’ll never do any good at all.” Morris is dearly loved by the British left; the great Marxist historian EP Thompson wrote a long and adoring biography of him which emphasised his socialist principles. Unlike the big-headed Pullman, though, Morris never imposed his utopian visions on anyone else by actually creating a commune or village. He was a romantic who became a revolutionary. As he wrote of himself: Dreamer of dreams, born out of my due time, Why should I strive to set the crooked path straight? News from Nowhere was published in 1890. It is sub-titled “an utopian romance”, giving the reader a clear sign that it’s not meant to be interpreted as a blueprint for an ideal community. Really, Morris wanted all people to live what he called a refined life, to have the leisure time to read and play music and think and be poets. Morris’s utopia did not come out of nowhere: there was something of a medievalist fervour at that time. John Ruskin, another medievalist and fan of the guild system, was outlining projects for ideal village communities, while the Arts and Crafts movement also was inspired by the Middle Ages. Morris was attacking the sordid utilitarianism which dominated his own age. In his utopia, presented through a dialogue between an elder of the new world and a young man who finds himself transported there, green fields cover London’s Piccadilly Circus. Money has been abolished. There is no private property. Women of 40 look 20 and wear simple clothes are not “upholstered like arm-chairs, as most women of our time are”. Children get out into nature: when our hero notices that there are camps of feral children living in the woods of Kensington, his guide tells him that “the less they stew in houses the better for them.” Above all, the narrator says, the society reminds him of the 14th Century. Meanwhile, the Houses of Parliament are now used as “a storage place for manure” – quite a satisfying Victorian joke. In fact, Morris’s utopia, refreshingly, has elements of the Land of Cockaygne to it. It is not, like More’s Utopia, puritanical in nature. The inhabitants have a lot of fun: the narrator, for example, records with pleasure that dinner is served with a bottle of very good Bordeaux. Immediately following Morris came HG Wells, who wrote a dozen utopian and dystopian novels. They were generally technological in nature: Woody Allen’s Sleeper, with its giant vegetables, sex machines and robotic butlers, is a satire of Wells’s 1899 The Sleeper Awakes. Perhaps the most surprising reverberation of More’s utopia, though, was found in the towering figures of Leo Tolstoy and Mahatma Gandhi. It’s a little-known fact that the Indian nationalist corresponded with the aristocratic Russian novelist. Tolstoy, an anarchist and a Christian, held that the state was responsible for most of the bad stuff: taxes, wars and general irresponsibility. Tolstoy counselled passive resistance and non-violence instead. Communes based on Tolstoy’s version of Christianity sprang up in the UK. The familiar elements were there: a return to handicrafts and small-scale agriculture, partial rejection of the gewgaws of the modern world, communal dining and shared expenditure. Two of these communes still exist today in the UK. One is the Brotherhood Church of Stapleton, which, according to a recent New Yorker piece, is home to four humans, a deaf cat, a few hens and an enormous cow. The other is the Whiteway Colony in the Cotswolds, formed in 1898. More village than commune, Whiteway is a collection of 68 houses loosely bound by a monthly meeting. In 1909 a young Indian philosopher started to correspond with Tolstoy. He called himself the Count’s “humble follower”; the two men discussed Indian home rule, pacifism, passive resistance, freedom from toil and other utopian issues. In 1910, the young man – Gandhi –launched a cooperative colony in South Africa which he named Tolstoy Farm. It was Gandhi’s utopian thinking, inspired by Tolstoy, that led to his doctrine of passive resistance and his campaign for Indian home rule. Dark visions One of my favourite 20th-Century utopian societies, however, is the anarchist occupation of Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War. Here, from 1936 to the start of Franco’s reign in 1939, authority and rank were suspended, people called each other ‘comrade’ and an anarchist system ruled. It is described without sentiment by George Orwell, who fought for the anarchists, in his account Homage to Catalonia. Meanwhile, utopias continued to hatch from the imaginations of novelists. In 1915, American author Charlotte Perkins Gilman published her feminist utopia Herland. In this ideal society, there are no men at all, and the women prize education above all else. Women have learned to reproduce via parthenogenesis – no men required. Children are the responsibility of everyone, though during the first two years of life the child is closely attached to her real mother. There is no war or private property. At the same time, other novelists decided that it would be more fun to write dystopias than utopias – and hence science fiction began. EM Forster added to the swelling genre with his brilliant novel The Machine Stops. In this grim fantasy, the people live alone in underground cells, connected to everyone else in the world by screen... sound familiar? The machine is worshipped as source of all knowledge and freedom: “The Machine feeds us and clothes us and houses us; through it we speak to one another, through it we see one another, in it we have our being. The Machine is the friend of ideas and the enemy of superstition: the Machine is omnipotent, eternal; blessed is The Machine.” The genre ultimately gave birth to two of the most famous utopian experiments of the 20th Century, both of them literary. Aldous Huxley once said that he originally conceived Brave New World, published in 1931, as a gentle satire of Wells’s endless utopias. Huxley was also worrying about the increasing ‘Americanisation’ of Europe. And there are many of what you might call ‘American’ features in his brave new (and dystopian) world: pain, for example, has been destroyed; when life gets overwhelming, the citizens take the drug soma which is a kind of cross between ecstasy and Prozac. To read the book today is startling as so many of its predictions have come true – like the Philistinism of the state, the debasement of sex and the insistence on happiness. The book was a huge hit. So was George Orwell’s later dystopia 1984, published in 1949. Both books also were loathed by Oxbridge Marxists. One historian called AL Morton, writing in 1952, really believed that a real utopia was being built in Soviet Russia and that Orwell and Huxley’s negative views of a totalitarian state were decadent and counter-revolutionary. Huxley’s ideas, writes Morton, are “self-evidently false, and in practice they are being shown daily to be false before our eyes, in that third of the world which is now building socialism upon quite different postulates.” For good measure, he adds, 1984 “as an intellectual attack on Marxism... is beneath contempt”. Morton then goes on to claim that “the fantasies of Cockaygne... are now being translated into facts in the plans that are now beginning to change the face and climate of the USSR and other socialist countries.” Of course, at the time of writing, the USSR’s leader was Stalin. But such naive and blinkered optimism was typical of the socialist intellectuals of the 1950s. The late ’60s saw hippies pick up on the now-familiar elements of classical utopias like back-to-the-land ideals, small scale crafts, the end of private property, an undermining of bourgeois marriage restrictions and an attack on consumerism. If we have learned anything from surveying utopian writing and real-life experimentation, it is that the same ideals keep returning. Such communal living experiments don’t tend to survive very long. However – though sometimes invaded by violent drug-dealers and various other problems – the anarchist community of Freetown Christiania in Copenhagen has proved decidedly resilient. Founded in 1971 on an old military base, it is today home to 850 citizens and as a thriving bicycle business. Its mission statement reads: “The objective of Christiania is to create a self-governing society whereby each and every individual holds themselves responsible over the wellbeing of the entire community. Our society is to be economically self-sustaining and, as such, our aspiration is to be steadfast in our conviction that psychological and physical destitution can be averted.” Christiania is a car-free neighbourhood, and like other hippy-ish communities allows its residents to build their own houses. The result is a very beautiful architectural vernacular: the houses look like wooden Babapapa houses. A famous son of the village is lead singer of international pop band Lukas Graham, behind the mega-hit 7 Years. Future perfect Today, the utopian spirit is far from dead. Like their capitalist forebears in the 19th Century, Silicon Valley capitalists talk about building ideal societies. In a small way their workplaces – like the Google or Facebook campuses – aim to provide workers with a progressive working environment. More ambitiously, billionaires are planning libertarian colonies. One of the most powerful players in the Californian tech revolution of the last 20 years is Peter Thiel. He was a co-founder of Paypal, which he predicted would be “something big” in a 1999 speech. He also was the first serious investor in Facebook. He invested $500,000 in the company and later sold his shares for $1 billion. Thiel has recently invested over $1 million in a project called the Seasteading Institute. His concept: geeks will set up self-governing cities in the sea free from the interference of government. They look a bit like medieval city-states. The mission statement says that they aim “to establish permanent, autonomous ocean communities to enable experimentation and innovation with diverse social, political, and legal systems"". The back-to-the-land hippy-ish experiments continue, too. The writer David Bramwell recently published his Number Nine Bus to Utopia, his account of a year spent visiting eccentric communities around the world. And Tobias Jones, having written his own account of contemporary utopian experiments, set up one of his own in 2009, a farm-based refuge in Somerset for waifs and strays which he and his wife Fra still run today. His gruelling and frequently comical experiences are brilliantly related in his book A Place of Refuge: An Experiment in Communal Living, published in 2015. Another utopian experiment that survives today is the arts centre and open house colony Dial House, founded by artists Penny Rimbaud and Gee Vaucher in 1968. Situated on an acre of land in Essex, the house has given birth to a number of successful projects including most famously the anarchist punk band Crass, which introduced hundreds of thousands of working-class kids to utopian concepts like vegetarianism, pacifism, the end of wage slavery, feminism and animal rights. So Utopia isn’t dead. But what have we learned from these centuries of ideas, hopes and plans? It seems practically nothing. The communist ideal remains attractive but elusive.

investors sentiments,How modern singing was invented,2024-09-15,2023-05-12,Zaria Gorvett,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230511-how-singing-has-changed-over-the-centuries,"Modern singing – whether on the charts or Eurovision – is radically different to the kind familiar to our ancestors. There was hysteria in the air at 81st Street Theatre in New York. Deep within the building, behind its white neoclassical arches and away from the steady chatter of crowds of adoring fans outside, a new kind of celebrity singer was walking onto a black-and-silver stage. It was February 1929, and just a few months earlier, Rudy Vallée had been an obscure graduate best known to the listeners of WABC radio in New York. He wasn't considered particularly good looking: one biting critic later called him ""a young man whose eyes are too close together and small to be called handsome"". His singing style, too, was highly unusual. But that night, as Vallée began the opening lines of a characteristically sentimental song, the crowd exploded with rapturous applause. The venue had achieved record-breaking sales, mostly with women: so many had turned up, the police had to be called to contain them. His was no longer just a voice for radio. As it happens, the evening did more than catapult Vallée to global stardom. The singer was one of the first singers to practice the art of ""crooning"". This new style was a kind of soft, intimate singing, often likened more to lullabies than to the belting operatic or classical performances audiences were used to in the early 20th Century. Today the term is less well-known, but the style is still as popular as ever. In fact, this was the birth of modern singing as we know it. A matter of projection   For much of the Middle Ages, singing may have sounded distinctly odd. Though the echoes of these ancient voices have been lost forever, there are hints in the historical record that the style of the day was somewhat 'nasal', to match the tones of the woodwind and string instruments popular at the time.   By the 17th and 18th Centuries, a number of famous European singers were castrati – men who had been castrated as children, and consequently never experienced the voice-deepening effects of puberty. Their powerful, 'metallic' voices were the dominant sounds at concerts, churches and palaces for generations, often moving audiences to tears and standing ovations. However, eventually genital mutilation of this sort came to be viewed as unethical and the castrati's distinctive sound went out of fashion. Their 'angelic' singing vanished – and somebody had to fill the void. ""They had had such extraordinary voices, being a large male body just with a tiny childlike larynx, they had incredible vocal facility,"" says John Potter, a singer and author based in the UK. In their place emerged conservatoires and music schools, ""where people learnt to do extraordinarily complicated things, loud things."" The idea that singing should be studied soon became well established, and soon technique came to be valued above all else. The best performers, it was agreed, had clear, dramatic voices. Flourishes such as vibrato, which involved rapid oscillations in pitch, became ubiquitous. ""That hadn't really happened much before that, "" says Potter. ""Before the 18th Century, people more or less sung as they spoke, as far as we can tell."" This included their regional accents: if you were from the British Midlands, this is what you sounded like as a singer, he explains.  A diversity of styles There have always been many different singing traditions outside the Western world, such as throat singing – a guttural style indigenous to peoples in Mongolia, Siberia, and Tuva, a republic in Russia. It's also historically been practiced by Inuit cultures in the Canadian Arctic, Greenland and Alaska. After years of oppression by colonists, throat singing had been dying out in some regions. But recently the practice has seen a popular revival. (Read more from BBC Travel about the comeback of indigenous throat singing.)   ""We do see a major shift during the period,"" says Allison McCracken, a professor of American studies at DePaul University, Chicago, and author of Real Men Don't Sing: Crooning in American Culture. Criteria emerged for what constituted a good singer. ""Often the qualifications were that they would be able to project, that they would be able to enunciate in certain ways, and that they would have what we would consider a trained voice."" For example, one of the most venerated singers of the late 19th century was German soprano Lilli Lehmann. In the manual How to Sing, she provides minutely detailed instructions for aspiring professionals, such as how to keep a breath vibrating in the mouth to achieve a certain note.  However, while tastes for different styles of singing have been continually evolving, all professional singers before the 1930s had one thing in common. In an era before artificial amplification, they had to be loud. That was the only way for their voices to fill a large concert hall. A transformational technology  This changed with the carbon microphone, which was thought up simultaneously by three inventors in the 1870s. These early devices used carbon granules sandwiched between two metal plates to convert sound into electrical signals. The technology was an immediate hit and became an essential part of radio and telephone technology. It also led to a public and bitter feud over whose version came first, including accusations of theft and plagiarism. Meanwhile, the technology was being quietly improved. By the 1920s, microphones were so good, they could be used to broadcast reasonable-quality audio around the world. The popularity of radio boomed – and the way people sung started to change. ""The big advantage was that you didn't have to project your voice in the back of a hall,"" says Potter. ""So you could just sing in a much more natural way. And you get the colours of your own personality coming through."" Enter the first crooners. This group of charismatic, mostly male performers pioneered a style of soft, seductive singing, typically involving romantic lyrics, that rapidly became wildly popular with young women. It was ""said to be peculiarly devastating in its effect on the heart of the emotional flapper"", wrote one journalist in 1929. Unlike their contemporaries, these musicians sounded as though they weren't performing at all, but rather whispering sweet sentiments directly into the listener's ear. This new type of singing was assessed by different criteria, centred on conveying feeling, says McCracken. Technical considerations like projection or hitting high notes became less salient. ""What becomes most important is that they sound sincere."" Crooners weren't allowed to be anonymous voices performing for an audience. They had to seem authentic – and for that, they needed personality too. An unwelcome development    Like all cultural innovations, crooning had its critics. Traditionalists were horrified, with one cardinal publicly condemning the style as a ""degenerate form of singing"" and ""imbecile slush"" – even going so far as to criticise its perpetrators as ""whiners and bleaters defiling the air"". Established musicians and conservatoires weren't thrilled either: crooners were accused of lacking skill and corrupting the youth. However, the crooners weren't finished, and the march of technology enabled musicians to push the style still further. The 1930s saw the development of directional microphones, a variety that pick up sound from a particular direction, minimising background noise. Singers who got close to those microphones discovered the 'proximity effect', which created an even more intimate tone, says McCracken. ""People really liked that sound."" You might also like: With these new singing techniques came a new kind of celebrity. ""Rudy Vallée was really the first pop idol,"" says McCracken. And along with this new lofty status came another invention: the adoring superfan. ""The fan letters to him basically say, 'I don't know why I'm in love with the voice, I don't understand why this is happening to me.'"" The term crooning eventually fell out of fashion, but the trend still lingers in popular music today. ""Anyone who's using popular music in order to communicate their emotions is crooning,"" says McCracken. “They're using microphones, they're singing love songs to a popular audience… that's what crooning is.” We might imagine that people have always sung like Taylor Swift, or the contestants on Eurovision. But for most of history they didn’t. Singing as we now know it was invented in the 1920s. Ubiquitous as the style now is, in those early days it seemed like a fad. One critic predicted, rather hopefully, that crooning would soon go the way of ""tandem bicycles, mah jong and [miniature] golf"". Given that all those things remain popular, he wasn't wrong. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

investors sentiments,Dumb money behaviour explained,2024-09-15,2014-11-03,Ari Weinberg,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20131029-dumb-money-behaviour-explained,"Harold Evensky, who leads financial planning for the firm Evensky & Katz, has long tried to protect his clients from allowing their personal psychological hang-ups to undermine sound financial decisions.   While such is the goal of most, if not all, financial planners, some of Evensky's inspiration has come from an unlikely source — a client. But not just any client. Evensky has gleaned valuable insights into behavioural economics from Nobel Prize-winning psychologist, Daniel Kahneman. Kahneman was awarded a Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002 for helping develop behavioural economics, a field of study that delves into the psychology that clouds otherwise rational economic decision-making.  In his popular writing, Kahneman, a psychologist by training, walks readers through the mental cues that help us make up our minds. When it comes to financial decisions, we can often be tricked (or trick ourselves) into believing that we are making the right choice with our money because we often base those decisions on rosy projections, past performance, linked events or even mushy things like emotion and sentiment.  But that rarely leads to smart decisions or financial gains when it comes to investments. These insights are particularly important for financial planners, who often become voices of reason when we are faced with challenging financial or economic choices.  While Evensky won’t talk about his famous client’s financial tendencies, he spoke with BBC Capital about how he incorporates teachings from behavioural economics in his own work. BBC Capital: What have you learned from Kahneman's academic discipline that either stands out to you, or that you use with your other clients?   Evensky: The first is managing expectations…to help clients understand how they handle issues in different situations. [Behavioural finance shows that] if you give someone a choice of, say, a 100% chance that they will get $800,000 or an 80% chance that they will get $1,000,000 and a 20% chance they get nothing, they take the sure thing. Turn that around, a 100% chance of losing $800,000 or an 80% chance that they lose $1,000,000 and a 20% chance of losing nothing, they gamble.  It’s exactly the same question, but it helps client’s understand the difference between being risk averse and loss averse. People are used to thinking that they don’t want to take risk. The reality is that most investors don’t want to take a risk to get rich, but they will take a risk not to get poor. This helps frame why investors need to be in stocks and not 100% bonds. There’s more risk than just the market going up or down, it’s [the risk of] not having enough money to live off of. BBC Capital: Is there any area where faulty logic like that comes up again and again? Evensky: People have significant challenges when it comes to mental accounting, or mental math. One example is dealing with linked probabilities. If you have a chain of four events, each assigned a 90% probability of occurring, the actually likelihood of your expected outcome is actually 66%. Which number are you making your decision on — 90% or 66%? Similarly, losses hurt more than gains. A client came in after the tech bust — a retired surgeon, the classic curmudgeon. He said, “I don’t get it, I was up 80% last year, but down 60% this year and I’m under water. Shouldn’t I be up 20%?” Mental math prevents you from realizing that the gain from one year and loss from the next are not on the same basis. BBC Capital: Have you found that people’s behaviour outside of their finances is reflective of how they act with money? Evensky: In our experience, there’s really no correlation. Someone may like to bungee jump, but that doesn’t mean that they wouldn’t be a conservative investor. Those deeply concerned with the high cost of medical care down the road [and the need to have money to pay for it], may be highly comfortable [with the risks in] the financial markets. And someone who’s not as concerned may be scared to death of taking risk! BBC Capital: How do you respond to a client who brings you a hot tip or investment idea? Evensky: In these cases, we utilise some of the concepts in behavioural finance, the first is framing. [I say]  “I don’t know anything about that, tell me about it.” Then we hear all of the great things that could happen to their money…and [we] probe more about what could go wrong. Then we go back through their financial plan — and look at capital needs. [Then I explain] If it works, you can take an annual cruise around the world. If it doesn’t work, you have to work three more years. This gives them completely different visions. BBC Capital: What about the biases people have around what they see as obvious — but might be wrong about? Evensky: People often confuse certainty and safety. If they tell me “I don’t want to take risk,” I say “Go bury [your cash] in the backyard, but let’s look at the consequences to your life style.” Don’t trust social security? Then keep working. There are consequences to conservative decisions that might make them anything but conservative [choices]. BBC Capital: How do you get people to focus on decisions that are decades away, like their estate? Evensky:  [The sentiment is:] ‘Who needs it? I’m not going to live that long.’ What they forget is that it’s not just about the probability. If you start giving everything away and don’t die early, you’re stuck. Like everything, there has to be a balance. If they want to give away a lot of money to avoid taxes down the road, we’ll walk them back. If you have enough money to do everything you want to do, that’s fine, but don’t take the risk of going overboard to avoid taxes when you’re dead and then not be dead.

investors sentiments,Bills set to rise to pay for £10bn sewage clean-up,2024-09-15,2023-05-17,Esme Stallard,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65626241,"Bills could rise after water suppliers in England said they were ready to spend £10bn on tackling sewage spills.  The privately owned companies have apologised for the amount of contaminated water being discharged into rivers and seas, amid mounting public anger over the practice. Some campaigners have cautiously welcomed the move, but others say firms are shifting the cost on to billpayers. The industry paid out £1.4bn to shareholders in 2022. Musician and environmental campaigner Feargal Sharkey called it a ""half apology"" that was another attempt to extract more money from customers. ""What I am actually hearing is no apology for the fact we have paid them for a service we haven't got, they are now suggesting we pay them a second time for a service we haven't had,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  ""We should have an apology for the suggestion they are going to put bills up by £10bn for their incompetence and their greed. This is nothing to celebrate."" Companies are sometimes allowed to spill sewage into open water following heavy rainfall to prevent the system becoming overloaded and backing up into people's homes.  But campaigners have long said these spills are happening too often. In 2022, raw sewage was dumped into rivers and seas for 1.75 million hours - or 825 times a day on average.  Untreated sewage contains bacteria such as E.coli and viruses like hepatitis, that can be harmful to animals and humans. Swimming in water where untreated sewage is discharged can lead to serious illnesses such as stomach bugs, which may cause diarrhoea and vomiting, as well as respiratory, skin, ear and eye infections.  Wildlife including fish and insects can also experience kidney issues and die from sewage pollution. Water UK, the body which represents England's nine water and sewage companies, apologised on behalf of the industry for not ""acting quickly enough"". Ruth Kelly, the organisation's chair, told BBC News: ""We're sorry about the upset and the anger from the fact that there have been overspills of untreated sewage onto beaches and into rivers over the past few years.  ""We're sorry that we didn't act sooner, but we get it."" Environment Agency chairman Alan Lovell welcomed the companies' apology but said he wanted to ""see action and a clear plan for delivery"". The companies said on Thursday they were ready to spend £10bn raised from investors to tackle the problem - but admitted customers could see a ""modest"" bills rise as firms looked to recover the costs over time. Water regulator Ofwat said on Thursday it would review the commitment to assess what impact it could have on consumers before spending begins. There are many ways that water companies can spend the money to reduce sewage spills including: But the water companies have come under significant criticism for suggesting bills could be raised to pay for this investment whilst continuing to pay out profits to shareholders. English water companies have handed more than £2bn a year on average to shareholders since they were privatised three decades ago, Whilst customers have seen their bills rise 7.5% since April, water companies say it is below inflation. Downing street has said that water companies should put ""consumers above profits"". The prime minister's deputy official spokesman said the apology from water companies was welcome but acknowledged that more needed to be done.  ""And we've been clear throughout that we don't want to see things disproportionately impacting customer bills, especially given we know that there are people up and down the country who are struggling with the cost of living, which is why we provided the help we have in that area.""  It is not yet known how much bills could rise with the new investment as Ofwat will not make a decision until the end of 2024 on spending plans. Marine conservation charity Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) welcomed ""the long overdue apology"" but said the investment should not be paid for through higher bills. ""The UK public has already paid for environmental protection from sewage - but we're yet to see it. And whilst the water industry rakes it in, this investment pledged by Water UK must come out of water company profits, not from the bill payer,"" said Izzy Ross, campaigns manager at SAS. Commons Environmental Audit Committee chair, Conservative MP Philip Dunne, told the BBC he hoped Ofwat would approve the investment plan. Last year his committee warned the UK's rivers were a ""chemical cocktail"" of raw sewage, microplastics and slurry. ""The water and sewage sector is in listening mode and has provided a promising plan to tackle poor water quality and take vital steps to improve the country's ageing sewerage infrastructure,"" he said. Jim McMahon MP, Labour's shadow environment secretary, said the government was partially to blame for the situation. ""Thirteen years of Tory government failure has left a broken system, capped by an appalling track record of inaction. The Conservatives are the problem not the solution,"" he said. This sentiment was supported by Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey. ""The one apology missing here is from the environment secretary,"" he said. ""This Conservative government has been pathetic on stopping sewage discharges into rivers."" The Green Party called for water and sewage companies to be brought back into public ownership. Water UK said the companies also committed to cutting spills by up to 35% by 2030 and sharing real time data on how often sewage was being spilled into rivers and seas. But this is not a new pledge, as the government announced last month the sharing of data would be a legal requirement for water companies by 2025.  Water UK also said companies would reduce the number of sewage spills by up to 140,000, compared with 2020, when there were more than 400,000 spills.  Environmental campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (Wasp) said that promise was ""meaningless"" unless the volume being spilled is also reduced. Currently, water companies are only required to monitor if a spill is happening but not how much is released.   Peter Hammond, from Wasp, told Radio 4's Today programme: ""All they are promising to do is reduce the number of spills, we still don't know whether they are trickles or tsunamis of sewage going into the river[s]"". Water and sewage services in the UK are devolved and in Scotland and Northern Ireland are provided by government-run companies, in Wales it is not-for-profit. They have their own action plans to tackle sewage spills which are not included in Water UK's announcement. Additional reporting by Jonah Fisher and Sophie Woodcock.
