Bond Yield Sentiment Analysis,Is O'Rourke the heir to Obama?,2024-09-14,2019-03-18,By Anthony Zurcher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47614978,"Beto O'Rourke made headlines while losing an election last year. Now he's running for president and already breaking fundraising records, but is this Texan the real deal? O'Rourke arrived at a gourmet coffee shop in the small south-eastern Iowa town of Mount Pleasant and immediately jumped up on the store's counter to address the packed room.  It was the second day of his presidential campaign, which he announced via an early morning YouTube video, and the O'Rourke operation was opting for a soft launch. He visited smaller towns, in smaller venues, with little advance fanfare.  The coffee shop in Mt Pleasant, an art gallery in Washington, a sing-along bar in Mt Vernon and a house party in Dubuque were among the stops.  All told, the candidate, behind the wheel of a dirty black minivan, covered more than 800 miles in three days. If he had travelled to the big state-college towns of Iowa City or Ames, he probably could have packed a sports arena. Instead, he went for more intimate settings in parts of the state that trend more conservative - counties that were, by and large, carried by Donald Trump when he became only the second Republican to win Iowa in a presidential election since 1984. Last year, O'Rourke himself nearly made history when he came close to unseating a senior Republican in Texas, Ted Cruz. It's part of O'Rourke's presidential campaign message, as it was in that failed Senate bid, that he won't take any votes for granted or look past any voters. Elana Joram, a college professor who saw O'Rourke on Saturday in Waterloo, was impressed. The Texan is a polished speaker, she said, who hits just the right tone - the kind of candidate who could have broad appeal. ""Donald Trump and George W Bush, they can communicate in such a simple, compelling way, and the Democrats get so carried away with themselves that they just forget who they're talking to,"" she said. ""Beto, he's really good in that respect."" If there's a defining attribute of the O'Rourke political phenomenon, it's his ability to connect with an audience. In fact for Democrats - many of whom first learned of the Texan when a YouTube video of him talking about national anthem protests during his Senate campaign went viral - that may be the only attribute they know.  At least for now. On Friday morning, O'Rourke, perched on the coffee-shop bar, launched into the topic making headlines that morning - the shooting at a mosque in New Zealand that took 50 lives. After extending his prayers to the victims, he said the attack is part of a ""larger disease of intolerance"" spreading in the Western world, including the US, which he added was once thought of as the ""most open, most welcoming country"" in the world. Hatred, Islamophobia and intolerance are on the rise, he asserted.   ""The violence predictably follows from the rhetoric that we use. We must be far better than that.""  All this is a preface for what has become the central thrust of O'Rourke's nascent campaign - a call for renewed kindness and decency in the country; an insistence that  Americans need to heal the way people of all political views and backgrounds interact with one another.  It sounds vaguely similar to the ""hope and change"" mantra that propelled Barack Obama to the presidency. It can be a winning message, even if the results of Obama's election didn't exactly heal the national divides. O'Rourke has drawn comparisons with other Democratic politicians - to former New York Senator Robert Kennedy, who had a similar shock of brown hair and a penchant for waxing philosophical. And to his brother, President John F Kennedy.  ""The torch has been passed,"" one elderly supporter bubbled as O'Rourke arrived, a reference to a line about generational change from Kennedy's 1961 inaugural address. O'Rourke said later on Friday that he's flattered people see a connection to Obama, although he says that he doesn't come ""anywhere close"" to the former president.  Another, more modern comparison might be more appropriate, however. And it's one O'Rourke probably won't be as eager to welcome, given a recent spate of scandal - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Like O'Rourke now, four years ago the Liberal Party leader represented generational change after a stretch of conservative dominance. Both have engendered resentment from some within their party for being unqualified for the high political office they sought - a product, it was said, of unearned privilege. Yet both captured the imagination of many.  O'Rourke (46) and Trudeau (then 43) seemed young for their age, with a sometimes-too-tightly-wound energy. The Canadian on the campaign trail had a quick, breathless delivery, while the Texan's every sentence is punctuated by a cavalcade of arm gestures.  He waves, he stretches, he chops. In one frequent move, he shoots one arm straight out and the other back - as though he has caught a wave on a surfboard or, perhaps more appropriate for the former punk band bassist, is riding a skateboard. The mannerisms have already drawn the attention of the man he hopes to defeat next year. ""I've never seen so much hand movement,"" Donald Trump said last week. ""Is he crazy, or is that just the way he acts?"" Reporters following O'Rourke on the stump jokingly share sped-up videos of his gyrations captured on their mobile phones, which make the candidate look like a fighter in an old Kung-fu film.  It's a manner that's easy to parody - late-night comedy spoofs are only a matter of time - but it's also memorable. And his habit of climbing on to restaurant furniture may seem a bit over-the-top, but it also emphasises his youth and vigour in a race where he will face off against several prominent septuagenarians. One of the early critiques of O'Rourke's campaign has been that it's style over substance - that the delivery and the lofty rhetoric is all there is. In his Iowa campaign appearances, however, the framework of a stump speech began to take form.  He talked about changing the attitude in Washington, with a favourite example of how the congressman worked with Republicans to pass a veteran's aid bill. He made a mention or two of his time as a member of the El Paso city council, where he said he learned to be responsive to his constituents. And, in event after event, he pushed three issues - healthcare, immigration and climate change, which he calls ""the challenge of our lifetime, perhaps the challenge of human existence"". The bulk of an O'Rourke campaign event isn't the stump speech, however, it's the question-and-answer session that comes after.  ""Having the humility to listen to and understand things from other people's perspective is not just the best way to run, I think it may be the only way to win and the best way to serve once in office,"" he said in Cedar Rapids. The topics reveal the tensions that have been pulling at all the other candidates, as well. Is he a capitalist or a socialist? A moderate or a progressive? A pragmatist or an idealist? An optimist or a realist? O'Rourke, with his stump-speech vagueness, tries to straddle these lines - or, perhaps, blur them.  ""I'm not big on labels,"" he said at a town hall event in El Paso last December. ""I don't get all fired up about party or classifying or defining people based on a label or a group."" Under pressure from his audience, however, candidate O'Rourke sometimes tips his hand. At least three times during his Iowa tour, the Texan used some version of the line about the ""perfect being the enemy of the good"" - in regards to healthcare reform, gun control and the need for cross-party co-operation.  That is, needless to say, the language of a pragmatist. Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, also running for president, would choke on those words.  Although he talks about progressive goals, his means to achieving them are incremental. He wants a $15 minimum wage, but he'll get there ""as quickly as we can"". He calls universal healthcare ""the ultimate answer"", but suggests a first step is to address the rising cost of prescription drugs and give Americans the choice of private plans or access to the government-run Medicare insurance programme.  For gun control, he backs universal background checks and a ban on new sales of assault-style rifles, allowing current owners to keep their firearms - a position that may anger both sides of the heated issue. He says he's a capitalist, noting that he started a technology business in the late 1990s, but goes on to call the current system in the US ""imperfect, unfair, unjust and racist"". ""I think there is a lot more we can do to make sure that this capitalism is just,"" he said in Mt Pleasant. Progressive critics also point to O'Rourke's voting record during his three terms as congressman, breaking ranks at times to vote with Republicans on tax, energy and immigration legislation. In Mt Pleasant, Tom Williamson - a retired IT professonal from Fairfield, Iowa - asked O'Rourke to explain his votes. ""All I can tell you is what I've shared with you,"" the ex-congressman said. ""The things I believe in, and the things I want to do."" Williamson, who supported Bernie Sanders in 2016 and is leaning towards him in 2020, says he remains sceptical. ""If he's going to put himself squarely in the middle, I wonder how much progress we're really going to make,"" he says.  A few hours later in Washington, Iowa, O'Rourke felt the heat from the other side, when asked to explain a call he made in February to tear down the border wall in El Paso. The Texan sidestepped the issue entirely, instead discussing citizenship for undocumented migrants who entered the US as children - a popular position with most Americans. ""I understand the argument that we don't need to build more walls, but I don't understand the argument that we need to tear down walls,"" said the man who posed the question, Ryan  Turner, a driving instructor from Kalona.  ""If you have that pendulum swing too far to the left, you're going to have those of us in the middle sit this one out."" Discussions of policy details - or lack thereof - weren't the only headaches for the newly minted candidate during his opening presidential tour.  O'Rourke's somewhat chequered past - an arrest for burglary (which he says was a misunderstanding) and driving while intoxicated (for which he says there is no excuse) - once again became uncomfortable topics which he tried to reshape as best he could. He told an audience at a podcast recording in Cedar Rapids that he was fortunate the the incidents did not derail his life. ""It's not because I'm a great person, or I'm a genius, or I've figured anything out,"" he said. ""A lot of it has to do with the fact that I'm a white man."" The experience, he continued, has given him an appreciation for how the criminal justice system does - and doesn't - work in the US and the need for reform. Newly revealed skeletons joined old ones in O'Rourke's closet over the weekend, following a Reuters report that, as a teenager, the Texan had been a part of a notorious hacking group and had penned poetry and stories with violent, misogynistic themes under the pseudonym ""Psychedelic Warlord"". In Cedar Rapids, O'Rourke called the language he used ""hateful"". ""I have to look long and hard at my actions, at the language that I have used,"" he said. ""And I have to constantly try to do better."" The revelations may have particularly damaging resonance for O'Rourke because he's already taking criticism for, to put it bluntly, being a white man with a thin political resume running against a crop of much more experienced women and people of colour.  He seems to be getting more attention from the media, including a Vanity Fair cover story, and more money - $6m raised in the first 24 hours is the highest of any candidate so far. On Saturday morning, Amy Klobuchar - a two-term senator from Minnesota who is also positioning herself as a pragmatic, solution-oriented presidential candidate - spoke at the Blackhawk County Democratic headquarters in Waterloo before a couple of cameras and a room with several dozen supporters. A few hours later, O'Rourke also addressed the Blackhawk County Democrats - from the bed of a red pick-up truck across the street, surrounded by a crowd of more than 150 and at least half a dozen cameras. Part of the attention can be explained by the fact that he is the new face in Iowa, but that hasn't stopped some from taking note. ""Beto gets treated like a rock star,"" says Denny McCabe, a retired teacher and drummer who attended the Klobuchar event. ""The women, not so much. It just seems like it's time for a woman."" O'Rourke isn't helping his cause, either. In his campaign kick-off video, his wife Amy sat silently by his side the entire time, while the candidate spoke. Several times on the trail, he mentioned that she was at home, raising their three kids, ""sometimes with my help"". ""Imagine [Democratic candidate Kirsten] Gillibrand saying this about her kids and still having a viable campaign,"" tweeted Marie Claire editor Chloe Angyal. In Cedar Rapids on Friday night, he acknowledged his ""ham-handed attempt"" at giving credit to his wife had generated some deserved criticism. ""Not only will I not say that again, but I'll be more thoughtful going forward in the way that I talk about our marriage, and also the way in which I acknowledge the truth of the criticism that I have enjoyed white privilege,"" he said. ""I hope as I have been, in some instances, part of the problem, that I can be part of the solution, and I stand very ready and very open to those who can guide me to do a better job going forward,"" he said. O'Rourke may try to pivot and shift and turn a weakness into a strength, but the reality is, at this moment, someone who looks like him, even with his Spanish nickname, may not be what the rank and file of the party are looking for. Lori Feldman, an accountant who attended a Cory Booker rally in Indianola on Saturday, was blunt. ""I think we really need a strong black man to turn our country back after Trump,"" she said, and for her O'Rourke ""is not going to cut it"". In Mt Pleasant, after O'Rourke's coffee shop appearance, Winfield high school senior Liana Sweezer expressed a similar sentiment.  ""I would like to look for a candidate who is a woman or a person of colour, because we have just too many white men in the political system right now,"" she said. Even Elana Joram, the Waterloo professor who praised O'Rourke's rhetorical skill, had her concerns. ""I am a little concerned that he's a white male, and not that I think that's intrinsically a problem, but there are groups of people that I think may not get motivated to come out and vote for him,"" she said. In the current Democratic field, they'll have plenty of choices. Before O'Rourke's appearance in Waterloo, while Klobuchar was still shaking hands and her aides were pulling down her campaign signs in the Blackhawk County Democratic headquarters, an old Iowa political hand was throwing a bit of cold water on the Beto excitement. ""We've seen a lot of huge stars come through Iowa,"" said former Iowa Congressman Dave Nagle, now a lawyer in Waterloo. ""The question is, can he sustain it over a long period of time? A hot start doesn't get you home."" He quipped that ""presidents"" Howard Dean and Ben Carson are visiting Iowa next week, a reference to past candidates who generated the kind of buzz O'Rourke is getting, only to fizzle out in the home run. According to Nagle, the keys to Iowa success are organising and finishing strong at the end - and the first helps make the second possible. O'Rourke has hired a veteran Iowa campaign strategist, Norm Sterzenbach, who helped write the convoluted rules by which the Iowa caucuses will be conducted early next year. That, at the very least, will ensure that the Texan has a solid ground game.  The pressure of national politics, the glare of the presidential spotlight, is something a candidate can't understand until they start to experience it, however. O'Rourke, with questions about his past, controversy over his comments and scrutiny of his record, is just beginning his time in the crucible. For every Kennedy and Obama, there's a Dean and a Carson - flashes in the pan who could inspire a crowd but not get them to the voting booth when it counted.  O'Rourke has the attention. He's getting the money. He has the charisma. But it's a long way, and a long time, from these winding roads in Iowa to the White House. Follow Anthony on Twitter"
Bond Yield Sentiment Analysis,Celebrated spy author John le Carré dies aged 89,2024-09-14,2020-12-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-55297558,"British espionage writer John le Carré has died aged 89, following a short illness, his literary agent has said.  The author of The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy died from pneumonia on Saturday.  Fellow authors paid tribute, with Stephen King calling him ""a literary giant and a humanitarian spirit"". Historical fiction writer Robert Harris said le Carré, who chronicled the world of Cold War spies, was ""one of the great post-war British novelists"". Booker Prize winner Margaret Atwood tweeted that his novels featuring spymaster George Smiley - described by le Carré as an ""antidote"" to James Bond - were the ""key to understanding the mid-20th Century"". Historian and novelist Simon Sebag Montefiore described le Carré as ""the titan of English literature"" and said he was ""heartbroken"".  Jonny Geller, the author's agent, said he was an ""undisputed giant of English literature"" who ""defined the Cold War era and fearlessly spoke truth to power"".  ""We will not see his like again,"" he said in a statement.  Mr Geller said he represented the novelist, whose real name was David Cornwell, for almost 15 years and ""his loss will be felt by every book lover, everyone interested in the human condition"".  ""We have lost a great figure of English literature, a man of great wit, kindness, humour and intelligence. I have lost a friend, a mentor and an inspiration."" A statement shared on behalf of the author's family said: ""It is with great sadness that we must confirm that David Cornwell - John le Carré - passed away from pneumonia last Saturday night after a short battle with the illness. ""David is survived by his beloved wife of almost 50 years, Jane, and his sons Nicholas, Timothy, Stephen and Simon. ""We all grieve deeply his passing. Our thanks go to the wonderful NHS team at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro for the care and compassion that he was shown throughout his stay. We know they share our sadness.""  The statement said his death was not Covid-19 related.  The decades after the end of World War Two in 1945 were dominated by political tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, along with their respective allies in the Western bloc and the Eastern bloc. Both sides were armed with nuclear weapons, discouraging direct warfare because of the risk that both would be totally destroyed. So until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the hostility played out in support for regional conflicts known as proxy wars, propaganda campaigns, psychological warfare and espionage - creating the inspiration for a generation of spy novels and films. Several of le Carré's 25 works were turned into films including The Constant Gardener, The Tailor of Panama and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, while the Night Manager became a successful BBC television series. Smiley, his most famous character who first appeared in Call for the Dead, has been played by actors including Rupert Davies, Alec Guinness and Gary Oldman. Oldman, who appeared in the 2011 film of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, said le Carré was ""a very great author, the true 'owner' of the serious, adult, complicated, spy novel"" and was ""always a true gentleman"". Born as David Cornwell in Poole, Dorset, in 1931, he wrote under the pseudonym of John le Carré. He studied at the university of Bern, in Switzerland, and then Oxford, before entering a career in undercover intelligence.  After teaching at Eton for two years he joined the Foreign Office, and was initially based at the British Embassy in Bonn. During his time there he worked in the intelligence records department, giving him access to files with insights into the workings of the secret service. He also wrote his first novel, Call For The Dead, which was published in 1961. This meant the need for a pen name as Foreign Office officials were not allowed to publish books under their own name. In 1963, his third novel, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, brought him worldwide acclaim and allowed him to take up writing full time.  Le Carré said his manuscript was approved by the secret service because they ""rightly if reluctantly"" concluded it was ""sheer fiction from start to finish"" but he said the world's press took a different view, deciding the book was ""not merely authentic but some kind of revelatory Message From The Other Side"". His career as a spy came to an end in 1964 after his name was one of many given to the Soviet Union by a double agent, an incident which inspired a plot line in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Two things stand out about this prolific and hugely successful author.  Firstly, his novels were the very antithesis of the glamorous, racy world of James Bond as depicted by fellow author Ian Fleming.  Whether it was the grim reality of waiting hours for an agent to cross back into West Berlin in The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, or the drab, grey world of Cold War MI6 that he describes in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, le Carré stripped away the glitz to reveal a world of fallible, flawed characters.  Secondly, there is his extraordinary longevity.  Le Carré, who spent a relatively brief period with MI6, published his first novel in the same year that the Berlin Wall went up: 1961.  Yet long after the Cold War ended, decades later, he went on to diversify into writing about the arms trade, Big Pharma and the so-called War on Terror.  On the few occasions I met him he seemed genuinely surprised at his own extraordinary success. Le Carré turned down literary honours and a knighthood, saying in a 2017 US interview that he was ""so suspicious of the literary world that I don't want its accolades"". ""And least of all do I want to be called Commander of the British Empire or any other thing of the British Empire,"" he added, saying it was ""emetic"" or vomit-inducing. He told CBS News' 60 Minutes: ""I don't want to posture as someone who's been honoured by the state and must therefore somehow conform with the state, and I don't want to wear the armour."" Le Carré described himself as ""English to the core"" but deplored what he saw as the aggressive nationalistic sentiment behind Brexit. ""My England would be the one that recognises its place in the EU. The jingoistic England that is trying to march us out of the EU, that is an England I don't want to know,"" he said."
Bond Yield Sentiment Analysis,Can data reveal the saddest song ever?,2024-09-14,2018-08-22,Miriam Quick,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20180821-can-data-reveal-the-saddest-song-ever,"Data journalist Miriam Quick put Spotify’s new algorithm to the test, analysing over 1000 tracks to find the saddest pop songs to top the charts. The results were surprising. When I was 15 I discovered The Smiths, a band whose name had by then long been synonymous with misery. But it was Morrissey’s unique style of being miserable – coquettish and laced with Northern English humour, flipping between self-pity and irony – that appealed to my teenage self. That and the grandiose but intricately layered sweeps of Johnny Marr’s guitar. I’d always cry at the same points in each song: the end of Hand in Glove, the chord changes before the chorus of Girl Afraid, the line in The Queen is Dead where he sings “we can go for a walk where it’s quiet and dry”. I’m still not sure why the last one had such an effect. Two decades later, Spotify has built an algorithm that aims to quantify the amount of sadness in a music track. The streaming service has collected metadata on each of 35 million songs in their database, accessible through their web API, that includes a valence score for every track, from 0 to 1. “Tracks with high valence sound more positive (eg happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (eg sad, depressed, angry)”, according to Spotify. There are similar scores for other parameters including energy (how “fast, loud and noisy” a track is) and danceability, which is exactly what it sounds like. -       The world’s hardest singing styles -       Why Aretha was the Queen of Soul -       Why disco should be taken seriously The valence data has been a gift to bloggers and journalists with data science skills and a taste for the dark side. It’s been used to develop a ‘gloom index’ of Radiohead songs, to reveal the most depressing Christmas song, to find out which European countries prefer sad songs (Portuguese fado really is a downer) and to show that even Eurovision winners are getting gloomier. (A recent academic study, based on data from the open-source audio repository Acousticbrainz, also suggests UK chart hits have become sadder over the last 30 years.) But how can an algorithm – which cannot feel a thing – tell the difference between a happy song and a sad one? “It’s an initially challenging concept, that you would be able to quantify the sadness that a song evokes”, says Charlie Thompson, the data scientist who developed the Radiohead ‘gloom index’ who blogs as RCharlie. Inspired by his approach, I decided to test the Spotify data out for myself using some of the most popular songs of the last half a century – Billboard number one hits. First, I found the names of all the number ones on the Billboard Hot 100 charts since they began in July 1958, a list of 1,080 tracks. Then I matched them to the Spotify data. Only one track wasn’t on Spotify: Over and Over by the Dave Clark Five. So, what’s the saddest song ever to hit number one? Don’t worry, be happy Before I reveal its name, let’s consider what you might expect a sad song to sound like. Perhaps it would be in a minor key? “Major modes are frequently related to positive valence, or more specifically to emotional states such as happiness or solemnity, whereas minor modes are often associated with negative valence (sadness or anger)”, explains Rui Pedro Paiva, Professor of Informatics Engineering at the University of Coimbra, Portugal and a specialist in music emotion recognition. Surprisingly, this is not the case among this group of Billboard number ones: while there are more than twice as many major as minor key songs, there’s no difference in average valence between them. Perhaps a sad song would be slow, or lacking energy, like the movements of a sad person? This does seem to be the case with Billboard number ones: the lower valence tracks also tend to be lower energy. But some tracks are low valence but high energy – the angry tracks. So a better definition of a ‘sad’ song might be one that’s both negative in its mood and lacking energy, to distinguish it from an angry song. Let’s use both the valence and energy scores to find out the saddest track. This chart would be familiar to music psychologists, who often visualise feelings in terms of valence and energy (or ‘arousal’), and divide them into quadrants based on four basic emotions: sadness, happiness, anger and calm. Sad songs (low valence, low energy) appear in the bottom left corner of the chart, happy songs (high valence, high energy) in the top right, angry songs (low valence, high energy) on the top left and calm songs (high valence, low energy) in the bottom right. On the whole, number one hits tend to be pretty cheerful – the happy corner has by far the most songs. The most upbeat are Hey Ya!, Macarena (hey!) and Brown Sugar by The Rolling Stones. Don’t Worry, Be Happy is the calmest, most chilled-out song. Eminem’s Lose Yourself is off on its own in the angry quadrant. It’s not shown on the chart, but happier songs tend to be more danceable. And the most danceable number one? It’s Ice Ice Baby by Vanilla Ice, which I can totally get behind. But let’s look at what Spotify’s algorithm considers the most miserable songs, down in the sad corner. Five saddest Billboard number one songs 1958-2018, based on valence and energy data from Spotify 1. The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face – Roberta Flack (number 1 in 1972)  2. Three Times a Lady – Commodores (1978)  3. Are You Lonesome Tonight? – Elvis Presley (1960) 4. Mr Custer – Larry Verne (1960)  5. Still – Commodores (1979) The saddest song ever to top the charts since 1958, according to the data, is The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face by Roberta Flack, which was number one for six weeks in 1972. It is not a sad song. It is a tender, soulful love song. Three Times a Lady by the Commodores is also a slow love ballad and Mr Custer is a comedy song about a soldier who doesn’t want to fight. Of the five ‘saddest’, only the Elvis track and Still, another Commodores track, could really be described as sad songs. The algorithm is definitely on to something, but it’s not brilliant at coping with Lionel Richie. Lyrics clearly have a big impact on the mood of a song. The Spotify data appears not to take account of them, although the Radiohead ‘gloom index’ and the other studies do find a way to quantify lyrical sadness using sentiment analysis. So what is the Spotify data based on? They don’t release any information about this, so I ask Glenn McDonald, the company’s Data Alchemist. Yes, that’s his real job title. He’s the man responsible for Every Noise at Once, a visualisation of all 1870 music genres classified by the streaming platform, from ‘deep filthstep’ to ‘Belgian indie’. The valence dataset was developed using human training data, then extrapolated by machine learning, he tells me. Spotify use the track metadata to help editors make the mood-based playlists the platform is famous for: Happy Pop Hits, Easy 00s, A Perfect Day. “The data can find what a human would never have time to collect, but the human can make subjective and cultural judgments that the machines can’t.” I ask him which audio features the algorithm has learned to classify as happy or sad but he doesn’t (or isn’t able to) reveal much: “Valence is one of our elemental features, so it isn't described in terms of others”. The company is currently improving its emotional classification system by asking its users to tag short track excerpts with mood words. (I tried this and it’s not as easy as it sounds.) It’s not just Spotify doing this. Gracenote’s Mood 2.0 employs a neural network to classify music tracks in terms of their mood profile, and the results are incredibly specific: Give it Away by the Red Hot Chili Peppers is 38% ‘loud n’ scrappy’ and 2% ‘alienated anxious groove’. Machine learning is also used in the academic field of music emotion recognition. Starting with a pool of tracks verified as having a particular emotional quality, for example a list of sad songs collated using mood word tags applied by human listeners, it’s possible for a computational model to “automatically learn a mapping between music clips and their respective emotions”, Professor Paiva explains. But it’s not an easy task. “Emotion perception in music is inherently subjective: different people might perceive different emotions in the same song.” Another fundamental hurdle is that “it is not well understood how and why some musical elements elicit specific emotional responses in listeners.” Hence my puzzling waterworks at that one Smiths line. ‘Darling, they’re playing our tune’ Machines can now learn, but so far, they lack the idiosyncrasies of humans, our fine-grained cultural knowledge and our ability to put what we hear into a very specific context. Computers lack emotional memories, too, those autobiographical associations that can imbue music with meaning and richness. (This tendency of music to forever remind us of emotionally powerful things that happened to us is known by music psychologists as the ‘Darling, they’re playing our tune’ theory.) “When you hear a song, you might remember where you were when you first heard it, and that will dictate how you’re going to experience that song in the future”, says data scientist Charlie Thompson. “When a machine looks at a song, it just sees a waveform. It doesn’t even really have a concept of time that’s meaningful.” Spotify’s Data Alchemist Glenn McDonald agrees: “Machines don’t ‘perceive’ music in any human sense. Humans have context and emotion and nostalgia and language and dreams and fears. It's like asking how an airplane goes sightseeing. The airplane doesn't. It's just a thing humans use to do human things at a larger scale.” So when a machine learning algorithm classifies the mood of a track, what is it doing? It can’t attempt to classify the emotions you feel when you listen to a song, at least not yet. Instead, “most current Mer [music emotion recognition] systems are focused on perceived emotion”, says Paiva. That is, the emotion or emotions a person identifies or ‘sees’ in a song – Eminem’s tracks are angry; 70s disco is sexy and joyful; this song is sad. (There’s also a third kind, transmitted emotion, which is “the emotion that the performer or composer aimed to convey”.) Felt and perceived emotion can be quite different, and the ambiguity of the words we use to describe them can bamboozle machines: “when a person uses the tag ‘hate’ it might mean that the song is about hate or that the person hates the song”, says Paiva. At the moment, the best Mer systems are about 70% accurate at recognising static emotions in 30-second musical excerpts, he tells me. That is, if you fed today’s star algorithm 10 song snippets, it would on average label three of them with the wrong emotion. That’s far from perfect, and reducing a track to a single value loses a lot of information about the emotional changes that happen over the course of a track. But the performance of Mer systems is improving all the time. In five or 10 years’ time they’ll be much better. The technology has many potential uses, according to Paiva, from music therapy through to gaming and advertising: “Mer systems could be used to find songs that match a desired emotional context for some product or scene, or to use the audio information to recognise emotion in video.” “We’re at a really interesting moment,” says Nicola Dibben, Professor of Music at the University of Sheffield. Data from online streaming services like Spotify, Pandora, Tidal and YouTube offers exciting opportunities to researchers who want to find out how the acoustic characteristics of music elicit particular emotions in listeners, she says. And the oceans of listening data such services create are potentially a precious source of insights about “people’s actual listening habits”, that is, “what people are really doing with music at a particular moment in time”, whether that’s singing in the shower or crying over a breakup. If those companies share their data with researchers, that is. The crying game There is a darker side. In a speech earlier this year, Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane quoted a study by researchers at Claremont Graduate University (described here) suggesting there’s a link between song sentiment and consumer confidence. The researchers extracted musical and lyrical sentiment data from songs in the top 100 charts from various sources, including Spotify, to show that fluctuations in the average mood of songs could predict the monthly returns of various financial indices. People’s listening tastes appear to shift in tandem with the movement of markets. It’s an extraordinary idea but the logic is plausible: we’re more likely to listen to happy songs in good times, and sad songs in bad times. In his speech, the economist went further: “Why stop at music? People’s tastes in books, TV and radio may also offer a window on their soul.” Haldane’s language is rather Orwellian. Do you want to give a suite of streaming companies, broadcasters and publishers access to your soul? Do you want them to sell your data to third parties? What if your soul is hacked? It’s easy to over-dramatise, but the availability of vast amounts of data gathered by music and other streaming sites does create raise questions of privacy, especially when it’s triangulated with other user data such as location, or used to sell us products. These questions could become more urgent if Mer systems learn to guess what might be going on in an individual listener’s mind, to detect the felt emotion, rather than just assigning each track an emotional label. “Unlike a piece of sheet music, vinyl LP or cassette tape, these new musical objects are actively listening to us, too”, write Richard Purcell and Richard Randall about streaming services in their 2016 volume on music listening. Streaming services are gathering data on our listening habits at the same time as, many argue, they’re also changing them via recommendation algorithms. The window to your soul may reveal more than you think. Research in music psychology suggests musical tastes correlate with personality traits. If you like sad music, you may well be more open to experience and more empathic than someone who prefers their tunes ‘loud n’ scrappy’. But there’s a paradox: sad music is generally pleasurable to listen to. It doesn’t make you sad in the way that happy music can cheer you up, or a scary piano crash in a horror film can freak you out. Theories abound about why sad music should give us this paradoxical pleasure. Do sad songs provide catharsis, a safe space for wallowing in outsourced misery? Do they offer a kind of therapy, an excuse for self-reflection? We just don’t know yet, but the key to understanding why music moves us is going to be more complex than allocating each track one of four basic emotions. Unravelling the tangled web of human felt emotion may be a gargantuan task for machines to master, if we even want them to. Perhaps people simply enjoy the feeling of letting go, of being consumed by the musical soundworld, of being moved to tears. Not sad tears, not happy tears, but tears all the same.
