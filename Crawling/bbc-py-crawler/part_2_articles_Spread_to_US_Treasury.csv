Spread to US Treasury,US accuses Russia of 2024 election interference,2024-09-25,2024-09-04,Sam Cabral,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rx28v1vpro,"The US has charged and sanctioned Russian state media executives and restricted Kremlin-linked broadcasters as it accused Moscow of a widespread campaign to interfere with the presidential election. The justice, state and treasury departments announced coordinated actions on Wednesday to ""aggressively counter"" the alleged operations. Attorney General Merrick Garland accused state broadcaster RT, formerly Russia Today, of paying a Tennessee firm $10m to ""create and distribute content to US audiences with hidden Russian government messaging"". RT boss Margarita Simonyan was one of 10 people sanctioned for alleged attempts to harm ""public trust in our institutions"". RT denied involvement.  Mr Garland said that Moscow wanted to secure a ""preferred outcome"" in the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said that Russia's programme was aimed at ""reducing international support for Ukraine, bolstering pro-Russian policies and interests, and influencing voters here in the US"". A Treasury official meanwhile said that RT and other Russian state media had engaged in a ""nefarious campaign to covertly recruit unwittingly American influencers in support of their malign activity"". The Biden administration's response so far includes: Much of the Kremlin's disinformation effort is directed and funded by RT, Mr Kirby said. ""RT is no longer just a propaganda arm of the Kremlin,"" he said. ""It's being used to advance covert Russian influence actions."" The state media outlet mocked the US government's accusations, saying in a statement to the BBC that ""2016 called and it wants its clichés back"". ""Three things are certain in life: death, taxes and RT's interference in the US elections."" The criminal indictments of Kalashnikov and Afanasyeva do not identify by name the Tennessee-based content creation company they used. But the court filing's description of ""a network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues"" matches the self-description carried on the website of an outlet named Tenet Media. Tenet posts thousands of English-language videos on social media, and promotes well-known right-wing commentators Benny Johnson, Tim Pool and Dave Rubin as its ""talent"". Pool said on Twitter/X that he and other commentators had been ""deceived"" and were themselves victims.  The company has been contacted for comment. US officials warn that a growing number of foreign adversaries have attempted to interfere with its elections since Russia's efforts in 2016. In June, a group of hackers linked to the Iranian government successfully breached Donald Trump's campaign and leaked internal documents. A month later, the Department of Justice announced the seizure of two domain names and the search of nearly 1,000 social media accounts operated by Russian actors to ""create an AI-enhanced social media bot farm that spread disinformation"". Researchers have also uncovered a growing Chinese influence operation aimed at infiltrating and swaying US political conversations on social media. Xi Jinping, China's president, pledged his country would not interfere in the US election during a summit with President Joe Biden last November. Jen Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said on Tuesday that the US could ""absolutely expect... foreign adversaries"" to try to ""undermine American confidence in our democracy... and sow partisan discord"".  ""And that's why it is up to all of us not to let our foreign adversaries be successful."" Eight years ago, Russia conducted a sophisticated campaign that involved hacking the Democratic National Committee and leaking stolen documents to Wikileaks with the intent of hurting Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Many Democrats argue the operation helped contribute to Trump's eventual victory that November. US politicians and intelligence officials have since concluded that the operation was directly ordered by Vladimir Putin, Russia's president. Twelve Russian military intelligence officers were charged in 2018 with orchestrating the effort, and federal warrants were issued for their arrest."
Spread to US Treasury,"War ‘tour’, football and graffiti: How Russia is trying to influence Africa",2024-09-25,2024-09-09,"Chiagozie Nwonwu, Fauziyya Tukur, Olaronke Alo & Maria Korenyuk",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3lky7z7eo,"Teenage footballers listen to the Russian national anthem before a match. Nearby, artists paint Russian President Vladimir Putin’s portrait on a wall during a graffiti festival.  Welcome to Burkina Faso, one of the African nations where Russia is boosting its operations to gain influence. Evidence found by the BBC shows that Russia is using media and cultural initiatives to attract African journalists, influencers, and students while spreading misleading information. These events are being promoted by African Initiative, a newly founded Russian media organisation which defines itself as an “information bridge between Russia and Africa”. It inherited structures previously set up by the dismantled Wagner mercenary group and is believed by experts to have links with the Russian security services. Registered in September 2023, a month after Wagner’s leader Yevgeny Prigozhin died in a plane crash, African Initiative has welcomed former employees from his disbanded enterprises. Its efforts have been particularly focused on the three military-run countries of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.  Following recent coups, these West African nations have distanced themselves from Western allies like France, criticising their failed interventions against jihadist groups and colonial legacies. They have instead pivoted towards Russia. Alongside cultural events on the ground, African Initiative maintains a news website with stories in Russian, English, French, and Arabic, as well as a video channel and five Telegram channels, one of which has almost 60,000 subscribers. Some of the Telegram channels were “recycled” from older ones which had been set up by groups linked to Wagner. They were the first to promote the Russian Defence Ministry's paramilitary group Africa Corps, which has effectively replaced the military wing of Wagner in West Africa. Pro-Kremlin narratives and misleading information, especially about the United States, are rife. Stories on the African Initiative’s website suggest without evidence that the US is using Africa as a production and testing ground for bio-weapons, building on long-discredited Kremlin disinformation campaigns. One story echoes the Kremlin’s unsubstantiated claims about US bio-labs being relocated from Ukraine to Africa. Another maintains without evidence that US bio-labs on the continent are increasing, claiming that “under the guise of research and humanitarian projects, the African continent is becoming a testing ground for the Pentagon”, suggesting that secretive biological experiments are being conducted. While Prigozhin’s propaganda efforts targeted mainly France, African Initiative “targets Americans to a greater degree,” says researcher Jedrzej Czerep, head of the Middle East and Africa Programme at the Polish Institute of International Affairs. “It’s far more anti-American.”  In June, a group of bloggers and reporters from eight countries were invited for a seven-day “press tour” of the Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. The trip was organised by Russian state media and Western-sanctioned Russian officials, and the journalists visited African Initiative’s headquarters in Moscow. ""Africa wasn’t getting much information [about the war],"" Raymond Agbadi, a Ghanaian blogger and scientist who studied in Russia and who participated in the “press tour”, told the BBC. ""Whatever information we were getting was not convincing enough for us to understand what the war was really about.” American influencer Jackson Hinkle, a vocal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has spread multiple false claims about Ukraine, was also on the visit.  After visiting Moscow, the journalists travelled 1,250km (780 miles) to the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol in the Donetsk region. Then they went to towns in the Zaporizhzhia region – all areas which were captured by Russia early in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Throughout the visit, the reporters were accompanied by Russian officials and travelled with the Russian military in vehicles marked with the Z sign – the symbol of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In May, African Initiative organised a separate “press tour” to Russian-occupied Mariupol for a delegation of bloggers from Mali. Press trips for journalists are a widely used tool to attempt to sell a country’s viewpoints. But while “Western media does a lot of progressive training [for journalists] to report on key topics which have become global concerns, Russia uses these guided tours as a way of propagating certain narratives,” says Beverly Ochieng, senior analyst at Control Risks and the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, noting that China organises similar tours. Having African journalists report on their trips gives an “impression of authenticity” because they “reach out to the audience on languages they recognise”, rather than looking like it is part of “a wider campaign used to portray Russia in a positive light,” says Ms Ochieng. In stories published since the trip, the African journalists refer to the Ukrainian cities occupied by Russian forces as ""conflict zones in Russia"" and quote Russian-installed authorities, echoing Russian state propaganda and presenting the Kremlin’s view of Ukraine’s borders. In a piece published on JoyOnline, an English-speaking website operated by the Multimedia Group, Ghanaian journalist Ivy Setordjie writes that the Ukrainian Zaporizhzhia region [whose capital is under Ukrainian control], is ""located in the south of European Russia."" She tells the BBC she disagrees that the regions were illegally annexed by Russia, affirming that her reports are reflections of her own judgement and “not tilted towards” the country. Beyond press tours, local affiliates of African Initiative in West Africa's Sahel region have been actively involved in community outreach efforts aimed at boosting Russia’s image. The BBC has been monitoring African Initiative’s Telegram channels and Facebook pages, where videos, images, and reports of their work on the ground are shared. In Burkina Faso, we found reports about a football competition where the Russian national anthem was played, “friendship lessons” in schools where students are taught about Russia, a competition of the Soviet martial art “sambo”, first aid workshops for citizens and policemen, and a graffiti festival where participants drew Russian President Vladimir Putin alongside Burkina Faso’s former leader Thomas Sankara, all sponsored by African Initiative. Images also show African Initiative members distributing groceries to locals and neighbourhood screenings of the Wagner-backed documentary The Tourist, about a group of Wagner instructors in the Central Africa Republic, where Wagner and its offshoots have been helping the government fight rebels for several years. “The original idea with the Africa Corps was to erase whatever military structures Prigozhin had developed and to replace it with something new. African Initiative, often serving as its media wing, was more accommodating and happy to reuse all assets that were already there,” says researcher Mr Czerep from the Polish Institute of International Affairs. The FSB, the Russian Federal Security Service, plays an important part in the new organisation, he notes. The head and editor-in-chief of African Initiative is Artyom Kureyev, identified by Russia experts as a Russian Federal Security Service agent. Mr Kureyev is linked to the Valdai Club, a Moscow-based think-tank close to President Putin. African Initiative’s website lists Anna Zamaraeva, a former Wagner press officer, as deputy editor-in-chief.  Viktor Lukovenko, known as one of Prigozhin’s “political technologists,” founded the Burkina Faso office of the African Initiative but left the position in recent months. A former Russian nationalist with a criminal past, Mr Lukovenko served five years in prison for an attack in Moscow on a Swiss citizen who later died. We reached out to African Initiative for comment. Its office in Moscow confirmed it had received our queries but its response did not reach us by email. The African Initiative reacted to the BBC story in an article on its website, quoting a response it said it had sent to the BBC. The organisation said its “humanitarian activities in the Sahel, such as the football competition” aimed to “improve Russian football and recruit new players” and the goal of film screenings and school lessons is to introduce the people of Africa to “the great Russian culture”. The organisation reiterated and defended the stories which were highlighted by the BBC as misleading, however it didn’t provide any new evidence. It referenced the Russian constitution and Russian laws as the justification for its terminology when referring to areas of occupied Ukraine as Russian territory. In February, in response to a report by the US Department of State, an article on African Initiative’s website stated that its editorial board “insists that its purpose is to spread knowledge about Africa in Russia and popularise Russia in African countries”, giving “various Africans an opportunity to be heard, including their criticisms of Western countries”. Meanwhile, the organisation continues intensifying its outreach in the Sahel. In the last week of August, about 100 students in Burkina Faso attended a talk about training opportunities in Russia.  ""I learned about the culture of Russia and the relation between our governments,"" said a smiling teenager wearing a T-shirt with an African Initiative logo in a video recorded after the discussion.

Spread to US Treasury,Theatre launches knitting campaign for panto props,2024-09-25,2024-08-19,Katharine Wootton,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz73l0ndzx5o,"It may still be summer, but a theatre has already started looking ahead to its Christmas pantomime.  Richmond's Georgian Theatre Royal have appealed for knitters to create woolly props for their festive show, Treasure Island. Theatre staff have called on the community to make knitted or crocheted ice creams that will be thrown on stage as part of the show, as well as decorating the theatre's foyer.  The Georgian Theatre Royal has called on local crafters to help their annual pantomime since 2011 with local yarn-lovers creating everything from bananas to snowballs. In the early days, the project typically attracted contributions from just the local area but has since spread far and wide, with knitters from as far afield as Australia sending in their pantomime presents. “As soon as the curtain went down on last year’s pantomime, we started receiving phone calls and emails asking what the next knitting project will be,"" theatre manager Jo Mawhinney said. Richmond resident Jen Capewell has been among the local knitters who have been helping out the theatre ever since the first appeal for help.  “It’s great fun to be part of something that gives so much pleasure to so many people,"" she said.  After the knitted objects have been used on stage, they are then donated to local groups including local nurseries and playgroups who use them to help teach children. “It is fantastic the way that everyone gets involved with this project from experienced knitters to those who are picking up their needles for the first time. ""Each knitted item that we receive is very much appreciated as we know what huge effort goes into creating them,"" added Ms Mawhinney.  For this year's project, which will see knitted ice creams thrown on stage - as would have taken place in a traditional Georgian theatre - crafters have been asked to create any kind of ice lolly, ice cream or even an ice cream wafer sandwich.  Inspiration for knitted and crochet pattern examples can be picked up from the theatre box office, where finished creations should also be handed in or posted to before 30 November.

A spokesperson for the union is quoted as saying there's still ""a long way to go"" in negotiations.  The paper's editorial warns against giving into unions, saying such deals put ""public sector workers ahead of tax payers"" and have ""disturbing shades of the 1970s"". But the Daily Mirror's political columnist, Paul Routledge, praises ministers for trying to end industrial disputes, saying: ""Sort-it government is what the public wants."" The Daily Mail highlights figures published on Thursday which suggest the UK economy grew by 0.6% in the three months to June. It says Labour's ""doom-laden claims about the Tories' economic legacy"" have been left in ""tatters"".  The Daily Express has a similar take. Its front page headline declares there's ""surely no need for tax hikes with our growing economy"". The shadow chief secretary to the treasury, Laura Trott, has written a comment piece for the paper arguing that the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has ""no excuse"" to announce any increases in taxation when she sets out her budget this autumn. The Financial Times has spoken to government insiders who insist ministers aren't ""abandoning supercomputing"" - despite scrapping £1.3bn in support for projects. The paper says Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is trying to contain the fallout from the decision - which included axing funding for a supercomputer at Edinburgh University.

Spread to US Treasury,Joy and relief as South Africa manages to keep its lights on,2024-09-25,2024-08-06,Ed Habershon,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng1ygxzddo,"Regular power cuts had become a feature of South African life and fed feelings the country was moving in the wrong direction, but the electricity supply has been uninterrupted since March leaving people to wonder what has changed. It is a crisp winter’s day in Johannesburg, a clear blue sky shimmering over the bustling township of Alexandra, or Alex, as it is more commonly known here in South Africa. Sizeka Rashamosa is standing in her restaurant, a stream of people swirling around her, some delivering crates of beer, another grilling meat on a hotplate. A group of young men are sitting at a sun-drenched table. “I can’t talk,” she says, “I’m busy.” It is a far cry from when we first met in March last year, at the height of South Africa’s power crisis and frequent load-shedding, the official term for scheduled power cuts. Back then Ms Rashamosa had very little electricity, and just one customer. A reflection of the wider impact on the economy. “The power is everything,” she said at the time. “I’m very stressed. We don’t have money because of the electricity, you can see it’s dark. I don’t think I’ll survive in my business. We’ll have to close down after 25 years. It’s terrible.” But now, when she finally finds a few minutes to talk, things are more positive. “The load-shedding is much better now,” she says. “You can see, there’s electricity. And now I’m busy. I’m going to stay open, no plans to close, not anymore.” It is a remarkable turnaround. Load-shedding began in 2007, reaching a low last year with power cuts often lasting more than half a day. This year it was expected to get worse. But now there has been no load-shedding for more than four months - since 05:00 on 26 March to be precise - the longest break in more than four years. How has the turnaround happened, and will power cuts return? It is largely because of a set of programmes from the state-owned power provider Eskom and the government over the last two years. In July 2022 President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the Energy Action Plan, and the following February he declared a national state of disaster over the electricity crisis. Soon after he created the role of electricity minister, appointing Kgosientsho Ramokgopa.  And then Eskom launched the two-year Generation Operational Recovery Plan, the key aim of which was to increase the amount of power - known as the “Energy Availability Factor” (EAF) - to 70% of the network’s potential. At the same time Eskom overhauled its leadership, which most point to as a crucial factor.  For years the company had been beset by corruption under former President Jacob Zuma, known as ""state capture"", when it fell victim to acts of theft and sabotage. A former CEO even claimed to be have been poisoned. “If you look at them now, it's a good mix. You have technical people, you have financial people, you have people with skills in turn around,” says energy analyst Ruse Moleshe. “Our 40,000 employees that we have are more committed, more motivated, because load-shedding really was discouraging all of us, morale was very low,” says Daphne Mokwena, Eskom’s national spokesperson. Another significant move last year was a 254bn rand ($14bn; £10.9bn) debt-relief package from the treasury to plug Eskom’s financial blackhole. As a result there has been a substantial reduction in unplanned outages at Eskom’s power stations, that had been caused by break downs in units.  This in turn meant that a programme of planned maintenance could be carried out. That has led to more energy capacity, and on 23 July it reached 35,000 MW, its highest in six years. “There's been a pipeline of these large projects,” says energy expert Chris Yelland, referring to the plans that had been put in place since July 2022. “It's like having a pipe where you stuff marbles in one end, and you keep on stuffing them in because it takes a long time, and eventually the marbles start popping out.” Then there are the external factors. “The first thing one can say is that the total demand for electricity [from Eskom] by the South African economy as a country has been reducing, for a decade,” says Mr Yelland. This is down to two factors - the increasing energy bills and the spread of alternative energy sources. “Every year we have an electricity price increase from Eskom at several times the inflation rate so the real price of electricity is going up and has been doing so for years,” says Mr Yelland. “And there has been a remarkable increase in solar and battery energy storage systems across the board from individual residential applications, to commercial, industrial mining and agricultural.” Sluggish economic growth has also led to less upward pressure on the demand for power. Minister Ramokgopa holds frequent media briefings in the capital, Pretoria, by far the most in South Africa’s government, and regularly visits Eskom’s power stations. He was typically upbeat in his latest briefing, particularly proud of the fact so much was being achieved in winter, the time of year that sees the most demand on power. But could all of this have happened much sooner? “I think we could have managed this situation better when we were told much earlier 'you're going to run out of capacity, invest in new generation capacity',” Mr Ramokgopa told the BBC. “We thought the market will resolve that problem, when in fact the state must lead, and we didn't create conditions for the market to respond appropriately.” He also admits that load-shedding played a role in the disastrous election result in May for the African National Congress (ANC) when it saw its vote share fall below 50% for the first time. “Our core base was not convinced that the administration is capable and willing to resolve the problem. We have paid the penalty, we are here, government of national unity are committed to that and to resolve the South African problem. I'm confident that we'll get it right.” As a result of the changes is load-shedding now a thing of the past? “It is too soon to claim victory,” said President Ramaphosa in an address last month. “Our electricity system is still vulnerable and we cannot yet rule out - yes - possible challenges going forward.” There is still the occasional power cut - what is known as “load reduction” - whereby Eskom switches off power in high-usage areas to prevent damage to local infrastructure, like transformers, which would in turn lead to more lengthy power cuts. Eskom mainly attributes this to illegal connections and overcrowding of properties - what it and the government refer to as “backyard dwellers”. The government says 5% of South African households are affected by load reduction. But things seem genuinely positive. “We're not out of the woods yet, but the probability of us going back to load-shedding is very slim if we keep doing what we are doing currently”, says Daphne Mokwena. Back in Alex, Ms Rashamosa is preparing for a busy weekend, one she could not have imagined this time last year. “Life is much better now,” she says, then darts off into the back of her restaurant.

Spread to US Treasury,Copenhagen is incentivising tourists to be good,2024-09-25,2024-07-31,Adrienne Murray Nielsen,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240730-copenhagens-new-copenpay-scheme-rewards-tourists-but-does-it-actually-work,"Scoop up litter from canals. Volunteer on an urban farm. Pedal by bike instead of driving. As a reward for green deeds, visitors to Denmark's capital, Copenhagen, can get perks like free ice cream, glasses of wine and discounted museum entry. It's part of a newly launched initiative called CopenPay, which encourages travellers to think and act a little more sustainably. From art galleries to sports-rental outfits, 24 attractions are taking part in the one-month pilot scheme, which runs until 11 August. This welcoming approach stands in stark contrast to other European cities, where mass tourism has ignited tensions. To limit visitor numbers, Venice has introduced daily entry fees and banned large groups and loudspeakers, while in Barcelona and Majorca, residents have protested in the streets. With the behaviour of holiday makers increasingly in the spotlight, often for the wrong reasons, Carina Ren, a professor and tourism researcher at Aalborg University, thinks ""CopenPay is super timely"". ""It tries to give a little bit of an answer to how tourism can pay back and how it can help,"" she told the BBC. With a population of around 600,000, Denmark's compact, bike-friendly capital often ranks among the world's greenest cities. However since the pandemic, record numbers of tourists have flocked to the country. Last year Copenhagen saw more than 12 million international overnight stays, with July and August the peak season.  Greeted by screens in the airport promoting CopenPay and banners on the side of buses, visitors are now being nudged to play their part by making more sustainable choices like greener modes of transport and reducing waste, while they also enjoy the city's cultural experiences.  ""We want tourism to be a force for positive change and not an environmental burden,"" explained Rikke Holm Petersen, director of marketing at tourism board Wonderful Copenhagen who are behind the initiative. ""When you go travelling, you sometimes forget the good habits you have at home,"" she added. ""We want to inspire a more conscious, sustainable mindset and behaviour amongst travellers."" The launch garnered huge media attention and Petersen is adamant it's not a marketing stunt. ""We haven't done this to attract tourists. Obviously, we have many already."" I wondered, will Denmark's carrot rather than stick approach work? And could it be a model for other destinations? As a writer living in Copenhagen, I decided to test it out to see how tourists can give back to their host city, and learn what they thought of the scheme. My first activity was a morning dip and communal singing session – both popular Danish pastimes. My eco-friendly deed: simply turning up by foot. My reward: complimentary coffee. With deep breaths and tingling muscles, I clambered quickly out of the cold seawater at 08:00 having just plunged myself into a small pool tethered to Copenhagen's harbourfront. Feeling buoyed by newfound energy and a warming cup of coffee, moments later I was joining more than a dozen other early risers for avery Danish singalong, belting out the Beatles classic Let it be followed by Frank Sinatra's Fly Me to the Moon – all English-language songs so everyone could join in. Singing enthusiastically near me were Jasmine Blakeway and her friends from Birmingham in the UK, who'd learned about CopenPay on Instagram. ""We thought what a great way to start our morning,"" Blakeway told me, adding that embracing local culture and trying to act sustainably was something they cared about. ""It is important to us that wherever we go, we only leave a positive mark."" My next adventure started by entering a discount code into an app, hopping onto an orange rental bike and pedalling southwards along the waterfront, where I boarded an electric GoBoat. More than 500 people had booked out the slots available via CopenPay for a free hour-long boat trip in return for picking up litter while exploring Copenhagen's waterways. Moving barely faster than walking pace, our small battery-powered boat cruised through a canal, circling Denmark's brooding parliament. Overlooked by grand historic buildings and towering church spires, we soaked in the surroundings, all while armed with small fishing nets, scouring the water for rubbish. However, with Copenhagen's canals being so clean, it proved to be tricky to spot any. Finally, we scooped up a crisp packet and plastic toy plane. ""It's very, very clean,"" said tourist Mark Brown back on the jetty. ""We didn't find very much."" Holidaying with his family from York, they booked the boat rental ""to do something different"". Similarly, GreenKayak, which is also part of CopenPay, loans kayaks for two hours free-of-charge to those picking up rubbish. ""When you hear that you have to collect trash, maybe for some people it doesn't sound like that much fun,"" GreenKayak's Elisabeth Friis Larsen said. ""But when people do it, they actually find themselves enjoying being on a treasure hunt. But it's a trash hunt."" Exploring the scheme further, I biked beyond the city centre to Refshaleøen, a former industrial zone that's now a popular foodie hangout and arts destination. It's also home to the urban farm Oens Have (""Island Garden""). Marooned among warehouses and boat hangars, it's a veritable green oasis where sunflowers reach skywards, and butterflies and bumble bees dance on the purple cornflowers and strawberry patches, alongside a hen coop and beehives. Volunteering in the garden, my first task was to remove dried-out flower heads from a bed of yellow and orange calendula and then weed a patch of leeks. Kneeling in the sunshine for a couple of hours, it was easy to forget I was in the city, and rather than feeling like a chore, it was really rather blissful. ""It's a place where you can come and use your hands. Here you can be present with each other, have a really nice conversation,"" explained Oens Have co-founder, Livia Urban Swart Haaland, as we collected handfuls of wonderfully fragrant coriander seeds. ""These are used fresh, and in ferments and pickles, by our restaurant,"" she added, which tucked inside a yurt, focuses on seasonal produce. More like this: • 10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024 • Are we seeing the slow decline of the travel selfie? • Why do tourists behave badly on holiday? Among rows of kale and rhubarb, more than 30 green-fingered volunteers were mucking in with weeding and harvesting; a spectrum of nationalities and ages from retirees to families with small children, including a handful who'd signed up through CopenPay.  ""We're just happy that people have the opportunity to join in who wouldn't have heard about it. I think it's really nice when you travel to contribute and go a little deeper into the culture,"" said Haaland. Our efforts were rewarded with a delicious lunch of mixed vegetables and fresh bread. We sat elbow to elbow around a communal table and everyone was soon eagerly chatting. Italian tourist Sara Carenini, who was travelling solo in Scandinavia, said she was drawn to the social side of volunteering. ""Around the table, nobody is a stranger,"" she said. ""I really enjoyed that part of it."" However, she also felt it can be tricky navigating how to act sustainably. ""It's very hard these days to differentiate what is and what isn't greenwashing. But at the end of the day, if you're a tourist, why not do it consciously and give something back to the city?"" It's evident there's strong interest in CopenPay, with many of the scheme's activities already booked up. But litter-picking and volunteering doesn't appeal to everyone, especially when on holiday. On iconic Nyhavn, Copenhagen's picture-postcard street lined with colourful buildings and vintage sailboats, several tourists I spoke to liked the idea of doing green deeds, though none were taking part in the CopenPay scheme. ""We're here three more days. During a trip like this, I probably wouldn't do it,"" one man told me. ""But if I was here for maybe, say, two weeks, I definitely would."" A young woman agreed, adding, ""It's probably a good way for young people who are on a budget to get to experience more.""  For Berit Charlotte Kaae, a senior researcher in tourism at Copenhagen University, CopenPay is a small step in the right direction. ""I think it's an interesting 'carrot-way' of trying to change people's behaviour,"" she said, noting though that the immediate green impact of the scheme is probably limited. ""In the overall picture, I don't think it's going to really do a lot for environmental issues. The big impact comes from how you get here,"" Kaae said, pointing to polluting transport like air travel and cruise ships that should be addressed. Ren added that she would like to see attractions more spread out away from the usual tourist trail. And in a city where most people already get around by bike or public transport, she thinks the bar for some rewards is set a little low.

Spread to US Treasury,Kemi Badenoch announces bid to become Tory leader,2024-09-25,2024-07-28,Sam Francis,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw0yr7pyzneo,"Kemi Badenoch has promised to ""renew"" the Conservative Party as she becomes the sixth person to launch a bid to become the next Tory leader. The shadow housing secretary said she would return her party to ""first principles"" including a focus on sovereignty and a revived confidence in capitalism. The 44-year-old hoping to take over from ex-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak regularly tops polls among Conservative Party members. She joins Dame Priti Patel, Mel Stride, Robert Jenrick, Tom Tugendhat and James Cleverly in the race to replace Mr Sunak. Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman has said she will not be running. Ms Badenoch said the Conservative Party needed to focus on ""doing some things well, not everything badly"" to recover from their worst ever election result - which left them with 121 MPs. Writing in The Times newspaper, she said: ""My campaign is launching with an explicit focus on renewing our party for 2030 – the first full year we can be back in government and the first year of a new decade."" Under her, the Conservatives ""will speak the truth again"" and return to its roots, Ms Badenoch said. In her article, Ms Badenoch made a case for leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), a major dividing line within the Conservative party. Some Conservatives argue leaving the convention is key to controlling immigration and enhancing national security, but others worry it could damage the UK's international reputation and legal protections. ""We can’t control immigration until we re-confirm our belief in the nation state and the sovereign duty it has above all else to serve its own citizens,"" Ms Badenoch said. ""Our public services will never fully recover from the pandemic until we remember that government should do some things well, not everything badly."" Central to her pledge for ""renewal"" and ""reuniting the Conservative family"" is an unwavering embracing of capitalism. ""The wealth of our nation is built upon our historic ability to capture the ingenuity and industry of our people, and the willingness of many to trade risk for reward,"" she said. ""It’s become a dirty word, but our renewal must also mean a renewal for capitalism."" A committed Brexit supporter, Ms Badenoch was first elected as an MP in 2017 and used her first parliamentary speech to celebrate the Brexit vote as ""the greatest ever vote of confidence in the United Kingdom"". She gained her first major ministerial role in the Boris Johnson government, serving under then-chancellor Mr Sunak in the Treasury. Ms Badenoch emerged as a darling of the right of her party during her time as women and equalities minister in 2021 for her stance on trans rights. She previously ran for Conservative leader following the resignation of Boris Johnson and came fourth despite starting the race with a relatively low profile. Ms Badenoch now regularly outperforms her rivals in approval ratings among party members, according to surveys on Conservative Home - a popular website among activists. Before even announcing her bid, Ms Badenoch claimed she was a victim of ""dirty tricks"" by fellow Conservatives - passing on ""dishonest"" and damaging claims about her to the media. In a social media post, Ms Badenoch said a team behind another leadership bid had sent a “dirty dossier"" to journalists and spread rumours she had secretly set up a leadership campaign website. At the same time, a story about her appeared in The Spectator magazine, claiming an online profile going by the name of ""Kemi"" on a Nigerian website in the mid-2000s had made a series of ""direct, sometimes rude, often confrontational"" comments.  The article said the statements did little to damage her forthright reputation and were unlikely to hurt her in the leadership race. Tory MPs aiming to become the next Conservative leader must secure the backing of 10 MPs and raise £200,000 by 14:30 BST on Monday to enter the first round of voting. Mr Sunak will remain Conservative leader until his successor is announced. The process to choose his replacement will see Tory MPs narrow the field of candidates who secure enough backers to four by the time of the party's annual conference in Birmingham at the end of September. MPs will then hold a series of votes to narrow the field to a final two contenders, with party members then choosing the winner. The online vote will end on 31 October, with the result announced two days later on 2 November, three days before the US presidential election. Ms Badenoch and the other five candidates for the Tory leadership will not face competition from Ms Braverman, who was widely expected to enter the contest. Writing in the Telegraph, she said there was ""no point"" in her running to lead the party ""when most of the MPs disagree"" with her. The acting editor of Conservative Home, Henry Hill, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Braverman had ""woefully misjudged the mood of the party around and immediately after the general election"".  ""She was well out on the right. She wanted to come to some kind of immediate deal with Reform UK which was not a particularly popular proposition. ""And she did things like attacking the government before the close of the polls when Tory members were still out there  trying to return Tory MPs."""
Spread to US Treasury,The Swiss city that runs the Olympics,2024-09-25,2024-07-25,Norman Miller,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240725-lausanne-the-swiss-city-that-runs-the-olympics,"Set dramatically among a picture-perfect lake, mountains and hillside vineyards, this unassuming city offers a unique glimpse at how the modern Games came to be. In the 1890s, when French baron Pierre de Coubertin set about reviving the ancient Greek sporting games first recorded at Olympia in 776 BCE, he thought about following classical precedent and giving his modern Olympics a single permanent location, too. But instead of considering his own birthplace (Paris) or perhaps the world's most populated city at the time (London) as a potential permanent host city, he imagined staging his modern Games in and around a small Swiss city he had fallen in love with on the shores of Lake Geneva: Lausanne.  Like many past visitors – from Charles Dickens to long-time resident David Bowie – Coubertin fell in love with Lausanne's dramatic waterside setting framed by craggy Alpine peaks and striking Unesco-inscribed hillside vineyards. Arriving in the city in 1913, Coubertin gushed with enthusiasm for a place he described as ""spread out delightfully along the shores of the lake, crowned by forests, provided with every conceivable sporting possibility."" While others opted to make the revived Games a globetrotting event held in different cities, Coubertin's passion for Lausanne led him to establish the city as the permanent home of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) two years later in 1915. Following the outbreak of World War One, a beguiling city in neutral Switzerland was seen as a practical (and pretty) choice. The official relocation ceremony took place in 1915 at the 17th-Century City Hall on Place de la Palud, overlooking an atmospheric cobbled square now home to chic shops and weekly markets, watched over by an ornate 16th-Century fountain. Ever since, Lausanne has overseen the Games wherever they are held, and promoted the uplifting principles of the Olympic movement worldwide. As the 2024 Olympics kick off in Paris, visiting Lausanne offers a unique opportunity to discover how the ancient Games were reborn, and how the modern Olympic movement has sought to blend culture and history alongside sports.   After stepping out of a central train station proudly adorned with the Olympic rings and a declaration of Lausanne's official status of Olympic Capital, an easy 15-minute walk leads you down to the chic shoreline neighbourhood of Ouchy, where the Olympic Museum's gleaming, modern facade faces the mountains across the lake. Classical Greek-style columns flank the entrance to this one-time European Museum of the Year, while surrounding parkland features eye-catching sculptures celebrating specific sports or famed athletes. Inside, the world's largest collection of Olympic heritage objects provides a fascinating sporting panoply: reproduced items related to the ancient Games; evocative vintage artefacts (a primitive 1920s bobsleigh, Jesse Owen's 1936 running shoes); an array of Olympic torches spanning the decades; eye-catching posters for past Games. Giant screens replay memorable sporting episodes, while interactive machines offer visitors a chance to test their own balance, strength and coordination in sporting settings, such as a platform mimicking the moves involved in downhill slalom skiing. One corner highlights Coubertin's own notable prowess in boxing, fencing, riding, tennis and rowing. Pulling together the museum's ever-evolving displays is a global effort. ""For each edition of the Games, a team called the Heritage Hunters travels to negotiate donations and collect artefacts. Most of our artefacts are donated – 70% percent in 2023,"" said Angelita Teo, director of both the museum and associated Olympic Foundation for Culture and Heritage. ""We look at acquiring items with high storytelling potential, which help us share Olympic values, the history and the voices of athletes."" The museum will also be heading to Paris for the 2024 Games, courtesy of an offshoot exhibition entitled SPOT24 beside the Eiffel Tower. ""It's an interactive space that shines a light on six new and urban Olympic sports and disciplines: skateboarding, sport climbing, BMX freestyle, surfing, 3x3 basketball and breaking, and the vibrant cultures surrounding them,"" Teo explained.  As well as discussing athletic physiology and psychology, Lausanne's 1913 Olympic Congress (where those in the Olympic movement both planned events and discussed key underlying principles of the Games) was complemented by a cultural programme including a floating Venetian fete and local choir performances which exemplified the ideal unification of sport, culture and education that Coubertin dubbed Olympism.  The Congress itself took place in the grand Renaissance-style Palais de Rumine, which has morphed into an atmospheric free history museum on Place Riponne, a square now served by a metro station named Riponne-Maurice Bejart after the dancer whose illustrious ballet company  provides a perfect contemporary fusion of artistry and athleticism at Lausanne's grand Beaulieu Theatre. A stone's throw away from Place Riponne, travellers can test their own athleticism on the Escaliers du Marché, a striking series of medieval covered wooden stairs leading up to the Gothic Cathedral de Notre Dame that dominates an enclave of cobbled streets and grand buildings and has grandstand views over the rooftops to the lake and mountains beyond. Given the importance of diverse arts and culture [inclusivity is a key principle of Olympism, so worth highlighting that here] to Coubertin's big idea of Olympism, he would have likely been impressed by how another historic villa near the Bejart Ballet now hosts the inspiring Collection de L'Art Brut, one of the world's leading museums dedicated to art brut (or as art historians have dubbed it, ""raw art."" This unique collection provides a thought-provoking complement to the contemporary art, design and photography museums clustered together to create the Plateforme 10 complex located beside the central station. When Coubertin made Lausanne the home of the International Olympic Committee in 1915, its headquarters were set up at the beautiful Casino de Montbenon, near the city's current hipster enclave, Flon. This monument of Olympic history is now home to an excellent brasserie, fronted, as in Coubertin's time, by a formal garden terrace with sweeping lake and mountain views. More like this:  • When painting and sculpture were Olympic events  • The world's most extravagant wine event  • Nine iconic sites in Paris where Olympic events will be held Along the lake shore, a long javelin throw from the Olympic Museum, the Chateau d'Ouchy is another of Lausanne's many important Olympic sites, and it happens to be set beside a little harbour from where a unique fleet of gorgeous vintage paddle steamers depart for lake cruises. Wrapped around a 13th-Century tower that reflects its past role as a fortress, the chateau today is a grand luxury hotel. But in 1926 it hosted the conference where Coubertin underlined key tenets of the modern Olympic movement, such as the ""right to sports"" and the ""right to access of general culture."" The hotel's quayside restaurant serves up even more stellar lake and mountain views, as well as excellent versions of traditional Swiss dishes, like grilled veal paillard with confit lemon butter or perch fillets from the lake outside, and superb Swiss white wine made from Chasselas grapes from the neighbouring Lavaux vineyards.   The picture-perfect setting that Coubertin so admired underpins Lausanne's sports-loving DNA. It's the headquarters of more than 40 international sports organisations and federations, and thanks to its high sports participation rate among residents and the city's athletic infrastructure, Lausanne is regularly listed as one of the world's leading Sports Cities. The vast liquid expanse of Lake Geneva, for example, provides a watery arena for various sailing and rowing clubs, which have honed the skills of local Olympians bound for Paris 2024, such as sailor Maud Jayet and rower Barnabé Delarze. The jagged Alpine peaks surrounding the city offer athletes ice- and snow-based training, while the city's hills, woods and shore offer a wonderful backdrop for runners – though the city's steep inclines also feed Swiss jokes about how Lausanners generally have the best legs in the country. Two kilometres north of the Chateau d'Ouchy, Olympic history buffs should look for a hilltop park near the Bessieres metro station. Mon Repos was the 18th-Century mansion where Coubertin lived and worked during the 1920s and '30s – and where the IOC relocated in 1922 when it outgrew the Casino de Montbenon. It was at Mon Repos where Coubertin also began gathering Olympic artefacts that provided the seeds of today's museum in Ouchy. Though visitors can no longer go inside the villa, you can still wander the surrounding landscaped park, home to regular free summer events, such as the annual Lausanne Garden Parties programme of concerts, screenings and other cultural offerings.   Back beside the lake, Chateau d'Ouchy is the start of a 3.5km promenade along a wooded shoreline to the leafy suburb of Vidy, a stroll that comes with ample opportunity to pause at waterside bars and diners, or take a bracing swim from tiny sandy beaches dotting the shoreline.  Set back from the shore at Vidy, the 18th-Century Chateau de Vidy became yet another headquarters for the IOC in 1968 after the IOC outgrew Mon Repos. The organisation has since moved next door into a modern building whose futuristic grass-covered glass-and-steel curves provide sharp contrast to the adjacent chateau, as well as the nearby ancient ruins from the city's former time as the Roman lakeside settlement of Lousonna. If you'd like to find out more, the city's Roman Museum is just a few minutes' walk inland.   The Chateau de Vidy is a fitting setting for one final stop along Lausanne's Olympic-inspired trail. Vidy is Coubertin's final resting place, and he is buried in the gorgeous Cemetery Bois-du Vaux just behind the Roman Museum, near the grave of a very different local A-lister, fashion designer Coco Chanel. Unlike her more grandiose tomb, Coubertin's grave is marked with a simple stone memorial – adorned with the Olympic rings symbolising the legacy a French baron gave to Lausanne, and the world. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram. "
Spread to US Treasury,The superbugs lurking in seas and rivers,2024-09-25,2024-07-13,Anna Turns,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240709-why-cleaning-sewage-out-of-uk-waterways-could-stop-amr-superbugs,"Drug-resistant superbugs are on the rise, prompting researchers and campaigners in the UK to call for a water system clean-up. I'm a goggles-on, face-underwater kind of swimmer, yet these days I hesitate before I dip my head beneath the surface of the sea. In recent years, increasingly frequent spills have released millions of hours-worth of untreated sewage into UK rivers and coastal water. The immediate health risks are numerous: exposure can lead to acute sickness, ear infections or a tummy upset. But that's not all – there's another potential health hazard lurking in those polluted waters. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) develops when the genetic codes of pathogens, including bacteria present in sewage, mutate to resist medicines designed to control infections. Infections caused by the resulting drug-resistant pathogens, sometimes referred to as ""superbugs"", are estimated to be directly linked to 1.27 million deaths each year and the UK's special envoy on antimicrobial resistance, Dame Sally Davies, has called this threat ""a global antibiotic emergency"". By 2050, AMR could cause 10 million deaths annually, according to the UN Environment Programme. The World Health Organization (WHO) labels AMR a ""silent pandemic"" because it's a serious threat to public health globally – yet it's not often talked about by the media or policymakers. Untreated sewage is one possible avenue for AMR's spread. And once untreated sewage pollution containing AMR reaches the environment, people – including swimmers like me – can be exposed. But while sewage spills regularly make headlines, AMR often gets overlooked. So behind the scenes, scientists are working hard to quantify which sources of AMR are the most dangerous and which solutions could be the most effective to reduce the spread of AMR. Not only in the UK, but globally too.     Curious about whether I have ingested any AMR, I'm getting tested to check whether my guts have been colonised by a particular type of antibiotic resistant E. coli. A quick, simple and not-so-glamorous screening test involves sending a faeces sample off in the post to Elitsa Penkova, an evolutionary microbiologist at the University of Exeter in the UK. As part of her PhD, she's coordinating the Poo-Sticks project to assess the link between sewage pollution in UK rivers and antimicrobial resistance in swimmers and non-swimmers – by analysing poo samples from 300 people. While I wait for my results, Penkova explains that humans don't metabolise antibiotic medicines well: ""Up to 70% of these antibiotics can be excreted via urine and faeces"", so some get unknowingly flushed away down the toilet. Sewage pollution includes effluent from waste water treatment plants, combined sewer overflows that discharge raw sewage into waterways when the system becomes overloaded, such as during heavy rainfall, and septic tanks. Hospital wastewater is another source of antibiotics. And around half of all the world's antibiotics are used on farms, so agricultural run-off is a major concern. Antimicrobial residues end up in soil, river sediment, waterways and oceans. A new water quality report from environmental charity Earthwatch Europe concludes that 75% of the UK's rivers are in poor ecological health.

""Polluted rivers offer favourable conditions for the emergence, spread and maintenance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria,"" says Penkova, whose research follows the University of Exeter's 2018 Beach Bums study, conducted in collaboration with Surfers Against Sewage, an environmental non-profit campaigning for cleaner, safer waters. During this research, comparisons of faecal samples from UK surfers with people who don't go in the sea showed a strong association between water users and AMR. Guts of surfers were about three times more likely to harbour antibiotic-resistant E. coli – a bacteria listed as a priority pathogen by WHO that grows in the presence of cefotaxime, a common antibiotic – than non-surfers' guts. Researchers also found that surfers swallow up to 10 times more water than sea swimmers so could potentially be more vulnerable to ingesting antibiotic resistant bacteria. However, a 2023 Irish study found that coastal swimmers were less likely than non-swimmers to carry antibiotic resistant bacteria in their guts. Those results contradicted the Beach Bums results, possibly because swimmers swallow smaller volumes of water than surfers, suggests Penkova. Polluted rivers aren't a threat solely to swimmers and surfers. ""There are many ways you might ingest AMR,"" says Giles Bristow, chief executive of environmental non-profit Surfers Against Sewage (SAS). ""Some people might paddle or walk into the water after their dog – if they have a cut on their foot, for example, AMR might get into the bloodstream. Polluted water can also get into your ears, eyes or mouth."" While carrying AMR doesn't necessarily make someone poorly, and that bacteria can be excreted without causing problems for healthy people, continuous exposure does increase the risk that AMR gets passed on to someone more vulnerable to infection. ""It's a nasty bug,"" says Penkova. ""It's hard to prevent [serious illness] because these superbugs are easily transmissible and there are limited treatment options for AMR infections – antibiotics simply won't work. That's the biggest concern."" Currently, when rivers and coasts are monitored by government authorities (the Environment Agency in England, Natural Resources in Wales, and Scotland's Environment Protection Agency) for sewage, levels of just two prevalent bacteria – E. coli and intestinal enterococci – are measured because they are well-studied and predictable. Yet these indicators only give a snapshot view of river health status and subsequent risk of AMR spread, as Bristow explains: ""There are thousands of different species of increasingly antimicrobial resistant bacteria that are pathogenic. Our sewage system is a breeding ground for AMR,"" he says.   Wastewater is a major contributor to AMR. Treatment plants act as both a sink and a hotspot because it's where bacteria from faecal material are removed, whether they carry resistance genes or not. It's also where those bacteria mix with other bacteria naturally present in the activated sludge flocs (a gel-like material covered with masses of microbes that biodegrade organic material and filter out most pathogens). The high nutrient concentrations  on these flocs mean that bacteria reproduce quickly and genes, including those for antibiotic resistance, can transfer faster. Jan-Ulrich Kreft, associate professor in computational biology at the University of Birmingham in the UK, studies the complexities of wastewater treatment plants and aims to quantify the pathways of transmission of AMR through the environment. ""We don't yet know whether the run-off from cows or manure spread on fields is as significant as the human sewage pathway. Once we know that, we can prioritise interventions and gauge progress from that baseline."" ""Wastewater treatment plants remove all bacteria – and their resistance genes – by about 100-fold as a rough rule of thumb,"" says Kreft who explains that untreated sewage is always significantly worse that treated sewage. In the UK, all human sewage gets treated except effluent released via combined sewer overflows (often but not always during rainy weather), or sewage that leaks out of holes or cracks in the old, often Victorian, pipes. Nobody knows exactly how much untreated sewage gets spilled but one study calculated that 11 billion litres (2.4 billion gallons) of untreated sewage was discharged from just 30 UK wastewater treatment plants in 2020 – equivalent to the volume of 4,352 Olympic-sized swimming pools. For that reason, Kreft argues that the installation of volume metres at storm overflows should be a legal requirement: something recommended by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee, but left out of the 2021 Environment Act. A little AMR can also remain in treated effluent and E. coli is one of the bacteria that doesn't bind to the sludge flocs – instead it flows through the system and out into the waterways. In developing countries the situation can be much worse, Kreft says. In India's Musi River, where only about 20% of sewage gets treated because the population is growing faster than treatment plants can be built, urban rivers are full of raw sewage.  ""Treatment plant effluent is actually cleaner than the polluted river water,"" says Kreft.   AMR is a mobile entity, moving around the globe via shipping and tourism – so improving wastewater treatment in developing countries would help tackle the AMR issue in the UK, says Kreft. In fact, the UK government recently pledged £85m ($108m) to support international efforts to improve access to antimicrobial drugs in Africa and monitoring of AMR globally. ""It's a global problem – people travelling from countries in Southeast Asia are likely to return with resistant bacteria in their gut,"" says Kreft. ""Airplane toilets are full of AMR and these resistant bacteria can stay in the gut for a few months. It might not be a problem, but if you get ill and take a course of antibiotics, then you're selecting for resistant bacteria. If resistant genes transfer to the pathogen causing your infection, the medicine won't work."" In 2022, scientists at the University of York in the UK led a global project monitoring pharmaceuticals that carried out the first worldwide investigation of medicinal contamination in the environment. Of 258 rivers across the globe tested for 61 pharmaceuticals, a quarter tested positive for some, including commonly used antibiotics, at high enough concentrations to drive the evolution of AMR. The AMR problem is also forecast to worsen as the growing world population puts greater demand on existing sewerage infrastructure and increases the need for more wastewater treatment plants. Climate change-induced extreme weather is a threat multiplier too. During droughts, sewage in waterways becomes more concentrated, while floods increase the run-off from agricultural land and overwhelm sewers, causing raw effluent to divert into rivers. Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. ""When rivers flow fast, some bacteria in the river sediment become resuspended and released back into the water column, so it's a good idea not to swim in rivers after heavy rainfall,"" warns Kleft. Rising temperatures have an effect too. Bacteria grow more quickly in warmer sediment or water and a 2018 US study found that an increase of 10C (18F) is consistently associated with increased levels of AMR in common pathogenic bacteria.  In the UK, however, there are growing calls for a sewage-system clean up. In 2023, 1,924 people reported getting ill after entering UK waters, as outlined in SAS' latest water quality report.  According to Bristow, ""about 60% of those cases were in bathing waters classified as 'excellent'; the places that we encourage people to go in and swim"". Bristow says his non-profit is pushing for an independent inquiry into the issue of sewage pollution and widespread lack of water quality monitoring. ""[AMR] is not a future threat – it's a now threat and our waste treatment systems are absolutely central to building resilience,” he says. According to a spokesperson for Water UK, the trade association for water and wastewater companies, research shows that wastewater treatment works ""are effective"" at removing AMR genes and organisms from effluent. Water companies have also proposed prices hikes to fund further investment in infrastructure, including treatment works, some of which the industry's economic regulator Ofwat has approved. Countries with advanced AMR monitoring strategies, such as Iceland, Finland and Slovenia, also have some of the cleanest waterways in Europe. So one solution, Bristow suggests is to better resource the UK Environment Agency – the government department monitoring water quality. ""There's a huge lack of monitoring so we don't really understand what's in our rivers and coastal waters,"" he warns. According to the UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), both its department and the Environment Agency are also part of a £24m ($31m) Treasury-funded pathogen surveillance in agriculture, food and environment (Path-Safe) programme. This aims to detect and track pathogens and associated AMR through the food and water system, and has been trialling new approaches for environmental surveillance. More like this: • The unnatural impacts of natural gas • How unhealthy air changes body and mind • Parisians save 'le pipi' to help the Seine ""I don't think people realise how urgent this is….it's not something we often talk about because it's unpleasant and scary,"" says Penkova, who wants policymakers to urgently prioritise this issue and tackle systemic antibiotic overuse in both the medical sector and industrial agriculture.   But there are also steps individuals can take too, she adds: ""The first step is to avoid overusing antibiotics, always finish a course of medicine and stop wasting antibiotics"". Furthermore, the development of new, targeted antibiotics is another frontier in AMR prevention, with some signs of promise. Microbiologists at Queen's University Belfast recently identified how a bacteria protects itself from the effects of antibiotics and this could lead to novel drug development in the future. Meanwhile, chemists at King's College London have discovered a way to speed up the production of new antibiotics. Researchers at the University of Stirling in Scotland are also developing a new, low-cost system for monitoring freshwater quality that uses innovative sensor technology and artificial intelligence to flag polluted waters. After a few days, Penkova gets in touch with the results of my E. coli test. My sample doesn't show any evidence of AMR which is good news…for now. A person's gut microbiome is dynamic – it fluctuates depending on the food and drink they consume, the people they interact with and the places they visit. But Penkova doesn't want to put people off swimming: ""I want to empower people to become more informed and call for change to clean up our waterways,"" she says.  While confirmed presence of E. coli cannot be definitively linked to the waters someone swims in, scientists like Penkova are working hard to quantify those links and encourage greater antimicrobial stewardship within healthcare and farming – that begins with doctors and vets only prescribing antibiotics when essential and appropriate, so not as a preventative measure or to treat viral infections that won't respond to antibacterial drugs. On a personal level, I'll definitely be avoiding any default use of antibiotics unless absolutely necessary and I'm going to do my best to avoid exposure to AMR in the environment too. I will be checking for pollution forecasts more carefully via the SAS safer seas and rivers service app, I definitely won't be swimming in rivers or coastal waters after heavy rainfall, and I'm taking the unused antibiotics in my bathroom cabinet back to my local pharmacy to be disposed of safely. -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

Spread to US Treasury,Extra £3.2m for museum and library 'won't go far enough',2024-09-25,2024-07-10,Lorna Prichard,https://www.bbc.com/articles/cj7dzdjdeyeo,"The National Museum is receiving additional funding for ""emergency repairs"" An extra £3.2m for emergency repairs at the national museum and the National Library of Wales ""won't go far enough"", believes Amgueddfa Cymru Chairwoman Kate Eden. In announcing the funding, Cabinet Secretary for Culture and Social Justice Lesley Griffiths said: “It is a very small amount. I fully appreciate that, but that’s all I can find this year."" She also described it as ""horrific"" seeing lots of buckets to collect rain water at the national museum in Cardiff.  Ms Eden of Amgueddfa Cymru - which looks after museums in Wales - agreed it was ""a small amount"".  An estimated £25m is needed for critical urgent repairs to the National Museum building,  but Ms Eden called it ""a positive step"". National Museum will not shut, minister promises Vaughan Gething defends Museum Wales cuts Ms Eden said: “The money won’t go far enough. But it will allow us to get the technical expertise to put that business case together, to make some immediate emergency improvements, and improve accessibility.” The museum, which is over 100 years old, has a leaking roof which means paintings have to be removed from top floor rooms and stored elsewhere during heavy rainfall.  Speaking to a Senedd committee about a previous visit, Ms Griffiths said: ""I have never seen so many buckets catching water. It was horrific.""  She also told the culture committee that ""significant millions were needed to fully repair"" the museum's roof.  Amgueddfa Cymru chairwoman Kate Eden said the money ""won't go far enough"" but is ""a positive step"" Ms Griffiths said: ""I’ve reprioritised my budget to find that funding. Talking to the staff here it absolutely will help get those urgent repairs done this year but I fully appreciate in the long-term we’re going to need significant funding here.” She said the money had been found by scrapping plans for a museum of north Wales and an anchor site for the National Contemporary Art Gallery scheme, which is currently spread across nine art galleries.  ""We can’t have a new building when we’ve got iconic buildings like this that need funding,"" she said.  Asked if she thought people in north Wales would feel ""let down"", she said: ""No, I don't think so. I'm from north Wales and I don't feel that at all."" She said the National Slate Museum in Llanberis, Gwyedd, had already received ""significant funding"" to improve it, with renovations expected to close it for a year from November 2024.  Buckets have been used to collect rain water at the national museum   In December 2023 Museum Wales and the National Library in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, were notified of a 10.5% a reduction in their funding - the biggest cut in their history.  In April Museum Wales chief executive Jane Richardson said ""at least 90 jobs"" would have to be cut, but an exact figure has not been announced while the consultation is ongoing.   In total the seven Amgueddfa Cymru museums need an estimated £90m in total towards repairs and improvements.  The other sites include the St Fagans National Museum of History, Big Pit Coalmine in Blaenavon, National Waterfront Museum in Swansea, National Wool Museum near Llandysul and the National Roman Legion Museum in Caerleon, Newport. National Library of Wales chief executive, Rhodri Llwyd Morgan said this money will go towards essential renovations to the National Library building in Aberystwyth. “The national collection that is kept here is a treasure that belongs to the nation and the funding will enable works that are much needed,"" he said. ""Completing these works will mean that the collections are safe in the long-term and will ensure access to them for future generations.” A further £500,000 funding will go towards independent museums and archives across Wales.

Spread to US Treasury,A new way to see the world's most-visited city,2024-09-25,2024-07-01,Jennifer Hattam,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240701-istanbuls-plan-to-save-its-cultural-soul,"An extensive culture and heritage restoration campaign is revealing previously overlooked layers of the world's most visited city. For decades, the dome-topped turret of the Bulgur Palas in Istanbul's central Fatih district could only be glimpsed peeking out over the top of the high walls that surround this abandoned century-old mansion. Now the palace offers sweeping, panoramic views of the Marmara Sea, the city's minaret-studded historical peninsula and its skyscraper-studded new business district in the distance. Restored and reopened in February 2024 as a cultural centre, complete with a 150-seat library, exhibition space, garden cafe and observation terrace, this former residence and Ottoman Bank archive is one of dozens of previously inaccessible sites across Istanbul – ranging from Byzantine-era fortifications to late-Ottoman-period factories – that have been opening to the public over the past five years. The result is a wealth of newly restored attractions that reveal little-known historical and cultural layers in the world's most-visited city. ""Istanbul cannot fit into a single photograph; wherever you go in the city, you can find these little gems,"" says Mahir Polat, who has spearheaded this city-wide restoration drive since 2019 as deputy secretary-general of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (İBB). According to Polat, the restoration projects aim to create new public spaces in the dense metropolis and breathe new life into neglected historical sites that were at risk of earthquakes and further urban development. But they may also point towards a more sustainable tourism strategy for a city straining under the weight of 20.2 million international visitors in 2023 – a 26% leap compared to 2022. Lines often stretch down the block to get into top sights such as Topkapı Palace, home to the Ottoman sultans; the Byzantine-church-turned-mosque Hagia Sophia; or the ancient underground Basilica Cistern. ""Tourists always tend to go to the same places, which can create problems anywhere in the world,"" says tour guide Sinan Sökmen, the founder of Istanbul Tour Studio. ""These additional landmarks have the potential to spread tourism around."" As an example, Sökmen points to the Gülhane Park Cistern, a 1,500-year-old reservoir that was restored by the municipality and reopened to the public in early 2023. Just a 10-minute walk from its larger, more popular cousin, Gülhane is only one piece of a city-wide cistern system once comprising more than 200 underground and open-air reservoirs that provided water to the city's residents. It sits inside a leafy park that was part of the private grounds of Topkapı Palace and is also home to the Column of the Goths, perhaps the oldest extant Roman monument in the city, and the Alay Köşkü, a gem of a 16th-Century pavilion where the Ottoman sultan would view his parading troops.  This kind of multi-layered history is everywhere in Istanbul, which was founded in the 7th Century BCE and catapulted to power to become the seat of the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman empires. Today, it remains the only place in history to have been the capital of consecutive Christian and Islamic empires, and the only city in the world spanning two continents: Europe and Asia. In the century since the creation of the modern Turkish Republic in 1923, Istanbul's population has soared from fewer than 1 million people to a sprawling megalopolis of roughly 16 million people (the largest city in Europe), spurring a building boom that has left ancient monuments marooned in seas of concrete. The rapid pace of change has also created a newer set of at-risk cultural landmarks: 19th and early 20th Century residential and industrial sites that have been abandoned and neglected despite the important chapters they represent in Istanbul's evolution.  When author Ayşe Övür was a university student in Istanbul in the 1990s, she and her friends would frequent cafes on İstiklal Caddesi, a broad thoroughfare in the Beyoğlu district that had been a fashionable address during the latter days of the Ottoman Empire. On these excursions, her eye was particularly drawn to the ornate Art Nouveau decorations on one building: a 1901 apartment where Dutch fashion designer Jean Botter, the official tailor to the Ottoman palace, had his home and atelier.  ""Not only the sultan's family, but also other rich and famous people of the era came to Botter for their clothes,"" says Övür, who used the building as the setting for her 2019 novel, Botter Apartmanı. She says Botter was the first person in Istanbul to establish a fashion house, introduce the white wedding dress to Turkish society and host fashion shows, making him an important symbol of broader Europeanising trends at the time.  Later rented out to publishing houses and other commercial tenants, the once-majestic building had sat empty for decades by the time the Istanbul municipality started the process of restoring it in 2021. It reopened in April 2023 as Casa Botter, a public art and design centre with rotating exhibits featuring Turkish modern and contemporary artists. On the other side of the Golden Horn, a 19th-Century weaving factory that initially produced fezzes and military uniforms is now hosting an exhibition of 20th-Century optical and kinetic art from the Tate Collection. The restored building, now known as Artİstanbul Feshane, was one of the city's first to be constructed from steel; its original cast-iron columns, brought to Turkey from Belgium, are still in place.  Preserving and revitalising Istanbul's industrial heritage sites, which form a crucial part of the city's transition from the Ottoman to Republic era, has been one of the focal points of the municipality's restoration efforts. Rapid industrialisation began in Istanbul in the mid-1800s as part of the late Ottoman Empire's modernisation drive. The Golden Horn, the waterway spanned by the popular Galata Bridge, was once home to shipyards, slaughterhouses, tobacco, flour and brick factories and the Ottoman Empire's first urban-scale electrical power plant. But as in other global cities, manufacturing has largely been relocated in recent decades to industrial parks on the urban fringes, leaving these early factories to decay.  ""Previous administrations made a big mistake by tearing many of these buildings down in the past decades; we lost that history forever,"" says Polat. Because many of the sites that remain are located outside areas traditionally visited by tourists, he hopes restoring these buildings and transforming them into things like galleries, event spaces and cafes can help create new centres of attraction for both locals and travellers alike.  The municipality's approach has not been without its critics. ""Industrial heritage is only valued in terms of protecting the structure,"" says Gülsün Tanyeli, an architecture professor at Istanbul Technical University. She argues that these revitalisation efforts don't do enough to convey to visitors how these former sites fit into the city's cultural and historical fabric. Tanyeli consulted on the municipality's restoration of Hasanpaşa Gazhane, a former gasworks in a residential neighbourhood of the Kadıköy district. In the 19th and early 20th Centuries, this facility burned coal to fuel Istanbul's street and indoor lighting; today, it's a sprawling cultural complex, Müze Gazhane, that features a climate museum, a cartoon museum, cafes, a library and exhibition spaces. But Tanyeli says she wishes visitors had been given more information about the production processes that took place there – and about the two-decade-long struggle by local activists to protect the gasworks from destruction – so they could better understand the site's greater importance.  The ongoing restoration of Istanbul's fragile 5th-Century city walls has also been criticised by urban activists who say the work has failed to sufficiently preserve garden plots along their base where food has been grown for centuries. More like this: • The most Istanbul thing to do in Istanbul • Explore the Ottoman past on Istanbul's car-free islands • Istanbul's five best hammams Overall, though, the restoration projects seem to have been eagerly embraced by Istanbul residents, which Sökmen says creates ""living places"" that give visitors the opportunity to engage with contemporary daily life in the city. At Anadolu Hisarı, the oldest Ottoman fortress in Istanbul, ramparts once patrolled by soldiers now bustle with families and couples smiling for selfies above the sparkling waters of the Bosporus. Built on the Beykoz waterfront in 1395 to help establish Ottoman military dominance over the strategically important strait, the fortress was last restored in 1953 and had been closed off for more than a decade until its reopening in May 2023. On summer nights, its illuminated towers make a dramatic backdrop for free open-air concerts organised by the municipality. ""The history of Istanbul is its biggest treasure,"" says Polat. ""By protecting this heritage and making it available for everyone to experience in their daily lives, we believe Istanbul will be loved even more."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."
Spread to US Treasury,Who should I vote for and what are the parties promising?,2024-09-25,2024-06-20,By the Visual Journalism team,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxeez8271nvo,"Polls open in the UK general election on Thursday - have you decided which party will get your vote? If not, this guide offers a summary of where the main parties stand on the issues most important to voters, based on the promises they have made during the campaign. Click on the drop-down list to select the nation, political parties and issues that interest you. A manifesto is the list of pledges parties make to voters, explaining what they would do if elected. This interactive has been put together by the BBC's Visual Journalism team, the BBC's political research unit in London and BBC journalists in Belfast, Cardiff and Glasgow. Its aim is to summarise where the parties stand on key topics to help voters make informed decisions at the ballot box. We have selected issues highlighted in polling company Ipsos Mori's Issues Index, a monthly survey that measures the things the public believe to be the most important facing the country. We analysed surveys from the twelve months before the election was called and selected the issues based on their aggregate score over that period. In some cases we have combined similar issues for simplicity. For example, ""NHS, hospitals, healthcare and social care"" are included under the one category of ""NHS and care"". ""Democracy"" was added as an issue on the editorial grounds that it help fulfil the BBC's public service commitments. In order for a party to be included in the guide it must be standing candidates in at least one sixth of seats in the nation it is campaigning in as well as meeting one of the following criteria: Parties are ordered by their vote share in the 2019 general election - and then alphabetically. You can see a full list of all parties standing at the general election here. This is an editorial process overseen by BBC journalists. All parties included in the guide have contacted by the BBC and given the opportunity to identify their key policies in each area. Because of devolution, the UK parliament cannot rule on, or has limited powers over, some of the issues highlighted in the guide. For example, ""health"" is devolved to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Parties do still campaign locally on these devolved issues in the run up to a general election. For this reason, the guide highlights issues that are devolved or partly devolved to acknowledge that these policies may not become law in that nation even if they are passed in Westminster.

Spread to US Treasury,School strikes: How and why schools will be affected ,2024-09-25,2024-05-19,By Robbie Meredith,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89z99yz2ngo,"""There's a fair bit of responsibility for a very minimum wage."" School bus driver Thomas McMichael is among thousands of non-teaching staff in the Education Authority (EA) set to strike on Monday. Education workers including bus drivers, classroom assistants and canteen staff are taking action for several days during May and June. Workers in the Unite, GMB and Nipsa trade unions are walking out as part of a long-running dispute over pay and job grading. The Education Authority (EA) said the strike action would ""cause significant disruption"" to special schools. It said about eight schools were expected to close and five to partially close, would result in about 250 EA (yellow) buses not running and would impact on about 20% of children entitled to a free school meal. Many schools across Northern Ireland will be affected, especially those who rely on EA buses to get pupils to and from school. However, some special schools will be hit the hardest and some may have to close to pupils on strike days. That is because special schools rely particularly on staff like classroom assistants to provide support to pupils and on transport provided by the EA. Jonathan Gray is the principal of Arvalee Special School in Omagh, County Tyrone. He told BBC News NI that he expected Arvalee to stay open but some pupils may have problems getting transport to school. ""We can't guarantee transport will be available for the children,"" he said. ""We're based in Omagh, we have a very wide catchment area so transport is key. ""It's also part of their routine. The drivers are an important part of our children's lives."" Mr Gray said non-teaching staff are crucial and he said resolving the pay dispute was crucial. ""Many of my classroom assistants have to work two jobs so that they can provide for their families as well as do the job they love,"" he said. ""This has to come to some sort of resolution because they are worth the money."" School support staff are among the lowest paid in the education system. Some jobs for classroom assistants are currently advertised by the EA at about £12 per hour. Jobs for school bus drivers and catering staff are available at roughly the same hourly rate. The pay and grading review would lead to improved pay scales and wages. The dispute over the pay and grading review has been running for a number of years and has led to a number of previous walkouts. But it now comes down to the 2024/25 Stormont budget. In a letter to schools about the strike the Department of Education (DE) permanent secretary Dr Mark Browne said it would ""have a significant detrimental impact on our children and young people, particularly the most vulnerable children with special educational needs"". Dr Browne said that to implement the review and award back pay from April 2022 would cost DE around £180m and then £90m a year going forward. ""When the executive met to set the budget, given numerous other competing pressures they did not have the funding required to implement these changes,"" his letter said. ""Consequently, it was agreed that the minister of finance should seek approval from the Treasury to bring forward funding set aside under the agreed funding package for future years to allow for additional funding to be accessed in 2024-25. ""The minister of finance is currently making that case and we await a decision from London."" But he added that ""taking industrial action in Northern Ireland at this time will not resolve this issue and will only cause further damage to the education of our children"". He also raised concerns that some children taking GCSEs, AS and A-Level exams could have their transport to school disrupted. Thomas McMichael is a school bus driver with the EA but is also a representative with the Unite union. ""We carry special needs kids and we carry mainstream as well,"" he told BBC News NI. ""You've got them in your care, you're driving a five-tonne bus in and out of estates and you've children behind you you're responsible for as well. ""So there's a fair bit of responsibility for a very minimum wage."" Mr McMichael said his union and others had been taking ""on and off"" strike action for about two years due to the dispute over pay and grading for non-teaching staff. The pay and grading review would mean changes to pay grades and scales for some job roles, and overall would lead to pay rises for workers currently on low pay. Mr McMichael said he, like many others, was ""struggling to get by"". Many staff like him are only paid during the school term. ""I get paid for 47 weeks out of 52 and the hourly rate is squashed down to be spread across it,"" Mr McMichael said. ""So I'm currently on £11.79 an hour which is 35p ahead of the minimum wage of £11.44. ""We're carrying the, and I don’t like using the term, the most precious cargo in the world - children - and we're paid basically the lowest.""  The EA board - which oversees the authority - recently heard that pay issues within the school catering service ""were having a negative impact on staff retention"". Mr McMichael said that he was seeing a similar problem among bus drivers. ""There's a recruitment and retention issue because we have people leaving,"" he said. ""I've spoken to drivers there recently, one of them in particular was 20-odd years in the Education Authority. ""He loved the job but he couldn't afford to stay. ""You're constantly watching what you can spend on and you're struggling to get by."" He also said that strikers were very aware of the disruption caused to children missing school, especially those with special educational needs. ""This isn't just about us looking more money, this is about trying to save the services for both parents and ourselves."" “The Education Authority said it would ""work closely with schools to try and mitigate the impact of the strike action as far as possible"" ""However, we remain very concerned about the disproportionate impact this will have on our children and young people, particularly those with special educational needs, those sitting exams and those from the most socially deprived areas."" The statement added: “We remain fully committed to delivering the pay and grading review.  ""However, we simply don't have the money to proceed at this time and a resolution is outside of our control. “Therefore, given the impact this will have on the most vulnerable pupils, we would call on colleagues to defer this action and allow the executive time to continue their engagement with the UK government about securing the additional funding necessary to implement the EA pay and grading review."""
Spread to US Treasury,'Immediate cancellations' over Omicron advice,2024-09-25,2021-12-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-59683468,"Hospitality venues in the North West say they had ""immediate cancellations"" after people were urged to ""think carefully"" about socialising due to the spread of the Omicron variant.  The prime minister gave the advice on Wednesday amid record UK Covid cases.   A hotel near Garstang said its phone was ""the hottest thing"" following the briefing, with 40 rooms cancelled. A Merseyside venue also said the advice was ""putting the burden"" on individuals to decide whether to attend gigs. The UK recorded 78,610 new Covid cases on Wednesday - the highest daily number reported since the start of the pandemic. At the Downing Street briefing, Boris Johnson said he was not shutting pubs and restaurants but advised people to ""think carefully before you go"". England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty urged the public not to ""mix with people you don't have to"" and warned more Covid records would be broken as the Omicron variant surges.   In Chorley, an entertainment venue said within five minutes of the briefing, ""worried customers"" had phoned up to axe their plans. Managing director of Escape Entertainment, Ian Kearney, told BBC Radio Lancashire the venue had lost 25% of its December bookings so far which was ""potentially catastrophic"".  ""In some cases [customers have] deferred to January which is ok but from last year's experience the appetite for a Christmas party in January has gone and you get cancellations,"" he said. Mr Kearney is calling for financial support for the industry and said he felt the government was ""tip-toeing around a lockdown"". ""We are in limbo [while also] carrying significant losses from last year,"" he said. Sean Wilkinson, from Guy's Thatched Hamlet in Bilsborrow near Garstang, said his hotel and restaurant complex lost 40 room bookings after the briefing. ""The phone was the hottest thing yesterday with people cancelling,"" he said. ""The government advice is contradictory because people have been told to work from home but to go out and meet people - this is normally a very busy time for our industry."" Live music venues across the North West are also counting the cost of the government advice. Craig Pennington, from Birkenhead-based community live music venue Future Yard, said the government's ""intangible"" advice was ""putting the burden"" on individuals to decide whether to attend gigs. ""Essentially it is leaving local businesses to bear the brunt and is leaving us in a precarious position,"" he said. ""I think we are back to when the pandemic first started and we had that ludicrous situation where the PM said pubs, clubs bars and theatres are open but you are not to go to them, it is déjà vu. ""Its almost like it has fallen off a cliff edge with 60 to 70% cancellations."" Manchester-based celebrity party planner Liz Taylor said: ""We cannot cancel Christmas again, we have to live with this."" The businesswoman, who has worked with Coronation Street staff and Manchester United, is still planning a prominent client's 80th birthday event this weekend, but the guest list has dropped from 100 to 75. She said: ""We've had no cancellations yet, but it's on a wing and a prayer. ""Anyone with half a brain gets boosted, wears a mask and gets on with it."" A Treasury spokesman said: ""As we have done throughout the pandemic, we are closely monitoring the impact of the virus on the economy.  ""Our £400bn Covid support package will continue to help businesses well into spring next year and of course we will continue to respond proportionately to the changing path of the virus.""

Spread to US Treasury,UK forecast to have slowest growth in G7 next year,2024-09-25,2022-04-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61142906,"The war in Ukraine will ""severely set back"" the global economic recovery with the UK hit harder than most, the International Monetary Fund has said.  The conflict is driving up prices for food and fuel which the international body expects to slow growth globally. It has cut its global forecast and also downgraded its outlook for the UK. This means the UK will no longer be the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of leading Western nations, and will be the slowest in 2023, it says. The body says that UK growth will slow as price pressures lead households to cut spending, while rising interest rates are expected to ""cool investment"". The UK's economy is now predicted to grow by 3.7% this year, down from the previous forecast of 4.7% made in January. However, next year, the UK is expected to have the slowest growth in the G7 and across Europe's main economies, at just 1.2%, a near halving from the 2.3% expected previously. The 2023 UK figure is the slowest apart from heavily-sanctioned Russia in the wider G20 grouping, which includes nations such as China and India. The IMF said that the UK was the fastest growing G7 economy in 2021, and is forecast to be the second fastest in 2022. The low UK growth rates forecast in 2023 are in part due to the UK rebounding more quickly from the pandemic than some of its G7 peers. However, the UK is also wrestling with high inflation, which will hit growth in 2023, as people cut spending as their real income shrinks, the IMF said. The organisation expects inflation to peak in late 2022 at 9%. It said rising interest rates will also slow the UK economy in 2023 and 2023, while government policies such as getting rid of certain tax breaks will reduce business investment at that time. In addition, Brexit will hold back export growth, the IMF said, and it will continue to make pandemic-related labour supply ""scarring"" worse by reducing immigration. ""However, the impact of Brexit is spread over several years and is not the primary driver of the slowdown in 2023,"" a spokesperson for the organisation added. The IMF works with its 189 member countries to try to stabilise the global economy, including issuing short-term loans and assistance to countries who are struggling. It said inflation was now a ""clear and present danger"" in many countries and the situation has added to supply strains from the coronavirus pandemic. ""In the matter of a few weeks, the world has yet again experienced a major, transformative shock,"" IMF director of research Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in the organisation's 2022 World Economic Outlook. ""Just as a durable recovery from the pandemic-induced global economic collapse appeared in sight, the war has created the very real prospect that a large part of the recent gains will be erased.""  The organisation said it expected global growth of just 3.6% this year, down nearly a percentage point from its forecast before the war.  The World Bank also said it was lowering its growth forecast from 4.1% to 3.2%.  The conflict has already devastated the economies of Ukraine and Russia, which the West cut off from key trade and financial networks with sanctions following the invasion. Ukraine is facing a severe contraction of 35% or more this year, while Russia's economy is expected to shrink by 8.5%, the IMF said. But with Russia a major energy producer and key supplier of staples such as wheat and corn alongside Ukraine, the consequences will ripple far beyond their borders, the IMF warned. There have been two acute shocks to the world economy in quick succession - the pandemic and the Ukraine war. The latter is building on the problems created by the former, tripping up what had been a healthy recovery, and sending prices rising at an even faster rate. Food and energy prices were already being hiked by the supply bottlenecks after the pandemic, before one of the world's biggest energy suppliers invaded one of the world's biggest food exporter. But now there are new bottlenecks emerging from the stringent Covid lockdowns in some regions of China. Rising prices risk social stability in poorer countries, dependent on food imports. Fears about inflation becoming entrenched are leading the world's central bankers to raise interest rates. In turn that is raising the cost of borrowing for the record debts many nations racked up during the pandemic. So all this requires some skill and cooperation among the old and new financial powerhouses of the world. But that has been another commodity in short supply in recent times. ""The economic effects of the war are spreading far and wide - like seismic waves that emanate from the epicenter of an earthquake,"" it said. In Germany, where the economy is especially closely entwined, the war is likely to lower growth by 1.7 percentage points, it said. Even in countries with little direct trade with Russia and Ukraine, households will feel the effects of the war, as central banks respond to the more rapid inflation by raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive, the IMF said. In the US, for example, the organisation lowered its forecast for growth in 2022 by 0.3 percentage points to 3.7%, citing the prospect of more aggressive interest rate rises.  Overall, inflation pressures are significantly worse than they were when the IMF issued its previous forecast in January. It now predicts inflation in ""advanced economies"" will hit 5.7% this year, while it is likely to reach 8.7% in emerging markets.  UK inflation is expected to be 5.3% next year - the highest in the G7, and higher than all EU members, and only exceeded in the G20 by crisis-ridden Argentina, Turkey and Russia. ""Inflation has become a clear and present danger for many countries,"" Mr Gourinchas wrote in a blog. A few countries, such as oil exporters, are benefiting. The IMF expects growth in Saudi Arabia, for example, to be stronger than it did in January. But the risks are not purely economic, the IMF added.  It said the war had also created a refugee crisis and aggravated political tensions, risking a ""more permanent fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical blocks with distinct technology standards, cross-border payment systems, and reserve currencies"".  ""Such a 'tectonic shift' would cause long-run efficiency losses, increase volatility and represent a major challenge to the rules-based framework that has governed international and economic relations for the last 75 years,"" the IMF said. A Treasury spokesperson said the IMF forecasts ""will be concerning for many people and families"" in the UK. ""However the support we provided over the past two years has put our economy in a good position to deal with these headwinds, including through record numbers of employees on payrolls and a strong economic recovery from the pandemic,"" the spokesperson said. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the IMF forecast ""shows the extreme challenges facing the UK economy"". ""While it is true that global forces play a role, the fact that the UK is forecast to have the slowest growth of any G7 economy next year plus the highest inflation, shows the uniquely bad situation the UK is in. ""Inflation spiralling out of control this year has created a cost of living crisis hitting families across the country, needing decisive and urgent action,"" she said, repeating Labour calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said the UK government had ""failed to shield the UK from spiralling energy bills and soaring inflation, but they have gone ahead with raising people's taxes to their highest point in 70 years""."
Spread to US Treasury,Is Kenya having a mid-life crisis?,2024-09-25,2013-12-11,Joseph Warungu,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-25327001,"Kenya turns 50 on Thursday - and I'm reliably informed that this an age which is truly a turning point in life. Memory, vision, hearing, movement - speed, flexibility and agility - are all faced with challenges as the years creak by. So is Kenya at 50 acting her age?  Memory: In 1998, 224 people died when al-Qaeda bombed the US embassy in Nairobi As middle age kicks in it is common for people to forget things: You misplace your keys; you forget the title of the film you watched last month.  Kenya, too, is becoming increasingly forgetful.  Before the terrible attack at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi last September, in which scores of innocent lives were lost, Kenya had faced a similar, more deadly terrorist attack which targeted the US embassy in the heart of the city.  But all the lessons of the 1998 bombing were quickly forgotten - until Westgate happened. Vision: 80% of Kenyans are under 35 years old Changes in age lead to changes in vision. As we get older, we require glasses or stronger lenses for reading or driving.  Kenya is almost legally blind. And as Kenya itself grows older, it has failed to see that its population is growing younger. Eighty percent of Kenyans are under 35 years old and each year, one million Kenyans jump out of their mothers' womb screaming their heads off, for education, food, better health and jobs. Yet, despite their large numbers, it is the young who are hardest hit by lack of jobs.  Kenya's population is growing rapidly and has more than quadrupled in the past 50 years. About 42% of the population is below 15 years of age. Child mortality rates have fallen - although Unicef says figures vary, from 54 per 1,000 live births in Central Province to 206 per 1,000 in Nyanza Province. Life expectancy in Kenya rose until the late 1980s, when the HIV/Aids virus started to spread. It is still reported to be the leading cause of death in the country. According to Unicef, about 1.3m people are currently living with HIV in Kenya, but latest figures suggest prevalence is dropping. Kenya has the largest GDP in East and Central Africa. Its main exports are tea, coffee, horticultural products and petroleum products. The World Bank says Kenya needs to adopt more modern farming methods. About 75% of the population still live in rural areas and rely on agriculture for most of their income. According to a UN Programme for Development (UNDP) report, external released earlier this year, youth unemployment rates are several times higher than among adults and particularly in cities and among females. Kenya has recently been to the optician to acquire new lenses that will focus better on its children, through new government initiatives that aim to create employment for young people.  However, Kenya's blurred vision means the country is sitting on a demographic time bomb.  Hearing: There have been angry demonstrations about MPs' salaries this year If you have ever had the experience of shouting into your grandma's ear because of her failing hearing, then you will understand the frustrations of Kenyans.  As the years catch up with Kenya, its ears are rapidly failing.   Before the elections in March, the ""wananchi"", or ordinary people, took to the streets and shouted down their members of parliament who were attempting to raid public coffers and award themselves lucrative pay hikes and astonishing retirement packages. Fearing reprisals at the ballot box, the politicians reluctantly backed down.  But with Kenya now increasingly deaf, the MPs are once more analysing their payslips and knocking on the treasury door.  They just did not hear what the wananchi told them. Movement: Disagreements between politicians can paralyse government business Age can be cruel: the knees that held you upright now begin to call for a commercial break in the middle of an exciting journey.  They do not even have the courtesy of letting you sit down quietly - they will creak, moan and sigh loudly.  The six-pack tummy of youth turns into a beautifully rounded one-pack balloon that is finding the ground more exciting to touch than staying firmly in place.  Kenya has stepped into all these challenges of age. As the knees, which guide movement and symbolise all sections of government, decide with one accord to take the country forward in a particular direction, disharmony sets in gradually and the body is thrown into rigor mortis.  The left knee, which is perhaps the senate, twists out of shape and decides to walk in the opposite direction.  The right knee, which symbolises parliament, sulks and decides to sit down.  Meanwhile, the spine, which represents the county governors, suffers a slipped disc as it contorts itself out of shape trying to reach for more money from central government. The rest of the Kenyan frame has little choice but sit still, breathless.  No-one goes anywhere. When the wananchi question this lack of agility, direction and purpose, ageing Kenya has a ready answer: ""If God wanted me to touch my toes, he'd have put them on my knees!"" Mid-life crisis: Kenya envisages a digital future So you can see Kenya has aged, but there is hope for the country at 50.  Just like the men and women who have renewed themselves with age, found new hobbies and new callings in their mature years, Kenya is trying to make the most of its mid-life crisis. It has a 2030 vision, external to propel it into middle-income status by 2030.  High-speed commuter trains - the equivalent of a flashy sports car for the man chasing his youth - will replace the chaotic and inefficient public transport system of today. A fully digitised society, complete with laptops in schools, an electronic-government, and internet-enabled rural villages will complement a new oil-driven economy. With improved eyesight, a sharper sense of hearing, greased knees and joints, as well as memory-enhancing exercises, I feel confident that Kenya, with its dyed hair, will be unrecognisable when it sits amongst the world's leading economies in the year xyz. For now in advance of the big day, let me say, ""Happy birthday Kenya!""  Even without teeth, you are still a great companion to live with at 50. Is Kenya #sickat50?

Spread to US Treasury,US-Canada border to close amid virus crisis,2024-09-25,2020-03-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51949243,"US President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have agreed to close the US-Canada border to all non-essential travel in an attempt to curb the spread of coronavirus.  ""We will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our northern border with Canada,"" Mr Trump tweeted. He said trade would not be affected. Both countries had already issued sweeping travel bans but had maintained exemptions for each other.  Canada relies on the US for approximately 75% of its exports.  The two leaders discussed the changes on Wednesday, Mr Trudeau said. ""I want to be clear though that essential travel will still continue,"" he said at a press conference.  ""No matter who you are or what you do, this is a time when you should be focused on your health and that of your neighbours. Not: are you going to lose your job, are you going to run out of money for food or medications.""  Details of the final deal have yet to be released in writing but both leaders have stressed that cross-border trade will not be blocked. Supply chains must be preserved so trucking would not be affected, Mr Trudeau said. ""That is something we remain committed to,"" he added. About $2bn in goods and services crosses the US-Canada border each day.  Canadians who needed to travel for other ""urgent reasons"" would also not be impacted, Mr Trudeau said.  There is no set timeframe for how long the border closure will last. Mr Trudeau's government had previously resisted closing the border to his country's most important trading partner.  ""Nearly 200,000 people cross that border every day, and that border and that traffic that goes across that border is literally a lifeline for both the Canadians and the Americans on both sides of that border,"" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday. ""We get our groceries thanks to truckers who drive back and forth across that border. Very urgently needed medical supplies and medicines go back and forth across that border.""  But both leaders had kept the notion of travel restrictions on the table, as both countries have struggled to halt outbreaks of Covid-19.  Earlier this week, Mr Trump warned against discretionary travel and said that ""we have very strong emergency powers when it comes to something like this, both on the southern and the northern borders"".  During a White House press conference on Wednesday, Mr Trump said his administration would launch a new crackdown on migrants or asylum seekers crossing the US-Mexico border illegally in an effort to stem the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Trump said he would invoke a statute allowing America's top public health official, the surgeon general, to block people or goods from certain countries or places to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. The president said the move could happen as soon as Wednesday, but that his administration did not plan to fully close the border with Mexico. ""We're not going to close it, but we are invoking a certain provision that will allow us great latitude as to what we do,"" he said. The Mexican foreign ministry did not immediately comment. Mr Trump has made illegal immigration over the southern border his signature issue in the White House, though deportations under his administration remain lower than during the Obama era. The novel coronavirus has maintained a steady march throughout both countries. The US has nearly 8,000 cases of Covid-19 across all 50 states and has seen 138 deaths so far. Canada - which has about a ninth of the population of the US - has 598 confirmed cases, with eight deaths.  President Trump has announced a stimulus proposal that could include sending a $1,000 (£844) cheque to every American. The president also said that all property foreclosures and tenant evictions were being suspended until the end of April.  He said that his treasury chief's estimate that 20% of people could become unemployed due to the pandemic was only ""an absolute, total worst-case scenario"". On Wednesday, Mr Trudeau announced a C$82bn (US$56.4bn) aid package, including $27bn in direct support to workers and businesses.  ""Our government will introduce the emergency care benefit, which will provide money every two weeks to workers who have to stay home,"" he said. This is designed for Canadians without paid sick leave who do not qualify for employment insurance.  Mr Trudeau has so far stopped short of invoking Canada's Emergency Measures Act, but said ""all options are on the table"".  Mr Trudeau's wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, tested positive for the virus last week. The prime minister has self-isolated in Ottawa, but aides say he has displayed no symptoms.  British actor Idris Elba has also tested positive for the coronavirus after he was photographed hugging Canada's first lady earlier this month at a charity event in London."
Spread to US Treasury,Arrests as Extinction Rebellion protests go global,2024-09-25,2019-10-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-49959227,"Hundreds of Extinction Rebellion activists have been arrested as protests take place across the globe. Thirty people were charged with committing offences in Sydney after hundreds blocked a road, while more than 100 were arrested in Amsterdam. Protests have taken place in countries including the US, UK, Germany, Spain, Austria, France and New Zealand. Protests by climate change activists are expected in some 60 cities over the next two weeks.  The group is also causing disruption in London, where more than 270 people were arrested on Monday.  Extinction Rebellion wants governments to take immediate and drastic action to address climate change. ""We have tried petitions, lobbying and marches, and now time is running out,"" Australian activist Jane Morton told the AFP news agency. ""We have no choice but to rebel until our government declares a climate and ecological emergency and takes the action that is required to save us."" Australia's government has been criticised for its lack of action in tackling climate change but it insists that it is doing its part to reduce global carbon emissions.  The country's Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said last week that names and photos of Extinction Rebellion protesters should be widely distributed to ""shame"" them.  In London, organisers have vowed to shut down key sites in the city including the Houses of Parliament and Trafalgar Square. Similar protests in the UK earlier this year brought major disruption to London and resulted in more than 1,100 arrests. Protests are expected to spread across dozens of cities, including Delhi and New York, in the days and weeks ahead as activists call for urgent environmental action. Extinction Rebellion (XR for short) wants governments to declare a ""climate and ecological emergency"" and take immediate action to address climate change. It describes itself as an international ""non-violent civil disobedience activist movement"".

Spread to US Treasury,'Godfather of Sudoku' Maki Kaji dies aged 69,2024-09-25,2021-08-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58243126,"Maki Kaji, the Japanese man known as the ""Godfather of Sudoku"", has died at the age of 69. Kaji gave the number puzzle its name after publishing it in his magazine Nikoli in the 1980s. Since then the popular game - involving placing the numbers 1 to 9 in each row, column and square of a 9 by 9 grid - has spread around the globe. Tournaments take place across the world and it is estimated that millions play versions of the game each day. On Monday Nikoli published a statement on its website saying Kaji had died at his home in Tokyo from bile duct cancer on 10 August 2021.  Kaji was born in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo in 1951.  After dropping out of Keio University, he set up the puzzle magazine Nikoli, which published its first edition in August 1980.  The origins of Sudoku are unclear. Some credit the 18th Century Swiss mathematician Euler as its creator, while others say it came to the Arab world from China via India in the 8th or 9th Century, according to the New York Times.  French newspapers published a number of early versions of the game in the late 19th Century, including one called ""le carré magique diabolique"", or the evil magic square, published by La France newspaper in July 1895. But US architect Howard Garns is often credited as the creator of the modern version of the puzzle in the 1970s, under the name Number Place. It was this game that Kaji spotted in 1984. ""It was a very interesting puzzle, fun to solve,"" he said in a 2008 speech.  ""But the name, Number Place, did not hit me. I wanted to create a Japanese name."" Kaji landed on Suuji wa dokushin ni kagiru, meaning ""Numbers should be single"".  Pushed by colleagues to come up with a catchier name as he rushed to get to a horse race, he said he came up with the name Sudoku ""in about 25 seconds"". The game became popular in Japan but only turned into a global phenomenon in 2004, after The Times of London published a puzzle. Kaji did not trademark the game, and did not gain financially from its huge success. But he said the joy of the puzzle and of others enjoying the game was more important than any monetary reward.  ""I get really moved when I see a new idea for a puzzle which has lots of potential,"" he told the BBC in 2007.  ""I get really excited about it. It is like finding treasure."""
Spread to US Treasury,New rules for Wales' pubs and bars before Christmas,2024-09-25,2020-11-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-55102867,"Pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter Covid-19 restrictions in the run up to Christmas, the first minister has said. The new restrictions, which have not yet been finalised, will come into force from Friday, 4 December. They may be based on the system in some parts of Scotland where no alcohol can be served. Cinemas, bowling alleys and indoor entertainment venues will also have to shut before the festive break. A date for these to close has not yet been agreed. Mark Drakeford said action was needed as case rates continued to rise in the run up to Christmas. But the Welsh Conservatives said any new restrictions would be a ""real blow"" for businesses who had already ""suffered greatly"", while Plaid Cymru said the lack of detail was leaving employers unable to prepare. Pubs, bars and restaurants had only reopened on 9 November after the Wales-wide 17-day lockdown, and are currently made to close at 22:00 GMT. Ahead of the announcement people working in the hospitality industry had warned any further restrictions before Christmas would be a ""big blow"". Plans for the new rules have not yet been finalised, but BBC Wales understands one option being considered is the ""level three"" Scottish system, where venues are banned from selling alcohol and have to close at 18:00. The R rate - the number of people each infected person passed the virus on to - has risen again to 1.4 in Wales, with the rate needing to be below one for the number of cases to fall. In England about 55 million people are being placed under the tightest level of lockdown rules from 2 December, when an England-wide lockdown ends and a new tiered system is introduced. Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said Wales had to use the ""coming weeks"" to reduce the spread of the virus, to ""create more headroom for the Christmas period"". Mr Drakeford said while case rates had fallen following the 17-day firebreak, as people had resumed socialising it they had risen ""faster and further than we anticipated"", and action was needed. ""This does not mean a return to the firebreak arrangements, but the cabinet has agreed to take further specific and targeted action to reinforce the current national measures we have place,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said he could ""not rule anything out for the future"" in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. Non-essential retail, hairdressers, gyms and leisure centres will stay open, it was confirmed. Speaking of the new measures for pubs, bars and restaurants, Mr Drakeford added: ""I know this will be a worrying time for all working in the industry. ""We will be working over the weekend with partners to finalise the details of the new arrangements and to put in place a further major package of financial support to respond to those changes. ""I will give further details about the package on Monday."" Claire Vaughan, programme manager at Chapter cinema in Cardiff, said: ""Globally no cases of coronavirus have been traced back to a visit to the cinema.  ""Cinemas are a low-risk way of spending time outside the house at a time when the mental health of people in Wales is a huge concern. ""Masks are worn, there are air circulation units and no one is facing another person... Not everyone is living in a warm, safe home - many people need these spaces to be open."" Liam Evans-Ford, Theatr Clwyd's executive director, added the announcement had been a ""huge surprise"". ""This is devastating for our business, for our employees, for our freelancers and for our communities,"" he said. Sian Shepphard, owner of the Horse and Jockey in Pontypool, opened the pub in August so has not been eligible for government support. ""The main problem is we are trying to get people to stay at home but it is ruining our businesses,"" she said. ""I employ over 25 staff here - we are a really family-run business. We are all family - how am I supposed to put food on the table for them?"" Phil James, a customer at the pub, said the potential changes would affect his Christmas plans. ""We just don't know what arrangement to make at the end of the day - people have to know. You come out to socialise - people want to be social for Christmas, alcohol is a part of it."" Simon Buckley, chairman of The Brewers of Wales, said: ""Is this finally the straw that will break the industry's back? ""We as an industry are being thrown to the wind, and the looming prospect of significant job losses seems to count for nothing."" Plaid's economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said: ""They [pubs and restaurants] don't know if they're being asked to close altogether again, to only do takeaways, to have restricted opening without alcohol.  ""So, they can't really prepare. They need to be given the maximum length of time to prepare."" Clwyd West member of the Senedd Darren Millar called for a targeted rather than a Wales-wide blanket approach. ""It is grossly unfair to impose the same level of restrictions in Conwy and Denbighshire as Covid-19 hotspots in south Wales,"" he said. ""The virus is circulating at different rates in different parts of the country."" Mr Drakeford insisted there were no plans to introduce regionalised ""tiered"" restrictions, similar to those coming into force in England. He said there was no case for aligning the Welsh and English systems to ensure no-one was left out of UK-wide Treasury schemes that offer financial assistance to businesses affected by lockdown measures. ""We don't lose out on any UK system by having a single tier for Wales, so there is no disadvantage to us in that,"" he said. He added: ""The advice we have is that a single set of arrangements for Wales works best, is easiest to communicate and delivers benefits in all parts of Wales."" Pembrokeshire councillor John Davies welcomed the restrictions after a spike in cases in his ward, Cilgerran, linked to the recent outbreak in nearby Cardigan. He told Newyddion 9: ""If people aren't willing to exercise common sense and be citizens of responsibility towards each other, there is no other option. ""We've seen what happens in this part of the world when people act in a selfish manner."" Mr Drakeford said he had no plans to allow schools to close early for Christmas. Teaching union UCAC had called for classrooms to be shut on 11 December and for lessons to be moved online amid fears teachers and pupils may have to isolate on Christmas Day. But Mr Drakeford said ministers would do ""everything we can"" to keep schools working up until the Christmas holiday. He added: ""It is more important for our children not to miss out further on the education that is planned for them for the whole of the rest of this term and that's what we will be working to achieve."""
Spread to US Treasury,$600 benefit to millions of US unemployed expires,2024-09-25,2020-08-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53619910,"A $600 (£459) jobless benefit paid weekly to tens of millions of unemployed Americans expired overnight after Republicans and Democrats failed to reach a deal on its extension.  Friday was the deadline for an agreement on the coronavirus relief, which tops up state benefits that are mostly far below $600. Republicans want a smaller relief plan than one passed by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. Talks have resumed in Washington. Unemployment has soared during the coronavirus pandemic, with 30 million Americans currently collecting jobless benefits. The US economy shrank by 9.5% in the second quarter of 2020, compared with the preceding three months.  This is equivalent to an annual rate of 32.9% - the country's steepest contraction for decades. The $600 payments are part of a $2.2tn congressional package adopted in March as the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses to shut down.  But Congress did not anticipate the current resurgence of the virus, deepening the impact on the economy.  Two top Democrats - US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer - are meeting two top Trump aides - Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Ms Pelosi made it clear that she was still opposed to any short-term deal on the $600 relief payments. The Covid-19 pandemic has killed at least 152,384 people in the US - the highest death toll in the world. On Friday Ms Pelosi rejected a Republican proposal to extend the benefits for just a week, pending a full agreement. Republican Mark Meadows said the Democrats had rejected reasonable offers, and ""what we're seeing is politics as usual from Democrats"". Many of the unemployed have already received their final $600 top-up. Danielle Grant, a single parent in San Francisco, told CBS that without the $600 relief she would struggle to pay her monthly mortgage and other bills. ""I'm already financially strapped. It's an impossible situation,"" she said.  Her public relations firm for the arts lost business when museums and other venues were forced to close in the pandemic. Ms Pelosi said Republican leaders ""and perhaps the White House do not understand the gravity of the situation"". She said she rejected the one-week extension proposed by President Donald Trump's team because such a move would occur ""if you are on a path"" toward a deal, and ""we're not"". Democrats also rejected a later White House proposal to cut the $600 weekly payment to $400 for the next four months. Democrats want to maintain the $600 weekly top-up benefit into next year, and are pushing for a new federal stimulus package to help states through the crisis. President Trump turned to Twitter to attack both Ms Pelosi and the top Democrat in the Senate Chuck Schumer for the impasse. "
Spread to US Treasury,Scotland to enter five-level Covid alert system,2024-09-25,2020-10-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-54661494,"Scotland is to enter a new five-level system of coronavirus restrictions, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed. The new model will come into force from 2 November, when temporary curbs on the hospitality trade are due to expire. It features five tiers of measures - from ""level zero"" to four - to be applied in different areas of Scotland depending on the spread of the virus. The top level would be close to a full lockdown, but the aim is for schools to remain open at all levels. Restrictions under levels two and three are similar to those which are currently in place for different parts of Scotland. The first minister said the new strategy was about ""striking the best balances we can"" between suppressing the virus and minimising wider harms to businesses and individuals. The move in Scotland comes as tougher restrictions are brought into force for millions of people in England and Wales. Coronavirus cases in Scotland continue to rise, with 1,401 registered on Friday alongside a further 18 deaths. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest the virus is spreading across the UK, with 1 in every 180 people in Scotland thought to have been infected in the two weeks to 16 October. Ms Sturgeon said the ban on home visits and the short-term restrictions currently imposed on bars and restaurants in the central belt of the country in particular were beginning to slow the increase in cases. However, she said restrictions would still be needed until a vaccine for the virus was developed, adding: ""Everything we do must be consistent with suppressing Covid as far as we can."" The first minister said there would be talks with opposition parties and representatives of businesses - particularly from the hospitality trade - about the exact details of the different levels. Decisions on which tier each part of Scotland will be placed in will be made alongside local health protection teams in the coming week. Ms Sturgeon has previously said decisions about where levels would be set for each region of Scotland would be taken on a ""collaborative"" basis, but said she would ultimately bear accountability for them. The system will come into force from 2 November, following a vote by MSPs, and the application of different levels in different areas will be reviewed on a weekly basis. The first minister said: ""It's possible the whole country at some point could be placed in the same level. But it means we don't have to take a one size fits all approach if that's not warranted. ""A part of the country with low rates of infection won't have to live with the same levels of restrictions as a part of the country with high rates."" Ms Sturgeon said that while case numbers were still rising across Scotland, there were ""some signs of progress"" in the data. The average number of new cases per day in Scotland has increased by 7% over the past seven days, compared with the previous week. This is down from a 29% increase on average the previous week, and a 52% jump the week before that. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Cases are still rising, which is why we cannot be complacent. But the rate of the increase does seem to be slowing down, which gives us grounds for some cautious optimism."" A system of grants for businesses hit by closures or restricted trading has also been announced, with payments on a par with those offered in England. Ms Sturgeon said firms in Scotland ""deserve nothing less"", but said she wanted greater guarantees of funding from the Treasury ""as quickly as possible"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Scotland had ""got a fair share"" of UK-wide funding, saying the Scottish government should ""get that funding out to businesses now"". Meanwhile, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said it was ""vital there is clarity over what restrictions people are living under and for how long"". The strategic framework comes alongside an expanded testing strategy, which includes a commitment to expand Scotland's testing capacity to 65,000 tests per day by the end of the year. This will include boosting the number of tests that can be processed at the UK government's Lighthouse laboratory in Glasgow, as well as NHS facilities and some smaller commercial ones. New NHS regional hubs are under construction in Grampian, Lothian and Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and are expected to take on all of the daily routine testing done in care homes around Scotland.

Spread to US Treasury,Sunak to extend furlough scheme to end of March,2024-09-25,2020-11-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54824120,"The furlough scheme will be extended across the UK until the end of March, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed. Mr Sunak said the scheme will pay up to 80% of a person's wage up to £2,500 a month. He told the Commons that the government will review the policy in January.  The chancellor said his intention was ""to give businesses security through the winter"". ""The security we are providing will protect millions of jobs,"" he added. The furlough scheme, or Job Retention Scheme, subsidises the wages of people who cannot do their jobs, either because their workplace is closed or because there is no longer enough work for them. Mr Sunak said it would apply throughout the UK, saying the country had ""a Treasury for the whole of the United Kingdom"". As part of the revised scheme, anyone made redundant after 23 September can be rehired and put back on furlough.  The Job Support Scheme - a less generous form of support that had originally been set to replace the furlough scheme in November - has now been postponed. Mr Sunak also announced billions of pounds of other support for the economy, including more money for self-employed people. Support through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) will be increased, with the third grant covering November to January calculated at 80% of average trading profits, up to a maximum of £7,500. At the same time, the chancellor raised guaranteed funding for the UK's devolved administrations by £2bn to £16bn. But, many people will remain ineligible for help, including the newly self-employed, those whose pay themselves in dividends, freelancers, and sole traders who previously had a trading profit of more than £50,000. Chef Louise Solomon, 49, is going back on furlough from midnight and says she feels ""a huge sense of relief"". She says without the support, she and her wife, a key worker, would only have lasted a few months before things got tight.  ""I have card loans, and companies want to be paid regardless. I'd probably have to sell my car and look at what else I could get rid of."" Instead, the furlough extension has given her some breathing space. ""It gives you that security - you can sleep at night, knowing money is coming in."" Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds accused Mr Sunak of ignoring objections to the government's measures ""until the last possible moment"". She pointed out that he had previously ""ridiculed"" a furlough extension as ""a blunt instrument"". But Mr Sunak defended his rapid change of policy, saying: ""It is not a weakness to be fast-moving in a crisis, but rather a strength."" Alison Thewliss, the Scottish National Party's Treasury spokesperson at Westminster, described the ""long-overdue Tory U-turn"" as ""welcome"", but said it came after six months of sustained pressure from the SNP and devolved governments. Northern Ireland Finance Minister Conor Murphy welcomed the new support, but said it was ""regrettable"" that repeated calls to extend the furlough scheme ""had not been answered sooner"". This is a change of heart from ministers - and a really significant one. The chancellor and the prime minister did not want to be here.   The furlough scheme was due to end at the start of November. At the weekend, we found out it would last until 2 December. Now it's staying until the end of March. The government will argue it is necessary because of a changing health picture. They are clearly worried about the economic outlook.  But political opponents have been calling for this for some time and they believe the chancellor has waited too long.  The Treasury has said anyone who was made redundant after 23 September - when the furlough replacement was announced - can be brought back on to the scheme. But the government will face accusations it should have done this sooner. The latest announcement follows several days of wrangling over the scope and duration of the furlough scheme. It was due to end on 31 October, but was then extended to cover the new four-week lockdown in England. That announcement at the weekend sparked a row with Scotland and Wales, which argued that it was unfair for the full support package to be available only when England is in lockdown. They said the scheme should be on offer if they went into their own full national lockdowns later on. The Treasury has not put a cost on extending the furlough initiative until March, as it will depend on the take-up of the scheme, However, it suggests a rule of thumb of £1bn a month, per million who use it. So three million furloughed workers would cost £3bn a month. The furlough scheme has cost more than £50bn so far. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the support did not go far enough, particularly for the self-employed, and suggested it had been ""dreamt up on the hoof"". However, Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said extending the furlough scheme and the self-employment grant to the end of March provided ""important support to the UK economy at a time of heightened uncertainty"".  Heathrow airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said: ""Whilst we welcome the extension of the furlough scheme, we are clear that it doesn't go far enough for an aviation sector that has been on its knees since March."" He said the sector was being ignored by the government, adding: ""The hundreds of thousands of families across the UK that rely on jobs in aviation to pay the bills have no other choice than to feel very alone.""   Mr Sunak's statement comes after the Bank of England said it was pumping an extra £150bn into the economy. The Bank warned the resurgence of Covid-19 would lead to a slower, bumpier recovery. Just as the last furlough scheme extended long beyond the date that some businesses were allowed to reopen, so we should not infer that furlough till March means lockdown in England till March.  The current measures for England will be lifted on 2 December, but are likely to be replaced by a form of the regional tier system in place until now.  One of the interesting things to watch in the coming weeks will be the effect of lockdown measures on the infection rates.  The hard-hit hospitality industry, in particular, has argued vehemently that the evidence that pubs, bars and restaurants are a major spreader of infection is very thin.  Does shutting hospitality make a huge difference to the spread of infection? The industry says we are about to find out.  The furlough scheme was introduced in March and was originally intended to end in May, but Mr Sunak said at the outset that it would be extended ""if necessary"". About 9.6 million people have benefited at one time or another, with a steep take-up in the first few months. However, some have questioned whether all the money has been wisely spent. HM Revenue and Customs, which administers the furlough scheme, has suggested that up to 10% of the money delivered by the scheme to mid-August - some £3.5bn - may have been paid out in fraud or error. It is also unclear whether it has genuinely safeguarded viable jobs or merely delayed the inevitable disappearance of unviable ones. What is your experience of the furlough scheme?

Spread to US Treasury,Twitter says 130 accounts targeted in major hack,2024-09-25,2020-07-17,By Joe Tidy & David Molloy,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53445090,"Twitter says 130 accounts were targeted in a major cyber-attack of celebrity accounts two days ago. However, Twitter says only a ""small subset"" of those 130 accounts had control seized by the attacker. The security breach saw accounts including those of Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Kanye West and Bill Gates tweet a Bitcoin scam to millions of followers. Twitter said it was still trying to work out if private data - which could include direct messages - was stolen. ""We're working with impacted account-owners and will continue to do so over the next several days,"" the company said, through its official support account. ""We are continuing to assess whether non-public data related to these accounts was compromised,"" it added. The FBI is now investigating. On 15 July, a number of Bitcoin-related accounts began tweeting what appeared to be a simple Bitcoin scam, promising to ""give back"" to the community by doubling any Bitcoin sent to their address. Then, the apparent scam spread to mainstream celebrity accounts such as Kim Kardashian West and former vice-president Joe Biden, and those of corporations Apple and Uber. Twitter scrambled to contain the unprecedented attack, temporarily preventing all verified users - those with a blue tick on their accounts - from tweeting. Attackers were able to bypass account security because they had somehow gained access to Twitter's own internal administration tools. However, US President Donald Trump, one of the most prominent Twitter users, was unaffected.  There has been speculation for some time that President Trump has extra protections in place after his account was deactivated by an employee on their last day of work in 2017. The New York Times confirmed that was how Mr Trump's account escaped the attack, citing an anonymous White House official and a separate Twitter employee. Despite the fact that the scam was obvious to some, the attackers received hundreds of transfers, worth more than $100,000 (£80,000). Bitcoin is extremely hard to trace and the three separate crypto-currency wallets that the cyber-criminals used have already been emptied.  The digital money is likely to be split into smaller amounts and run through so-called ""mixer"" or ""tumbler"" services to make it even harder to trace back to the attackers. Clues about those responsible are surfacing through bragging on social media - including on Twitter itself. Earlier this week, researchers at cyber-crime intelligence firm Hudson Rock spotted an advert on a hacker forum claiming to be able to steal any Twitter account by changing the email address to which it is linked. The seller also posted a screenshot of the panel usually reserved for high-level Twitter employees. It appeared to allow full control of adding an email to an account or ""detaching"" existing ones.  This means that the attackers had access to the back end of Twitter at least 36-48 hours before the Bitcoin scams began appearing on Wednesday evening. The researchers have also linked at least one Twitter account to the hack, which has now been suspended. The concern is that this hack might not be over if the attackers copied - and still possess the private Direct Messages of the accounts over which they took control.  ""Bitcoin scam is a misguided way to frame this incident,"" Roi Carthy, CEO of Hudson Rock said.  ""If anything, the 'scam' part supports the conclusion that the group behind the attack was, to Twitter's luck, unsophisticated. The incident can either be characterised as an account take-over campaign for sale on the Darkweb, or a data breach to get a hold of Direct Messages for malicious purposes."" Twitter says it is still looking into ""what other malicious activity they may have conducted or information they may have accessed"". The private messages of Kanye West, Kim Kardashian West and Elon Musk could be worth money on dark web forums. Selling the private messages of presidential hopeful Joe Biden or former mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg could also have political consequences.  However, the BBC has spoken to one hacker who specialises in social media account takeovers and has been part of a hacking group with one account suspected of involvement.  ""Honestly, I think the hack is over because I feel this may have been a quick money grab and run situation,"" he said. ""If they do have the DMs, they will be extremely careful with who they sell them to, if they do, because it increases their chances of being caught by quite a bit."""
Spread to US Treasury,PM back at Downing Street to lead virus response,2024-09-25,2020-04-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52436471,"Boris Johnson has returned to Downing Street to take charge of the UK's response to the coronavirus outbreak. The prime minister will chair the regular morning cabinet meeting on Covid-19 before holding talks with senior ministers and officials. He arrived back at No 10 on Sunday evening amid mounting pressure from Tory MPs to begin lifting the lockdown. But Health Minister Edward Argar said ""now is not the time to ease up"" even if people were feeling frustrated. The latest official figures bring the total number of deaths in UK hospitals to 20,732, after a further 413 were announced on Sunday. It is a month since Mr Johnson was diagnosed with the virus. He spent a week in St Thomas' Hospital in central London, including three nights in intensive care, after being admitted on 5 April. Mr Johnson has not been doing any official government work during his convalescence at his country residence, Chequers, although last week he did speak to the Queen and US President Donald Trump, as well as meeting senior ministers. He will now resume full-time duties, although it is unclear at this stage whether he will lead Monday's press briefing. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said he thought it would be ""extraordinary"" if Boris Johnson's own coronavirus experience had not shaped his views on ""how lethal"" the virus is. The public debate around easing the lockdown could ""begin in the next few days"", he added, but we are ""still some way off getting any easing of the lockdown"". Strict limits on daily life - such as requiring people to stay at home, shutting many businesses and preventing gatherings of more than two people - were introduced on 23 March, as the government tried to limit the spread of the virus. Ministers are required by law to assess whether the rules are working, based on expert advice, every three weeks. The next review is due by next Thursday 7 May. Our correspondent Norman Smith added Mr Johnson will need to ""convince people ahead of then"" that the government's approach is the right way to go. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Argar said he could ""understand the frustration people are having with these measures"". He said there had been much press ""speculation"" about when the lockdown might end, but: ""The reality is we're not there yet.  ""We're not in a place where the science says it is safe to ease the restrictions. We need to keep these in place to keep that infection under control, and not to lose the gains we've all made."" There are a huge range of decisions facing Boris Johnson after a race in government in the last month or so to keep up with the demands of this crisis.  The biggest collection of decisions though is how and when to start the move out of the lockdown that Boris Johnson brought in from a desk in Downing Street on 23 March. In cabinet of course, there are different tones, different emphases. The Treasury, for example, is focused on the profound economic harm, eager to know the timetable of when restrictions might start to ease off.  They all of course want to minimise the loss of life but, as you'd expect, the Department of Health is particularly concerned about how the NHS is coping. And, of course, if there were to be a second wave, what would happen in that kind of circumstance? It is clear the prime minister himself sees the prevention of a second deadly spike, which could be worse than the first, to be the absolute top of the list.  But I don't think this is a question of either you prioritise people's health or you prioritise the nation's wealth.  It is an almost impossible balancing act.  And partly for that reason, I don't think there will be any big moves of substance this week. Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee, said there was a limit to how long people would tolerate restrictions. He said: ""If there is a question over whether something is necessary or not, I think we should err on the side of openness and trying to make sure that more people can get on with their lives and more people can get on with getting back to their jobs."" Frances O'Grady, head of the umbrella group for unions the Trades Union Congress (TUC), said when people do return to work, social distancing should continue, along with risk assessments in every workplace, staggered shifts and safe transport.  Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has been standing in for the PM, said on Sunday that social distancing would remain for ""some time"" in the UK. Rather than a complete lifting of all measures, he said the country would end up ""moving to a new normal"". He suggested social distancing measures already being seen in food shops and other businesses that have remained operating could also be expanded to non-essential businesses if they were to reopen. Labour's Rachel Reeves said the UK should ""potentially"" be following the example of countries like Belgium, Germany and Denmark which have already signalled partial re-opening of some businesses and schools. ""We want to work with the government in bringing forward a plan and getting it right,"" she said. Scientists advising the government have warned any relaxation risks a renewed flare-up just as the numbers of patients in hospital with the disease is beginning to fall. NHS England medical director Professor Stephen Powis told the daily No 10 briefing: ""My fear is that those curves won't continue to be on a downward trend, but will start to go on an upward trend.  ""We are not at a point where any of us can be absolutely confident that that's not going to be the case."" A further 413 coronavirus deaths in UK hospitals were announced on Sunday - the lowest number that has been reported in April. However, experts have previously warned against over-interpreting daily statistics, as they often reflect reporting delays, particularly over weekends - so do not relate directly to the number of deaths that occurred on a certain day. Meanwhile, Mr Raab insisted the government remained ""on track"" to hit its target of carrying out 100,000 tests for coronavirus per day by Thursday. There were 29,058 tests carried out on Saturday, far short of the government's target - which it aimed to achieve by the end of April. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the capacity for testing had risen to more than 50,000 a day, adding that ""significant numbers"" of people in care homes were obtaining tests. Since Friday, millions of key workers and people they live with have been able to book appointments online to be tested. However, the British Medical Association said testing for healthcare staff should not be on a ""first come, first served"" basis after slots ran out for the third day in a row. Appointments to visit a test site in England ran out about seven hours after the website opened on Sunday, much later than in the previous two days. Spaces remained available in Scotland throughout the day. Key workers in Wales and Northern Ireland cannot currently book tests online. Those too ill to travel should also be able to order home kits - although numbers are limited. On Sunday morning home kits were no longer available within 15 minutes of the site reopening at 08:00 BST."
Spread to US Treasury,The Marvellous Neil Baldwin's secrets of staying positive,2024-09-25,2022-03-10,By Ian Youngs,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-60624134,"Neil Baldwin was taken to the nation's hearts thanks to the Bafta-winning BBC film Marvellous, in which he was played by Toby Jones. He has now helped create a theatre version. People who get their life stories turned into films and plays are usually celebrities or politicians or those who have done something particularly heroic or remarkable. On the face of it, Neil Baldwin is an unlikely subject. He's a former clown and Stoke City kit man who wasn't well-known - at least beyond his Staffordshire home town - and hasn't been at the centre of any daring or dramatic historical events. But viewers who watched the heartwarming Marvellous in 2014 came to realise he is remarkable and heroic in his own way. They saw his uncanny ability to spread positivity and endear himself to everybody he meets, from students to archbishops to footballers. They also saw how he always manages to get what he wants and keep going in the face of adversity, his learning difficulties anything but an obstacle. ""When I saw it, I thought, that's a good film,"" he says now. ""The best film ever made. And I still think it is."" Marvellous won three Baftas in 2015 including best single drama, and was also showered with prizes from the Royal Television Society, Broadcasting Press Guild and Monte Carlo TV Festival. Since then, Baldwin has received other honours including the freedom of Stoke-on-Trent and the British Empire Medal for services to the community in Newcastle-under-Lyme. He now wears that medal everywhere, and has it pinned to the lapel of his jacket when he comes to Newcastle-under-Lyme's New Vic theatre to discuss the stage adaptation. He has created the show with the venue's artistic director Theresa Heskins, and it is finally reaching the stage after lengthy pandemic-enforced delays. ""Three times it was postponed because of the pandemic,"" says Heskins, who has joined Baldwin in the theatre's lounge during a break from rehearsals. She says to him: ""Every time I phoned you, I thought, how am I going to tell Neil? ""He made me feel better every single time. I'd phone him up feeling dreadful about it, and then I'd put the phone down feeling so much better - which is Neil's special power."" The play will have its official opening night on Baldwin's 76th birthday, on Tuesday. Former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams recently conducted a special service in Baldwin's honour to mark his 62 years on campus at Keele University, where his mother worked as a cleaner and where the young Baldwin made himself a popular presence and unofficial mascot. A far back as 1968, he was granted honorary life membership of the students' union, and he received an honorary degree in 2013. His love of making people laugh led him to join the circus as Nello the clown in 1980. His other passions include Stoke City FC, and when he introduced himself to new manager Lou Macari in 1991, Macari decided Baldwin would be a force for good in the dressing room. He made Baldwin the kit man and described him as ""my best-ever signing"". ""His real value was in helping the players relax before games,"" Macari wrote in his autobiography. ""No chemist ever produced a drug that could reduce stress levels like Nello. I was convinced that this gave us an edge in matches. Nello bonded the group."" Baldwin has even run his own football club, named Neil Baldwin FC, at Keele University since 1967, asking the likes of Kevin Keegan and Gary Lineker to serve stints as its president. They agreed, of course. Baldwin published his autobiography in 2015 and when they started work on the play, he and Heskins went through his life story with a set of actors. ""We'd say to Neil, 'There's this bit in the autobiography, could you tell us a little bit more about that?"" Heskins explains. ""He'd tell us, then we'd try to re-stage that. While the actors were improvising, Neil would say, 'I think I did that and I said that.' And then we'd do those things."" She adds, addressing Baldwin: ""Always, whenever we wanted to get a bit serious, you'd be the person that would always be telling us, 'Wouldn't it be funny if she had itching powder in her skirt now?'"" The world could do with more of Neil Baldwin's spirit-lifting powers. So what is his secret of staying upbeat? ""I just stay positive,"" he replies simply, before recalling a conversation with a young friend whose mother had recently died. ""He rung me up on Christmas Day and said, 'Why do you keep on being happy?' I said, 'Life is very short sometimes and you've got to keep happy.'"" Heskins has tried to dig deeper. ""Remember that time I trapped you in the auditorium for two hours?"" she says to him. ""I wouldn't let you out until you answered exactly that question. What is your recipe for happiness? ""You kept saying to me, 'Just be happy.' And I kept saying, 'What if some people can't? Offer me some concrete ideas.' ""You said, 'Get a pet. Sing. Have friends.' You said to me, 'I know I live on my own, but I've got that many friends.' And you said, 'That's one of the keys to being happy, having people.' ""You have all those friends and you are lovely to them. You make people feel good about themselves by being so kind to them, and that makes people happy. That feels like your amazing recipe for happiness. And also laughing."" ""Oh yeah,"" Baldwin says. ""I always do try to keep laughing. Sometimes people do get upset. But you've always got life to live."" Baldwin's trademark positivity was justified when it came to making Marvellous. ""Before the film ever came out, I said, 'We're going to London to the Baftas.' [Writer] Peter Bowker says, 'Don't be a fool.' I said, 'You'll be the fool if we win.' And we won."" That film opened doors for Baldwin to make even more friends in high places. A devout royalist, he recounts a visit to Buckingham Palace, one of his proudest days. ""William and Kate were there and William said to me, 'You've won a Bafta haven't you? What a film that was.' ""And I said to Kate, 'What lovely children you've got.' She said, 'Thank you, sir.' I turned around and said, 'I'm not a sir till you make me one!'"" Marvellous made Baldwin something approaching a national treasure, and there's still room for more gongs on his lapel. Marvellous runs at the New Vic theatre in Newcastle-under-Lyme from 11 March to 9 April."
Spread to US Treasury,Furlough cash promise and 'lockdown dilemma',2024-09-25,2020-11-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-54790844,No content available
Spread to US Treasury,Lessons learned from failed 'tech bank' SVB,2024-09-25,2023-03-13,By Zoe Kleinman,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64939556,"Uncertainty, panic and urgency are three words I heard rather a lot on Monday morning. I have been talking to some of the UK-based tech firms which had accounts with Silicon Valley Bank, the bank that failed rather dramatically towards the end of last week.  The UK arm of it, with just over 3,000 business customers, has now been rescued by HSBC but as I write, the online banking facility remains frozen. SVB was primarily used by the tech sector, and I know there have been mutterings about how much sympathy UK taxpayers should have for the ""tech bros"" in the event of Treasury intervention. The people I have been chatting to do not fit that description.  I asked one worker whether she expected to get paid this month as her firm had only banked with SVB. It was still unclear how much operational cash - money needed by businesses to pay bills and salaries - remained in limbo. ""I hope so,"" she said. The one thing everyone I have spoken to had in common was that not only was SVB their main bank - it was their only bank. ""At our next board meetings I want to talk about resource concentration,"" said Melanie Hayes, managing partner at the venture capitalist firm BGV, which also banked exclusively with SVB. ""We also need to look at the rest of the business and see where else we might have concentration risk."" To paraphrase: do not put all of your eggs in one basket. And also, may I add - choose big, robust, protected baskets that are more likely to be prevented from failing by regulators and governments. It may sound like a no-brainer, but if you are a tech start-up, it is not as easy as it sounds. ""The main High Street banks are not supportive to start-ups, because we have perceived higher risks,"" says Elin Haf Davies, founder of Aparito, a med-tech start up based in Wrexham that focuses on clinical trials. Ms Davies said that SVB was popular with the med-tech sector, including both her competitors and clients - many of whom are US-based. Aparito is still scoping out how much of an impact those clients' banking problems are likely to have on its own cash flow. As well as financial services, you should also consider the breadth of your client base, she added. ""Try to have a large distribution of clients so you have a secure revenue stream,"" she said, acknowledging that ""it's easier said than done"". The perception that the big banks are less keen on start-up customers is one I hear echoed a lot. ""Many start-ups are with challenger banks because their account opening procedures are so much more straightforward,"" said Ms Hayes. ""It's hard to open up a bank account with a High Street bank if you're a start-up business."" But when I ask why, nobody is quite sure. ""If I knew the answer to that..."" Ms Hayes laughs. Chris Edson from Second Nature, a firm specialising in helping Type 2 diabetes patients manage their lifestyles, said that until recently his firm banked with Metro, but had decided to switch to SVB. The firm had transferred some money into a fixed-term bond before news began to spread about SVB, but there was still about £1m in the account.  ""We faced the dilemma of, 'do we withdraw our cash and make the problem worse or do we wait?'. I was in a WhatsApp groups with other founders and opinion was split."" In the end, Mr Edson opted for a transfer back to the old Metro account on Friday morning and while the money appears to have left SVB, it has not yet arrived in its new destination. But he is confident that under HSBC ownership, all will be well. ""I think every chief financial officer has worked all weekend,"" he said.  ""Sunday seemed like a real black swan, once in a generation, moment for start-ups. It's shaken everybody in the VC [venture capital] world to their core."" One thing it has also done is unite the tech sector together in an unusual moment of business collaboration. ""I've never had so many messages from founders or investors as I have over the last 48 hours,"" said Mr Edson. Ms Hayes said she saw tech bosses sharing ""practical stuff"" like lists of banks which were prepared to open accounts quickly, and personal contacts who may be able to help. They were also co-ordinating a data-gathering exercise to establish the extent of the problem, which involved sharing quite sensitive company information such as the amount of money firms had at risk and their cash flow requirements. ""We saw other people just sharing solidarity and support,"" she said. ""It was good to see people pulling together."" Follow Zoe Kleinman on Twitter @zsk."
Spread to US Treasury,Iran vows custody death probe amid protests,2024-09-25,2022-09-22,By Merlyn Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-63003344,"Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has said the death of a woman in police custody must be investigated after it sparked widespread protests. Speaking on a visit to the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr Raisi accused the West of hypocrisy for raising concerns over Mahsa Amini's death. She died hours after morality police arrested her for allegedly breaking headscarf rules. At least 17 people have died in the worst unrest in Iran for years. Ms Amini, a Kurdish woman from the north-western city of Saqez, died in hospital in Tehran on Friday following three days in a coma. Mr Raisi repeated a coroner's conclusion that the young woman had not been beaten. Iranian police said she had suffered ""sudden heart failure"".  Protesters reject the state's conclusions, pointing to reports that officers beat Ms Amini's head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles.  The hard-line president warned the protesters that the ""acts of chaos"" were not acceptable. He accused Western nations of ""double standards"", pointing to killings by police in the United Kingdom and the US.  ""Every day in different countries, including the United States, we see men and women dying in police encounters, but there is no sensitivity about the cause and dealing with this violence,"" he added. His shot back at the West came hours after the US announced sanctions to be placed on Iranian morality police. The US treasury department said the sanctions were for the abuse of Iranian women and the violation of protesters' rights.  Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard, which has close ties to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called on the judiciary to prosecute ""those who spread false news and rumours"" as part of apparent efforts to halt the momentum of the protests. The Guards also expressed sympathy for Ms Amini's family.  The protests have reached about 80 cities and towns. One person told BBC Persian her neighbourhood resembled a battlefield.  In an interview with BBC Persian, Ms Amini's father Amjad said he was not allowed by authorities to see all of her body after it had been wrapped for burial, when just her face and feet were visible.  ""There were bruises on her feet,"" he said, adding that he had asked doctors to examine them but had never heard back. Mr Amini also rejected claims from the interior minister and Tehran's director of forensic medicine that his daughter had had pre-existing health problems. ""They are lying,"" he said. ""She has not been to any hospital at all in the past 22 years, other than for a few cold-related sicknesses."" The first protests took place after the funeral, when women were filmed waving their headscarves in the air and shouting ""death to the dictator"" - a chant often directed at the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  Similar demonstrations were staged by students at several universities in Tehran, before the protests started spreading rapidly across the country. ""Now, we have seen so many men joining in and it has moved on from a protest against the compulsory hijab. It's now against the whole existence of the Islamic Republic,"" BBC Persian's Rana Rahimpour told the Today programme. She added: ""This is most serious challenge to the Islamic leadership of Iran that we have seen here in recent years."" The deadliest unrest has been concentrated in Iran's Kurdish-populated north-west, where Ms Amini lived. Internet-monitoring group NetBlocks has reported that Iran is now subject to the most severe internet restrictions seen since mass anti-government erupted in November 2019. Mobile phone networks were largely shut down, internet service was disrupted during protests, and access to Instagram and WhatsApp were being restricted, it said."
Spread to US Treasury,Two more coronavirus cases confirmed in Wales,2024-09-25,2020-03-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-51790967,"Two more people in Wales have tested positive for the coronavirus, taking the total number in Wales to four. The two latest cases are members of the same household in Pembrokeshire who had travelled back from northern Italy, Wales' chief medical officer has said. Both individuals have been in self-isolation since their return and are being managed in a ""clinically appropriate setting"". Public Health Wales (PHW) said it was identifying their close contacts. Meanwhile, the Welsh Government has confirmed that emergency legislation introduced by the UK government would also apply in Wales.  ""The public can be assured that Wales and the whole of the UK is prepared for these types of incidents,"" said Dr Giri Shankar, from PHW.  ""Working with our partners in Wales and the UK, we have implemented our planned response, with robust infection control measures in place to protect the health of the public."" The nationwide steps came as a man in this 60s became the third person in the UK to die after testing positive for coronavirus, on Sunday.  The man, who had ""significant"" underlying health problems, died at North Manchester General Hospital, NHS England said. The number of UK cases has risen to 273 - up from 209 on Saturday. Wales' other two cases, one person from Swansea and one from Cardiff, had also returned from northern Italy. Elsewhere, Italy has placed millions of people under quarantine as it battles to contain the spread of the virus. Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said: ""I can confirm that two additional individuals in Wales have tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), bringing the total number of positive cases in Wales to four. ""All appropriate measures to provide care for the individuals and to reduce the risk of transmission to others are being taken."" A new symptom checker for suspected coronavirus has been launched online by the Welsh NHS as attempts continue to halt the spread of the virus. The Welsh Ambulance Service said the online service should be the ""first port of call"" as the NHS 111 telephone lines are ""very busy"". And a car park for an old medical clinic is doubling up as Wales' first drive-through coronavirus testing centre at Rossett, near Wrexham. As of Friday, 634 people in Wales had been tested for the virus, according to PHW. The tests are being conducted by specialists with about 90% being carried out in people's own homes. Coronavirus presents with flu-like symptoms including a fever, a cough, or difficulty breathing. Wales' Health Secretary Vaughan Gething confirmed on Sunday that the UK government's proposed emergency legislation - which would include allowing workers to temporarily leave their jobs and could see retired health professionals registered again - would apply to all four UK nations.  He said a range of those powers would be for ministers in Wales to exercise.  ""These emergency powers will allow us to respond quickly and effectively to the Covid-19 outbreak by strengthening quarantine and mass gathering powers,"" he said. ""These powers are an important, proportionate and coordinated response to help us do that."" Funding from the Treasury to help deal with the outbreak should be ""distributed on the basis of need"", Wales' Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said on Sunday. She told BBC's Politics Wales the Welsh Government was ""currently managing to deal with the coronavirus within our existing financial budget in respect of the NHS"". The minister said she intended to raise the point at a meeting with the UK government's chief treasury secretary on Tuesday."
Spread to US Treasury,New rules for Wales' pubs and bars before Christmas,2024-09-25,2020-11-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-55102867,"Pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter Covid-19 restrictions in the run up to Christmas, the first minister has said. The new restrictions, which have not yet been finalised, will come into force from Friday, 4 December. They may be based on the system in some parts of Scotland where no alcohol can be served. Cinemas, bowling alleys and indoor entertainment venues will also have to shut before the festive break. A date for these to close has not yet been agreed. Mark Drakeford said action was needed as case rates continued to rise in the run up to Christmas. But the Welsh Conservatives said any new restrictions would be a ""real blow"" for businesses who had already ""suffered greatly"", while Plaid Cymru said the lack of detail was leaving employers unable to prepare. Pubs, bars and restaurants had only reopened on 9 November after the Wales-wide 17-day lockdown, and are currently made to close at 22:00 GMT. Ahead of the announcement people working in the hospitality industry had warned any further restrictions before Christmas would be a ""big blow"". Plans for the new rules have not yet been finalised, but BBC Wales understands one option being considered is the ""level three"" Scottish system, where venues are banned from selling alcohol and have to close at 18:00. The R rate - the number of people each infected person passed the virus on to - has risen again to 1.4 in Wales, with the rate needing to be below one for the number of cases to fall. In England about 55 million people are being placed under the tightest level of lockdown rules from 2 December, when an England-wide lockdown ends and a new tiered system is introduced. Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said Wales had to use the ""coming weeks"" to reduce the spread of the virus, to ""create more headroom for the Christmas period"". Mr Drakeford said while case rates had fallen following the 17-day firebreak, as people had resumed socialising it they had risen ""faster and further than we anticipated"", and action was needed. ""This does not mean a return to the firebreak arrangements, but the cabinet has agreed to take further specific and targeted action to reinforce the current national measures we have place,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said he could ""not rule anything out for the future"" in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. Non-essential retail, hairdressers, gyms and leisure centres will stay open, it was confirmed. Speaking of the new measures for pubs, bars and restaurants, Mr Drakeford added: ""I know this will be a worrying time for all working in the industry. ""We will be working over the weekend with partners to finalise the details of the new arrangements and to put in place a further major package of financial support to respond to those changes. ""I will give further details about the package on Monday."" Claire Vaughan, programme manager at Chapter cinema in Cardiff, said: ""Globally no cases of coronavirus have been traced back to a visit to the cinema.  ""Cinemas are a low-risk way of spending time outside the house at a time when the mental health of people in Wales is a huge concern. ""Masks are worn, there are air circulation units and no one is facing another person... Not everyone is living in a warm, safe home - many people need these spaces to be open."" Liam Evans-Ford, Theatr Clwyd's executive director, added the announcement had been a ""huge surprise"". ""This is devastating for our business, for our employees, for our freelancers and for our communities,"" he said. Sian Shepphard, owner of the Horse and Jockey in Pontypool, opened the pub in August so has not been eligible for government support. ""The main problem is we are trying to get people to stay at home but it is ruining our businesses,"" she said. ""I employ over 25 staff here - we are a really family-run business. We are all family - how am I supposed to put food on the table for them?"" Phil James, a customer at the pub, said the potential changes would affect his Christmas plans. ""We just don't know what arrangement to make at the end of the day - people have to know. You come out to socialise - people want to be social for Christmas, alcohol is a part of it."" Simon Buckley, chairman of The Brewers of Wales, said: ""Is this finally the straw that will break the industry's back? ""We as an industry are being thrown to the wind, and the looming prospect of significant job losses seems to count for nothing."" Plaid's economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said: ""They [pubs and restaurants] don't know if they're being asked to close altogether again, to only do takeaways, to have restricted opening without alcohol.  ""So, they can't really prepare. They need to be given the maximum length of time to prepare."" Clwyd West member of the Senedd Darren Millar called for a targeted rather than a Wales-wide blanket approach. ""It is grossly unfair to impose the same level of restrictions in Conwy and Denbighshire as Covid-19 hotspots in south Wales,"" he said. ""The virus is circulating at different rates in different parts of the country."" Mr Drakeford insisted there were no plans to introduce regionalised ""tiered"" restrictions, similar to those coming into force in England. He said there was no case for aligning the Welsh and English systems to ensure no-one was left out of UK-wide Treasury schemes that offer financial assistance to businesses affected by lockdown measures. ""We don't lose out on any UK system by having a single tier for Wales, so there is no disadvantage to us in that,"" he said. He added: ""The advice we have is that a single set of arrangements for Wales works best, is easiest to communicate and delivers benefits in all parts of Wales."" Pembrokeshire councillor John Davies welcomed the restrictions after a spike in cases in his ward, Cilgerran, linked to the recent outbreak in nearby Cardigan. He told Newyddion 9: ""If people aren't willing to exercise common sense and be citizens of responsibility towards each other, there is no other option. ""We've seen what happens in this part of the world when people act in a selfish manner."" Mr Drakeford said he had no plans to allow schools to close early for Christmas. Teaching union UCAC had called for classrooms to be shut on 11 December and for lessons to be moved online amid fears teachers and pupils may have to isolate on Christmas Day. But Mr Drakeford said ministers would do ""everything we can"" to keep schools working up until the Christmas holiday. He added: ""It is more important for our children not to miss out further on the education that is planned for them for the whole of the rest of this term and that's what we will be working to achieve."""
Spread to US Treasury,'Godfather of Sudoku' Maki Kaji dies aged 69,2024-09-25,2021-08-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58243126,"Maki Kaji, the Japanese man known as the ""Godfather of Sudoku"", has died at the age of 69. Kaji gave the number puzzle its name after publishing it in his magazine Nikoli in the 1980s. Since then the popular game - involving placing the numbers 1 to 9 in each row, column and square of a 9 by 9 grid - has spread around the globe. Tournaments take place across the world and it is estimated that millions play versions of the game each day. On Monday Nikoli published a statement on its website saying Kaji had died at his home in Tokyo from bile duct cancer on 10 August 2021.  Kaji was born in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo in 1951.  After dropping out of Keio University, he set up the puzzle magazine Nikoli, which published its first edition in August 1980.  The origins of Sudoku are unclear. Some credit the 18th Century Swiss mathematician Euler as its creator, while others say it came to the Arab world from China via India in the 8th or 9th Century, according to the New York Times.  French newspapers published a number of early versions of the game in the late 19th Century, including one called ""le carré magique diabolique"", or the evil magic square, published by La France newspaper in July 1895. But US architect Howard Garns is often credited as the creator of the modern version of the puzzle in the 1970s, under the name Number Place. It was this game that Kaji spotted in 1984. ""It was a very interesting puzzle, fun to solve,"" he said in a 2008 speech.  ""But the name, Number Place, did not hit me. I wanted to create a Japanese name."" Kaji landed on Suuji wa dokushin ni kagiru, meaning ""Numbers should be single"".  Pushed by colleagues to come up with a catchier name as he rushed to get to a horse race, he said he came up with the name Sudoku ""in about 25 seconds"". The game became popular in Japan but only turned into a global phenomenon in 2004, after The Times of London published a puzzle. Kaji did not trademark the game, and did not gain financially from its huge success. But he said the joy of the puzzle and of others enjoying the game was more important than any monetary reward.  ""I get really moved when I see a new idea for a puzzle which has lots of potential,"" he told the BBC in 2007.  ""I get really excited about it. It is like finding treasure."""
Spread to US Treasury,$600 benefit to millions of US unemployed expires,2024-09-25,2020-08-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53619910,"A $600 (£459) jobless benefit paid weekly to tens of millions of unemployed Americans expired overnight after Republicans and Democrats failed to reach a deal on its extension.  Friday was the deadline for an agreement on the coronavirus relief, which tops up state benefits that are mostly far below $600. Republicans want a smaller relief plan than one passed by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. Talks have resumed in Washington. Unemployment has soared during the coronavirus pandemic, with 30 million Americans currently collecting jobless benefits. The US economy shrank by 9.5% in the second quarter of 2020, compared with the preceding three months.  This is equivalent to an annual rate of 32.9% - the country's steepest contraction for decades. The $600 payments are part of a $2.2tn congressional package adopted in March as the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses to shut down.  But Congress did not anticipate the current resurgence of the virus, deepening the impact on the economy.  Two top Democrats - US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer - are meeting two top Trump aides - Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Ms Pelosi made it clear that she was still opposed to any short-term deal on the $600 relief payments. The Covid-19 pandemic has killed at least 152,384 people in the US - the highest death toll in the world. On Friday Ms Pelosi rejected a Republican proposal to extend the benefits for just a week, pending a full agreement. Republican Mark Meadows said the Democrats had rejected reasonable offers, and ""what we're seeing is politics as usual from Democrats"". Many of the unemployed have already received their final $600 top-up. Danielle Grant, a single parent in San Francisco, told CBS that without the $600 relief she would struggle to pay her monthly mortgage and other bills. ""I'm already financially strapped. It's an impossible situation,"" she said.  Her public relations firm for the arts lost business when museums and other venues were forced to close in the pandemic. Ms Pelosi said Republican leaders ""and perhaps the White House do not understand the gravity of the situation"". She said she rejected the one-week extension proposed by President Donald Trump's team because such a move would occur ""if you are on a path"" toward a deal, and ""we're not"". Democrats also rejected a later White House proposal to cut the $600 weekly payment to $400 for the next four months. Democrats want to maintain the $600 weekly top-up benefit into next year, and are pushing for a new federal stimulus package to help states through the crisis. President Trump turned to Twitter to attack both Ms Pelosi and the top Democrat in the Senate Chuck Schumer for the impasse. "
Spread to US Treasury,Trump says China to cut tariffs on US cars,2024-09-25,2018-12-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46422320,"Beijing will ""reduce and remove"" the 40% tariffs it places on US cars imported into China, US President Donald Trump has said. China has declined to confirm President Trump's announcement, which he made on Twitter without providing details. The move, if confirmed, would be welcomed by a car industry unsettled by the escalating US-China trade war. President Trump and Xi Jinping have now agreed to a temporary truce in the bitter dispute.  Over dinner at the G20 summit, they agreed to not increase tariffs for 90 days to allow for talks. Failure to strike a deal would have seen tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese goods rise from 10% to 25% at the start of next year, and would have opened the way for tariffs on additional Chinese goods.  President Trump was in ebullient mood after the developments. On Monday, China's foreign ministry said the presidents of China and the US had instructed their economic teams to ""intensify talks"" towards removing all tariffs following the G20 meeting, However, it did not say if that was a plan with specific goals or something that was merely desirable. Asian markets rallied after news of the trade war truce. In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index climbed 2.5% and the Shanghai Composite index jumped 2.6%. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 1%. The gains spread to Europe, with the UK's FTSE 100 index, the Cac 40 in France and Germany's Dax index all up by about 2%.  The trade war has seen the US and China hit each other with escalating tariffs in an attempt to make their domestically made goods more competitive.  The US says its tariff policy is a response to China's ""unfair"" trade practices and accuses it of intellectual property theft.  Since July, the US has hit China with tariffs on $250bn (£195.9bn) worth of goods. China has retaliated with duties on some $110bn of US goods over the same period. As part of this, the US imposed a 25% tariff on Chinese cars, on top of the 2.5% already in place.  In July, China, which is the world's largest market for cars, imposed a 40% tariff on US vehicle imports. The rate is much higher than the 15% it places on other trading partners and forced many carmakers to raise prices.  In his tweet, President Trump said Beijing had ""agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the US"".  He did not provide a new level for the Chinese tariffs, and Beijing did not immediately confirm the statement.  In a statement, the White House said US tariffs on Chinese goods would remain unchanged for 90 days, but added: ""If at the end of this period of time, the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the 10 percent tariffs will be raised to 25 percent."" The US said China agreed to ""purchase a not yet agreed upon, but very substantial, amount of agricultural, energy, industrial, and other products from the United States to reduce the trade imbalance between our two countries"". Both sides also pledged to ""immediately begin negotiations on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and cyber theft"", according to the White House.  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters after the talks that ""the principal agreement has effectively prevented further expansion of economic friction between the two countries"". Yes. The truce prevents raising tariffs as planned on $200bn worth of Chinese goods.  But it does not remove tariffs that apply to a total of $250bn of Chinese goods targeted since July. The truce also does not affect the existing duties China has imposed on $110bn of US goods in a tit for tat retaliation. While the result of the G20 meeting was better than expected, it is unclear how the two countries will manage to resolve their underlying differences. ""There should be no wishful thinking that the truce would end the trade war between the world's two largest economies,"" DBS strategist Philip Wee wrote in a research note.  He said it ""remains to be seen if real progress could be achieved during this narrow window to resolve the contentious issues, not just on trade, but also intellectual property"". Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, said while the agreement itself was ""positive"" the next steps remained unclear.  ""Whether we will see further de-escalation or whether it is temporary reprieve continues to be very much up to a political decision in Washington DC - that will continue to make this uncertain,"" Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics said.

Spread to US Treasury,Historic church destroyed in large blaze,2024-09-25,2023-01-27,By Liz Jackson & Celestina Olulode,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-64421569,"A Grade II* listed church in north-west London has been destroyed in a fire overnight. Eighty firefighters were deployed to St Mark's church in Hamilton Terrace, St John's Wood, at 23:20 GMT on Thursday. Videos on social media showed the entire two-storey building alight, while witnesses said the roof of the ornate Victorian building had caved in. London Fire Brigade (LFB) said there were no injuries and the cause of the fire was not known. The National Churches Trust has described St Mark's as an ""architectural and historical treasure"". The building, which is more than 170 years old, has links to author Lewis Carroll and Queen Victoria's son Prince Leopold and is situated near Abbey Road Studios and Lord's Cricket Ground. The vicar of St Mark's, the Reverend Kate Harrison, told the BBC the fire was ""heart-breaking for us as a church and a local community"". ""We remain in deep shock, but are so grateful for the prayers and messages that continue to come in, and commit to continuing to serve the local community as best we can,"" she added. Sophia Tennant, who witnessed the fire, said she was getting ready for bed when she looked out of the window and saw flames rising from inside a building which she later realised was the church. After calling the fire brigade, she said she ""came and watched and it was really flaming, most of the roof seemed to be on fire"".  ""You could see the fire inside the church going up what would have been the stained glass window at the east end, so it's pretty disastrous,"" she said. Reema Raisinghani, 32, lives in Hamilton Terrace directly opposite the church and said residents living on the ground floor of nearby buildings were told to evacuate as the flames spread. She said the building was fully alight, including the spire, by 00:30 and ""pieces of the church were actually falling down the façade"". ""It's an iconic church, I'm used to waking up to it every single morning. It's one of those massive community churches, it's just a centre point for the whole terrace as well,"" she said. ""The beautiful stone colour is now all black, it's a black shell. There's ash everywhere, including outside my whole flat."" Another witness described seeing ""lots of flames"" which became ""much bigger before the roof caved in"".  More than 10 fire engines were deployed to the scene, with crews from North Kensington, Paddington and West Hampstead working to put out the flames. Firefighters used three ladders to spray water on to the building, including two 34m (111 ft) ladders and one 64m (209 ft) ladder that is the tallest of its kind in Europe. Eddie Tulasiewicz, from the National Churches Trust, said it was a tragedy that such a ""beautiful, historic church"" had been struck by fire, but he hoped ""a lot of the interior can be saved"". ""Churches are full of wood and most have fire detectors, but what they need is sprinkler systems,"" he said. Households in the area were previously advised to keep windows and doors closed, and police asked the public to avoid the area to allow emergency services to work.  LFB said fire teams remained on site making the scene safe and were carrying out investigations into the cause of the blaze. Westminster City Council said there would be local road closures until late morning, but all residents were ""safe and accounted for"". Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Spread to US Treasury,Government announces anti-fake news unit,2024-09-25,2018-01-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42791218,"The UK government is to establish a new unit to counter ""fake news"", Downing Street has said. Theresa May's spokesman said the ""dedicated national security communications unit"" would be charged with ""combating disinformation by state actors and others"". ""We are living in an era of fake news and competing narratives,"" he said. The phrase ""fake news"" has recently emerged and is frequently used by US President Donald Trump. Completely false information, photos or videos purposefully created and spread to confuse or misinform Information, photos or videos manipulated to deceive - or old photographs shared as new Satire or parody which means no harm but can fool people A committee of MPs is currently carrying out an inquiry into the ""growing phenomenon"" and has demanded information from Facebook and Twitter including on Russian activity during the EU referendum. Downing Street told political reporters: ""The government will respond with more and better use of national security communications to tackle these interconnected complex challenges. ""We will build on existing capabilities by creating a dedicated national security communications unit. This will be tasked with combating disinformation by state actors and others. It will more systematically deter our adversaries and help us deliver on national security priorities."" Last month the BBC launched a new scheme to help young people identify real news and filter out fake or false information. The new fake news unit was agreed at a meeting of the National Security Council (NSC). The NSC had also commissioned a defence spending review ""to deliver better military capability and value for money in a sustainable and affordable way"", Downing Street said. There have been repeated warnings about cuts to the armed forces, with the Ministry of Defence looking for savings of £2bn. The latest review, called the Modernising Defence Programme, will be led by the MoD, rather than the NSC, which BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale described as a ""small but significant victory"" for Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. The NSC had been carrying out a ""capabilities review"" expected to push through more defence cuts, our correspondent said. And handing responsibility to the MoD would give it the chance to argue for more money from the Treasury and more control over the process."
Spread to US Treasury,US sanctions Iran's Foreign Minister Zarif,2024-09-25,2019-07-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49182562,"The US Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions against Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. The sanctions freeze any assets Mr Zarif may have in America, the department said. ""Javad Zarif implements the reckless agenda of Iran's Supreme Leader (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei),"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. Mr Zarif tweeted the US had imposed sanctions on him because it considered him as a threat to its agenda. Tensions between the US and Iran have heightened since the US last year withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal that aimed to curb Iranian nuclear activities. There are growing concerns that a number of recent incidents in the Gulf could lead to a military conflict in the vital shipping region. On Wednesday, the US extended waivers which allow Russia, China and European countries to continue civilian nuclear cooperation with Iran.  White House security adviser John Bolton said on Wednesday that it was a ""short 90 day extension"". ""I think the idea here is we are watching those nuclear activities very, very closely,"" he added. Mr Mnuchin described Mr Zarif as the Iranian ""regime's primary spokesperson around the world"". ""The United States is sending a clear message to the Iranian regime that its recent behaviour is completely unacceptable. ""At the same time the Iranian regime denies Iranian citizens' access to social media, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif spreads the regime's propaganda and disinformation around the world through these mediums,"" Mr Mnuchin said. Mr Zarif said the US move ""has no effect on me or my family, as I have no property or interest outside of Iran"". He posted a tweet, mocking the US move. ""The US reason for designating me is that I am Iran's 'primary spokesperson around the world. Is the truth really that painful?"" he asked. ""Thank you for considering me such a huge threat to your agenda."" Last year, the US unilaterally withdrew from the agreement between Iran and world powers. Washington has since reimposed tight sanctions affecting the Iranian economy, and also  The other parties of the 2015 deal - China, France, Germany Russia and the UK - criticised Mr Trump's decision and said they remained fully committed to the deal. Iran responded by breaching the limit on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium set under the nuclear deal. Tehran stepped up production of enriched uranium, used to make reactor fuel but also potentially nuclear bombs, in May. Last week, talks were held in Vienna to try to save the nuclear deal. After meeting representatives from Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, a senior Iranian official said the atmosphere had been ""constructive"". Tensions between the UK and Iran rose in July after British forces seized the Iranian tanker, Grace 1, off Gibraltar. It was alleged to be carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions, a claim denied by Iran. Several days later the British-flagged Stena Impero was impounded by Iran, which said it had been ""violating international maritime rules"".

Spread to US Treasury,From employment to interest rates... the next few weeks are critical,2024-09-25,2023-09-09,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66755407,"So far 2023 has seen some false dawns for the UK economy. The next few weeks' data are critical. Recession has been avoided but growth has bumped along the bottom. And even as inflation falls from the double-digit levels of a year ago, it has proven more stubborn and sticky, and spread to the service sector. The ONS's recent huge revision of historical growth changes the picture of the immediate post-pandemic recovery, especially relative to other European countries. But a broader reassessment of UK prospects may have to wait for news in the coming weeks. Data released in September could show whether the crises of the past three years are being put firmly behind us. Expectations within government are for the rollercoaster ride to continue for the next few weeks at least.  Unemployment might tick up again when new figures are released on Tuesday. However, the UK should finally return to a situation where earnings are growing by more than the rise in the cost of living too. The economy (GDP) could also have shrunk a little in July - we'll find out on Wednesday. Rising fuel prices in August are likely to lead to a blip in the latest inflation numbers, released the following Wednesday, according to both Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey. All of this will feed into the Bank of England's interest rate decision in a fortnight. A rate rise had been expected, but recent hints have suggested the Bank may prefer to keep rates at current levels for longer. Against this backdrop, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is plugging the latest data into its forecasts to be published in November, alongside the Autumn Statement. On the face of it, higher wages are pushing up the tax take, meaning that this year's borrowing numbers are coming in less than originally forecast. However, there is more red ink pouring into the projections. At the Budget forecast in March, the peak in Bank of England rates was expected to be 4.3%. It is already 5.25%. Ten-year UK borrowing rates were forecast to be an average of 3.6% in March, and they reached 4.8% last month.  The OBR already stated at the Budget that a one percentage point rise in borrowing costs would increase borrowing by £20bn in 2027-28, ""wiping out headroom"" in its forecast. When the OBR points out that the Treasury is not on course to meet its self-imposed constraints on borrowing, that can result in pressure for tax rises or spending cuts. Right now the political conversation is about the opposite - pre-election tax cuts, or more spending on, for example, school repairs. For the chancellor, this autumn should help settle Britain on a stable, steady economic trajectory. It will not be spectacular, but it will be a world away from last year's shambles under his predecessor. Inflation should continue to fall, down to 3% in a year's time. The UK will stay in a respectable middle lane of growth in the major G7 economies. The Treasury's main medium-term policy focus will be acknowledging and trying to deal with the UK's relatively poor record on business investment. The Budget contained a suite of measures designed to help ease the labour supply problem. The Autumn Statement will be about this business investment challenge. The Treasury thinks it explains a quarter of the UK's productivity underperformance with other major economies. The prize, if the UK was as productive as Germany, for example, would be an increase in GDP per head of £6,000. But households are very much not out of the woods. Even a declining headline rate of inflation, and rising average earnings, will not mask increasing pain as rising interest rates hit homeowners and renters. The ONS consumer habits survey shows the bulk of people still spending more than usual on food shopping, buying less, and noticing less variety on the shelves. Supermarkets notice hundreds of thousands of home meals, replacing eating out. Banks notice mortgage holders who used to shop at the priciest of supermarkets switching to discount retailers. By the end of the month the Bank of England could give a definitive steer that interest rates have peaked at 5.5%, albeit at the cost of their staying at such a level for the next year or so. Industry is confident that high stocks of gas, and the ability to reduce demand, mean the whole of Europe should be resilient to any further energy market disruptions. But the combination of some further stoppage in gas tanker trade and a very cold winter still has the capacity to create a nasty inflationary surprise in the new year. A path to a more normal economic situation could emerge soon. The data about to be released should give some big clues."
Spread to US Treasury,Is Grenfell council outspending government?,2024-09-25,2017-10-24,By Dominic Casciani,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41724262,"The Claim: Kensington and Chelsea Council says it will spend more on the rehousing and recovery operation for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire than the government has promised to spend on housing in one quarter (three months) in the whole of the UK. Reality Check Verdict: The £235m that the council has set aside so far for Grenfell is less than the additional £250m allocated for affordable housing in England and Wales a quarter, so on these figures the council is wrong. The council predicts it will ultimately end up spending more on Grenfell but hasn't provided the figures. However the government is due to spend a total of £455m a quarter on affordable housing up to 2021. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea says it has set aside £235m so far on what it calls the Grenfell ""recovery"" operation.  This money includes:  There's no doubt that all of this is going to cost a fortune - not least because the borough is one of the most expensive areas of the UK. But even taking into account the sky-high prices of west London land, the council's claim doesn't stack up. So why did it get it wrong? It's not hard to understand why the council got into a muddle.  It all comes down to one of the biggest problems faced by anyone trying to get their head around government spending: knowing for sure when the cash is going to be spent.  The council told BBC Reality Check that it was comparing its spending with the government's Affordable Homes Programme.  This is the key scheme overseen by the Department for Communities and Local Government to funds new homes in the social sector.  The AHP was set up in 2010 and it runs until 2021. Up until the end of the summer, the Treasury had approved £7bn for the second five-year phase which we are now in. That works out at £350m a quarter. But that's not the figure to which the council is referring. Instead, it is referencing a new part of the affordable homes spending: an additional £2bn that the prime minister announced at October's Conservative Party Conference.  If that £2bn was spread over the five years to 2021, it would work out as £100m per quarter. That's lower than Kensington and Chelsea's Grenfell spending - so the council looks like it's right.  But in fact, that new money is an additional investment for only the final two years of the Affordable Homes Programme.  That works out at £250m per quarter. And that's more than the council has set aside so far for the Grenfell recovery bill.  The council predicts it will ultimately end up spending more on Grenfell but hasn't provided the figures.  BBC Reality Check likes to challenge itself by discovering new and complicated ways to push figures further.  We lumped all £9bn of the government's current affordable homes spending together, without worrying too much about which particular year it applied to. When you spread that total over the five years of the programme, the projected quarterly average was £455m - still more than the council has set aside so far. This article was amended on 24 October to reflect new information from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter"
Spread to US Treasury,Why Trump wants US open for business despite pandemic,2024-09-25,2020-03-23,By Anthony Zurcher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52009108,"As a growing number of states issue ""shelter in place"" orders, businesses shutter and Americans everywhere are told to limit outings and practise social distancing, Donald Trump may be having second thoughts. For more than a week, Trump administration officials and state leaders have been talking of the need to ""bend the curve"" of the coronavirus outbreak, limiting the spread of the illness to prevent the American healthcare system from being overwhelmed. The steep economic toll, however, is becoming increasingly apparent. Last week Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin predicted that US unemployment could reach 20%. On Thursday the Treasury Department will release last week's new jobless claims, and the numbers are sure to be in the millions. A Goldman Sachs report estimated that the nation's gross domestic product in the second quarter could shrink by 24%, dwarfing the previous 10% record decline in 1958. But at Monday's White House coronavirus news conference, the president said: ""America will again and soon be open for business."" In the late hours of Sunday night, Trump had vented his concerns. ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,"" he tweeted, using the all-caps he reserves for matters of apparent urgency. ""AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!"" The 15-day period the president referenced began on 16 March, when the White House announced new Centers for Disease Control guidelines encouraging all Americans to work from home when possible and limit gatherings of more than 10 people. As is often the case, the president's tweet may have been prompted by watching a segment on Fox News. On Sunday evening, host (and former advisor to then-British PM David Cameron) Steve Hilton warned that an economic collapse would itself result in avoidable deaths and other hardships - that the ""cure"" could be worse than the ""disease"". ""Our ruling class and their TV mouthpieces whipping up fear over this virus, they can afford an indefinite shutdown,"" Hilton said. ""Working Americans can't. They'll be crushed by it."" Trump's faithful may be inching back to the view they held a few weeks ago, that the virus is being used by the president's political enemies to damage his political standing by damaging the economy. On Monday morning the president continued on this theme, with a flurry of retweets of accounts (some with only a few hundred followers) who were calling for Americans to be allowed to return to work after the 15-day period ended. Former top Trump economic advisor Gary Cohn also joined the chorus, albeit somewhat obliquely. ""Is it time to start discussing the need for a date when the economy can turn back on?"" he asked on Twitter. ""Policymakers have taken bold public health and economic actions to address the coronavirus, but businesses need clarity. Otherwise they will assume the worst and make decisions to survive."" This conclusion among conservatives is not universal, however. On Sunday Steve Bannon, a former senior Trump campaign and White House staffer who has repeatedly fallen in and out of favour with the president, advocated for a ""hammer"" style imposition of rigorous separation. ""Drop the hammer, don't mitigate the virus, don't spread the curve, shatter the curve,"" he said during a Fox News morning interview. ""Go full hammer on the virus right now with a full shutdown, use the stimulus to bridge the economic crisis."" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who frequently has the president's ear, issued his own warning, garnished with a bit of praise. ""President Trump's best decision was stopping travel from China early on,"" he writes. ""I hope we will not undercut that decision by suggesting we back off aggressive containment policies within the United States."" Graham somewhat misrepresented the administration's 31 January order that only limited entry by non-US-resident foreign nationals who had been in China in the previous two weeks, but the move has been touted by the president as evidence that he acted early to deal with the spread of the virus. Meanwhile, others in the Trump administration continue to stress the need for rigorous social distancing - which suggests that there could be growing divisions between medical professionals in the administration and those whose focus on the economic impact. On Monday morning, for instance, Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned that the worst was yet to come. ""I want America to understand, this week, it's going to get bad,"" he said in a television interview. ""And right now there are not enough people out there who are taking this seriously."" Any move by the administration to ease guidelines could also set up a clash with state governors, a growing number of whom are moving toward greater, not lesser, restrictions on movement and gatherings. One of the much-touted strengths of the US federalist system of government is it allows states - the so-called ""laboratories of democracy"" - freedom to devise their own policies and solutions to pressing political concerns. That system has never been tested quite like this, however, as some governors warn of the risks of a patchwork response to a national health crisis   The president underlined this potential for conflict in a tweet on Sunday afternoon swiping at Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who had earlier criticised the administration's coronavirus response. @JBPritzker, Governor of Illinois, and a very small group of certain other Governors, together with Fake News @CNN & Concast (MSDNC), shouldn't be blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings,"" he wrote. ""We are there to back you up should you fail, and always will be!"" The president, it appears, is being pulled in multiple directions and, as he often does, is airing his internal dialogue on Twitter.  At his press conference on Monday, he seemed to be tilting away from his medical advisers. ""If it were up to the doctors, they may say let's keep it shut down - let's shut down the entire world,"" he said.  ""You can't do that with a country - especially the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world."" He has described himself as a ""wartime president"" doing battle against the spread of this virus, but he's also spent much of the past year building a November re-election campaign around the claim that he has presided over record economic growth and low unemployment - both of which seem to be evaporating. And not only is Trump looking at this as a president whose re-election could hinge on an economic rebound, he is also a businessman watching his life's work - his empire of resorts, hotels and golf courses, some of which were reportedly already in financial trouble - face an existential crisis. ""At a certain point, we have to get open and have to get moving,"" Trump said on Monday, referring to the US economy.  ""We don't want to lose these companies, we don't want to lose these workers, we want to take care of our workers, so we'll be doing something I think relatively quickly."" The three-plus years of Trump's administration have already had enough turmoil and drama - much of it self-created - to fill an entire two terms.  The coronavirus outbreak is a presidency-defining crisis, however - one that, barring the kind of miracle treatment Trump has at times hoped for, appears to offer options that range from bad to worse."

The new prime minister announced cash on Monday for three growth deals in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and one in Wales. It is not yet decided how much of the £300m will go to Wales. The UK government said the allocation of the money would depend on the strength of proposals put forward. Growth deals are government funding packages aimed at boosting regional economies, using money from different sources including private investment to be spent on specific projects. Cardiff and Swansea Bay are at the centre of growth deals already in place while another is being negotiated for north Wales. The Mid Wales Growth Deal, which covers Powys and Ceredigion, will get a proportion of the £300m cash, which will be spread out over 15 years.  It promises a potential of 4,000 new jobs boosting the mid Wales economy by £200m a year. Transport, broadband and connectivity are expected to be at the heart of proposals likely to emerge in the autumn. Mr Johnson visited Faslane naval base in Scotland on Monday, with a visit to Wales planned for later this week. He called for a renewal of ""the ties that bind our United Kingdom"". ""Our union is the most successful political and economic union in history. We are a global brand, and together we are safer, stronger and more prosperous,"" he said ahead of the visit to Scotland. On the matter of funding for mid Wales, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: ""I am keen for us all to be as ambitious as possible in driving forward the development of projects, so that they can deliver enduring benefits to businesses and people."" However, Welsh Labour accused the UK government of having made ""swingeing cuts"" to the Welsh Government's budget over the last ten years. A spokesman said that set against a ""chronic lack of investment"" from the UK government in major infrastructure projects, the new funding offer was "" very thin stuff"". He added: ""Instead of vague promises and half-baked announcements lacking in detail we need concrete action from the UK government to end the punishing austerity the Tories have imposed on our economy and our public services over the last decade."" A UK government spokeswoman said in response: ""Today's announcement is about expanding the growth deals programme to areas of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland which are yet to benefit from this significant investment. ""This includes additional funding for the Mid Wales Growth Deal where we have a longstanding commitment, having announced starting negotiations at Autumn Budget in 2017.  ""All deals involve negotiation and the funding total for mid Wales will be based on the strength and ambition of proposals put forward by local partners."" Analysis -  Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent The Mid Wales Growth deal is at a very early stage. The expectation is that in return for the money from the UK Treasury, the projects chosen will be expected to deliver an increase in the strength of the local economy in terms of productivity or Gross Value Added. That's in contrast to funding being awarded purely because of need.  It is far from clear who would decide what the money would be spent on, nor is it known whether that would be determined in Westminster or Cardiff. However, projects chosen for funding will have to be innovative and have a wider impact, rather than being spent directly to ease deprived communities. Workers in Powys have the lowest rate of productivity per hour of any local authority area in the UK.  The Growing Mid Wales Partnership has already held workshops, gathering ideas for a growth deal. Along with better communications, some of the ideas have been about new developments in green energy, new agricultural techniques - such as ""vertical farming"" to get more produce per acre - and local sourcing of food for tourism.  The aim is to create high-skilled, well-paid jobs that will also keep young people in the area and attract others."
Spread to US Treasury,Trump's Iran deal speech: Full text,2024-09-25,2017-10-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41617488,"Thank you very much. My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, my highest obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people. History has shown that the longer we ignore a threat, the more dangerous that threat becomes. For this reason, upon taking office, I've ordered a complete strategic review of our policy toward the rogue regime in Iran. That review is now complete. Today, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps we are taking to confront the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East and all around the world. Iran is under the control of a fanatical regime that seized power in 1979 and forced a proud people to submit to its extremist rule. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the world's oldest and most vibrant nations, and spread death, destruction and chaos all around the globe. Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian regime illegally seized the US embassy in Tehran and held more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis. The Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah twice bombed our embassy in Lebanon - once in 1983 and again in 1984. Another Iranian-supported bombing killed 241 Americans - service members they were, in their barracks in Beirut in 1983. In 1996, the regime directed another bombing of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. Iranian proxies provided training to operatives who were later involved in al-Qaeda's bombing of the American embassies in Kenya, Tanzania, and two years later, killing 224 people, and wounding more than 4,000 others. The regime harboured high-level terrorists in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, including Osama bin Laden's son. In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military personnel. The Iranian dictatorship's aggression continues to this day. The regime remains the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and provides assistance to al-Qaeda, the Taliban, Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist networks.  It develops, deploys, and proliferates missiles that threaten American troops and our allies. It harasses American ships and threatens freedom of navigation in the Arabian Gulf and in the Red Sea. It imprisons Americans on false charges. And it launches cyberattacks against our critical infrastructure, financial system, and military. The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed. The regime violently suppresses its own citizens; it shot unarmed student protesters in the street during the Green Revolution. This regime has fuelled sectarian violence in Iraq, and vicious civil wars in Yemen and Syria. In Syria, the Iranian regime has supported the atrocities of Bashar al-Assad's regime and condoned Assad's use of chemical weapons against helpless civilians, including many, many children. Given the regime's murderous past and present, we should not take lightly its sinister vision for the future. The regime's two favourite chants are ""Death to America"" and ""Death to Israel"". Realising the gravity of the situation, the United States and the United Nations Security Council sought, over many years, to stop Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. But the previous administration lifted these sanctions, just before what would have been the total collapse of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. This deal is known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for years of terrible trade deals that have sacrificed so many millions of jobs in our country to the benefit of other countries. We need negotiators who will much more strongly represent America's interest. The nuclear deal threw Iran's dictatorship a political and economic lifeline, providing urgently needed relief from the intense domestic pressure the sanctions had created. It also gave the regime an immediate financial boost and over $100bn its government could use to fund terrorism. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7bn from the United States, a large portion of which was physically loaded onto an airplane and flown into Iran. Just imagine the sight of those huge piles of money being hauled off by the Iranians waiting at the airport for the cash. I wonder where all that money went. Worst of all, the deal allows Iran to continue developing certain elements of its nuclear programme. And importantly, in just a few years, as key restrictions disappear, Iran can sprint towards a rapid nuclear weapons breakout. In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. What is the purpose of a deal that, at best, only delays Iran's nuclear capability for a short period of time? This, as president of the United States, is unacceptable. In other countries, they think in terms of 100-year intervals, not just a few years at a time. The saddest part of the deal for the United States is that all of the money was paid up front, which is unheard of, rather than at the end of the deal when they have shown they've played by the rules. But what's done is done, and that's why we are where we are. Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. For example, on two separate occasions, they have exceeded the limit of 130 metric tonnes of heavy water. Until recently, the Iranian regime has also failed to meet our expectations in its operation of advanced centrifuges. The Iranian regime has also intimidated international inspectors into not using the full inspection authorities that the agreement calls for. Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow inspectors onto military sites, even though the international community suspects some of those sites were part of Iran's clandestine nuclear weapons programme. There are also many people who believe that Iran is dealing with North Korea. I am going to instruct our intelligence agencies to do a thorough analysis and report back their findings beyond what they have already reviewed. By its own terms, the Iran Deal was supposed to contribute to ""regional and international peace and security"". And yet, while the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror and turmoil throughout the Middle East and beyond. Importantly, Iran is not living up to the spirit of the deal. So today, in recognition of the increasing menace posed by Iran, and after extensive consultations with our allies, I am announcing a new strategy to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. First, we will work with our allies to counter the regime's destabilising activity and support for terrorist proxies in the region. Second, we will place additional sanctions on the regime to block their financing of terror. Third, we will address the regime's proliferation of missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbours, global trade and freedom of navigation. And finally, we will deny the regime all paths to a nuclear weapon. Today, I am also announcing several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. The execution of our strategy begins with the long-overdue step of imposing tough sanctions on Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.  The Revolutionary Guard is the Iranian Supreme Leader's corrupt personal terror force and militia. It has hijacked large portions of Iran's economy and seized massive religious endowments to fund war and terror abroad. This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons to attack civilians in the region, and even plotting to bomb a popular restaurant right here in Washington DC. I am authorising the Treasury Department to further sanction the entire Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for its support for terrorism and to apply sanctions to its officials, agents and affiliates.  I urge our allies to join us in taking strong actions to curb Iran's continued dangerous and destabilising behaviour, including thorough sanctions outside the Iran Deal that target the regime's ballistic missile programme, in support for terrorism, and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many. Finally, on the grave matter of Iran's nuclear programme: Since the signing of the nuclear agreement, the regime's dangerous aggression has only escalated. At the same time, it has received massive sanctions relief while continuing to develop its missiles programme. Iran has also entered into lucrative business contracts with other parties to the agreement. When the agreement was finalised in 2015, Congress passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal.  Among other conditions, this law requires the president, or his designee, to certify that the suspension of sanctions under the deal is ""appropriate and proportionate"" to measure - and other measures taken by Iran to terminate its illicit nuclear programme. Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification. We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror and the very real threat of Iran's nuclear breakout. That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons. These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear programme. The flaws in the deal also include insufficient enforcement and near total silence on Iran's missile programmes. Congress has already begun the work to address these problems. Key House and Senate leaders are drafting legislation that would amend the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act to strengthen enforcement, prevent Iran from developing an inter - this is so totally important - an intercontinental ballistic missile, and make all restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under US law. So important. I support these initiatives. However, in the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. It is under continuous review, and our participation can be cancelled by me, as president, at any time. As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we ignore a threat, the worse that threat becomes. It is why we are determined that the world's leading sponsor of terrorism will never obtain nuclear weapons. In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's longest-suffering victims: its own people. The citizens of Iran have paid a heavy price for the violence and extremism of their leaders. The Iranian people long to - and they just are longing, to reclaim their country's proud history, its culture, its civilization, its cooperation with its neighbours. We hope that these new measures directed at the Iranian dictatorship will compel the government to re-evaluate its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people. We hope that our actions today will help bring about a future of peace, stability and prosperity in the Middle East - a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own citizens. We pray for a future where young children - American and Iranian, Muslim, Christian and Jewish - can grow up in a world free from violence, hatred and terror. And, until that blessed day comes, we will do what we must to keep America safe. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you."
Spread to US Treasury,Six climate questions for 'Green GB',2024-09-25,2018-10-11,By Roger Harrabin,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-45827068,"Scientists say we must keep global temperature rise under 1.5C - so what does that mean for the UK? Next week, ministers are likely to ask their advisers how Britain can reduce carbon emissions in line with that target. They’ve declared what they're calling Green GB Week – a celebration of the UK’s achievement as a world leader in tackling climate change whilst increasing the economy. But will they make the huge carbon cuts still needed on these six key issues?   Overall, the UK’s CO2 emissions have been falling, but transport emissions have gone UP by 4%. People are buying bigger cars after the Treasury removed the fuel duty incentive for low-pollution hybrids. Drivers have also turned away from diesel vehicles, which create fewer greenhouse gases but emit more local pollution.  The government’s advisory Committee on Climate Change says sales of electric cars and installation of charging points are both too slow. Meanwhile, campaigners say the decision to help people fly more often by expanding Heathrow shows ministers haven’t grasped the scale of the climate challenge.  Our ageing housing stock leaks heat, and we can’t meet carbon emissions targets unless we insulate homes better. But home insulation has plunged by 95% because insulation grants have been cut.  Labour pledges to create 160,000 jobs in making homes energy efficient - but the Treasury doesn’t want to pay householders to improve their homes. The government also scrapped a plan for zero-carbon homes – that’s homes which create as much energy as they use. Heat for industry is a huge issue too. Ministers have been criticised for glacial progress in promoting technology that can capture CO2 emissions from industrial heating. The government is pushing to exploit shale gas by the controversial technique of fracking. They say it’s good for jobs and balance of payments.  Greens ask why we are seeking more gas when burning the fossil fuels we’ve already found would wreck the climate. Meanwhile, ministers want to expand nuclear power to keep a spread of options – even though wind power is far cheaper.  The government has also virtually banned the cheapest potential source of energy – onshore wind. If food and plant matter is dumped in landfill, it will rot and create methane, which contributes to climate change.  Many councils are now separating food and garden waste so firms can harness the methane as useful biogas. But after a good start, emissions have been rising.  There’s confusion and inconsistency between local councils over the best ways to deal with waste.  Farming is a major source of greenhouse gases. Fertilisers and manure emit greenhouse gases, and farm machines pollute, too. Emissions from farms have barely reduced. Scientists also say we need more woods and trees to soak up the CO2 we produce. They also want more energy crops grown to substitute for oil in powering vehicles. And they want us all to eat less meat – especially beef – because plant-based foods create fewer emissions.  We’re going to need new technologies to help us use energy differently. Online systems can save individuals wasting energy, and enable us to buy power more cheaply.  We also need to store much more of the electricity generated when the wind’s blowing strongly or the sun is bright. And we must strengthen local electricity networks to cope with the power created by local solar and wind energy. Attempts are also being made to harness hydrogen as a fuel source for trucks, buses and homes, but progress is very slow. It’s all a mighty challenge, made harder by the up-front cost of innovation. How green will Green UK week really be? Follow Roger on Twitter."
Spread to US Treasury,"Covid grants not enough, hospitality firms say",2024-09-25,2021-12-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-59756313,"Businesses in the hospitality industry hit by customers' renewed concerns over Covid have said a new weekly grant of up to £6,000 is not enough. Earlier this week, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a £1bn fund allowing firms to apply for a cash injection. But a pub owner in North Lincolnshire said his firm was losing ""a lot more"" than £6,000 each week.  Meanwhile, other food businesses have called for ""clarity"" and for the furlough scheme to be reinstated. Many hospitality and leisure firms have been hit by a collapse in bookings and reduced footfall due to people's fears over the spread of the Omicron variant. Owners of restaurants, bars, cinemas and theatres can apply for a cash grant of up to £6,000 every week for each of their premises, Mr Sunak said on Tuesday. Slawek Mikolajczyk, owner of The Hope and Anchor Pub in South Ferriby, said ""any help"" was welcome, however he asked: ""It's £6,000. How far is that going to go?"" ""We'll see, but we are losing a lot more than that in one week. So it's appreciated, but I think they should do a lot more...Definitely it doesn't go far enough,"" he said. Mr Mikolajczyk added that his pub had suffered ""up to 60%"" of booking cancellations in the past year and the grant would ""probably cover some of the cancellations for this week and that's it."" ""We thought we were going to be open as normal, so we employed a few more staff just to be ready. Unfortunately, customers are scared so they're just cancelling and there's not much we can do apart from asking customers to buy a voucher to see us next year,"" he said. Crystal Marinas, who runs The Black Horse pub near Spalding, Lincolnshire, said she was concerned the family firm would not get the full £6,000 of aid because the rateable value of the small business was under £15,000. ""It feels a bit like a plaster, when actually right now we could do with a bandage and a great big hug,"" she said. ""The trade isn't there. We've spent a lot of money getting it ready, then the cancellations come in and we haven't had the turnover."" Echoing Mr Mikolajczyk, Ms Marinas said she also had monthly running costs far exceeding the £6,000 funding. ""We've already got huge bills now that need paying but we don't know how we're going to pay them. When we don't get the bums on seats it's truly heart-breaking. ""Of course, anything is better than nothing - but we don't know how long we've got to make that [grant] last."" Meanwhile, food businesses in Leeds said there was mixed government messaging, with one calling for ""clarity and a clear plan"". Valerie Kolat, who runs the Dapur Malaysia restaurant in Chapel Allerton, said: ""Good they have stepped up to help, but really disappointed with the way it's being handled. The lack of clarity and the never-ending leaks is quite torturous.""  She added her restaurant had seen ""just six months of 'normal' trading"" since it opened in August 2019. Street food vendor Jamie Ooi, who owns Little Bao Boy in Leeds, called for the furlough scheme to be ""reinstated to fully support us"".  ""The up-to-£6,000 doesn't cover half my wages and 12.5% VAT of zero sales is still zero,"" said Mr Ooi. He said the government needed to convey ""a clear plan so we business owners are also able to plan"". The Treasury has been approached for a comment."
Spread to US Treasury,The week of economic contagion,2024-09-25,2020-03-14,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-51888442,"There are health fears, of course, and concerns about care for the old, the young and the unwell. We're all gaining expertise in epidemiology. There is disruption to the way we work, with many people preparing for a move from the office to the kitchen table. Companies should by now have their business continuity plans in place, to cope with disruption of supplies and widespread sick leave taken by staff. As ever, the markets - as if they had rational brains and personalities - like to think they get there first. And this week saw them plunged into an immense tizz, as analysts and traders realised the implications of the Covid-19 or coronavirus outbreak wreaking economic havoc throughout the world's two biggest market economies - Europe and North America. No-one is immune: actor Tom Hanks, the Canadian premier's wife, Sophie Trudeau and the chief executive of BT tested positive. The jet-set lifestyle may itself create higher risk of infection, with a fast-revolving door of visitors. Nowhere is immune either, even if President Trump believes this is a ""foreign virus"", blocking the entry of Europeans, while India shuts its doors to visitors. Three people at a dinner the president attended with visiting Brazilians on 7 March have since tested positive. A terrifying new wave awaits as countries such as India and in Africa, with the least equipped or resilient health systems, try to delay the virus's spread from China, Iran, the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic countries. So what do the markets tell us about the way ahead? The main London index had two of its biggest one-day falls during the past week, on Thursday down by 11%. The FTSE100 has fallen 30% in only a month. That index reflects international business conditions. The more British-oriented FTSE 250 has fallen 29%. That scale of decline was in line with other share indices in Europe and the US. They tanked on Monday, after the crisis was compounded by a falling-out between oil exporters. Russia refused last Friday to join with others in a proposed cut in supply, intended to match the virus-driven cut in demand. So Saudis launched an all-out price war two days later, pushing the price down to the mid-30 dollar range, where it has bounced around for the rest of the week. There's a fierce battle for market share, and a challenge from these big exporters as to who can absorb the most pain. At the start of the year, a barrel of Brent crude sold for $69: a month ago, it was over $60. So down by half, that's good news for buyers of fuel: bad for the firms and regions, including north-east Scotland, that rely on a stable and higher price to keep the investment flowing. It's also bad news for the environment, as one important way to discourage the burning of oil is for the price to be high. Stock markets rallied, helped a bit by the Budget splurge at Westminster, and then a double whammy on Thursday - responding to an address by President Trump. He intended to reassure the public and markets, but this was inept even by his standards. It backfired spectacularly - an address that will live in infamy, ""the most expensive speech in history"". Less high-profile, Christine Lagarde, the new boss at the European Central Bank, chose her words carelessly, and spooked European investors. In one day, Wall Street was down 10%. A pan-Europe index was down 12.5%. In Madrid, the fall was 14%. For London and European financial centres, helped by additional liquidity pumped into the market by central banks, Friday saw a steadying of the fall. After European markets closed, President Trump tried again - this time with $50 billion in national emergency funding, and Wall Street responded positively. So what was going on? Share prices, fundamentally, reflect the expectation of future profit from that company. They also fluctuate in terms of confidence about the economy in general. And however well informed by data and analysis, investors also tend to follow the herd. To some extent, they reflect the relative attraction of other assets.  So while cash has earned so little interest, and government bond yields have been low, there's more of an incentive to put money into shares - all the moreso while others are doing so. This week, after an 11-year rise, the herd stampeded in the other direction.  The fundamental fears about future profit, or the very survival of firms, was a driving factor. Airlines look like they face a horrific year, as business travel is axed ferociously, leisure travellers take fright, their insurers remove cover for travel disruption, and governments impose bans. That feeds through to the many supply firms that feed off airports; Swissport and John Menzies ground handlers in British airports are cutting jobs following the collapse of Flybe: Edinburgh Airport has warned that there may be a number of months this year when it has zero, or near-zero, passengers: lower footfall in the departure lounge is hitting profits at WH Smith shops. The Budget on Wednesday at Westminster, which seems distant only three days later, had big gestures for small firms (they're still to be translated at Holyrood into tax relief and grants in Scotland, with some consternation that there was more detail about the sums available from the Treasury in my last blog than there was for Scottish ministers). However, the Budget did nothing much for the aviation sector, and it's complaining loudly. The cruise liner business is being savaged by the bad publicity, with some suspending operations for at least two months. That will hit Miami and the Caribbean particularly hard, but spare a thought for the many businesses in Lerwick, Invergordon and Greenock which have grown up around that traffic. Shares in those supplying healthcare and groceries are less affected. It is the broader leisure and hospitality sector that is joining travel in the danger zone. Restaurants and bars are emptying, and may not see sustainable levels of custom return for several months. Hotels and guest houses are seeing bookings cancelled. The potential upside later this year could be a big surge in UK staycations. But where people gather in numbers, there's trouble ahead. Football clubs face dire financial straits without the 43% of income that comes in through the turnstiles. The spring and summer economy was intended to blossom from now, with festivals and concerts, but cancellations are going to hit these catering and hospitality firms that depend on them. Yesterday, we got Glasgow's Aye Write book festival cancelled because authors didn't want to travel to it: big, money-spinning concerts at the city's SSE Hydro arena have been cancelled - this weekend the Country to Country music festival, later this month The Who and Santana: BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend was scheduled for Dundee in May, but no longer. Edinburgh can merely hope that the worst will be over by August. And while Roger Daltrey won't be on his uppers with The Who's tour cancelled, think of the number of people with occasional, insecure work in the hi-viz vests around these events, marshalling or pulling pints. Many are students. And students are being told to go home, sucking their spending power out of the diverse business districts that grow up around universities. So what happened as investors rushed to sell shares this week? One destination for that money at times like these would normally be secure government bonds, and there's none more secure than America's. But that market is also in a lot of trouble. Over recent weeks, the demand for Treasury bonds pushed prices up and the yield (therefore, automatically) down, to historic lows. In the past week, the market was struggling with lack of liquidity. There weren't enough buyers. Why? One theory is that traders have been told to work from home. They're now sitting on the sofa in their ""leezhure pant"", and don't have the psychological energy of the trading floors to fire up their risk-taking synapses. Such asset flows also affect currency rates. They have been less dramatic over the past few days, but over time, sterling has been weakening. Against the euro, it's lost 8% of its value since a mid-February peak, and a pound now buys €1.11.  Against the US dollar, it dropped 6% in the past week, or 8 cents, to reach $1.23. Sterling had perked up over winter months, when a no-deal Brexit was taken off the table for 2020. But it's not off the table for the start of 2021, and the flight for safety may also reflect that prospect. This week saw the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, tell the 27 capitals what a deal might look like, though with important details left blank. It left little doubt that fisheries remains a big problem in these talks. If annual negotiations on fishery quotas can't be agreed, the European side is asserting a right to continue past entitlements. With government bandwidth absorbed by the virus crisis, there's a risk that Whitehall's previous all-consuming focus on Brexit risks being ignored. The economic risks from it played a very small role in Rishi Sunak's first Budget, though for that and virus reasons, he may be back during financial year 2020-21 with significant budget adjustments. A second round of Brexit talks between negotiating teams of around 100 were due in London in the coming week, and Brussels a fortnight after that. But they've been cancelled, and the two sides are looking to the possibility of video-negotiating.  I'm no negotiating expert, but I fear Skype is better suited to keeping in touch with your granny in her care home than to getting Brexit talks to a happy ending."
Spread to US Treasury,"Nearly 16,000 virus cases missed after IT error",2024-09-25,2020-10-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54412581,"A technical glitch that meant nearly 16,000 cases of coronavirus went unreported has delayed efforts to trace contacts of people who tested positive. Public Health England said 15,841 cases between 25 September and 2 October were left out of the UK daily case figures. They were then added in to reach Saturday's figure of 12,872 new cases and Sunday's 22,961 figure. PHE said all those who tested positive had been informed. But it means others in close contact with them were not. The issue has been resolved, PHE said, with outstanding cases passed on to tracers by 01:00 BST on Saturday.  The technical issue also means that the daily case totals reported on the government's coronavirus dashboard over the past week have been lower than the true number. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said daily figures for the end of the week were ""actually nearer 11,000"", rather than the about 7,000 reported. Labour has described the glitch as ""shambolic"".  The BBC has been told by senior public health officials in the north-west of England that a significant proportion of the unreported cases are from the area. Cities such as Liverpool and Manchester already have among the highest infection rates in the country, at about 10 times the national average. BBC analysis found the number of cases reported for the week to 1 October increased by 92.6% in the north west after taking in the missing tests - with similar rises reflected across England. The increase is mostly down to the missing tests, but the figures also included some results which came back after 2 October. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the cases data had been ""truncated"" and ""lost"", but added all people who had tested positive had been contacted and the tracers were ""now working through all the contacts"". Meanwhile, the head of the government's vaccine taskforce, Kate Bingham, has told the Financial Times that less than half of the UK population could be vaccinated against coronavirus. ""There is going to be no vaccination of people under 18,"" she said. ""It's an adult-only vaccine for people over 50, focusing on health workers, care home workers and the vulnerable."" Mr Johnson has warned it could be ""bumpy through to Christmas"" and beyond as the UK deals with coronavirus. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday, the PM said there was ""hope"" of beating Covid, and called on the public to ""act fearlessly but with common sense"". In an interview with the Sun, Rishi Sunak has defended his Eat Out to Help Out scheme, saying he had ""no regrets"", after suggestions it may have helped fuel the second wave of coronavirus cases. At a time when the testing system has come under intense scrutiny after reports of delays and a system struggling to keep up with demand, the latest revelation could not have come at a more awkward moment for the government at Westminster.  Because the nearly 16,000 extra positive test results had been not entered into the test and trace system, their recent contacts were not immediately followed up.  Experts advise that ideally contacts should be tracked down within 48 hours.  Officials say the technical problem - thought to be IT related - has been resolved, with all the new cases added into totals reported over the weekend.  But all this will hardly improve public confidence in the testing system in England.  And it muddies the waters for policy makers and officials trying to track the spread of the virus at what the prime minister has called a ""critical moment"".  On Sunday, the government's coronavirus dashboard said that, as of 09:00 BST, there had been a further 22,961 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 502,978. Another 33 people were reported to have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Sunday.  Public Health England's interim chief executive Michael Brodie said a ""technical issue"" was identified overnight on Friday, 2 October in the process that transfers Covid-19 positive lab results into reporting dashboards. He said the majority of the unreported cases had occurred in the ""most recent days"".  It was caused by some data files reporting positive test results exceeding the maximum file size. Mr Brodie said they worked with NHS Test and Trace to ""quickly resolve the issue and transferred all outstanding cases immediately into the NHS Test and Trace contact tracing system"". ""We fully understand the concern this may cause and further robust measures have been put in place as a result,"" he said. Test and Trace and Public Health England joint medical adviser Susan Hopkins said a thorough risk assessment had been undertaken ""to ensure outstanding cases were prioritised for contact tracing effectively"". PHE said NHS Test and Trace have made sure there are enough contact tracers working, and are working with local teams to ensure they also have sufficient resources to be urgently able to contact all cases. The number of call attempts is being increased from 10 to 15 over 96 hours. There have been clear problems with the government's Test and Trace data, but they do not change our view of the UK's trajectory. Cases surged at the beginning of September, they may still be climbing, but not as quickly as anticipated just a few weeks ago. This perspective comes from three key sets of data - the Office for National Statistics, the React study by Imperial College London and the Covid symptom tracker app.  None are blighted by either the current issues with the Test and Trace data or by people struggling to access a test.  The real fallout of the weekend's statistical chaos is not the numbers, but the people who should have been contact-traced, told to quarantine and instead may have been unwittingly passing on the virus. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""This is shambolic and people across the country will be understandably alarmed."" He called for Health Secretary Matt Hancock to explain ""what on earth has happened"" and what he plans to do to fix test and trace.  Mr Hancock is due to update MPs about coronavirus on Monday afternoon. Bridget Phillipson, shadow chief secretary to the treasury, told BBC Breakfast she wanted to know whether it had had ""any impact on government decision making around local restrictions"".  PHE data shows Manchester now has the highest rate of infection in England, at 495.6 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 1 October, from 223.2 the week before. Liverpool has the second highest rate, up to 456.4 from 287.1 per 100,000. Knowsley in Merseyside, Newcastle, Nottingham, Leeds and Sheffield have also seen sharp rises. News of the glitch in the daily count first emerged late on Saturday, when the UK announced more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases for the first time since mass testing began.  The government said the technical issue meant some cases during the week were not recorded at the time, so were included in Saturday's data. The daily total rose from 4,044 on Monday to a then-high of 7,143 on Tuesday. However, over the next four days the daily total remained stable at a time when continued increases might have been expected. Then came the big leap in numbers - a far bigger day-on-day increase than at any time in the entire pandemic - which was announced on Saturday, five hours later than usual, and was accompanied by the government explanation.

Spread to US Treasury,Why Trump wants US open for business despite pandemic,2024-09-25,2020-03-23,By Anthony Zurcher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52009108,"As a growing number of states issue ""shelter in place"" orders, businesses shutter and Americans everywhere are told to limit outings and practise social distancing, Donald Trump may be having second thoughts. For more than a week, Trump administration officials and state leaders have been talking of the need to ""bend the curve"" of the coronavirus outbreak, limiting the spread of the illness to prevent the American healthcare system from being overwhelmed. The steep economic toll, however, is becoming increasingly apparent. Last week Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin predicted that US unemployment could reach 20%. On Thursday the Treasury Department will release last week's new jobless claims, and the numbers are sure to be in the millions. A Goldman Sachs report estimated that the nation's gross domestic product in the second quarter could shrink by 24%, dwarfing the previous 10% record decline in 1958. But at Monday's White House coronavirus news conference, the president said: ""America will again and soon be open for business."" In the late hours of Sunday night, Trump had vented his concerns. ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,"" he tweeted, using the all-caps he reserves for matters of apparent urgency. ""AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!"" The 15-day period the president referenced began on 16 March, when the White House announced new Centers for Disease Control guidelines encouraging all Americans to work from home when possible and limit gatherings of more than 10 people. As is often the case, the president's tweet may have been prompted by watching a segment on Fox News. On Sunday evening, host (and former advisor to then-British PM David Cameron) Steve Hilton warned that an economic collapse would itself result in avoidable deaths and other hardships - that the ""cure"" could be worse than the ""disease"". ""Our ruling class and their TV mouthpieces whipping up fear over this virus, they can afford an indefinite shutdown,"" Hilton said. ""Working Americans can't. They'll be crushed by it."" Trump's faithful may be inching back to the view they held a few weeks ago, that the virus is being used by the president's political enemies to damage his political standing by damaging the economy. On Monday morning the president continued on this theme, with a flurry of retweets of accounts (some with only a few hundred followers) who were calling for Americans to be allowed to return to work after the 15-day period ended. Former top Trump economic advisor Gary Cohn also joined the chorus, albeit somewhat obliquely. ""Is it time to start discussing the need for a date when the economy can turn back on?"" he asked on Twitter. ""Policymakers have taken bold public health and economic actions to address the coronavirus, but businesses need clarity. Otherwise they will assume the worst and make decisions to survive."" This conclusion among conservatives is not universal, however. On Sunday Steve Bannon, a former senior Trump campaign and White House staffer who has repeatedly fallen in and out of favour with the president, advocated for a ""hammer"" style imposition of rigorous separation. ""Drop the hammer, don't mitigate the virus, don't spread the curve, shatter the curve,"" he said during a Fox News morning interview. ""Go full hammer on the virus right now with a full shutdown, use the stimulus to bridge the economic crisis."" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who frequently has the president's ear, issued his own warning, garnished with a bit of praise. ""President Trump's best decision was stopping travel from China early on,"" he writes. ""I hope we will not undercut that decision by suggesting we back off aggressive containment policies within the United States."" Graham somewhat misrepresented the administration's 31 January order that only limited entry by non-US-resident foreign nationals who had been in China in the previous two weeks, but the move has been touted by the president as evidence that he acted early to deal with the spread of the virus. Meanwhile, others in the Trump administration continue to stress the need for rigorous social distancing - which suggests that there could be growing divisions between medical professionals in the administration and those whose focus on the economic impact. On Monday morning, for instance, Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned that the worst was yet to come. ""I want America to understand, this week, it's going to get bad,"" he said in a television interview. ""And right now there are not enough people out there who are taking this seriously."" Any move by the administration to ease guidelines could also set up a clash with state governors, a growing number of whom are moving toward greater, not lesser, restrictions on movement and gatherings. One of the much-touted strengths of the US federalist system of government is it allows states - the so-called ""laboratories of democracy"" - freedom to devise their own policies and solutions to pressing political concerns. That system has never been tested quite like this, however, as some governors warn of the risks of a patchwork response to a national health crisis   The president underlined this potential for conflict in a tweet on Sunday afternoon swiping at Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who had earlier criticised the administration's coronavirus response. @JBPritzker, Governor of Illinois, and a very small group of certain other Governors, together with Fake News @CNN & Concast (MSDNC), shouldn't be blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings,"" he wrote. ""We are there to back you up should you fail, and always will be!"" The president, it appears, is being pulled in multiple directions and, as he often does, is airing his internal dialogue on Twitter.  At his press conference on Monday, he seemed to be tilting away from his medical advisers. ""If it were up to the doctors, they may say let's keep it shut down - let's shut down the entire world,"" he said.  ""You can't do that with a country - especially the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world."" He has described himself as a ""wartime president"" doing battle against the spread of this virus, but he's also spent much of the past year building a November re-election campaign around the claim that he has presided over record economic growth and low unemployment - both of which seem to be evaporating. And not only is Trump looking at this as a president whose re-election could hinge on an economic rebound, he is also a businessman watching his life's work - his empire of resorts, hotels and golf courses, some of which were reportedly already in financial trouble - face an existential crisis. ""At a certain point, we have to get open and have to get moving,"" Trump said on Monday, referring to the US economy.  ""We don't want to lose these companies, we don't want to lose these workers, we want to take care of our workers, so we'll be doing something I think relatively quickly."" The three-plus years of Trump's administration have already had enough turmoil and drama - much of it self-created - to fill an entire two terms.  The coronavirus outbreak is a presidency-defining crisis, however - one that, barring the kind of miracle treatment Trump has at times hoped for, appears to offer options that range from bad to worse."
Spread to US Treasury,"PM's growth deal cash is thin stuff, Labour says",2024-09-25,2019-07-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-49151863,"Boris Johnson's promise that mid Wales will benefit from a £300m funding boost for the devolved nations is ""very thin stuff"", Welsh Labour says. The new prime minister announced cash on Monday for three growth deals in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and one in Wales. It is not yet decided how much of the £300m will go to Wales. The UK government said the allocation of the money would depend on the strength of proposals put forward. Growth deals are government funding packages aimed at boosting regional economies, using money from different sources including private investment to be spent on specific projects. Cardiff and Swansea Bay are at the centre of growth deals already in place while another is being negotiated for north Wales. The Mid Wales Growth Deal, which covers Powys and Ceredigion, will get a proportion of the £300m cash, which will be spread out over 15 years.  It promises a potential of 4,000 new jobs boosting the mid Wales economy by £200m a year. Transport, broadband and connectivity are expected to be at the heart of proposals likely to emerge in the autumn. Mr Johnson visited Faslane naval base in Scotland on Monday, with a visit to Wales planned for later this week. He called for a renewal of ""the ties that bind our United Kingdom"". ""Our union is the most successful political and economic union in history. We are a global brand, and together we are safer, stronger and more prosperous,"" he said ahead of the visit to Scotland. On the matter of funding for mid Wales, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: ""I am keen for us all to be as ambitious as possible in driving forward the development of projects, so that they can deliver enduring benefits to businesses and people."" However, Welsh Labour accused the UK government of having made ""swingeing cuts"" to the Welsh Government's budget over the last ten years. A spokesman said that set against a ""chronic lack of investment"" from the UK government in major infrastructure projects, the new funding offer was "" very thin stuff"". He added: ""Instead of vague promises and half-baked announcements lacking in detail we need concrete action from the UK government to end the punishing austerity the Tories have imposed on our economy and our public services over the last decade."" A UK government spokeswoman said in response: ""Today's announcement is about expanding the growth deals programme to areas of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland which are yet to benefit from this significant investment. ""This includes additional funding for the Mid Wales Growth Deal where we have a longstanding commitment, having announced starting negotiations at Autumn Budget in 2017.  ""All deals involve negotiation and the funding total for mid Wales will be based on the strength and ambition of proposals put forward by local partners."" Analysis -  Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent The Mid Wales Growth deal is at a very early stage. The expectation is that in return for the money from the UK Treasury, the projects chosen will be expected to deliver an increase in the strength of the local economy in terms of productivity or Gross Value Added. That's in contrast to funding being awarded purely because of need.  It is far from clear who would decide what the money would be spent on, nor is it known whether that would be determined in Westminster or Cardiff. However, projects chosen for funding will have to be innovative and have a wider impact, rather than being spent directly to ease deprived communities. Workers in Powys have the lowest rate of productivity per hour of any local authority area in the UK.  The Growing Mid Wales Partnership has already held workshops, gathering ideas for a growth deal. Along with better communications, some of the ideas have been about new developments in green energy, new agricultural techniques - such as ""vertical farming"" to get more produce per acre - and local sourcing of food for tourism.  The aim is to create high-skilled, well-paid jobs that will also keep young people in the area and attract others."
Spread to US Treasury,Six climate questions for 'Green GB',2024-09-25,2018-10-11,By Roger Harrabin,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-45827068,"Scientists say we must keep global temperature rise under 1.5C - so what does that mean for the UK? Next week, ministers are likely to ask their advisers how Britain can reduce carbon emissions in line with that target. They’ve declared what they're calling Green GB Week – a celebration of the UK’s achievement as a world leader in tackling climate change whilst increasing the economy. But will they make the huge carbon cuts still needed on these six key issues?   Overall, the UK’s CO2 emissions have been falling, but transport emissions have gone UP by 4%. People are buying bigger cars after the Treasury removed the fuel duty incentive for low-pollution hybrids. Drivers have also turned away from diesel vehicles, which create fewer greenhouse gases but emit more local pollution.  The government’s advisory Committee on Climate Change says sales of electric cars and installation of charging points are both too slow. Meanwhile, campaigners say the decision to help people fly more often by expanding Heathrow shows ministers haven’t grasped the scale of the climate challenge.  Our ageing housing stock leaks heat, and we can’t meet carbon emissions targets unless we insulate homes better. But home insulation has plunged by 95% because insulation grants have been cut.  Labour pledges to create 160,000 jobs in making homes energy efficient - but the Treasury doesn’t want to pay householders to improve their homes. The government also scrapped a plan for zero-carbon homes – that’s homes which create as much energy as they use. Heat for industry is a huge issue too. Ministers have been criticised for glacial progress in promoting technology that can capture CO2 emissions from industrial heating. The government is pushing to exploit shale gas by the controversial technique of fracking. They say it’s good for jobs and balance of payments.  Greens ask why we are seeking more gas when burning the fossil fuels we’ve already found would wreck the climate. Meanwhile, ministers want to expand nuclear power to keep a spread of options – even though wind power is far cheaper.  The government has also virtually banned the cheapest potential source of energy – onshore wind. If food and plant matter is dumped in landfill, it will rot and create methane, which contributes to climate change.  Many councils are now separating food and garden waste so firms can harness the methane as useful biogas. But after a good start, emissions have been rising.  There’s confusion and inconsistency between local councils over the best ways to deal with waste.  Farming is a major source of greenhouse gases. Fertilisers and manure emit greenhouse gases, and farm machines pollute, too. Emissions from farms have barely reduced. Scientists also say we need more woods and trees to soak up the CO2 we produce. They also want more energy crops grown to substitute for oil in powering vehicles. And they want us all to eat less meat – especially beef – because plant-based foods create fewer emissions.  We’re going to need new technologies to help us use energy differently. Online systems can save individuals wasting energy, and enable us to buy power more cheaply.  We also need to store much more of the electricity generated when the wind’s blowing strongly or the sun is bright. And we must strengthen local electricity networks to cope with the power created by local solar and wind energy. Attempts are also being made to harness hydrogen as a fuel source for trucks, buses and homes, but progress is very slow. It’s all a mighty challenge, made harder by the up-front cost of innovation. How green will Green UK week really be? Follow Roger on Twitter."
Spread to US Treasury,Government announces anti-fake news unit,2024-09-25,2018-01-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42791218,"The UK government is to establish a new unit to counter ""fake news"", Downing Street has said. Theresa May's spokesman said the ""dedicated national security communications unit"" would be charged with ""combating disinformation by state actors and others"". ""We are living in an era of fake news and competing narratives,"" he said. The phrase ""fake news"" has recently emerged and is frequently used by US President Donald Trump. Completely false information, photos or videos purposefully created and spread to confuse or misinform Information, photos or videos manipulated to deceive - or old photographs shared as new Satire or parody which means no harm but can fool people A committee of MPs is currently carrying out an inquiry into the ""growing phenomenon"" and has demanded information from Facebook and Twitter including on Russian activity during the EU referendum. Downing Street told political reporters: ""The government will respond with more and better use of national security communications to tackle these interconnected complex challenges. ""We will build on existing capabilities by creating a dedicated national security communications unit. This will be tasked with combating disinformation by state actors and others. It will more systematically deter our adversaries and help us deliver on national security priorities."" Last month the BBC launched a new scheme to help young people identify real news and filter out fake or false information. The new fake news unit was agreed at a meeting of the National Security Council (NSC). The NSC had also commissioned a defence spending review ""to deliver better military capability and value for money in a sustainable and affordable way"", Downing Street said. There have been repeated warnings about cuts to the armed forces, with the Ministry of Defence looking for savings of £2bn. The latest review, called the Modernising Defence Programme, will be led by the MoD, rather than the NSC, which BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale described as a ""small but significant victory"" for Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. The NSC had been carrying out a ""capabilities review"" expected to push through more defence cuts, our correspondent said. And handing responsibility to the MoD would give it the chance to argue for more money from the Treasury and more control over the process."

Spread to US Treasury,New year firebreak lockdown 'cannot be ruled out',2024-09-25,2020-10-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-54614002,"Welsh ministers say they cannot rule out imposing another firebreak lockdown early in 2021 if Covid-19 starts spreading quickly again at Christmas. Economy Minister Ken Skates urged people to stick to the rules during Wales' two-week lockdown from Friday. Scientific advisers say it is possible the reproduction (R) rate could drop from 1.4 to 0.8 over that period. However, the impact of the firebreak will not be known until some time after the lockdown has ended. The R rate is the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus to, on average. Mr Skates told the Welsh Government's coronavirus news briefing on Tuesday that lowering the R rate to that extent ""would, in itself, buy us enough time, give us the headroom, to get through to Christmas and the new year"". ""But of course we could not rule out the possibility of introducing another firebreak if over the Christmas period transmission rates increase dramatically,"" he said. A report by the Technical Advisory Cell (TAC), which advises Welsh ministers on coronavirus, estimates that a two to three-week lockdown ""should act to reduce R below 1"" but that ""multiple"" such lockdowns may be needed. ""Over a fortnight's 'break', two weeks of growth could be exchanged for two weeks of decay in transmission, assuming good adherence to measures, and no additional increase in contacts before or after the break,"" the paper says. ""If this were as strict and well-adhered to as the restrictions in late May, this could put the epidemic back by approximately 28 days or more.""  The report, published on Monday, adds that if rules and behaviour then returned to how they were before the firebreak ""there would be a return to exponential growth, but from a significantly lower level than would have been the case without the break"". But it also warns ""multiple"" firebreaks ""might be necessary to maintain low levels of incidence"" of the virus. A majority of Senedd politicians backed the firebreak lockdown in a vote on Tuesday evening - 37 for to 16 against. The vote's text included a call from Plaid Cymru - which won three amendments to the motion - for a strategy based on eliminating the virus. Conservative members were among those voting against the main motion. At the debate Tory Senedd group leader Paul Davies said the Welsh Tories had an ""open mind"", but that the Welsh Government had failed to justify its new measures. First Minister Mark Drakeford accused the Conservative Party in the Senedd of placing ""themselves in opposition to all the expert advice we have available to us"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said that the government ""has no option"" and that the lockdown should have been introduced earlier. But continual lockdowns were not an answer, he said, adding: ""We have to use this time to reflect on what's gone wrong and what can be put right."" Earlier, answering First Minister's Questions at the Senedd, Mr Drakeford said the current local lockdowns could not ""turn back the tide"" of Covid-19 quickly enough. Currently about 2.3 million people in Wales are living under local lockdown rules - 15 of the 22 council areas plus Bangor and Llanelli - where coronavirus infection rates are at their highest. Paul Davies said the Welsh Government should publish more local data to show how the disease is spreading on a ""community-to-community basis"".  But the first minister said a ""national effort"" was needed. ""It's very easy indeed to justify it [the firebreak] because while the efforts that have been made by people in those local lockdown areas are succeeding, they cannot succeed far and fast enough to turn back the tide of coronavirus as it is currently accelerating across Wales,"" he said. Mr Davies' comments came prior to the release of more detailed local information by Public Health Wales on Tuesday afternoon. Opening the debate, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said Covid-19 policies that will come into force after the firebreak will be set out ""in the coming days"". Local lockdowns, covering the vast majority of Wales's population, are likely to be replaced by a new national regime when the firebreak finishes. Monday's TAC report advises ministers to follow a ""new, simpler, national approach to behaviours and restrictions"". ""Simpler messaging and regulations are expected to be easier to understand and comply with,"" it says. ""Some existing restrictions may be removed if they are shown to be less effective or more harmful than originally expected, such as the local authority travel boundary restrictions [preventing people entering or leaving local lockdown areas without a reasonable excuse, such as for work].""  But the report warns that there would need to be ""sustainable changes in behaviour in many areas of life"" to keep the R number ""as near to one as possible"". ""Across the government we are now looking to work to agree arrangements that will be needed in the future to secure the gains made from the firebreak and we will set those out in the coming days,"" Mr Gething said. Ministers have relied on projections of a worst case scenario, prepared by Swansea University, which say there could be as many as 6,000 Covid-19 deaths in Wales by March."
Spread to US Treasury,Swann warns against 'rushed' decision on Covid tests,2024-09-25,2022-02-22,By Jayne McCormack,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-60471852,"Health Minister Robin Swann has said he will not be ""rushed"" into taking decisions on rules around the use of free mass testing in Northern Ireland. The government in England plans to bring it to an end from 1 April. The DUP MP Sammy Wilson said Northern Ireland should be following Number 10's lead, but Sinn Féin, Alliance and the SDLP have urged caution. In a tweet, Mr Swann said he would not base his decisions on ""timetables elsewhere"". ""I have asked officials to draw up policy options based on an appropriate, proportionate approach to testing in NI. In the meantime, there will be no changes to the current approach,"" he said. Mr Swann added that testing ""will continue to have a role, especially in protecting the most vulnerable"", and that further discussions on funding would be required with London and his Stormont ministerial colleagues. Speaking at Stormont on Tuesday, Finance Minister Conor Murphy said he wanted free testing to continue but it would come at a cost.  ""We have to make a decision do we try and provide our own supply and the cost of that, in a situation where we can't take budgetary decisions, where departments only have the baseline they have to spend into the new financial year because of the absence of the executive. ""That makes it infinitely more difficult.""  Northern Ireland's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said it would wrong for Northern Ireland to bring an end to free testing. Justice Minister Naomi Long said it was important that people are supported financially to test and self-isolate if required. However DUP MP Sammy Wilson said Northern Ireland should follow England's move. He described the recent strains of the virus as being similar to the impact of the common flu and that Northern Ireland should change test and trace procedures. ""We don't do that kind of extensive test and trace for common flu, we don't ask people to self-isolate immediately, we don't ask businesses to be disrupted as a result of that.  ""We ask people to engage in common sense. ""Test and trace was introduced at a time when we didn't have all of the means to combat Covid that we do today."" Ms Mallon said testing was ""an important means of controlling transmission"".  ""Now to be saying, particularly to low income families, that they will have to pay for that is deeply, deeply concerning,"" said the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) minister. The justice minister said whether it is Covid-19 or other conditions, people should ""not be going into the workplace ill and passing it on to colleagues who may be vulnerable or have vulnerable members of families"". ""But for people to make that choice, they have to be able to test, they have to know they're unwell and have financial support to let them self-isolate,"" said Mrs Long. From Thursday, people with a positive Covid-19 test in England no longer legally need to self-isolate and routine tracing will end. Remaining Covid restrictions are also being lifted in England, and free mass testing will stop from 1 April.  Dr David Farren, from the British Medical Association (BMA) in Northern Ireland, said free testing should remain and the government's decision could ""come back to bite us"".  ""Testing people and isolating them is the way you stop the bug from jumping from one person to another and effectively the prime minister has removed two very important protections in England with that move,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster on Tuesday. The infection control doctor said there could be ""further spread"" because people may not be able to afford tests or take time away from work. This risked creating a ""two-tier"" health system, he added, ""the like of which we haven't seen within our NHS"". Patricia McKeown, from the trade union Unison, said the pandemic had highlighted the importance of sick pay. But Roger Pollen, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said there was a need to ""learn to live with"" coronavirus and ending testing ""is a choice about how we spend taxpayers' money"". Meanwhile, the head of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, Patricia Donnelly, said mass vaccine centres will not be needed for the next roll-out of the Covid jab. Over the course of the pandemic, mass vaccination centres were set up across Northern Ireland to administer Covid-19 vaccines on larger scales at locations including the SSE Arena and the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast. Ms Donnelly also said health officials in Northern Ireland expect the roll-out to be extended to over-50s in autumn and ""are planning for it"". She said it had been expected there would be an annual vaccination programme, similar to how the flu vaccine is rolled out. Additional vaccines being made available for those aged 75 and over in 2022 could be facilitated by GPs, community pharmacies and health trusts, she said. About 155,000 people will be eligible for the booster jab, with the roll-out expected to begin in April. There must be a gap of at least six months since a previous dose.  Those eligible for the booster vaccine are: On Monday, Stormont ministers held talks with the UK government about future funding to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.  At the weekend, ministers from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales wrote a joint letter to Michael Gove expressing fears that funding for testing was about to be cut."
Spread to US Treasury,Covid fuels deepening education inequalities - MPs,2024-09-25,2022-03-11,By Branwen Jeffreys ,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-60683839,"The ""devastating"" impact of England's school closures during the pandemic is leading to greater inequality, MPs say.  A report by the Education Select Committee found Yorkshire and the Humber, and the North East are the worst-affected areas.  It warns the flagship National Tutoring Programme is falling far short of its targets this year.  The government said it aimed to ensure as many children as possible received high-quality catch-up tutoring.  The committee gathered evidence about how education in England is recovering after two years of disruption.  The report calls for the government to ""refocus"" its efforts on a ""fragmented and bureaucratic"" catch-up programme.   Primary maths is one of the subjects where there are shocking regional differences: the average learning loss was 0.5 months in the South West, 0.9 months in London, four months in the North East and 5.3 months in Yorkshire and the Humber.  At Greenhill Primary School in Sheffield, it has been one of the subjects where pupils have been offered extra teaching to recover lost ground.  Year 6 teacher Toni Whitehouse said there had been a ""massive impact"" from the classroom closure, and not just on learning.  ""We found children couldn't sit still, hold a discussion, collaborate with other children,"" she said. As well as covering new topics, teachers have had to reinstil some of the basics. ""Coming back from Covid, I've got children who can't use capital letters, full stops, the kind of skills we taught them when they were four or five."" Annabel, one of the Year 6 pupils, said booster classes with her teachers have really helped after the disruption.  ""I think it's helped with my arithmetic and reasoning. We didn't get to do much in lockdown. I lost quite a lot of confidence."" Nicola, also in Year 6, said despite extra help she is worried about going to secondary school.   ""My confidence with learning got a bit messed up - with a year-and-a-half of learning partly at home with your family around you."" The risk of failing to make up for the learning loss from the pandemic is rated as ""critical or very likely"" by the Department for Education itself in its annual report.  Robert Halfon, chairman of the Education Select Committee, thinks the damage could be long term ""This is incredibly serious, children have lost months of learning, disadvantaged children are between five to eight months behind in maths. ""We are damaging their life chances if we don't get this catch-up programme right."" He is also worried that if the almost £5bn committed so far isn't well spent, it could be hard to persuade the Treasury to give more funding to education.  Greenhill is part of a group of nine primary schools spread across Sheffield in very different parts of the city.  Chief executive Nicola Shipman says some schools have seen children more affected by the pandemic than others.  They tried using one part of the National Tutoring Programme, which is the main part of the government's catch-up programme, to get academic mentors for pupils. However, they found it wasn't easy to recruit enough good people. This year instead, like many schools, they have used their own staff to run extra sessions with some extra government funding, rather than using tutoring agencies through the national scheme.    Ms Shipman said: ""There needs to be a rethink, about how that money can be better spent by those of us who know our children better."" Schools can bid for funding from the National Tutoring Programme to organise extra tutoring themselves for disadvantaged pupils, or seek to be matched with tutoring agencies and academic mentors for pupils. This is via the private company Randstad, which won the contract.  However, MPs say it has only reached 52,000 courses so far  - just 10% of this year's target for tutoring courses.   They criticised the lack of transparency around the contract, and a decision to relax a target to reach mainly poorer pupils with tutoring.  Unless performance improves, the report calls for the contract with Randstad to be scrapped.  It adds the current ""spaghetti junction"" of confusing funding should be replaced by giving money directly to the schools and areas that need it most.  So far almost £5bn has been committed to education recovery in England. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Tutoring plays an integral role in supporting pupils to catch up on any lost learning, and delivery is on track to meet the ambitious target of teaching two million courses this academic year. ""We continue to work with Randstad to ensure as many children from all backgrounds - in particular those from disadvantaged backgrounds - across the country can benefit from high-quality tutoring and catch up on lost learning.""

Spread to US Treasury,"News Daily: Coronavirus plan, smart camera warning and Patel latest",2024-09-25,2020-03-03,By Victoria King,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51712892,"If you want to get this briefing by email, sign up here The head of the World Health Organization has warned the world is in ""uncharted territory"" when it comes to coronavirus, but it is still possible to contain it. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted: ""We can push this virus back."" He said every country must find its own ways to achieve that containment quickly and effectively.  The UK's plan will be published later, setting out legislation giving ministers greater powers to prepare for a widespread outbreak. There'll be a big press conference in Downing Street with Boris Johnson standing alongside the country's chief medical and scientific officers.  Under the plan, schools could be closed, big public events cancelled and routine operations postponed to reduce strain on the NHS. A major public health campaign will be rolled out, and a ""social distancing"" strategy could see unnecessary travel restricted. On Monday, the number of UK cases rose to 39. Ministers are expected to stress that the strictest measures are more likely to be used to curb local outbreaks than imposed nationwide. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says they want to be seen to be taking the disease seriously, but don't want panic or unnecessary disruption to people's lives. The government also wants to protect the economy, our correspondent adds, and as a result, the Treasury's first post-election Budget will prioritise coronavirus measures.

The National Cyber Security Centre is warning owners of smart cameras - like those used in video doorbells and baby monitors - that they can be watched by criminals over the internet by default. Security chiefs say easy to guess, pre-set passwords like ""admin"" or ""00000"" might let a hacker secretly observe a home. Owners should, therefore, change their passwords to something unguessable and take other steps like keeping the camera's software updated and switching off features that allow them to be checked remotely unless they're really needed. There are many examples of devices being accessed without permission. In one, the attacker spoke to a young girl, pretending to be Father Christmas.  BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera says some companies are making these devices cheap and fast to capture the new market - and security is often an afterthought, if it is thought about at all.

Spread to US Treasury,Minimum fine for Covid law breach to rise to £200,2024-09-25,2020-10-08,By Jayne McCormack,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-54455718,"People in Northern Ireland caught breaching coronavirus regulations will now face a minimum fine of £200 under plans agreed by the executive. Thursday's meeting saw ministers sign off on proposals brought by Justice Minister Naomi Long. At present, fixed penalty notices start at £60, but can rise to £960 for repeat offenders. First Minister Arlene Foster also confirmed that the use of mandatory face coverings in NI is to be extended. Face coverings are already compulsory on public transport and for customers in shops, but will now become mandatory in the following settings: The usual exemptions from wearing a face covering will still apply, the executive has said. Mrs Foster told a press briefing at Stormont that there would be a ""new regime"" of penalties to strengthen existing measures to try and curb the spread of Covid-19. ""The consequences from today will be more serious,"" she said. ""I'm saying to everyone - how far and how hard the executive will have to go depends on your actions today, tomorrow, over the weekend and the week ahead."" The executive has also agreed to introduce three new offences: not closing a business as required, breaching closing times and not implementing social distancing. Breaches will incur a fixed penalty notice of £1,000, or up to £10,000 on conviction. The justice minister told BBC News NI's The View that ""encouragement, engagement and explanation can work"". ""But we're also clear that enforcement matters,"" said Naomi Long. ""There will be those who defy the law, who refuse to take it seriously and enforcement has to follow. ""But that enforcement is going to be the last of the four options we have available to us."" A further 923 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported by the Department of Health on Thursday. In the last seven days, 4,674 people in Northern Ireland have tested positive. The department also confirmed the death of another person who died following a positive test, bringing its death toll to 587. There are 120 people with Covid-19 in hospital - 15 are in intensive care. Despite speculation, the executive has agreed not to impose new local restrictions in the Newry, Mourne and Down or Belfast council areas, where cases have been rising sharply in recent days. Mrs Foster said the executive had been advised that ""the growth of infections has been blunted"" in those areas, while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the executive was keeping that decision ""under review"". She added that the executive is ""united"" in its decision to ask for additional financial support from the British government to take further action to tackle the virus. ""It is clear the executive is fast approaching a point on making significant difficult decisions that will help us arrest the rise in infections,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said ministers would not take any decisions lightly, and that they would try to maintain the ""balanced approach"" regarding saving people's lives and their livelihoods.  She and Mrs Foster have asked for ""an urgent conversation"" with Mr Johnson due to cases rising ""at an alarming rate"". Earlier, Taoiseach (Irish PM) Micheál Martin and Prime Minister Boris Johnson expressed concerns about the situation in Northern Ireland. The two leaders spoke by phone on Thursday morning. Mr Martin said that he told Mr Johnson that the situation in Northern Ireland was ""very, very worrying in terms of the growing numbers"" of positive cases.  The taoiseach added that the Northern Ireland Executive ""needed support"" and he asked Mr Johnson to ""give consideration in terms of financial support to underpin any efforts or any restrictions that they themselves might decide to bring in"". According to an Irish government spokesperson, Mr Johnson also raised concerns about the impact of ""restrictions on the economy"".  The two leaders agreed to monitor the situation and remain in touch. On Wednesday, Northern Ireland Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young said of the coronavirus clusters identified, more than half of them had been linked to the hospitality sector.  Stormont ministers have not ruled out bringing in a circuit breaker over the half-term holidays, if localised restrictions do not help to halt the rise in infections. A circuit breaker is a lockdown for a short period of time, possibly two weeks, to slow the spread of the virus.  It would likely see all pubs and restaurants in Northern Ireland forced to close for the two weeks. But Economy Minister Diane Dodds said it would only be viable with additional financial support from Westminster. It is thought there could be further announcements next week from the Treasury about providing support to the hospitality industry in the worst hit areas of England, where pub closures are being explored.  That could automatically lead to some extra funding for Northern Ireland through what is known as a Barnett consequential. Meanwhile, figures obtained by BBC News NI show there are almost 1,200 health care staff off work as a result of coronavirus in Northern Ireland - either self-isolating or directly affected by the virus. The highest figure was recorded in the Western Trust area, which runs Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry, where 386 staff are isolating.  In Belfast, the figure is at least 384, while there is a further 193 staff affected at the Southern Trust, 117 in the South Eastern Trust and 116 at the Northern Trust. At the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS), 68 people are off work.  The interim chief executive of the South Eastern Health Trust, Seamus McGoran, said now is ""a critical time"" for the NHS and the public.  ""It feels rather like March, when we were not really in the foothills of the surge, but one third to half way up the mountain,"" he said. ""Unless we make dramatic changes to our behaviours within the community, we're going to be exactly where we were in about two to three weeks' time."""
Spread to US Treasury,No such thing as the internet,2024-09-25,2020-10-19,By Amol Rajan,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-54514574,"Six decades after the Advanced Research Projects Agency of America's Defence Department (ARPA) began funding research on time-sharing between computers, which led eventually to the revolutionary technology we call the internet, the time has come to drop the definite article.   Just as the claim that politicians are merely following ""the science"" when it comes to the pandemic is an attempt to create the illusion of consensus, so talk of ""the internet"" now refers to a phantom.  Today there is no such thing as the internet. There are internets - plural - with different, indeed rival, systems erupting in many places, but two dominant kingdoms: an American (OK, Californian) internet, and a Chinese one. The latter, being the product of the Communist Party, has a plan to win the future. The former, being a collection of disparate and competing companies, does not. After the splinternet Over the past year, I have been thinking and writing about the fact that one of the great questions societies need to ask themselves today is: What kind of internet do you want? As I mentioned in that earlier blog, the idea of a splinternet has emerged, and with it the claim that there are two other main internets aside from the Californian and Chinese ones: a libertarian free-for-all of the kind envisioned by an earlier generation of digital pioneers; and also a more regulated, European one. That makes four in total. Now I'm starting to think this idea of ""four kingdoms"" is also rather damaging, in a couple of ways.    First, it overlooks the fact that there are potentially - not yet, but potentially - as many internets as there are nation states with laws.  When, earlier this year, TikTok and 58 other Chinese-owned apps were banned in India, the world's largest democracy slipped into a category all of its own, and certainly not covered by those four kingdoms. India-without-TikTok wasn't a Californian, European, or libertarian internet. And neither, obviously, was it a Chinese one. It was an Indian internet. When, earlier this year, TikTok was banned in Indonesia, the ban only lasted for a few days, and was initially justified on different grounds from the ban in India.  India banned the Chinese apps mainly because of how they use data. Indonesia banned TikTok - though not many of the other apps banned by India - because they were thought to be blasphemous, and promote pornography, in the world's largest Islamic population.  It's not particularly useful to understand India or Indonesia's decision through the paradigm of the four kingdoms. These countries came to their own, unique decision for their own, unique reasons.  As more and more countries do this, it will be instructive to think not of one internet, but many internets, each with their own specifications attuned to local custom, practice and freedom of speech. This will help, for instance, businesses planning their operations in different territories. And it will help us all to grasp why people in different parts of the world have such wholly different responses to, and understandings of, the same event.  For instance, what if, in the maelstrom of the US presidential election, Beijing invades Taiwan?  This may not be as fanciful as you think. Should it happen, those in the West who are horrified need to remain very alert to the fact that, in China, citizens will be getting a very, very different version of events.  Which brings us to the second shortcoming of the splinternet theory of four kingdoms. It's true that, the internet is splitting into as many territories as there are nation states. Yet at the same time it is true that one paradigm matters much, much more than any other.  This is the age of the Tech Cold War. It is America v China.  All the stories you have seen this year about President Trump clamping down on TikTok (and demanding its sale to an American owner), or about Huawei, are best understood through this prism. America and China are vying for technological supremacy. Cyberspace is the battlefield.  When President Trump demanded that TikTok's US operations be sold to an American company, and that the US Treasury take a cut, there was a predictable outcry from those who saw this as an appalling incursion into the economic liberty which did so much to create American hegemony.  And yet, intriguingly, America's leader was merely borrowing from the Chinese playbook. In China, YouTube, WhatsApp and many other platforms are of course banned. The internet is policed, and is itself used as a policing surveillance tool by the Communist Party. Fans of democracy everywhere have to ask themselves: why shouldn't nation states demand control of the internet within their borders? And if there is a trade-off between economic liberty and national security, why should the former automatically win? China is one of those very, very rare subjects which commands bipartisan support in the US. A Biden administration would see technology as a foreign policy issue, and China as a tech policy challenge.  They may be encouraged in this, by the way, by Sir Nick Clegg of Facebook. Biden is one of the US politicians Sir Nick knows best, since they were both de facto deputy national leaders at the same time, have a similar political heritage, and used to talk regularly.  Through its extraordinary investment programmes in central Asia and Africa, China is already making a play for good favour from the people of those regions. Many of those people are among the three billion who still don't have access to the internet.  China has a plan to ensure that the internet they do have access to is a Chinese one: a highly-controlled digital service in which data is ultimately controlled by the Communist Party. If the US has a plan as coherent and well invested in, it's been remarkably quiet about that.  One of the many reasons democracies have made such a mess of regulating the internet, and have struggled to spread its benefits while reducing its harms, is the astonishing lack of basic knowledge among policy-makers.  Alerting them to the fact that there is no such thing as ""the internet"" any more, if ever there was, might give them a better chance of competing in the Tech Cold War that is upon us, and in which China has hitherto been more strategic.

Spread to US Treasury,"If McGregor wins, does he owe Man City?",2024-09-25,2017-08-25,Luke Reddy,https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/41046772,"McGregor is often accompanied to training by his closest friends and images of him are dotted around the Institute Floyd Mayweather v Conor McGregor  Date: Saturday, 26 August (local) Venue: T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas Coverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live, BBC Sport website and app from 04:00 BST; text updates online from 22:00 BST Fight replay: 06:00-10:00 BST on Sunday on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra If Conor McGregor beats Floyd Mayweather on Saturday night in Las Vegas, the boyhood Manchester United fan will perhaps owe a small debt of gratitude to Manchester City. For the past six weeks or so, he has driven his green Lamborghini to the UFC's new performance institute, external on a daily basis. At this hub, located about four miles from the city's famous strip, you can mimic conditions at 10,000ft of altitude, clock miles on an underwater treadmill, or analyse the density of specific muscles. If an athlete is to be built rather than born, this is the place. The attention to detail is stunningly intricate and it was Manchester City's own training complex which offered key elements of the blueprint. Schedule, BBC coverage and undercard Who is the real Conor McGregor? Podcast: Big fight preview with Costello and Bunce Fight is a circus - Crolla Amir Khan says Mayweather will knock McGregor out A group of journalists are led through the $14m development by Forrest Griffin, a retired UFC light-heavyweight champion and now a vice-president with focus on athlete development. He paints details around what we see at the 30,000 square feet facility, which opened in May. Some 23 years have passed since UFC was formed but this building is seen as a game changer which will take the welfare and performance of athletes to new levels. It is far removed from the spit and sawdust gyms which shaped some of boxing's greatest names. Some 24 hours earlier, I visited the Mayweather Boxing Gym, a world-renowned facility which inside is straightforward, humble and brilliantly effective. But the UFC institute cuts with tradition in pursuit of gains. Measurability, science and mapped progress shape the mantra. Griffin explains how recovery is meticulously plotted. He points to one of his own injuries and a subsequent substantial difference in mass between his two quad muscles, detected after his retirement. A UFC fighter at the Institute would be scanned during rehabilitation to highlight which muscles have suffered during their lay-off so targeted rebuilding can be done. The underwater treadmill allows the runner to watch a TV displaying their foot strike Any fighter competing under the UFC banner can train here at no cost. Tailored workout programmes appear on screens next to weight stations. If an athlete is only here for a short spell, their data and subsequent training plan will be sent to an app to use at their traditional base. Whatever the goal - recovery, strength, mobility, technique - there is a desire to offer a menu of ways to work on it. As Griffin stresses, what works for one individual will do nothing for another. In the recovery area, for example, athletes can opt for use of a cryotherapy chamber or laser-light therapy. Both will stimulate circulation, flushing away lactic acid and easing aches and pains. Facilities are purposely placed one room apart to ease access. We pass through a door and Griffin fires up the underwater treadmill McGregor has been filmed using in recent weeks. ""Conor has had a knee injury in the past so he doesn't like to do roadwork,"" says Griffin, 38.  ""So he does a lot of bike work and he uses this as it has no impact on your body and you can work hard."" Two pools next to the underwater treadmill offer temperatures of 105F and 50F respectively to again offer variety in recovery.  Griffin explains why McGregor's typical routine of sleeping in until midday makes perfect sense. ""He's been here once or twice a day for six weeks,"" adds Griffin. ""Training at the time you fight is under appreciated. When do you work out the best, after being up for 12 hours or three or four hours? He primes his body to do that, which is intelligent."" Behind the doors of the Mayweather gym 'Orgy of excess could further sully boxing' Podcast: Is McGregor feeling the pressure?  We are taken to meet UFC flyweight Joe Benevidez, who is receiving treatment from director of physical therapy Heather Linden. Linden left a role at the USA's Olympic Training Centre in Colorado Springs to be here. She jokes when explaining how even the toughest UFC fighters can struggle on a pilates ball when she isolates their weakest muscles in order to highlight where work is needed. ""What's been a shock is how little access to services these athletes have had in the past,"" she says. ""It's amazing how some of them have never had medical guidance for preventative measures.  ""I've had to build trust. I had a guy come in here and tell me he couldn't feel his left arm but he was going to fight. He was scared of telling people in the event he was pulled from competing but with work we restored him to full functionality in two weeks."" Former UFC welterweight Dan Hardy is part of the tour. The Nottingham-born 35-year-old describes the facilities as ""night and day"" to what he used. ""My life would be different now,"" he tells the group. ""I used to work with friends for treatment, driving around for different things I needed."" The upper tier of the gym is specific to MMA, while downstairs focuses on strength and recovery Despite all the technology in what feels like the slickest of finishing schools, MMA critics still exist. Perhaps blighted by images of the ground and pound or blood-stained faces they question the morality of the sport. But UFC's growth shows no sign of relenting. The company was sold for $4.2bn in 2016 and listening to Griffin it is obvious this is a sport with vision.  Mapping the layout of the Institute saw the UFC research facilities at the likes of Man City, the Phoenix Suns basketball team and the USA Olympic team base. Habits were observed, such as an athlete's occasional tendency to neglect post-workout nutrition if access to it was not made easy. Consequently, UFC athletes can only exit the building by passing a nutritional team. ""We learned from mistakes people had made in the past,"" adds Griffin. ""A facility and its staff may be too spread out. Manchester City have a great layout. The locker room is the centre of the building. The athletes start and end in the locker room so you build every service around that. ""Every sport taxes the human body a certain way. The needs and demands change but the impact on the body and the recovery needed is very similar."" This video can not be played How did my body look? I can eat burgers - Mayweather Elsewhere on the ground floor we see anti-gravity treadmills which take away impact, a 50m outdoor track and walls with numbered targets for medicine balls to be thrown at.  The altitude chamber McGregor sometimes cycled in is in use. This transparent box lets people look in at the world of pain it can serve up. Griffin proudly states UFC stars can now create conditions to prime them to fight anywhere on earth. In a gym packed with contraptions, he points to pressure plates in the floor. Squatting and lifting weights while planted on these will deliver data on which limbs are offering the greater power. Once more, it offers a way to drill down and improve weaknesses. We are led up stairs boasting the slogan ""contenders become champions and champions become legends"". These take us away from a ground floor focused on welfare and strength and to an upper tier which measures 17,000 square ft and is MMA specific.  Bags of varying shape and size hang there, an octagon dominates the room and of course, there is McGregor's boxing ring, home of those now infamous spars with Paulie Malignaggi. He is of course a fighter obsessed with detail. This desert treasure chest caters for that intricacy in abundance. And if all of the facilities have somehow polished him to a point where he can shock Mayweather at the T-Mobile Arena, UFC's main draw will achieve a status which will shine new focus on the company. Its Performance Institute tells us the organisation is nothing but ready to thrive and what is more, it now boasts a factory primed to build the next McGregor.

Spread to US Treasury,Who was the real 'Prince Monolulu'?,2024-09-25,2020-10-30,Frank Keogh,https://www.bbc.com/sport/horse-racing/54695641,"Born in 1881, Monolulu - real name Peter Carl McKay - arrived in Britain at the turn of the 20th century ""I gotta horse, I gotta horse to beat the favourite..."" The booming unforgettable catchphrase of Ras Prince Monolulu. A maverick tipster, he was one of the first black people to appear on British television and became an international celebrity. Lion tamer, fire eater, street dentist, preacher, tribal chief, boxer, prisoner of war, entertainer. A CV like no other. This remarkable figure arrived in England at the turn of the 20th Century claiming to be from Ethiopia, and died in London in 1965, at the age of 84.  But what is fact and what fiction? How is he viewed decades after the end of his extraordinary life? And did he really suffer death by chocolate? As we will discover, all was not quite as it seemed. Standing tall with a headdress of ostrich feathers, lion paws swinging from his neck, in baggy pantaloons and holding a tartan umbrella, Monolulu held court before entranced crowds at racecourses across England.  ""I've gotta horse to beat the favourite, Spion Kop will win the Derby, put your shirt on it, put your pants on it. And when you win - roast beef, two veg, Yorkshire pudding, and God save the King."" Spion Kop won the 1920 Derby at odds of 100-6 (about 16-1) netting Monolulu a reputed £8,000 (worth around £400,000 in today's money).  And as a rare free tip, it also brought a big following for the man with quickfire patter worthy of Muhammad Ali and a flamboyant style later echoed by racing pundit John McCririck. From the 1920s to the 1960s, Monolulu appeared on newsreels from major racing fixtures like Derby Day at Epsom as regularly as the Royal Family. Punters paid for his racing tips, sealed in envelopes with the warning not to pass the selection on. He made and lost a fortune, clocked up a succession of court appearances, was married several times, and invariably left people with a smile on their face. ""When I was growing up, everybody in my family knew who he was because of his flamboyance and character,"" says historian and author Stephen Bourne. ""He shouldn't be bypassed. He should be part of British history because he was such a popular character."" Thanks to painstaking research from retired policeman John Pearson, the truth about Monolulu's life has taken shape. Monolulu pictured addressing large crowds at Aintree in 1931 Now 84, former inspector Pearson recalls how, in his rookie days as a bobby on the beat in the 1950s, he bumped into a larger-than-life character in Buckinghamshire market town Chesham. ""I turned around and thought 'who on earth is that?' I got the shock of my life. I was looking straight into the eyes of what I thought was an African chief,"" he remembers. Curious, he set about discovering more and his interest turned into a serious hobby after Monolulu's death and his own retirement. Having appealed for more information, he was contacted by an air hostess who remembered taking Monolulu on a flight to Paris, who said that he'd had a Danish passport. He remains keen to find out more. ""Eventually after a lot of research I managed to establish that he was originally from St Croix in the US Virgin Islands,"" says Pearson. ""His beginnings were very humble, but he obviously had a very sharp mind and spoke several languages."" Epsom racecourse, 1938. Monolulu was also said to have worked as an opera singer in Russia. Born Peter Carl McKay in 1881, Monolulu arrived in Britain from the United States around 20 years later, seeking a better life, having earlier claimed to have been shipwrecked. In London he joined the chorus line of In Dahomey, an all-black West End musical show, and appears to have developed his interest in racing after meeting an Irish tipster. Away from the track, he could be found in the capital's markets such as East Street and Petticoat Lane, selling lucky mascots and even medicines that claimed to cure anything from flat feet to baldness.  Pearson has visited St Croix, tracked down archive records and even helped open a new housing development called Monolulu Court in south London. ""There is some myth and legend. If he felt something was going down well, it probably got enhanced a bit. I think a lot of it is true,"" he says. ""He says he was married six times, but I've only found evidence of three. His claim to be from Ethiopia was a load of rubbish, but it gave him the chance to dress up as someone who would be recognised. ""A black man here in those days had to work twice as hard to make his presence felt in society and Monolulu somehow got right on top of it all."" Bourne says: ""He probably did encounter racism, like many black people would have done. ""There may have been some in the upper classes who laughed at him not with him. The lower classes loved him - he wasn't a figure of fun, he was a man of the people. If you look at the pictures, he's surrounded by smiling people.""  Monolulu's charismatic force made him a star - he even had a London pub named after him Monolulu appeared in newspapers and cartoons and on cigarette cards, and was used by the government for public information campaigns. As his fame spread, he visited the United States to watch famous boxers such as Joe Louis and Sugar Ray Robinson and appeared alongside the Marx Brothers on television.  He was well known to crime writer Edgar Wallace, racehorse owner Prince Aly Khan and Lord Lonsdale (of boxing belt fame). ""When the Second World War broke out he was one of the first public figures to appear in a newsreel encouraging the British public to carry gas masks,"" says Bourne. ""If you go to VE day, he's in the crowd jumping up and down at Buckingham Palace with a big grin on his face. He bookends the beginning and end of the war. He was a remarkable character."" Monolulu's grandson Peter lives and works in Sweden - Peter's son Cristoffer has a tattoo of Monolulu on his arm Peter Granwe remembers raising a glass to his grandfather when a pub named after him was open - the Prince Monolulu in London's Fitzrovia. His son Cristoffer was with him and has a permanent reminder of his great-grandfather. ""I'm very proud and my son, who's now 35, is very proud,"" says Peter from his home in Sweden. ""On his lower arm he has a tattoo of Monolulu, which is from a picture in the National Portrait Gallery., external ""I have a small boathouse north of Gothenburg and I have a sort of man cave where Monolulu stuff is all over the wall. ""He was a unique character, absolutely. He liked to make people laugh."" With Pearson's help, Peter has researched his grandfather and read his 1950 autobiography in which the list of unlikely jobs is covered. ""I'm not sure everything in the book is 100%. He made a history about himself,"" says Peter, who is a treatment assistant helping young immigrants and drug addicts. His uncle told him of being carried around the streets of Soho on the shoulders of Monolulu, who would look out for those down on their luck. ""He would give them a piece of paper with his address in Cleveland Street. You can go there, he would say - there is rice and eggs, but you have to do the washing as I have no butler,"" Peter says. ""After he died, the place was ransacked. The only thing left in the apartment was lion claws. I got one claw. I gave it to my son for his birthday."" Even Monolulu's death is wrapped up in legend - neither his grandson Peter nor Pearson know the truth Comedian and broadcaster Stephen K Amos knows more about Monolulu than most, having narrated a BBC Radio 4 documentary on his life. ""I'm sad his story is not better known,"" he says. ""I've had talks about doing a programme on forgotten black heroes in the UK. He might have to be a four-parter. Listen: The Prince Monolulu Quandary ""He could have just put his head down, worked in a factory or transport system, and lived a regular life. He chose not to do that in the same way I chose not to do that. If that means taking a risk and it pays off, great."" Bourne is pleased we are talking about Monolulu in Black History Month. ""He wasn't a minstrel. He's a national treasure, no question about it - he was a respected figure,"" he says. ""The problem is a younger generation in this country are not told about black Britons in history. It's the fault of the education system.""  Pearson, who has become friends with members of Monolulu's family, is still piecing together the puzzle.  ""I cannot believe that after so many years I'm still finding out bits and pieces. Things come in from all over the world,"" he says. ""It would be nice to have a trust where information could come in. He was such a unique character he would make a fine musical."" For Amos, he is someone who 'represented' - his success earning respect from peers, just as he has with high-profile TV performances such as the Royal Variety Performance. ""To me as a black man, a performer, an entertainer, his story is a part of mine,"" reflects the comic. ""He'd been through adversity, and made something of himself. Wow, that's someone to look up to."" Peter chuckles as he recounts the myriad tales: ""The story of my grandfather's life will never die.""  Pictured at Epsom in 1923. Monolulu's autobiography 'I Gotta Horse', published in 1950 and now out of print, details many of the myths he created. Monolulu's story may be a lesson in character and survival. He also leaves a greater legacy. ""It has taught me, if I needed teaching, a tolerance and respect for people, whatever background or colour they are, as long as they are good people,"" concludes Pearson. ""He probably cheered a lot of people up, particularly when they were down. He would be very useful in these particular times now."" Monolulu died on Valentine's Day, 1965. Legend says he choked in hospital on a chocolate given to him by journalist Jeffrey Bernard. Not even his grandson Peter or Pearson are sure whether it's true. A strawberry cream, it's said, from a box of Black Magic.  It seems too unlikely. But with Prince Monolulu, you just never knew.

Spread to US Treasury,Berlin's stunning indoor public pools,2024-09-25,2023-11-17,Joe Baur,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20231116-the-hidden-beauty-of-berlins-indoor-pools,"The German capital is dotted with more than 60 public indoor swimming pools, and many of them are so stunning and tranquil they feel like you're swimming in an ornate library. On a recent November day in Berlin's upscale Prenzlauer Berg neighbourhood, locals in long jackets pushed strollers through the crisp autumn air. Others wrapped themselves in blankets and lingered at outdoor cafes. And down the street, a handful of people gripping swimsuits headed under the stone Neo-Renaissance facade at the Hotel Oderberger Berlin to partake in a beloved, centuries-old local tradition: whiling away the hours at one of Berlin's many eye-catching public indoor swimming pools (Hallenbäder). Boasting 60 indoor public swimming pools that attract six million visitors each year, Berlin is one of the world's great indoor swimming destinations. And unlike elsewhere, where public pools are more functional than fancy, Berlin's Hallenbäder are veritable cathedrals of late 19th- and early 20th-Century design. As I followed the crowd inside the Stadtbad Oderberger Strasse, for instance, I noticed the 20m pool was surrounded by decorative tiles, arched windows and ornate detailing on the stone railings that felt more like a Moroccan riad than a public pool. Berlin's indoor pools are also known for being places of relaxation rather than racket. Aside from the occasional splash or sandals tapping against tiles, all was quiet here. As others were quietly doing laps, it felt like I was in a library-turned-swimming pool (without the constant fear of getting shushed). ""It would be impossible not to be fond of swimming and also live in a place like Berlin,"" said local resident Beata Gontarczyk-Krampe. ""It's something that you do very much and very often in Berlin."" For the past 15 years, Gontarczyk-Krampe, who calls herself ""a very eager amateur historian"" has been researching and writing about Berlin's lesser-known history, publishing two editions of her Berlin Companion books in the process. The history of Berlin's many indoor swimming pools is a topic that's piqued her interest since moving to here from Poland in 2003. And after spending the past 20 years discovering dozens of ornate Hallenbäder hiding in plain sight, she learned that they have a curious history. Hallenbäder first became popular in Berlin among the wealthier classes in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries as a means to develop higher standards of personal hygiene at a time when few people had baths at home. But as it became clear that poor hygiene spread diseases, the city realised that there were civic and sanitary benefits to broadening the pools' accessibility and granted access to lower classes as well, which is why they are also called Volksbäder, or the ""people's pools"". Remarkably, many of the city's Hallenbäder survived the bombing of World War Two. Stadtbad Charlottenburg – the city's oldest indoor pool built between 1896 and 1898 – and Stadtbad Oderberger Strasse are two such examples. But those that were hit, like Stadtbad Moabit, were swiftly restored to their original glory. ""The city did everything it could to re-open them as quickly as possible,"" Gontarczyk-Krampe explained. ""But not so much for swimming as for washing and bathing."" After World War Two, a trip to the pool became less about hygiene and more as an escape from the rubble of an occupied city. These ornate reminders of a better time were the backdrop for many Berliner childhoods. For those children of post-war Germany, spending the afternoon at the pool simply became a matter of tradition, if not obsession. ""Berliners are really among the most swimming-pool crazy people I know,"" Gontarczyk-Krampe laughed. Just as hordes of Berliners flock to the city's many nearby lakes to swim whenever the weather warms, they also retreat to their local pool as soon as temperatures drop. ""Most of the Hallenbäder are surprisingly full very early in the morning,"" she said. ""All lanes will be taken by the 'Frühschwimmer' or early swimmers."" Then there are the weekends, when parents carry massive bags full of snacks and swim gear. ""If you really wanted to hurt Berliners, you would take the swimming pools away,"" Gontarczyk-Krampe joked. ""Whenever anyone says anything about a swimming pool being renovated or closed for three years, there's such an outcry. It's almost touching."" Whether you're a history buff, architecture buff or are simply looking for a place to escape the city's dark winter days, here's our list of Berlin's most stunning indoor pools. Stadtbad Charlottenburg Following the demolition of the Moabit Volksbad in 1985, Stadtbad Charlottenburg became the city's oldest surviving indoor swimming pool. Nestled along a quiet side street off Bismarckstrasse, this majestic Gothic-style red-brick building is adorned with captivating water-themed gargoyles. Built during Berlin's population boom in 1898, it served a crucial role in public health, offering bathing facilities at a time when most homes lacked bathrooms. Despite surviving damage in the final days of World War Two and facing demolition threats in 1974, public outcry forced the decision to restore and preserve the facility. In 1982 it received historic preservation protection and remains the first and only Hallenbad in Berlin to have a stainless-steel swimming pool. Today, Stadtbad Charlottenburg welcomes visitors with an elaborate wrought-iron door leading to the Art Nouveau-style old hall. The facility showcases a neo-Gothic cross vault interior, mesmerising ironwork and murals depicting a pastoral lakeside scene of a naked man and woman relaxing in their natural surroundings. Stadtbad Neukölln Nestled in Berlin's dynamic and diverse Neukölln neighbourhood, Stadtbad Neukölln is a time-honoured Neoclassical treasure that seamlessly combines architectural splendour with a rich bathing tradition. Originally opened in 1914, this grand bathhouse was built for up to 10,000 daily visitors and quickly became one of the most celebrated pools in Europe. Architect Reinhold Kiehl designed it in the style of an ancient spa, taking inspiration from Russian-Roman baths that included a domed building with a round plunge pool and a skylight that draws in natural light. A bonus for the ladies: it's reserved exclusively for women on Mondays. Stadtbad Berlin-Mitte Also known as Stadtbad Gartenstrase, this pool is anchored in the heart of Berlin's central Mitte (literally: ""Middle"") district and is a captivating testament to the city's architectural and bathing heritage. The historical Bauhaus bathhouse first opened its doors in 1930, designed under the motto ""light, air and sun"", and its mullioned ceiling windows offer fantastic views of the winter sky. Two bombs hit the building on 2 January 1945, but immediate action was taken to prevent more significant damage and the pool reopened that June – just a month after the surrender of Nazi Germany. By the end of 1945, Stadtbad Mitte averaged 5,000 daily visitors – perhaps in search of distraction from the reality of post-war Germany. Float on your back in the 50m-long pool and take in the fleeting light of winter in Berlin. Liquidrom Located in the massive Brutalism crown-meets-tent Tempodrom on the western-edge of Kreuzberg, Liquidrom is essentially a Berlin club-turned spa. The sleek, modern interior and soft illumination matches a soundtrack that ranges from classical to techno. Unlike the more historical swimming pools, the emphasis here is on saunas and the impressive saltwater floating pool. Perhaps more than anywhere else, this is where travellers can experience Germany's ""textile-free"" culture head on. Stadtbad Oderberger Strasse Tucked into Berlin's well-heeled Prenzlauer Berg neighbourhood, Stadtbad Oderberg Strasse (also known as Stadtbad Prenzlauer Berg) is a captivating fusion of history and modernity. Originally inaugurated in 1902 as a public bathhouse to improve the hygiene of the growing neighbourhood brimming with breweries and factories, this architectural treat underwent extensive renovations after closing in 1986. It reopened in 2016 inside the boutique Hotel Oderberger Berlin with guaranteed public access to the pool. Visitors just have to book a two-hour ticket for €9 and can do so in advance online. Hotel guests can visit for free. Schwimmhalle Finckensteinallee Schwimmhalle Finckensteinallee has witnessed many chapters of Berlin's complex history. It's one of the city's few remaining relics of Third Reich Brutalist architecture. Originally constructed in 1938 as an exclusive training facility for the SS, its imposing red-brick exterior and pseudo-Neoclassical style showcase the imagined grandeur of Nazi Germany. Two stone statues of a naked woman and a man holding a disc are on either side of the entrance as if standing guard. After years of serving different purposes – including being under American control post-World War Two – the pool opened its doors to the public in 2014. The vast hall, adorned with floor-to-ceiling windows, preserves its original scale and aesthetics, with pastel blue and white ceilings adding a touch of vibrancy. Despite its challenging past, the pool now offers a unique blend of history and modern amenities, including a free book exchange, inviting visitors to reflect on its transformative journey. Either way, come prepared to swim, as it's known as a place for sporty swimmers.

Spread to US Treasury,"Virus will transform UK work and travel, says AA",2024-09-25,2020-04-03,By Roger Harrabin,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52137968,"The aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis will transform the way we live, work and travel in the UK, the AA says. It predicts a permanent reduction in the demand for travel because people have learned during the crisis to use home-working technology.  The implications are profound for commuters and for government finances. The chancellor currently plans to spend £27bn to curb congestion on roads and £100bn on HS2 – but if demand falls, that may not be needed. AA President Edmund King says anecdotal evidence from people lucky enough to be working during the coronavirus-enforced lockdown suggests that infrastructure funds might be better spent on broadband to support home working. He told BBC News: ""Arguably in future, we should invest more in broadband because what this current crisis has shown is that the majority of companies can continue working from home, and it can be more efficient."" But the government's former infrastructure tsar, Andrew Adonis, said it was too soon to forecast a permanent drop in traffic due to an increase in home working.   He told us: ""Lots of people are working out how to use Skype and Zoom, so this could improve productivity – but on the other hand, other people can’t wait to get back to the office.  “I’m sceptical whether travel demand will drop sufficiently to counteract population growth in the UK."" More people generally equals more travel.  Other experts are calling for the roads programme and HS2 rail project to be put on hold for a decade so ministers can be sure they’re not wasting money. They say if commuters spend just one day a week working from home after the crisis - or commuting later - the roads will be as empty as they are in the school holidays.     If transport infrastructure plans are scrapped or scaled down, that could also help plug the inevitable gulf in public finances caused by the virus. Mr King continued: “It really is extraordinary. Every day is like Christmas Day since the lockdown.  ""People travelling up and down motorways just to hold meetings is inefficient, expensive and not good for the environment. I think use of roads and rail and indeed bus will be reduced after this crisis."" Prof Greg Marsden from Leeds University's Transport Studies Unit said the government's projections of traffic growth underpinning the roads programme was 1% a year – meaning 35% by 2055. He told BBC News that post-Covid-19, an actual fall in traffic was more likely.  He said: ""The likely drop in traffic levels post the Covid-19 crisis means that we should delay the road expansion programme and focus instead on rebuilding public transport and switching more of our vehicles to zero emissions."" He also points out that the number of peak-hour commuter journeys was already falling before the crisis, as people choose to work one or two days at home, or simply to come in after rush hour. A global survey by the infrastructure architects Weston Williamson & Partners of more than 2,000 commuters in 10 major cities showed a pre-coronavirus reduction in commuting of 2-5%, as 60% of managers and professionals were already working partly from home.   ""Fewer people have been travelling at rush hour but although the numbers are just a few percent they are significant numbers - from New York to Los Angeles, to Paris or Berlin. So it's quite a trend,” said the firm's co-founder Chris Williamson. He himself is working from home in North London – and loving it. ""I feel a bit like Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window,"" he said. ""I can see just one window but it's really nice – and it's a new way of working.  “In the next few weeks I had six tours booked to go to architecture schools for recruitment. All the visits have been cancelled so I’m going to record it and share it online.  ""The students can watch it at their leisure and then I can do a live Q&A. It saves me an awful lot of travelling and it's something I should have thought of previously. ""Five years ago I was invited for an interview for a job in Singapore and we were told in no uncertain terms if we didn't go for the interview, we would not get the job.  ""It was ridiculous – nine hours there and nine hours back for a 25-minute presentation. I think those days, and crazy demands are over, and now it will be done through technology."" There’s a story in similar vein from Deborah Caldwell, a solicitor whose office is in Milton Keynes, but who lives in Hampshire. She was commuting two-and-a-half hours a day on average.  Now her home study overlooks quiet fields where lambs are frolicking – and she says she's transformed the defunct commuting time into working time. ""It’s so much better,"" she says. ""I was exhausted by the travelling to get to the office. Luckily my firm was already good with flexible working, but I would be amazed if other firms haven't yet cottoned on to the possibilities of remote working."" It's clear that some workers will be more highly motivated than others – and some will need the stimulus (or supervision) of an office environment.  But some major firms are already gearing up for a home/work revolution.  A senior partner of a leading professional services firm, who didn’t want to be named, told me they were helping their employees to set up for working at home – and they didn't expect to revert to previous office-based patterns of work. ""First,"" he said, ""it’s better for our employees. We can offer much more flexible conditions – which will suit a lot of people.  ""It will have to be a two-way street, and if people want only to work five hours a day we’ll want to pay them five hours' worth of salary. ""But also it's going to save us a fortune in office costs. And the technology will open the opportunity for firms to bid for work at a distance.  ""There are some very big changes under way in the way we work – and they have deep implications."" Indeed, research from accountants Theta Financial Reporting suggests that some degree of working from home will become the norm.  A survey of more than 2,000 people in the UK suggests that nearly two-thirds of us believe the most popular working method in the future will be flexible working.  It says many people now say that flexible hours are the most important thing to them when choosing a job. And it suggests a third of working Brits would rather have flexible working options than a pay rise. It is indeed too soon to tell whether a work revolution is under way – but it would be convenient for the Treasury if it was. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin "
Spread to US Treasury,True-life treasure hunt that turned into a comic book,2024-09-25,2018-12-22,By James Badcock,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46439189,"When Spanish civil servants got wind that someone was sweeping up the priceless treasure of a 200-year-old frigate from the ocean floor, it triggered a real-life escapade full of naval pursuits and secret airlifts - like something from a comic book adventure.  And that is what it has now become, after one of those suit-and-tie sleuths convinced Spain's best-known graphic novelist that together they should tell the tale of the modern-day treasure hunt. In 1804, a British fleet opened fire on the Spanish ship Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes, causing the death of 250 people of the 300 on board – and the loss of half a million silver and gold coins. That incident became known as Battle of Cape Santa Maria and led to Spain declaring war on Britain. Within a year came the Battle of Trafalgar and the defeat of the Spanish and French fleet. Two centuries later, US firm Odyssey Marine Exploration announced it had made the largest discovery of underwater treasure in history - but would not reveal the name or location of the shipwreck. The deep-ocean exploration company used robotic rovers to suck 17 tons of treasure from the seabed – before spiriting it away to Florida on a secret flight out of Gibraltar under the Spanish authorities' noses in 2007.  ""With the coordinates that the Navy handed us, it hasn't taken us too long to find the site. Let's get going, lower Triton!"" ""Triton descending - to 200m... 850m... 930m... 1010... 1015... sea-bed"" ""There's nothing there"" ""Turn 45 degrees east. A bit more to the left... slowly."" ""Wait! Stop - here it is, we've got it."" It would take five years for a team of Spanish civil servants to wrest back the treasure, which now sits in a museum in Cartagena on the south-east coast. But the story of how they got it back is itself quite a tale. Guillermo Corral, a career diplomat who was working in Spain's culture ministry in 2007, felt his experience of the legal fight had potential as an adventure story, so he contacted graphic novelist Paco Roca.  Mr Roca soon saw parallels with classic comic-book sagas such as Tintin and Corto Maltese, and the two men wrote The Treasure of the Black Swan, in reference to the codename that Odyssey gave the shipwreck before the Spanish authorities worked out that it was in reality the Mercedes. ""We have a boat we know nothing about, that may or may not be Spanish.... and an immense treasure that has been outside Spain for weeks, almost certainly in the US. And you are suggesting that we do exactly what, Alex?"" ""I was fascinated by the historical aspect. The attack on the Mercedes triggered war between the British and Spaniards and the entry into Spain of Napoleon's army,"" Mr Roca told the BBC in an interview.  Most shipwrecks tend to be spread over large areas. But the Mercedes exploded in spectacular fashion when a British cannonball pierced the ship's gunpowder magazine, causing the ship to sink very quickly. That meant its treasure of Spanish escudos and pieces of eight reached the seabed in one very specific spot.  Mr Roca claims he did not intend to create a story of comic-book goodies versus baddies. But he admits that he and Mr Corral were ""critical of the company's manner of extracting the treasure, using a kind of giant vacuum cleaner and destroying the wreck site, which is also a marine cemetery"".  ""That's the difference between a real archaeologist and a treasure hunter: one is moved by the history; the other the economic aspect,"" he said. In real life, the dispute went to a court in Tampa, an appeal in Florida, and eventually all the way to the US Supreme Court. But the graphic novel doesn't take place in a courtroom.  ""They're coming..."" ""I can't believe it ... we've got it, we've got it."" The book depicts a cloak-and-dagger pursuit of information to work out where and how Odyssey was sweeping the ocean for treasure.  But in the fictionalised version the exploration company is called Ithaca.  Other details are changed too.  In the comic book the ship's GPS is switched off to confuse Spanish authorities, who later use a stolen copy of Gibraltar airport manifests to work out where the company is flying planes to and from.  So where does the truth end and fiction take over? ""That's for each reader to decide for themselves,"" says his co-writer, Guillermo Corral. ""What I can say is this: everything is the truth. And if it isn't? Well, it could have been."""
Spread to US Treasury,Stablecoin collapse sends crypto tokens tumbling,2024-09-25,2022-05-12,By Joe Tidy,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-61425209,"Cryptocurrency markets are being rocked after a popular token lost 99% of its value along with a so-called ""stablecoin"". The Terra Luna token fell from a high of $118 (£96), last month, to $0.09 on Thursday.  The collapse was linked to, and made worse by, the fall of its sister token, TerraUSD, which is normally stable. Spooked investors are now pulling out of major cryptocurrencies with values plummeting. The companies behind stablecoins try to ensure they remain in parity with assets such as the US dollar - with one token equalling $1, for example. But on Thursday TerraUSD fell to $0.4 according to the trading website Coin Market Cap. Tether, the most popular stablecoin, also fell off its US dollar peg - to an all-time low of $0.95. The term ""cryptocrash"" has been trending on Twitter and Google Search.  And the combined market value of all crypto-currencies is now reportedly $1.12trillion, about a third of its November value, with more than 35% of that loss coming this week. One Bitcoin is now worth about $27,000, its lowest value since December 2020 and down from a high of nearly $70,000 late last year. Ethereum, the second largest coin by value, has lost 20% of its value in 24 hours. ""The collapse of TerraUSD has started what we used to call 'the panics', when major financial institutions sold off large chunks of assets and everyone else tried to take their money out as quickly as they could,"" economist Frances Coppola said. ""Panic is exactly what's going on here.""  On Friday Terraform Labs, the company behind TerraUSD and Terra Luna took the unprecedented and controversial step of halting trading on it's blockchain. The company tweeted that the move was necessary to allow it ""come up with a plan to reconstitute it"".   Previously, Do Kwon, the founder of Terraform Labs, posted on Twitter: ""I understand the last 72 hours have been extremely tough on all of you - know that I am resolved to work with every one of you to weather this crisis and we will build our way out of this."" A plan to shore up Terra Luna by creating more tokens was outlined - but having lost large sums, many Twitter users are asking the company to help. Meanwhile, the company's Discord server, a platform where investors congregate to talk through issues, posted a notice saying it had been ""locked down so new people can't come in and spread fear, uncertainty, doubt and misinformation"".  At Tether, the chief technology officer took to Twitter to reassure holders of his token the company had enough cash reserves to pay anyone who wanted to sell. Paolo Ardoino tweeted: ""[A] reminder that Tether is honouring [Tether] redemptions at $1 - 300 million redeemed in [the] last 24 hours, without a sweat drop."" Lawmakers and officials in a number of countries have called for stablecoins to be regulated. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen cited the TerraUSD collapse, in a Senate committee meeting on Tuesday, to ask again for robust regulation. ""It simply illustrates that this is a rapidly growing product and that there are risks to financial stability and we need a framework that's appropriate,"" she said. A UK Treasury report last month also laid out plans to regulate stablecoins, which it predicted would become a """"widespread means of payment""."
Spread to US Treasury,Budget promises 'no regions will be left behind',2024-09-25,2020-03-11,By Patrick Burns,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-51838917,"""What's in it for us?"" That's the question thousands of Midlanders are entitled to ask of today's Budget, especially those Labour voters who broke the habits of several lifetimes by switching to the Conservatives in areas of the Black Country and North Staffordshire where, until recently, any such thing would have seemed unthinkable.  Remember this Budget is not only the first to be presented on behalf of a new government by a very new chancellor. It's also the first after Brexit and the first after our own flooding emergency along the rivers Severn, Teme and Wye which has left local communities facing long and relentless battles to rebuild their lives and their livelihoods.  What's in it for them, too?  And on top of all this, the deepening health emergency caused by the spread of coronavirus guaranteed that Rishi Sunak's debut could hardly have come at a less promising moment.  For once, Boris Johnson was the warm-up man - Prime Minister's Questions coming immediately before the chancellor's statement.  He did his best to take everyone's minds off coronavirus for a moment. He told Stoke South's Conservative MP Jack Brereton that the Budget would turn his city into ""the crucible in which the future prosperity of this country is to be forged"".  While Dudley South's Conservative MP Mike Wood asked the PM if the Budget would help the West Midlands' Conservative ""metro mayor"" Andy Street's drive for ""investment in skills and transport infrastructure to power the Midlands Engine"".  Mr Johnson replied that the Budget would be ""transformational to the infrastructure in this country and in Dudley in particular"". In the event, there was no getting away from the health emergency, however determined the chancellor may have been to avoid this being remembered as ""The Coronavirus Budget"". The NHS, he promised, would be given whatever it needed to cope with the emergency.  Next came flooding relief. The headline figures of £120m to repair the immediate damage, £200m for local authorities to improve flood defences and £5.2bn capital investment in improving resilience measures also include £23m for communities in the Severn Valley.  So at least there is something in this Budget for the people who met Mr Johnson during his visit to Worcestershire 10 days ago when they told him he must ""get Bewdley done"". Some of the other stand-out numbers:  No less bravely, Mr Sunak made a pledge close to Mayor Street's heart: to eradicate rough sleeping during the lifetime of this Parliament.  While Mr Street may be celebrating all these name-checks here at Westminster, he'll not need reminding that, Covid-19 permitting, he faces a mayoral election in May, when he will face a Labour challenger who knows a thing or two about Budget Day himself.  Liam Byrne was a Cabinet Minister at Treasury in the last Labour government. Already he's blamed Mr Street's ""dithering"" over local rail franchises for the misery that's been visited on hapless local commuters.  Mr Byrne has followed this up by tweeting his ""anger and disappointment"" that the Budget funds just 20% of what's needed for East Birmingham extension to the Midlands Metro. Even this, he says, will have to be shared with Sprint Bus Phase One where he calculates there is a £73m funding gap.  A landmark Budget this may be, with a Conservative government promising to ramp up public spending. But the opposition insist they are only repairing some of the damage of their own making during the Tories' decade of austerity.  Yet again, we have a Budget wrapped up in complex number-crunching. But that won't stop the raw politics following close behind. "
Spread to US Treasury,Halloween: Can we go trick or treating or not?,2024-09-25,2020-10-02,By Becky Morton and Doug Faulkner,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54180119,"From trick or treating to apple bobbing, the traditions of 31 October aren't things you would immediately consider to be ""Covid-safe"". So does that mean Halloween is cancelled? The answer kind of depends on where you live. In Scotland, trick or treating - or guising - has been strongly discouraged by the government, with Deputy First Minister John Swinney telling parents going door-to-door ""brings an additional and avoidable risk of spreading the virus"". ""Our clear advice for families is to avoid it,"" he said. And with people banned from meeting other households indoors, Halloween parties are also definitely off the cards. In Wales, Halloween falls during a 17-day firebreak lockdown, meaning meeting people from other households, either indoors or outdoors, is not allowed. ""We are asking people to stay home during the firebreak period to slow the spread of coronavirus and help save lives,"" a government spokesman said. Northern Ireland's Public Health Agency (PHA) has said it is important people continue to follow the restrictions, which prevent meeting indoors with other households and restrict the number of people who can meet outside to 15. Dr Gerry Waldron, head of health protection at PHA, said apple bobbing was a definite no-no, and asked people not to trick or treat. So what about in England? Well, it depends on what tier your local area is in. Downing Street has suggested trick or treating can take place as long as the local restrictions are followed. The prime minister's official spokesman this week said: ""The rules are those which apply to household mixing in general and what that means in practice is if you are in a very high alert level (Tier 3) then you cannot mix with other households indoors or in private outdoor spaces. ""If you're in a high Covid alert level (Tier 2) then the rule of six applies in private gardens and outdoor spaces but households must not mix indoors. ""And in terms of the medium alert level (Tier 1), you can meet indoors and outdoors in groups of no more than six people."" He added people would have to use their common sense. The Cabinet Office said people should check which restrictions applied to them, but said it was not planning to give specific guidance on Halloween. In the US, where Halloween is big business, some cities have already said traditional trick or treating is not recommended. And the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has outlined guidance on how risky Halloween activities are, ranging from lower-risk activities to higher risk ones. The safer activities, it said, included having a movie night with your family, carving pumpkins with your own household or going on a socially-distanced scavenger hunt to find Halloween-theme items outside. Higher risk activities include traditional trick or treating, where sweets are handed to children, and fancy dress parities indoors. So what are the risks of trick or treating? ""If you're doing something that increases your contacts with other people then you are automatically increasing their risk and your risk,"" says Dr Chris Smith, a virologist at the University of Cambridge. Covid-19 can be spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus, as well as through droplets breathed in.  ""There's the issue of how you give a treat,"" he said. ""If everyone's scrabbling round in a bucket full of sweets and they touch all of them then there's a risk of transmission."" To reduce this risk, he recommends giving out individually wrapped sweets so children aren't touching something they then put straight in their mouths.  Safer still, you could leave sweets outside the door for people to help themselves. But while large gatherings are probably off the cards this year, virtual events are still a possibility. Elizabeth Lusty runs online choirs for children and adults and is hosting a Halloween-themed session with fancy dress and singalongs to tunes like Monster Mash and Time Warp.  Usually she would host a Halloween party for her children, Scarlett, aged three, and seven-year-old Frank, but this year the family, from west London, won't be able to.  Instead, she's still planning to decorate the house and hopes to try to organise a safe trail with some of her neighbours who are doing the same. In Bristol, a map of the ""spookiest houses"" has been created by a mother of five who says she is ""obsessed by Halloween"". Natasha Wood set up the Facebook group Halloween displays in Bristol when she realised trick or treating would be different this year due to coronavirus, Since then more than 170 decorated Halloween houses have been added to a digital map covering most of the city. Among the displays is an 18ft (5.49m) pirate ship complete with skeleton crew. ""I didn't expect it to but it has literally snowballed and gone crazy in the last two weeks,"" Ms Wood said. A similar scheme has been organised in the Marple area of Stockport, with an online map of decorated houses created for families to follow.  People are being encouraged to remain two metres apart and not to knock on doors or leave out treats - so children will only be able to admire pumpkin displays from a distance.  And of course, if you're dressing up, why not make your mask part of your costume. ""Because it's Halloween I'd say people are quite likely to be wearing a mask anyway,"" Dr Chris Smith adds. ""So if they can make a face covering work it's way into their costume then even better."""
Spread to US Treasury,Officials hint at tougher restrictions in Scotland,2024-09-25,2021-12-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-59717594,"Senior officials have suggested Scotland could face tougher Covid-19 restrictions around the new year. Prof Jason Leitch said it was better to ""act harder"" and ""early"" while Scotland Office minister Iain Stewart said ""big decisions"" may need to be made. A four-nations Cobra meeting was held this weekend following calls for more financial support for businesses. However, the first minister said she had no plans to recall Holyrood to discuss further measures. She said the situation was ""unpredictable"" and that parliament ""will sit as necessary"", following a report in The Herald on Sunday. She tweeted: ""No idea what basis of this headline is, and it's not helpful to add to anxiety people already feel. It's a week before @ScotParl is even in recess."" Exactly one year ago the first minister tightened restrictions around Christmas after it was hoped the rules would ease between 23 and 27 December. Omicron is now the dominant variant in Scotland, with more than 10,000 UK cases reported on Saturday alone. Currently, Scots are being advised to reduce their socialising as much as possible and to limit gatherings to three households - though large-scale events including the Scottish League Cup final and Edinburgh Hogmanay are still going ahead. However, Prof Jason Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, said the Scottish government's tone had ""shifted"" in the last few days. Speaking to BBC Scotland's Sunday Show, he said: ""The position is worrying, I make no bones about that. This new variant didn't exist 21 days ago - it's quite astonishing and it's happened just before Christmas again. ""Better to act early than later, better to act harder than softer - we've learned that over two years I'm afraid."" While about 53% of the eligible Scottish population has now received a booster jab, Prof Leitch added that the population was ""not vaccinated enough"" - and he shared concerns about mass gatherings such as football matches. He said: ""Buses, trains, all of them worry me - the outdoor experience at St Johnstone or Hampden, that doesn't worry me particularly, but getting to and from it do.  ""I don't think any of these events are safe but nor is your studio and nor is my house. What we're trying to do is create safer environments for people as best as we possibly can."" Prof Leitch spoke shortly after the UK's Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the Andrew Marr Show he would not rule out new coronavirus measures before Christmas - saying there are ""no guarantees"" in the pandemic. In leaked minutes seen by the BBC, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) suggested that if no further restrictions were introduced, hospital admissions could peak at between 3,000 and 10,000 a day - and deaths between 600 and 6,000. But Mr Javid said the government was challenging scientific data and considering wider factors before bringing in more measures, adding: ""I don't think it would be appropriate for government to take it [the advice] verbatim."" Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, called for tougher restrictions in Scotland. ""We can't boost ourselves out in time,"" she said. ""We need more restrictions now. There are lots of things we can do individually which will make a huge difference but making things more official - and by that I'm talking about curtailing access to certain things, closing certain things - does bring the numbers down and buys us more time for people to be boosted."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned on Friday that Omicron was now the dominant strain of the virus and a ""tsunami"" was beginning to hit Scotland. New guidance for shops, hospitality venues and other businesses was introduced that same day, in a bid to stem the transmission of Covid. Normally it would have been the busiest day of the year for many firms, but the hospitality sector reported a ""bleak Friday"" and repeated calls for more financial support. Scotland's Finance Secretary Kate Forbes is seeking £500m from the Treasury, a figure she said was based on previous monthly furlough costs and grants. Scotland Office minister Iain Stewart told the Sunday Show the UK government had already provided ""considerable help"" for the hospitality sector. However, he conceded that ""big decisions may need to be made"" as discussions between governments were ongoing - which included negotiations on support from the army for the booster rollout. He said: ""There isn't a playbook for this and there are no cost-free decisions - every measure you take to provide public health restrictions because of the virus has other consequences, not just economic. It has effects on people's mental health and children's learning. ""I know the effects this is having on hospitality and leisure and there are discussions happening this weekend on what the appropriate response will be to that."" Appearing on BBC Breakfast, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said there was clear evidence people in Scotland were changing their activity in response to the new guidance.   Asked what it would take for more measures to be introduced, he said the government was continuing to monitor the ""really aggressive"" spread of Omicron. He added: ""We will, of course, be updating parliament in the course of this week, on the further views that we have about any other measures that we need to take."""
Spread to US Treasury,Uncovering caves full of treasure,2024-09-25,2015-02-23,Jonathan Glancey,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150223-uncovering-caves-full-of-treasure,"The Ajanta Caves were a sanctuary for Buddhist monks that was forgotten, along with its stunning riches, for nearly 1,500 years. Jonathan Glancey investigates. The Ajanta Caves, 30 spellbinding Buddhist prayer halls and monasteries carved, as if by sorcery, into a horseshoe-shaped rock face in a mountainous region of India’s Maharashtra state, 450km (280 miles) east of Mumbai, were ‘discovered’ by accident in 1819. Unknown for more than 1,000 years except to wild animals, insects, flood waters, prodigious foliage and perhaps the local Bhil people, this magnificent work of art, architecture and contemplation, was abandoned by those who created it as long ago as AD 500. In 1983 it was designated a Unesco World Heritage Site. John Smith, a young British cavalry officer, was on a tiger hunt when he spotted the mouth of a cave high above the Waghora (Tiger) River that could only have been man made. Scrambling up with his party, Smith entered the cave and, branding a flaming grass torch, encountered a great vaulted and colonnaded hall, its walls covered in faded paintings. Beneath a dome, a timeless praying Buddha fronted a mound-like shrine, or stupa. Smith carved his name on a statue of a Bodhisattva, a figure representing one of the past lives of the Buddha before he achieved Nirvana, or union with the divine spirit. Since then, thousands of people have added their names as the Ajanta caves – a gallery of the oldest and some of the finest of all Buddhist art – has gained fame and become a compelling tourist attraction. News of Smith’s find spread quickly. In 1844, Major Robert Gill was commissioned by the Royal Asiatic Society to create reproductions on canvas of the wall paintings. This was the beginning of measures to reveal and document the prayer halls (chaityagrihas) and monasteries (viharas) that had, it seems, been hewn from solid rock in two phases, the first – five prayer halls – between the 1st  and 2nd  centuries BC and, the second – 25 monasteries, or monks’ lodgings – in the 5th Century AD. Gill worked in truly difficult conditions. Not only was it often unbearably hot, but this was still tiger country, and the fierce Bhil people had never come to terms with invaders, whether Hindu or Moghul emperors or 19th Century British military. Lost to time What Gill and other visitors saw, having climbed ropes and ladders, to reach the caves – the original stone stairs had long gone – was architecture of a very high order and sculpture and paintings that took the breath away. Here, Buddhist monks had gazed on thousands of lustrous images of the lives the Buddha – Siddhartha Gautama – had lived before this 6th Century Indian prince took up teaching and inspired a way of thinking and being practiced by hundreds of millions around the world today. Between images of the Buddha, were sensuous representations of glamorous princes and princesses, of animals, palaces, silks, jewellery, of lovemaking and life in all its mortal richness. Some of the images shocked Victorian sensibilities and are still condemned by religious zealots unable to comprehend that what these Indian artists saw was a joyous vision of natural fecundity and divine beauty. Along with the1st Century AD architecture, these paintings showed remarkable affinities to classical Greek art. This was not coincidence, but evidence of a Greco-Indian culture that had spread from the 4th Century BC expeditions of Alexander the Great. It stretched through Hellenistic kingdoms and trade routes from the Mediterranean to Persia, Afghanistan and India – with Ajanta along the way – to distant China and Japan. Twenty-seven of Gill’s canvases were displayed in the Indian Court of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, south London; in 1866, 23 were destroyed by fire. Newly armed with a camera as well as brushes, Gill set to work again. Meanwhile, the Royal Cave Temple Commission founded by the Royal Asiatic Society in 1848 had led to the foundation in 1861 of the Archaeological Survey of India. Concern for the treasures of Ajanta grew, as did the number of intrepid experts and treasure hunters, some of whom did more than carve their names on statues: they scraped paintings from walls which crumbled into dust. One of the few known surviving paintings to have left Ajanta intact is in the care of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts today. It had been sold in 1924 for £1,000 at Sotheby’s in London. The Government of Bombay commissioned new copies of the Ajanta cave paintings in 1872 from John Griffiths, principal of the Bombay School of Art. Griffiths and his students produced 300 paintings, only for a third to go up in flames at London’s Imperial Institute in 1885. In 1909, Lady Herringham, suffragette and art patron, began further copies with help from the Calcutta School of Art, and from the late 1920s the Indian art historian Ghulam Yazdani made a comprehensive photographic survey of the art of Ajanta, published in four volumes between 1930 and 1955. That was the year the surviving Griffiths paintings were put in store by the Victoria & Albert Museum. Inaccessible and forgotten for half a century, in 2005 81 were uncovered and restored. Searching for understanding Since 1999, a team led by Rajdeo Singh of the Archaeological Survey of India, using new methods developed in Japan, have revealed the intense colours and sheer beauty of many of the 1st Century AD portraits along with the subtlety of their artists’ use of perspective, shading and other three-dimensional techniques including the use of bright stones, notably lapis lazuli from Afghanistan. Their meticulous restoration raised anew questions asked many times over the past 200 years. How did the artists paint so well, with such precise use of colour, in the dark recesses of these rock-carved prayer halls and monasteries? Just how many architects, masons, sculptors and painters would have been at work between from circa AD 460-500 when so much of this glorious place, paid for by merchants and courtiers during the reign of the Vakataka dynasty emperor Harisena, was created? And, in those brief years before the fall of the Vakataka empire and its patronage of Buddhist art, could this really have been a place of quiet contemplation when it must have been one vast building site? The many archaeological ventures over the past two centuries seeking to answer these questions, as well as to uncover, document and conserve this feast of Buddhist creativity have added immeasurably to Ajanta’s fame, along with the tramp of ever increasing tourists. In 2013, four replica caves, created by the Mumbai-based designer Rakesh Rathod, were opened at the visitor centre 4km (2.5 miles) from the rock face. The idea was to reduce numbers heading to the precious chaityagrihas and viharas. The fake caves, however, have not been a success: evidently, visitors want the real thing even though many clearly revel in the shopping bazaar and food stalls greeting anyone making pilgrimages to Ajanta today. And, yet the serenity of the sleeping Buddha lying in one of the caves, the summer and winter solstice sunlight illuminating statues of the praying Buddha, the spellbinding architecture and the compelling beauty of the wall paintings lift Ajanta above such worldly concerns. This might be a tourist magnet, yet thanks to generations of conservationists, Ajanta remains a gateway to Nirvana.

Spread to US Treasury,UK forecast to have slowest growth in G7 next year,2024-09-25,2022-04-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61142906,"The war in Ukraine will ""severely set back"" the global economic recovery with the UK hit harder than most, the International Monetary Fund has said.  The conflict is driving up prices for food and fuel which the international body expects to slow growth globally. It has cut its global forecast and also downgraded its outlook for the UK. This means the UK will no longer be the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of leading Western nations, and will be the slowest in 2023, it says. The body says that UK growth will slow as price pressures lead households to cut spending, while rising interest rates are expected to ""cool investment"". The UK's economy is now predicted to grow by 3.7% this year, down from the previous forecast of 4.7% made in January. However, next year, the UK is expected to have the slowest growth in the G7 and across Europe's main economies, at just 1.2%, a near halving from the 2.3% expected previously. The 2023 UK figure is the slowest apart from heavily-sanctioned Russia in the wider G20 grouping, which includes nations such as China and India. The IMF said that the UK was the fastest growing G7 economy in 2021, and is forecast to be the second fastest in 2022. The low UK growth rates forecast in 2023 are in part due to the UK rebounding more quickly from the pandemic than some of its G7 peers. However, the UK is also wrestling with high inflation, which will hit growth in 2023, as people cut spending as their real income shrinks, the IMF said. The organisation expects inflation to peak in late 2022 at 9%. It said rising interest rates will also slow the UK economy in 2023 and 2023, while government policies such as getting rid of certain tax breaks will reduce business investment at that time. In addition, Brexit will hold back export growth, the IMF said, and it will continue to make pandemic-related labour supply ""scarring"" worse by reducing immigration. ""However, the impact of Brexit is spread over several years and is not the primary driver of the slowdown in 2023,"" a spokesperson for the organisation added. The IMF works with its 189 member countries to try to stabilise the global economy, including issuing short-term loans and assistance to countries who are struggling. It said inflation was now a ""clear and present danger"" in many countries and the situation has added to supply strains from the coronavirus pandemic. ""In the matter of a few weeks, the world has yet again experienced a major, transformative shock,"" IMF director of research Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in the organisation's 2022 World Economic Outlook. ""Just as a durable recovery from the pandemic-induced global economic collapse appeared in sight, the war has created the very real prospect that a large part of the recent gains will be erased.""  The organisation said it expected global growth of just 3.6% this year, down nearly a percentage point from its forecast before the war.  The World Bank also said it was lowering its growth forecast from 4.1% to 3.2%.  The conflict has already devastated the economies of Ukraine and Russia, which the West cut off from key trade and financial networks with sanctions following the invasion. Ukraine is facing a severe contraction of 35% or more this year, while Russia's economy is expected to shrink by 8.5%, the IMF said. But with Russia a major energy producer and key supplier of staples such as wheat and corn alongside Ukraine, the consequences will ripple far beyond their borders, the IMF warned. There have been two acute shocks to the world economy in quick succession - the pandemic and the Ukraine war. The latter is building on the problems created by the former, tripping up what had been a healthy recovery, and sending prices rising at an even faster rate. Food and energy prices were already being hiked by the supply bottlenecks after the pandemic, before one of the world's biggest energy suppliers invaded one of the world's biggest food exporter. But now there are new bottlenecks emerging from the stringent Covid lockdowns in some regions of China. Rising prices risk social stability in poorer countries, dependent on food imports. Fears about inflation becoming entrenched are leading the world's central bankers to raise interest rates. In turn that is raising the cost of borrowing for the record debts many nations racked up during the pandemic. So all this requires some skill and cooperation among the old and new financial powerhouses of the world. But that has been another commodity in short supply in recent times. ""The economic effects of the war are spreading far and wide - like seismic waves that emanate from the epicenter of an earthquake,"" it said. In Germany, where the economy is especially closely entwined, the war is likely to lower growth by 1.7 percentage points, it said. Even in countries with little direct trade with Russia and Ukraine, households will feel the effects of the war, as central banks respond to the more rapid inflation by raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive, the IMF said. In the US, for example, the organisation lowered its forecast for growth in 2022 by 0.3 percentage points to 3.7%, citing the prospect of more aggressive interest rate rises.  Overall, inflation pressures are significantly worse than they were when the IMF issued its previous forecast in January. It now predicts inflation in ""advanced economies"" will hit 5.7% this year, while it is likely to reach 8.7% in emerging markets.  UK inflation is expected to be 5.3% next year - the highest in the G7, and higher than all EU members, and only exceeded in the G20 by crisis-ridden Argentina, Turkey and Russia. ""Inflation has become a clear and present danger for many countries,"" Mr Gourinchas wrote in a blog. A few countries, such as oil exporters, are benefiting. The IMF expects growth in Saudi Arabia, for example, to be stronger than it did in January. But the risks are not purely economic, the IMF added.  It said the war had also created a refugee crisis and aggravated political tensions, risking a ""more permanent fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical blocks with distinct technology standards, cross-border payment systems, and reserve currencies"".  ""Such a 'tectonic shift' would cause long-run efficiency losses, increase volatility and represent a major challenge to the rules-based framework that has governed international and economic relations for the last 75 years,"" the IMF said. A Treasury spokesperson said the IMF forecasts ""will be concerning for many people and families"" in the UK. ""However the support we provided over the past two years has put our economy in a good position to deal with these headwinds, including through record numbers of employees on payrolls and a strong economic recovery from the pandemic,"" the spokesperson said. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the IMF forecast ""shows the extreme challenges facing the UK economy"". ""While it is true that global forces play a role, the fact that the UK is forecast to have the slowest growth of any G7 economy next year plus the highest inflation, shows the uniquely bad situation the UK is in. ""Inflation spiralling out of control this year has created a cost of living crisis hitting families across the country, needing decisive and urgent action,"" she said, repeating Labour calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said the UK government had ""failed to shield the UK from spiralling energy bills and soaring inflation, but they have gone ahead with raising people's taxes to their highest point in 70 years""."
Spread to US Treasury,'Immediate cancellations' over Omicron advice,2024-09-25,2021-12-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-59683468,"Hospitality venues in the North West say they had ""immediate cancellations"" after people were urged to ""think carefully"" about socialising due to the spread of the Omicron variant.  The prime minister gave the advice on Wednesday amid record UK Covid cases.   A hotel near Garstang said its phone was ""the hottest thing"" following the briefing, with 40 rooms cancelled. A Merseyside venue also said the advice was ""putting the burden"" on individuals to decide whether to attend gigs. The UK recorded 78,610 new Covid cases on Wednesday - the highest daily number reported since the start of the pandemic. At the Downing Street briefing, Boris Johnson said he was not shutting pubs and restaurants but advised people to ""think carefully before you go"". England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty urged the public not to ""mix with people you don't have to"" and warned more Covid records would be broken as the Omicron variant surges.   In Chorley, an entertainment venue said within five minutes of the briefing, ""worried customers"" had phoned up to axe their plans. Managing director of Escape Entertainment, Ian Kearney, told BBC Radio Lancashire the venue had lost 25% of its December bookings so far which was ""potentially catastrophic"".  ""In some cases [customers have] deferred to January which is ok but from last year's experience the appetite for a Christmas party in January has gone and you get cancellations,"" he said. Mr Kearney is calling for financial support for the industry and said he felt the government was ""tip-toeing around a lockdown"". ""We are in limbo [while also] carrying significant losses from last year,"" he said. Sean Wilkinson, from Guy's Thatched Hamlet in Bilsborrow near Garstang, said his hotel and restaurant complex lost 40 room bookings after the briefing. ""The phone was the hottest thing yesterday with people cancelling,"" he said. ""The government advice is contradictory because people have been told to work from home but to go out and meet people - this is normally a very busy time for our industry."" Live music venues across the North West are also counting the cost of the government advice. Craig Pennington, from Birkenhead-based community live music venue Future Yard, said the government's ""intangible"" advice was ""putting the burden"" on individuals to decide whether to attend gigs. ""Essentially it is leaving local businesses to bear the brunt and is leaving us in a precarious position,"" he said. ""I think we are back to when the pandemic first started and we had that ludicrous situation where the PM said pubs, clubs bars and theatres are open but you are not to go to them, it is déjà vu. ""Its almost like it has fallen off a cliff edge with 60 to 70% cancellations."" Manchester-based celebrity party planner Liz Taylor said: ""We cannot cancel Christmas again, we have to live with this."" The businesswoman, who has worked with Coronation Street staff and Manchester United, is still planning a prominent client's 80th birthday event this weekend, but the guest list has dropped from 100 to 75. She said: ""We've had no cancellations yet, but it's on a wing and a prayer. ""Anyone with half a brain gets boosted, wears a mask and gets on with it."" A Treasury spokesman said: ""As we have done throughout the pandemic, we are closely monitoring the impact of the virus on the economy.  ""Our £400bn Covid support package will continue to help businesses well into spring next year and of course we will continue to respond proportionately to the changing path of the virus.""

Spread to US Treasury,'Prepare to stay home' and stock market 'meltdown',2024-09-25,2020-03-09,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-51810868,"The front of the Guardian - showing a stock market trader with his head in his hands - captures the mood of desperation as share prices plunged across the world.   A graph framing the image illustrates the precipitous fall in the FTSE 100 as £125bn was wiped off the value of Britain's leading companies. One portfolio manager tells the Financial Times that in just a couple of weeks, investor sentiment has swung from complacency to panic. ""Meltdown"" is the headline in the Daily Mirror, which describes how pensioners and those nearing retirement risk being hardest hit as the value of their pension funds dived.   The New York Times warns that ""crashing financial markets"" are increasing the risk of a vicious downward cycle that could inflict serious harm on the global economy. The Daily Mail, the Sun and the Daily Express lead on a warning from England's chief medical officer that anyone with just a minor cough or cold will soon be asked to stay at home for a week to help slow the spread of coronavirus.  The Times notes that Britain is now reporting more daily cases than China. It also points out while the share price of virtually every UK-listed company fell on Monday - an exception at one point was Dignity which arranges funerals, although it, too, was later down. The Daily Telegraph reports that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to use his Budget on Wednesday to announce financial handouts for businesses affected by coronavirus.   Ideas under discussion include the Treasury underwriting bank loans to encourage lending to firms, and small businesses being offered loans at cheap interest rates.   The back pages of the Guardian and the Times highlight a warning to the government that some League One and League Two football clubs in England fear going out of business because of a loss of ticket revenue if games have to be played behind closed doors. Also featuring on some of the front pages are pictures of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex at Westminster Abbey in their last royal engagement before they start a new life in Canada.   ""An ocean apart"" is one caption in the Daily Telegraph - despite the couple putting on what the paper calls a ""display of unity"" with the Royal Family.   The Times claims Harry and Meghan's swansong was an ""awkward adieu"" with little interaction between the prince and his brother, William.  ""Brothers at arm's length"" is the Daily Express' verdict. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning And finally, adjustable standing desks have become a common sight in offices, but the Daily Telegraph and the i newspaper bring news that we should go one step further for the good of our health by squatting or kneeling.  Scientists believe we could learn from a hunter-gatherer tribe in Tanzania whose crouching for hours on end has been found to ward off chronic illnesses associated with a sedentary lifestyle.   The Telegraph admits that squatting at a computer screen isn't an easy option, but says that some in the average office hierarchy would welcome others adopting a kneeling position. "
Spread to US Treasury,'No sailors': Cinema's 1918 pandemic log,2024-09-25,2021-12-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-59685437,"One of the country's oldest surviving cinemas has dug through its logbooks and found evidence of its response to a pandemic more than 100 years ago.  Hyde Park Picture House, in Leeds, kept a fastidious daily record of takings, ticket sales and film showings after it opened in 1914. About five years ago, a mystery woman dropped off a bin bag filled with almost 30 old ledgers detailing about 40 years of early activity at the picture palace. The scrupulous logs cover the titles being shown, the daily takings and other observations, such as the day's weather. ""Reading through the logs draws you in, it is quite evocative,"" says Ollie Jenkins, from the Picture House. Not long after the cinema opened the 1918-19 Spanish flu pandemic was to have a remarkable effect on daily life in Leeds.  On its opening day, on Monday 2 November, staff sold 429 tickets across two screenings of My Only Son, taking just under £9. As World War One took hold, the cinema continued to open its doors, screening patriotic dramas and newsreels to boost morale in its gas-lit auditorium. It is October 1918 - a month before the Hyde Park Picture Houses' fourth birthday - when the logs first make mention of the Spanish Flu with an entry containing two stark words: ""influenza epidemic"". On 13 November, two days after the end of the war - which is marked by a special Armistice Day stamp in the ledger - the disease had reached the cinema.  The cinema management took measures to try to stop the spread of the virus, as denoted by a logbook entry which reads ""soldiers, sailors and children barred"".  By 25 November 1918 there is a change of heart and the ledger duly notes: ""Soldiers and children admitted, influenza still bad"". ""The flu crisis felt like a very sad time as it combined with the end of World War One,"" says Mr Jenkins. ""The war followed by that illness contained a long period of disruption for the cinema and customers, but a big function of the picture house was to show the news reels and boosting morale with patriotic films. ""There are lots of similarities with what we've gone through with Covid,"" says Mr Jenkins. ""It shows some of the equivalents to our restrictions, including measures on soldiers and sailors who would have been travelling across borders in packed conditions."" Known as Spanish flu, the virus was thought to have begun in cramped, crowded and unsanitary army training camps on the Western Front - though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is no scientific consensus on its origin. It is estimated about one-third of the world's population became infected with the virus. Fatalities were estimated at least 50 million worldwide, it added. Records at the University of Leeds show an ""astounding 1,401 deaths in Leeds alone"" in 1918, (a death rate of 3.28 per 1000 of the population). The following year in 1919, the number of deaths from influenza was still high at 623. The end of the war had left people undernourished and vulnerable, contributing to the severity of the 1918-19 pandemic, according to the university. Children, pregnant women and nursing mothers were particularly affected.  The daily logging of life at Hyde Park Picture house continued, unabated and cinema records show royal events such the Prince of Wales' visit to the city in 1923 and a rare day's closure for the death of King George V in 1936. During World War Two air raids and gunfire were mentioned alongside cinema attendances. The records come to a halt in 1958 and cinema staff hope in future to digitise and properly research the treasure trove.  The Grade II listed cinema closed for refurbishment just as the Covid-19 pandemic hit and is due to re-open in September. A community fundraising drive to pay for renovations has already raised about £35,000 and has a target of £40,000 by Christmas Eve. The money donated will sponsor the cinema's famous gas lamps and help with upkeep of the Grade II listed lamp-post outside the front door. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Spread to US Treasury,Indoor gyms and pools in England start to reopen,2024-09-25,2020-07-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-53534919,"Indoor gyms, swimming pools and other indoor sports facilities have seen a cautious return of customers as they reopen their doors for the first time since March. Gym-goer Jamelah May said it was great to be one of the first people through the doors of her south-west London gym. ""As well as physically getting back to where I want to be, mentally it's had a massive impact,"" she said. However, it's thought at least a third of public facilities have stayed shut. The leisure sector has warned it will still struggle because of the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic.  Gyms that reopen must follow strict hygiene and social distancing measures, such as limiting the number of people using the facility and spacing out equipment. Facilities should also reduce class sizes and ensure adequate ventilation, according to government guidance issued earlier this month. Outdoor gyms and pools have been open in England since 4 July because there is less risk of catching coronavirus outdoors. Indoor gyms in Northern Ireland opened earlier this month, but they remain closed in Scotland and Wales.  Swim England has published its own guidance for operators on how to reopen indoor pools, including implementing a one-way entry and exit system. Its chief executive Jane Nickerson said financial problems meant less than 20% of pools will reopen this weekend. The cost of heating the pools and implementing the new guidelines, as well as the reduced footfall and fewer swimming lessons, mean many cannot afford to open, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She also called on the government to give more financial support to struggling pools, saying the money would also help with its plan to tackle obesity. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed gyms and sports facilities will not reopen in Luton or Blackburn with Darwen due to an increase in coronavirus cases in those areas. Luke Willmott, manager of the Castle Gym in Nottingham, said his gym was at capacity by about 06:25 BST, and it was ""only right for people to have a choice"" to return. He said returning members are being advised to spray equipment with sanitiser before, during and after use - but there were ""loads"" of membership cancellations during lockdown. ""I think it's down to people's circumstances,"" he said. ""A lot of our community have supported us which has been fantastic... but it has been a struggle."" Michelle and Tomasz used to train in the gym together. But the couple from Putney, south-west London, have come to different conclusions about whether to go back now that it's reopened. Michelle has cancelled her membership and says she won't return for the foreseeable future, while Tomasz is already out the door for his first gym session since lockdown began. ""I work in the leisure industry - I still don't believe it's 100% safe,"" says Michelle. ""There is a lot of equipment crammed in there and the gym doesn't have very good ventilation."" Instead, she's been using resistance bands and training outside. But for Tomasz, who used to do bodybuilding in Poland, the gym is part of his lifestyle. ""To not have that, it affects his mindset,"" Michelle says. ""Training outside doesn't do it for him. I can't stop him going to the gym and he can't make me go!"" Paul Douglas-Smith, manager of the Littlehampton Wave swimming pool, said the facility can now take 40 swimmers at once, down from more than 130 before the pandemic. He said the pool will be hit financially, and is aiming for a ""staged return"". ""We're looking at the fitness swimmers first and then we're looking at the family and the junior swimming. That will probably follow in the next two or three weeks,"" he said. Despite the relaxed rules, industries bodies have warned many facilities could be forced to close amid the pandemic. Community Leisure UK, the members' association that specialises in representing charitable leisure and culture trusts across England, Scotland and Wales, estimates that 48% of all public leisure facilities face closure, meaning as many as 1,300 could disappear by the end of the year, along with more than 58,000 jobs. By Katy Austin, BBC News business correspondent  Some fitness clubs saw queues outside their doors this morning and members we spoke to said they were overjoyed to be back. However, it's inevitable some people do not yet feel ready to exercise around others indoors.  The fortunes of gyms, pools and leisure centres depend on instilling confidence in the safety measures they've put in place, as well as how much people are prepared to spend at a time of economic uncertainty. Membership cancellation rates have reached 15-23% due to the impact of the pandemic, trade body UKActive said. Meanwhile, online classes and home equipment sales have boomed. Today is an important milestone, but not all venues can afford to open straight away under the new arrangements. UKActive said support will still be needed with costs such as back-dated rent in coming months. The District Councils' Network (DCN) is also warning of the ""uncertain future"" faced by gyms and leisure centres, pointing out that the sector is expected to lose about £305m this year. The DCN, which represents 187 district councils in England that provide leisure services, is calling on the Treasury to provide a rescue package to save leisure centres from collapse. Leisure centres and indoor gyms, along with swimming pools and other indoor sports facilities were closed on 21 March as part of measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus."
Spread to US Treasury,UK interest rates cut in emergency move,2024-09-25,2020-03-11,By Szu Ping Chan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51831004,"The Bank of England has announced an emergency cut in interest rates to shore up the economy amid the coronavirus outbreak. Policymakers reduced rates from 0.75% to 0.25%, taking borrowing costs back down to the lowest level in history. The Bank said it would also free up billions of pounds of extra lending power to help banks support firms. It comes as the chancellor is expected to announce further measures to support growth and jobs in the Budget later. Mark Carney, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, said policymakers had seen a ""sharp fall in trading conditions"", including spending on non-essential goods.  ""The Bank of England's role is to help UK businesses and households manage through an economic shock that could prove large and sharp, but should be temporary,"" he said. He said the Bank's co-ordinated action on Budget day was designed to have ""maximum impact"". Mr Carney stressed that the economic damage caused by the coronavirus remained unclear. However, he suggested that the UK economy could shrink in the coming months. He said early evidence from China suggested that the world's second largest economy was on course to contract in the first quarter. Other nations were experiencing a ""similar shift"", he said. ""I would emphasise the direction is clear, though the orders of magnitude are still to be determined."" While the Bank's last emergency rate cut was in October 2008, Mr Carney said the virus was unlikely to inflict the damage seen during the financial crisis. ""There is no reason for it to be as bad as 2008 if we act as we have, and if there is that targeted support,"" he said. The emergency rate cut comes as a sixth person died from the virus in the UK, which has a total of 382 cases.  The latest person to die was a man in his early 80s who had underlying health conditions. Meanwhile, Manchester City's Premier League match against Arsenal on Wednesday has been postponed as ""a precautionary measure"" because of the outbreak.  A number of Arsenal players are in self-isolation after coming into contact with Olympiakos owner Evangelos Marinakis, who tested positive for the virus.. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged to help the UK battle the impact of the coronavirus, saying the NHS will get ""whatever resources it needs"" during the crisis, while he is also expected to unveil measures to boost the self-employed and small businesses who are left out of pocket. Meanwhile, NHS England said it was scaling up its capacity for testing people for the infection, with the number of cases set to rise. The sudden cut in the Bank rate will immediately reduce the mortgage bill of a minority of homeowners. Others will have to wait to see how their home loan provider reacts at a time when mortgage rates are already at very low levels.  Little will change for savers, who have had to endure years of low returns anyway. They may take heart from the fact this is a temporary measure from the Bank.  Most people are, of course, savers and borrowers.  As well as concern over their physical health from coronavirus, their financial health will primarily depend on their job.  This emergency action is clearly designed to help protect businesses, particularly small and medium-sized ones, and in turn the employment of millions of people.  The interest rate cut was part of a package of measures introduced by the Bank to support the economy. It also announced a new £100bn scheme to help ensure households and businesses - particularly small and medium-sized firms - benefit from the reduction in interest rates. The Bank of England said other changes would free up an additional £190bn for banks to lend. It said the package of measures would ""help UK businesses and households bridge across the economic disruption that is likely to be associated with Covid-19"". The Bank said it expected UK economic activity to ""weaken materially"" over the coming months, but it was ready to take ""all further necessary steps to support the UK economy"". ""These measures will help to keep firms in business and people in jobs and help prevent a temporary disruption from causing longer-lasting economic harm."" Initially, the pound fell against both the euro and the dollar in reaction to the rate cut, but then rebounded. Share markets reacted positively, with the FTSE 100 rising more than 2% in early trading. Separate data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the UK economy stagnated in the three months to January. The dramatic emergency rate cut will dominate the headlines, but it is the overall package of measures which the departing Bank of England governor Mark Carney will stress as a support for the economy in this extraordinary coronavirus crisis. The key target of this move is the cashflow of small and medium-sized businesses, which could be hit by a combination of slumping demand, trade difficulties and staff absence. The Bank and Treasury agree that this will be a temporary shock. The aim, therefore, is to prevent unnecessary permanent economic scars. Alongside Budget measures, it is designed as a bridge beyond the virus. So the Bank's base rate is slashed to its record low, first reached in the aftermath of the EU referendum. But as important is the new TFSME - the ""Term Funding scheme with additional incentives for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". This proved rather successful after the EU referendum, and the aim is to get the banks to pass on the rate cut in full to businesses, particularly small and medium-sized firms, which face the greatest pressure to cut staff or hours in a crisis. Cutting the amount of money that banks are required to squirrel away when the sun is shining so they can spend the cash during this sort of rainy day should provide the firepower for banks to boost lending well above current lending levels.  To be clear, coronavirus is unique and highly unpredictable. There is a fundamental problem of people and businesses not being able to function because of the measures to contain the virus. The message from the Bank is that the banking system is fully padded up to help businesses get through this. What are your experiences relating to the coronavirus outbreak?

Spread to US Treasury,Island ferries get £6.5m coronavirus handout,2024-09-25,2021-01-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-55662708,"Three Isle of Wight ferry operators will share a £6.5m government grant to maintain services through the coronavirus pandemic. Wightlink, Red Funnel and Hovertravel have all seen passenger numbers slump. A Treasury statement said the funding would support crossings that ensured medical services and essential supplies like food and medicine were maintained. The ferry operators have been hit by a slump in cross-Solent tourism and commuter traffic over the past year. The government has already allowed the temporary suspension of competition law so ferry operators can work together to continue to run essential services despite reduced usage during the pandemic. The companies jointly agreed new limited timetables to maintain ""lifeline"" services between Portsmouth and Southampton and the Isle of Wight during the first national lockdown in March 2020. Some services were brought back as lockdown restrictions eased, but operators still reported lower than expected traveller numbers, with Red Funnel announcing 50 job losses in August. Red Funnel said the funding would be used to maintain its ""lifeline service"", but added it did not expect the support ""will be enough to offset the growing losses"" it had suffered since the start of the pandemic.  Wightlink said some of its ferries were carrying fewer than 20 passengers at a time. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Steve Barclay, said it was vital ""no community or region is left behind"" during the pandemic. ""These ferry services are essential to everyday life on the Isle of Wight, and this further package of funding will help ensure residents can continue to access healthcare and essential goods and services,"" he said. Wightlink chief executive Keith Greenfield said it was ""disappointing"" its FastCat passenger service between Portsmouth Harbour and Ryde was not included in the support package.  ""Although more essential travellers are crossing the Solent at present, compared to the first lockdown in spring 2020, Wightlink continues to make losses during the pandemic and the government support just announced will not change that,"" he said.   Its Lymington-Yarmouth and Portsmouth-Fishbourne car ferry routes are currently operating limited services. Neil Chapman, managing director of Hovertravel, said income from its passenger fares were also ""vastly reduced"".  ""This latest funding will help us maintain our critical community service carrying medical staff, other key workers, essential freight and Royal Mail, while also operating our Island Rescue service for rapid-off island transfer of stretcher patients,"" he added. The number of people crossing the Solent has tumbled during the latest lockdown.  Not as far as during the first wave of the pandemic - this time, more people are continuing to travel for work. But it's still nowhere near commercial viability for tye cross-Solent ferry operators. With most seats on most sailings empty, the firms lose money on every crossing.  These are lifeline services, so the Government had little choice but to step in. It's perhaps surprising that the taxpayer isn't going to prop up the passenger ferry between Portsmouth and Ryde. So that route will remain suspended. "
Spread to US Treasury,Fifth of workers 'could be off sick at virus peak',2024-09-25,2020-03-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51718917,"Up to a fifth of the workforce may be off sick during the peak of a coronavirus epidemic in the UK, the government says in its latest plans.  Police may need to focus on only the most serious crimes and maintaining public order if the virus spreads.  The military could also provide support to emergency services if needed.  The government's response is in its first stage - containing the outbreak - with the number of UK cases rising from 39 to 51 on Tuesday. Out of the positive cases, 12 people have since recovered.  It is ""highly likely"" the UK will see further infection, the prime minister has warned, and the next phase of government contingency planning will be to do with delaying the spread of the virus. If the coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, becomes widespread, some non-urgent hospital care may be delayed to focus on treating those who are infected, while recently retired doctors and nurses may be called back to work.  Other possible measures include school closures, reducing large-scale gatherings and working from home. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that widespread transmission of the virus across the UK was becoming ""more likely"" and urged people to ""act on official medical advice"". Meanwhile, 12 new cases of coronavirus have been announced in England, eight of whom had travelled from Italy, and one each from Germany, Singapore, Japan and Iran. The patients are from London, Hampshire, Northamptonshire, Bury, Wirral, Greater Manchester and Hull. Consultancy firm Deloitte said one of its employees had tested positive for the virus after returning from Asia. A spokesman said one of the floors in its UK offices was affected. A British woman has also been diagnosed with the virus at a hotel in Tenerife that was hit by an outbreak of the virus last week. About 90,000 people have been infected globally since the outbreak of Covid-19, with cases in more than 50 countries and more than 3,000 deaths.  A British man who was infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan became the first UK citizen to die from the virus last week.  The Queen was seen wearing white gloves when she carried out an investiture at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday.  The palace would not confirm if the decision was linked to the coronavirus outbreak. It's a finely balanced judgement - not wanting to scare the public but being straight with them about what might happen and how intervention to limit the spread of the virus might affect their everyday lives. The government has chosen to make no secret of its assumption that things could well get significantly worse - after all the coronavirus plan published today is entitled ""a guide to what you can expect across the UK"". If medical experts are assuming widespread transmission of the virus ministers can hardly hide that from the public.  Preparing secret contingency plans for school closures and then risking an uncontrolled leak might worry people more. The plan, though, contains few details of how new powers might be used and how the NHS might find the beds and staff to cope with an increased number of very sick patients.  In the weeks ahead there will be increasing questions about the measures which have been flagged up with the launch of the plan. While the vast majority of patients in the UK will have a mild to moderate illness, similar to seasonal flu, a minority will require hospital care and a small proportion could die, the government's plans warn. There are no estimates given in the plans but they do warn of an increase in deaths, particularly among the elderly and those with existing health conditions. Young children can become infected and ""suffer severe illness"", but overall the illness is less common in the under-20s. It is possible an outbreak could come in multiple waves, the government said.  Wales' chief medical officer has suggested cases of coronavirus could increase from April with a peak in May or June. There are four stages to the government's response, which also includes mitigating the impact of the virus once it becomes established and a research programme to improve diagnostics and treatment for the disease. Boris Johnson reiterated on Tuesday that the ""single most important thing"" people could do was wash their hands with soap and hot water for the length of time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice.  He added: ""I want to stress that for the vast majority of the people of this country, we should be going about our business as usual."" Mr Johnson said schools should stay open ""if possible"" and follow advice from Public Health England.  Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has ordered Treasury officials to work up plans to support the public health response, businesses and the economy in his Budget on 11 March. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has said Labour would seek to work ""constructively"" with the government. However, he has called for emergency legislation to ensure those working in the gig economy are guaranteed sick pay, and for the government to provide emergency funding to support the NHS through the outbreak.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has warned the NHS was already at 94% bed occupancy before coronavirus hit. Mr Hancock told MPs that people who needed to self-isolate to protect others were entitled to sick pay. He added that resources had been increased to the NHS, but did not rule out the government taking future action if needed. In other developments:  As of Tuesday morning, the Department of Health said 13,911 people had been tested in the UK, of which 13,860 were negative.  The outbreak originated in China's Hubei province in December before spreading globally. The battle plan stops short of predicting how many people would be infected in an epidemic in the UK. Worst case scenario modelling suggests 80% of people can become infected when there is a new virus like this. But officials believe it will not be this high. The evidence suggests just over half of people infected develop symptoms and 1% of those infected could die. The elderly and those with existing health conditions are the most at risk. If there is a widespread transmission - which seems highly likely at this stage - it could take two or three months to peak. The peak would last two or three weeks and about 50% of people who become infected could become infected in those peak weeks.  There would then be a period of two or three months of declining cases, although the battle plan acknowledges there could be multiple waves. The government is likely to use its most drastic measures at its disposal just ahead of the peak in an attempt to flatten it. What questions do you have about the UK's preparations?

Spread to US Treasury,From employment to interest rates... the next few weeks are critical,2024-09-25,2023-09-09,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66755407,"So far 2023 has seen some false dawns for the UK economy. The next few weeks' data are critical. Recession has been avoided but growth has bumped along the bottom. And even as inflation falls from the double-digit levels of a year ago, it has proven more stubborn and sticky, and spread to the service sector. The ONS's recent huge revision of historical growth changes the picture of the immediate post-pandemic recovery, especially relative to other European countries. But a broader reassessment of UK prospects may have to wait for news in the coming weeks. Data released in September could show whether the crises of the past three years are being put firmly behind us. Expectations within government are for the rollercoaster ride to continue for the next few weeks at least.  Unemployment might tick up again when new figures are released on Tuesday. However, the UK should finally return to a situation where earnings are growing by more than the rise in the cost of living too. The economy (GDP) could also have shrunk a little in July - we'll find out on Wednesday. Rising fuel prices in August are likely to lead to a blip in the latest inflation numbers, released the following Wednesday, according to both Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey. All of this will feed into the Bank of England's interest rate decision in a fortnight. A rate rise had been expected, but recent hints have suggested the Bank may prefer to keep rates at current levels for longer. Against this backdrop, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is plugging the latest data into its forecasts to be published in November, alongside the Autumn Statement. On the face of it, higher wages are pushing up the tax take, meaning that this year's borrowing numbers are coming in less than originally forecast. However, there is more red ink pouring into the projections. At the Budget forecast in March, the peak in Bank of England rates was expected to be 4.3%. It is already 5.25%. Ten-year UK borrowing rates were forecast to be an average of 3.6% in March, and they reached 4.8% last month.  The OBR already stated at the Budget that a one percentage point rise in borrowing costs would increase borrowing by £20bn in 2027-28, ""wiping out headroom"" in its forecast. When the OBR points out that the Treasury is not on course to meet its self-imposed constraints on borrowing, that can result in pressure for tax rises or spending cuts. Right now the political conversation is about the opposite - pre-election tax cuts, or more spending on, for example, school repairs. For the chancellor, this autumn should help settle Britain on a stable, steady economic trajectory. It will not be spectacular, but it will be a world away from last year's shambles under his predecessor. Inflation should continue to fall, down to 3% in a year's time. The UK will stay in a respectable middle lane of growth in the major G7 economies. The Treasury's main medium-term policy focus will be acknowledging and trying to deal with the UK's relatively poor record on business investment. The Budget contained a suite of measures designed to help ease the labour supply problem. The Autumn Statement will be about this business investment challenge. The Treasury thinks it explains a quarter of the UK's productivity underperformance with other major economies. The prize, if the UK was as productive as Germany, for example, would be an increase in GDP per head of £6,000. But households are very much not out of the woods. Even a declining headline rate of inflation, and rising average earnings, will not mask increasing pain as rising interest rates hit homeowners and renters. The ONS consumer habits survey shows the bulk of people still spending more than usual on food shopping, buying less, and noticing less variety on the shelves. Supermarkets notice hundreds of thousands of home meals, replacing eating out. Banks notice mortgage holders who used to shop at the priciest of supermarkets switching to discount retailers. By the end of the month the Bank of England could give a definitive steer that interest rates have peaked at 5.5%, albeit at the cost of their staying at such a level for the next year or so. Industry is confident that high stocks of gas, and the ability to reduce demand, mean the whole of Europe should be resilient to any further energy market disruptions. But the combination of some further stoppage in gas tanker trade and a very cold winter still has the capacity to create a nasty inflationary surprise in the new year. A path to a more normal economic situation could emerge soon. The data about to be released should give some big clues."

Bristol Waste has opened two shops in Avonmouth and St Phillips and is set to open a third in Hartcliffe in spring. According to the group, waste increases by 20 percent over Christmas and has risen in general during the pandemic. A Bristol Waste volunteer said people could try changing their ""Christmas rituals"" to support the reuse economy. The two ""treasure trove"" reuse shops were opened during the pandemic. Avonmouth reuse shop volunteer, Barbara Bloomfield, bought all of her presents from the shop for £15 and said she was passionate about ""not buying things I don't need"". ""I wanted to do a tiny bit for the waste economy,"" she said. ""Every Christmas we are giving millions of pounds of unwanted gifts.  ""Really, there is something you can do about that, you can just make something for people and people love it. ""I understand that some people really want their kids to have new things. ""Before you do anything, look through the lens of changing your rituals. ""We have used a Christmas tree in a pot for ten years now and that's saved us quite a lot of money every year."" Bristol Waste shared a few tips to save waste during and after the Christmas period: A Bristol Waste spokeswoman said: ""Wrapping paper can confuse people.  ""In Bristol we can't recycle wrapping paper because it's normally covered in a film or glitter. That's why we advise to use brown paper instead. ""When the shops open back up after Christmas on the 5 January you can go in to drop off your unwanted items and we'll find them a new home."" All profits raised from the shop will go towards a reuse scheme to perform safety tests on electrical items. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Spread to US Treasury,Calls for Wales to copy English council tax rebate,2024-09-25,2022-02-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-60248094,"The Welsh government says it will make an announcement ""in due course"" on what it will do with £175m resulting from a council tax rebate in England. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced a rebate for residents in band A-D properties, after the energy price cap was hiked. Welsh Conservatives say Labour should match the plan. Labour Welsh ministers say they want to target the extra money to ""those who need it most"". They accused the UK government of loading ""even more costs"" onto consumers bills after it announced a Great Britain-wide electricity bill discount of £200 from October that will be paid off in £40 instalments over five years. Citizens Advice Cymru warned 230,000 low-income households would not benefit from an England-style rebate, because they do not have to pay the tax through Welsh government council tax benefits. On Thursday the energy regulator Ofcom announced that the price cap will rise by £693, with average bills climbing to £1,971. In a statement Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt said her colleagues ""are considering how to target this at those who need it most. A further announcement will be made in due course"". ""It is time the UK government acted to support households and to address the turmoil in the domestic energy markets."" She called for social policy costs on household energy bills to be moved to general taxation, and further and increased support through the warm home discount and other winter fuel payment schemes. The Welsh government said that band D council tax in England is £167 higher on average than in Wales. Earlier this week Cardiff ministers announced they would double a fuel help scheme for people on working age benefits, from £100 to £200. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said: ""As the British economy continues its recovery from the pandemic, we must confront the global inflationary pressures caused by the world economy coming swiftly back to life."" ""With Labour ministers in Cardiff Bay set to receive £175m as a result of the Chancellor's action plan, it's vital they use this money immediately to fund tax rebates and create a discretionary fund for local authorities to use on households who do not meet the criteria."" Plaid Cymru Treasury spokesman, MP for Ceredigion Ben Lake, said: ""The [UK]government needs to re-evaluate its decisions - tax hikes and welfare cuts are simply not what households or businesses need right now. I urge the chancellor to increase Universal Credit now and to match Plaid Cymru's funding calls to end fuel poverty this decade in Wales. ""It is now for the Welsh government to get funding out of the door and to households, including those unconnected to the mains gas grid. But we need to do more and implement improved household energy efficiency measures to reduce bills, benefit our climate and give us long-term energy security."" Rebecca Woolley, Director of Citizens Advice Cymru said: ""The package of measures announced by the UK government will provide some relief for all households in April, but it doesn't go far enough for people on low incomes. ""Energy rebates are a buy now pay later solution which only provide temporary relief later this year."" She added: ""The Welsh government needs to intervene to make sure those who have been hit hardest by the pandemic, are not left even further behind.""  In the Commons the Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""The price cap has meant that the impact of soaring gas prices has so far fallen predominantly on energy companies. ""It is not sustainable to keep holding the price of energy artificially low. ""For me to stand here and pretend we don't have to adjust to paying higher prices would be wrong and dishonest. ""But what we can do is take the sting out of a significant price shock for millions of families by making sure that the increase in prices is smaller initially and spread over a longer period."""
Spread to US Treasury,The people battling America's worst coronavirus outbreak,2024-09-25,2020-06-15,By Joshua Cheetham,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52941984,"When Valentina Blackhorse tested positive for coronavirus, she texted her sister and told her not to worry.  A former pageant queen, Valentina was known for her love of her Native American Navajo heritage, her passion for helping others and her playful sense of humour. She doted on her one-year-old daughter, Poet, and worked as a government administrator, with dreams of leading her people some day as Navajo president. When coronavirus reached the reservation on which she lived, Valentina warned her family to stay indoors and take precautions. Weeks later her boyfriend Bobby fell ill and she tended to him at their home in Kayenta, a small town near the sandstone buttes of Arizona's Monument Valley.  She'd lived with rheumatoid arthritis her whole life, but soon her joint pain started to feel different, and breathing wasn't so easy. She took herself for a test and the results came back a week later, confirming her fears. The next day, when Valentina's breathing got worse, Bobby rushed her to a health clinic. She died hours later, aged 28. ""She overcame a lot of things in her life,"" said her sister, Vanielle. ""I thought she was strong enough to pull through."" Valentina was one of the youngest victims of coronavirus in the Navajo Nation, a Native American reservation grappling with what is America's worst outbreak. Since Covid-19 was first reported in the Nation on 15 March, infection rates per capita have become the highest in the country when compared with any individual state. As of 14 June, 6,611 cases have been confirmed. More than 300 people have died after contracting the virus as well - a toll higher than 15 states. The Navajo Nation is the largest reservation of its kind, in both size and population. More than 173,000 people live within its borders, in pockets of communities spread across the deserts and canyons of Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. If it were a state, the Nation would be larger than 10 others.  The Navajo - or Diné, as they call themselves - have lived in the region for centuries, but the Navajo Nation is an American construct. After US expansion forced thousands of Navajo to leave their homes, America carved out a stretch of land where they could maintain some sovereignty. In return, the federal government pledged to support its people with funding for education, healthcare and other services. The Navajo have contributed much to America's development. Perhaps most famously, Navajo soldiers invented a military code, based on their language, that kept American communications secure during World War Two. But as coronavirus has swept through the reservation, it has underscored many of the social and economic inequalities that continue to affect the tribe - all contributing to one another, and all making the outbreak worse.  ""If we had better resources, maybe [Valentina] would still be alive,"" said Vanielle. Many residents struggle with money. The reservation's unemployment rate is approximately 40%, and a similar number live below the poverty line, earning less than $12,760 (£10,191) a year. These factors exacerbate health problems among the Navajo and a third of the population suffers from diabetes, heart conditions and lung disease. In some cases, people have fallen ill after years of radiation exposure from hundreds of abandoned uranium mines dotted around the desert.  Severely limited access to healthy food also plays a role. The Navajo Nation spans 71,000 sq km (27,413 sq miles) but has only 13 grocery stores, forcing many residents to drive for hours to towns outside the reservation with better facilities. It is common for people from different households to travel in one vehicle during these excursions because they are unable to afford petrol, further heightening their risk of catching coronavirus. Relief efforts have been hampered by limited healthcare resources, too. The reservation's dozen medical facilities hold just 200 hospital beds - approximately one bed for every 900 residents, and a third the national rate. As a result, some coronavirus patients have been moved to makeshift quarantine facilities, while others have been transferred to hospitals outside the reservation.  Many homes are multi-generational as well, making it easier for the virus to spread to elderly and vulnerable residents. A third of households have no access to running water or electricity either, making it hard for thousands of people to wash their hands regularly and to stave off infection. ""This is something that is year-round, it's been going on since we were put on reservations,"" says Emma Robbins, head of DigDeep, a charity that's delivering bottled water and improving access to running water in the Nation. Ms Robbins was born on the reservation. She now lives nearly 600km (373 miles) away in Los Angeles, California, but is unable to return due to travel restrictions. ""I fear for my family and I fear for my friends,"" she told the BBC, tearfully. ""Hearing these stories and not being able to go home is really hard and I feel so hopeless."" But despite their hardship, Ms Robbins says she feels frustrated by the tone of victimhood that often colours discussions about her tribe. ""It's really trendy to do things surrounding the Navajo Nation in terms of 'Oh look how bad it is here,' but I don't think people highlight enough of the amazing efforts on the ground and the positivity,"" she adds. In response to the outbreak, the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs told the BBC it had taken ""unprecedented actions to support Indian Country,"" providing the Navajo with protective equipment, contamination trailers, and other technical assistance.  The Navajo Nation has also received $600m under the CARES Act, a $2tn economic stimulus package to shore up local economies and communities during the pandemic. But local authorities only received the money a month after the bill was signed into law. In the meantime, the Navajo and 10 other tribes successfully sued the US Treasury over funding disparities in the CARES Act for Native American groups. In the midst of federal funding delays, the Navajo Nation had to rely on donations and its own resources in the crucial early weeks of the outbreak. Navajo President Jonathan Nez has co-ordinated the distribution of food and medical supplies to local residents, and introduced some of the strictest lockdown measures in the US - imposing a series of 57-hour weekend curfew. Locals are stepping in to help as well. More than $5.1m has been raised for the 'Navajo & Hopi Families Covid-19 Relief Fund' - a crowdfunding campaign started by former Navajo attorney general Ethel Branch. In an unusual twist, thousands of dollars have come from donors in Ireland - many paying respect to Choctaw Indians who, in 1847, donated $170 towards relief efforts in Ireland during the Great Hunger. With help from volunteers, Ms Branch has used the donations to deliver food, water and hand sanitiser to thousands of residents. But poor infrastructure has presented a challenge at times. ""There's one community that's really isolated and we're trying to figure out how to get food there,"" she told the BBC. ""The easiest way would be to go directly, but it's all dirt road, and if we stick to the pavement, that adds on another hour and a half."" Language barriers have also been a deciding factor in the Navajo Nation's response to the outbreak.  As with all public communications, it shares coronavirus updates in the Navajo language as well as English. This is driven by desires to maintain cultural heritage, but is a practical step as well because some residents speak only Navajo, or have limited English skills. In Navajo, coronavirus is translated as Dikos Ntsaaígíí-19, or Big Cough-19. But several residents have told the BBC they believe this translation downplays the severity of coronavirus. Among them is Agnes Attakai, a Navajo Nation native and a director at the University of Arizona's School of Public Health. She said a renaming should be explored in consultation with traditional Navajo healers. ""You have to be respectful of using the language and not invite the negativity of that particular illness,"" said Ms Attakai. ""Once you start respecting and addressing it appropriately… people will be engaged more to change their behaviours rather than linking it up with cough and pneumonia."" But Navajo President Jonathan Nez said it was ""unfair"" to suggest the translation did not adequately convey the dangers. ""That's an excuse being played out there,"" he told the BBC. ""We're respecting our elders and our traditional teaching by avoiding utilising the word death and anything that would bring negativity or hardship on our people."" Looking ahead, as surrounding states begin easing lockdown measures, many residents are concerned about a possible second wave of infections hitting the reservation. ""There's still much uncertainty right now, but I'm hopeful,"" said President Nez. ""You've got to be hopeful to be the leader of the Navajo people."""
Spread to US Treasury,Garth's Team of the Week,2024-09-25,2018-03-04,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/43278167,"Manchester City's relentless charge towards the Premier League title continued as they beat last season's champions Chelsea courtesy of a Bernardo Silva goal. It was not such a good weekend for Arsenal, who lost again - this time at Brighton - to further increase the pressure on manager Arsene Wenger. Liverpool brushed aside Newcastle and Tottenham eased to victory over Huddersfield. At the bottom, Swansea claimed a big win, beating West Ham 4-1, while West Brom limped to another damaging defeat - 1-0 at Watford. You've seen my picks this week. But who would you go for? Choose your XI from the shortlist selected by BBC Sport journalists and share it with your friends. Let's be honest, VAR (video assistant referees) has been a disaster. Quite what business the Football Association, which hosts the oldest club competition in the world, is doing experimenting with such a high-profile property beggars belief.  For over 100 years the referee's 'opinion' has been final. With the aid of technology the FA and now Fifa, from what I understand, are about to bow to science, and an element of public pressure, and spit on the game's roots and most sacrosanct tradition by introducing this technological evil.  I know I will be labelled a luddite but before you condemn me let's consider what is at stake here.  The game has, for generations, respected the view of the referee. The technocrats in the game told us that goal-line technology was essential and without it the game was being starved of natural justice. I could have lived without goal-line technology but I see the logic. However, what VAR is attempting to do is reduce the referee to a mere traffic warden.  Every conceivable angle is covered in a Premier League fixture and quite rightly so. The public pay though the nose to see live football and therefore should get value for money. But the game itself should be assessed on the values it has always set itself and that is the referee's 'view' must be the final arbiter and must be respected.  Referees have never had eyes at the back of their heads, and neither should they, but that is what VAR is proposing. What VAR is about to do is challenge every decision based on the letter of the law.  Well, if you did that you could arguably find an infringement in every challenge regardless of which team you supported. The match would eventually grind to a halt.  The game has always been about opinions and on the field of play there is only one opinion that counts and that is the referee. He can only give what he sees. VAR sees everything and will only serve to complicate matters. It will not make the game better.   It is the lack of respect for referees that is in danger of killing the game and allowed VAR to take centre stage. And I must say it is doing it very badly.

Spread to US Treasury,Venezuela crisis - in nine charts,2024-09-25,2019-01-27,By the Visual Journalism team,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-46999668,"Growing discontent in Venezuela, fuelled by hyperinflation, power cuts and food and medicine shortages, has led to a political crisis. Opposition leader Juan Guaidó has declared himself interim president following large protests, galvanising opponents of current socialist President Nicolás Maduro. At least 40 people are believed to have died since 21 January and the UN has warned that the situation could spiral out of control. More than three million Venezuelans have fled their country over recent years, blaming hunger, lack of medical care, rising unemployment and violent crime. Here are nine charts that try to explain what's going on.  The biggest problem facing Venezuelans in their day-to-day lives is hyperinflation.  According to a study by the opposition-controlled National Assembly, the annual inflation rate reached 1,300,000% in the 12 months to November 2018. By the end of last year, prices were doubling every 19 days on average. This has left many Venezuelans struggling to afford basic items such as food and toiletries. The number of bolivars - the national currency - needed to buy US$1 has also rocketed. Venezuela once boasted Latin America's richest economy - boosted by the biggest oil reserves on the planet. But under former president Hugo Chávez, who died in 2013, and current President Maduro, corruption, mismanagement and high levels of debt have seen the country's economy collapse. President Chávez took advantage of the oil boom in the 2000s to borrow heavily and government spending soared.  Then, during President Maduro's first term in office, the Venezuelan economy went into freefall.  Many blame him and his socialist government for worsening the country's decline. President Maduro blames ""imperialists"" - the likes of the US and Europe - for waging ""economic war"" against Venezuela and imposing sanctions on many members of his government. Plummeting oil prices in 2016 compounded the oil-dependant country's crisis. Venezuelans are going hungry.  Of those questioned for the country's annual living conditions survey (Encovi 2017), eight out of 10 said they were eating less because they did not have enough food at home. Six out of 10 said they had gone to bed hungry because they did not have the money to buy food. And this is taking its toll on the nation's health.  Most people (64.3%) said they had lost weight in 2017 - 11.4kg on average, with the poorest losing most. Other key findings of the study included:  As a result, Venezuelans are turning to forgotten vegetables and foodstuffs that were once considered a ""poor people's food"". The yuca  - or cassava - root vegetable, for example, is versatile, cheap and a traditional substitute for potatoes.  It can be boiled or fried - which fast food chain McDonald's used to its advantage in 2015, changing their Venezuelan menu from potato fries to yuca fries. Venezuela has suffered a huge rise in the number of malaria cases in recent years - in stark contrast to neighbouring countries in Latin America, where numbers are falling.  Having been the first country certified to have eliminated the disease in 1961, Venezuela now has cases in at least 10 out of 24 states. Canadian NGO Icaso has said leaked government reports show the spread includes the hard-to-eradicate form of malaria - plasmodium vivax. The Venezuelan Health Observatory has reported widespread shortages of antimalarial drugs - for all strains. Jose Felix Oletta, infectious disease specialist and former health minister, says projections for 2018 suggest an increase of 50% in the number of cases on 2017. ""At this pace, we will have more than one million cases in one year,"" he told Icaso. ""These were numbers Venezuela had at the beginning of the 20th Century. Malaria is out of control in Venezuela."" Measles and diphtheria have also returned with a vengeance. Venezuela holds the world's largest supply of crude oil, and petroleum products make up the vast majority of the country's exports. Production held virtually steady from 2002 - just before the national strike - to 2008, when global oil prices peaked. Figures from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) show the country earned bout $60bn from oil that year. But the collapse in oil prices towards the end of 2014 - a year after Mr Chávez died from cancer - decimated the country's already-struggling oil-dependant economy. The country hit crisis levels the following year, with GDP shrinking by almost 6% and inflation soaring.  Oil output has been declining since. Venezuela is heavily reliant on the US for its oil revenue - sending 41% of its oil exports there.  On 29 January, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuela's state-owned oil firm PDVSA, saying proceeds of the purchase of Venezuelan oil would now be withheld from Mr Maduro's government. But US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the company could avoid sanctions by recognising opposition leader Mr Guaidó. Three million Venezuelans have left their home country since 2014, according to the UN. The majority of those leaving have crossed into neighbouring Colombia, some then move on to Ecuador, Peru and Chile. Others have gone south to Brazil. Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez has disputed the UN's figures, saying they are inflated by ""enemy countries"" trying to justify a military intervention. The US, more than a dozen Latin American countries, and Canada have come out in support of Mr Guaidó - leader of Venezuela's elected National Congress - undermining President Maduro.  A number of European countries, including the UK, France, Germany, Spain have also officially recognised Mr Guaidó as interim president of Venezuela. Russia has condemned foreign support for Mr Guaidó, saying it violates international law and is a ""direct path to bloodshed"". China and Turkey also back Mr Maduro.

Spread to US Treasury,Omicron now dominant virus variant in Scotland,2024-09-25,2021-12-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-59701008,"The Omicron variant is now thought to have replaced Delta as the dominant form of the virus in Scotland. The heavily-mutated Covid variant is likely to have been responsible for 51% of the cases recorded across the country on Friday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it suggested that the ""tsunami"" of cases she warned about last week was now beginning to happen. New restrictions aimed at limiting the spread of the variant are now in force. People have been urged to stay at home as much as possible in the lead up to Christmas, and to meet with no more than three households at a time.  And shops and hospitality outlets have to introduce measures to reduce crowding and queueing, erect screens and barriers and enforce the wearing of face masks. A further 4,336 new cases of Covid were reported in Scotland on Friday, of which 51% showed the so-called S-Gene dropout that is typical of the Omicron variant. There are now four people in hospital with confirmed cases of the new variant - two more than previously.  Ms Sturgeon said: ""Cases have already increased by more than 40% in the past week, and we should expect to see that continue and indeed accelerate in the period ahead. ""The tsunami I warned about a week ago is now starting to hit us.""  The first minister said the emergence of Omicron had been the ""cruellest of blows"" ahead of Christmas. She stressed that the country now had much more effective protection against the virus than it did a year ago, with booster doses of the vaccine appearing to be very effective in reducing the risk of serious illness from Omicron.  But Ms Sturgeon said the recent increase in cases was expected to ""continue and accelerate"", adding: ""As of now the scale and the immediacy of the challenge it presents is of profound concern."" The first minister also said people should ""think very carefully"" about every interaction with other people due to the ""not insignificant"" risk of catching Covid. She said that anyone who tested positive now would be isolating over Christmas, and that people planning to do something with other people should make a judgement about ""whether it is worth it to you to run the risk of not being with your family on Christmas Day"". Several bands have cancelled gigs in recent days despite large-scale events still being allowed under the new regulations. Sunday's League Cup Final between Hibernian and Celtic at Hampden Park in Glasgow will still go ahead, with Deputy First Minister John Swinney saying on Wednesday that people should still attend large events as long as they are fully vaccinated and have a negative lateral flow test.  The Scottish government has previously said it will make £100m available to businesses affected by the new guidance that came into force at midnight - although some industry leaders have criticised a lack of clarity over when the money will actually be distributed.  Ms Sturgeon said that £66m of this will go to the hospitality sector, £8m to the food and drink supply chain affected by hospitality cancellations, £20m to the cultural sector, £3m to the wedding sector and £3m to the worst affected parts of tourism. She added: ""We are working with councils, enterprise agencies and others to ensure businesses get this money as soon as possible"", and repeated her call for the UK government to provide more funds. The first minister warned in a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday that further restrictions on ""high risk"" sectors may become unavoidable. She has urged him to either re-establish the furlough scheme or give the devolved administrations the means to set up similar initiatives of their own.  The two leaders had talks on Friday on the issue of funding, with a Scottish government spokesman saying the discussions were ""constructive"" but ""inconclusive"". He added: ""The prime minister agreed that there needed to be swift engagement with the Treasury on the immediate action needed, and committed to further talks over the weekend.   ""The first minister also made clear that the devolved administrations require clarity that additional funding support would be available - and also on how it can be triggered by any or all of the UK administrations - in the event of further protective measures being necessary to tackle the virus in the period ahead.""    Further talks will be held over the weekend.  Treasury sources have played down the prospect of a new fund - saying they wanted to concentrate on getting money allocated out to businesses who need it. The Treasury has already provided £220m of immediate funding to Scotland, but Scottish ministers say that this had been brought forward from next year and had already been budgeted for. A Treasury spokesman said it was closely monitoring the impact of the virus on the economy -  particularly the hospitality sector. He added: ""Our £400bn Covid support package will continue to help businesses well into spring next year and of course we will continue to respond proportionately to the changing path of the virus. ""To keep safeguarding our economic recovery and the lives and livelihoods of the British people our priority is now to make sure everyone has the opportunity to 'Get Boosted Now'. ""We will continue to work with the Scottish government in the weeks and months ahead in the face of this serious health crisis."""
Spread to US Treasury,"More than 17 million have used buy now, pay later",2024-09-25,2021-11-29,By Rebecca Wearn,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59433904,"More than 17 million UK customers have now used a buy now pay later (BNPL) company to make an online purchase, company data shows.  The payment method is also set to have its biggest Christmas yet, experts say.  BNPL firms allow people to manage their shopping, either by postponing their bill for a short while, or splitting it into more manageable chunks over time, interest free.   But critics say users too easily end up in debt and tougher rules are needed.  The biggest provider in the UK, Klarna, has seen its customer base double to 15 million since early 2020. The market's other main players, Clearpay and LayBuy, are also expanding fast. Growth is fastest among users in their 40s and 50s, showing BNPL is no longer just a millennial and Gen Z trend. A recent survey for Citizens Advice found that almost one in 10 people were planning to use BNPL to help with Christmas shopping.  Kate Hobson from Citizens Advice urged consumers ""not to spend more than they can afford"".  ""If you're considering using buy now pay later, make sure you understand what you're signing up for, how you'll make the repayments and what will happen if you can't pay on time,"" she added.  The main players in the market, however, feel they offer consumers a hassle-free means to pay for purchases without interest. It is also much cheaper than a credit card if late payment fees aren't incurred, they add. Klarna, which launched in the UK in 2014, charges no interest or fees if payments are on time and claims around 40% of users repay money early.  The service launched a ""pay now"" option and updated its terms ahead of an expected crackdown on the sector.  Platform Clearpay stresses it does not report late paying users to credit agencies, and maintains that many of its users are in fact better with their money than they are given credit for. ""There are misperceptions that young people are bad at saving and investing money, however a report by Accenture on Clearpay users has shown that young people are more cautious with money than older people,"" a spokesperson said. LayBuy saw transactions grow 500% between 2019 and 2020 and the company reported a 56% spike in transactions last November, as Christmas shopping commenced. The family-run business, which was the first to run affordability checks on users, has since listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.  Millions of shoppers use buy now pay later services to spread the cost of their online shopping throughout the year. Like any kind of credit, if you keep on top of it, it can be a sensible way of making sure you're not hit with a big bill at one point of the year.  But of course it also makes it more tempting to spend more than you would do otherwise, especially with fewer credit checks. At this time of year, with so many different credit options available and other bills due for payment, lots of customers can get stuck in a real quagmire.  It's always important to check the terms and conditions before you sign up - figure out what you are expected to pay back and when, don't just clip 'Pay Later' and hope for the best. If you do get into difficulties then flag it up quickly, most of the companies can arrange repayment plans with you which are more manageable if you contact them. And of course get advice from a debt charity directly if you are feeling stuck. The Treasury is consulting on how to regulate the BNPL sector, and the Financial Conduct Authority will publish proposals some time next year.  A Treasury spokesperson said it was taking a ""proportionate approach"".  ""Buy now pay later can be a helpful way to manage your finances so it's important that regulation is balanced and proportionate, ensuring that customers are given appropriate protections.""   But many charities want action to be taken sooner, arguing that many consumers could be pushed into borrowing more than they can afford this Christmas. Debt charity Christians Against Poverty recognises BNPL can be ""attractive"", especially at Christmas, but it worries users could lose track of spending.  ""We're particularly concerned about those consumers who turn to credit like BNPL as a means of keeping on top of essentials, like bills or the weekly food shop,"" said spokesman Jonathan Shaw.  ""Add to this the additional pressure to spend at Christmas and consumers can be left in an even more financially difficult situation.""  Growth in the sector shows no sign of slowing down. Established money brands Paypal and Monzo are poised to enter the market, and BNPL technology is evolving so that some brands can be used to make any purchase on any site. "

She took herself for a test and the results came back a week later, confirming her fears. The next day, when Valentina's breathing got worse, Bobby rushed her to a health clinic. She died hours later, aged 28. ""She overcame a lot of things in her life,"" said her sister, Vanielle. ""I thought she was strong enough to pull through."" Valentina was one of the youngest victims of coronavirus in the Navajo Nation, a Native American reservation grappling with what is America's worst outbreak. Since Covid-19 was first reported in the Nation on 15 March, infection rates per capita have become the highest in the country when compared with any individual state. As of 14 June, 6,611 cases have been confirmed. More than 300 people have died after contracting the virus as well - a toll higher than 15 states. The Navajo Nation is the largest reservation of its kind, in both size and population. More than 173,000 people live within its borders, in pockets of communities spread across the deserts and canyons of Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. If it were a state, the Nation would be larger than 10 others.  The Navajo - or Diné, as they call themselves - have lived in the region for centuries, but the Navajo Nation is an American construct. After US expansion forced thousands of Navajo to leave their homes, America carved out a stretch of land where they could maintain some sovereignty. In return, the federal government pledged to support its people with funding for education, healthcare and other services. The Navajo have contributed much to America's development. Perhaps most famously, Navajo soldiers invented a military code, based on their language, that kept American communications secure during World War Two. But as coronavirus has swept through the reservation, it has underscored many of the social and economic inequalities that continue to affect the tribe - all contributing to one another, and all making the outbreak worse.  ""If we had better resources, maybe [Valentina] would still be alive,"" said Vanielle. Many residents struggle with money. The reservation's unemployment rate is approximately 40%, and a similar number live below the poverty line, earning less than $12,760 (£10,191) a year. These factors exacerbate health problems among the Navajo and a third of the population suffers from diabetes, heart conditions and lung disease. In some cases, people have fallen ill after years of radiation exposure from hundreds of abandoned uranium mines dotted around the desert.  Severely limited access to healthy food also plays a role. The Navajo Nation spans 71,000 sq km (27,413 sq miles) but has only 13 grocery stores, forcing many residents to drive for hours to towns outside the reservation with better facilities. It is common for people from different households to travel in one vehicle during these excursions because they are unable to afford petrol, further heightening their risk of catching coronavirus. Relief efforts have been hampered by limited healthcare resources, too. The reservation's dozen medical facilities hold just 200 hospital beds - approximately one bed for every 900 residents, and a third the national rate. As a result, some coronavirus patients have been moved to makeshift quarantine facilities, while others have been transferred to hospitals outside the reservation.  Many homes are multi-generational as well, making it easier for the virus to spread to elderly and vulnerable residents. A third of households have no access to running water or electricity either, making it hard for thousands of people to wash their hands regularly and to stave off infection. ""This is something that is year-round, it's been going on since we were put on reservations,"" says Emma Robbins, head of DigDeep, a charity that's delivering bottled water and improving access to running water in the Nation. Ms Robbins was born on the reservation. She now lives nearly 600km (373 miles) away in Los Angeles, California, but is unable to return due to travel restrictions. ""I fear for my family and I fear for my friends,"" she told the BBC, tearfully. ""Hearing these stories and not being able to go home is really hard and I feel so hopeless."" But despite their hardship, Ms Robbins says she feels frustrated by the tone of victimhood that often colours discussions about her tribe. ""It's really trendy to do things surrounding the Navajo Nation in terms of 'Oh look how bad it is here,' but I don't think people highlight enough of the amazing efforts on the ground and the positivity,"" she adds. In response to the outbreak, the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs told the BBC it had taken ""unprecedented actions to support Indian Country,"" providing the Navajo with protective equipment, contamination trailers, and other technical assistance.  The Navajo Nation has also received $600m under the CARES Act, a $2tn economic stimulus package to shore up local economies and communities during the pandemic. But local authorities only received the money a month after the bill was signed into law. In the meantime, the Navajo and 10 other tribes successfully sued the US Treasury over funding disparities in the CARES Act for Native American groups. In the midst of federal funding delays, the Navajo Nation had to rely on donations and its own resources in the crucial early weeks of the outbreak. Navajo President Jonathan Nez has co-ordinated the distribution of food and medical supplies to local residents, and introduced some of the strictest lockdown measures in the US - imposing a series of 57-hour weekend curfew. Locals are stepping in to help as well. More than $5.1m has been raised for the 'Navajo & Hopi Families Covid-19 Relief Fund' - a crowdfunding campaign started by former Navajo attorney general Ethel Branch. In an unusual twist, thousands of dollars have come from donors in Ireland - many paying respect to Choctaw Indians who, in 1847, donated $170 towards relief efforts in Ireland during the Great Hunger. With help from volunteers, Ms Branch has used the donations to deliver food, water and hand sanitiser to thousands of residents. But poor infrastructure has presented a challenge at times. ""There's one community that's really isolated and we're trying to figure out how to get food there,"" she told the BBC. ""The easiest way would be to go directly, but it's all dirt road, and if we stick to the pavement, that adds on another hour and a half."" Language barriers have also been a deciding factor in the Navajo Nation's response to the outbreak.  As with all public communications, it shares coronavirus updates in the Navajo language as well as English. This is driven by desires to maintain cultural heritage, but is a practical step as well because some residents speak only Navajo, or have limited English skills. In Navajo, coronavirus is translated as Dikos Ntsaaígíí-19, or Big Cough-19. But several residents have told the BBC they believe this translation downplays the severity of coronavirus. Among them is Agnes Attakai, a Navajo Nation native and a director at the University of Arizona's School of Public Health. She said a renaming should be explored in consultation with traditional Navajo healers. ""You have to be respectful of using the language and not invite the negativity of that particular illness,"" said Ms Attakai. ""Once you start respecting and addressing it appropriately… people will be engaged more to change their behaviours rather than linking it up with cough and pneumonia."" But Navajo President Jonathan Nez said it was ""unfair"" to suggest the translation did not adequately convey the dangers. ""That's an excuse being played out there,"" he told the BBC. ""We're respecting our elders and our traditional teaching by avoiding utilising the word death and anything that would bring negativity or hardship on our people."" Looking ahead, as surrounding states begin easing lockdown measures, many residents are concerned about a possible second wave of infections hitting the reservation. ""There's still much uncertainty right now, but I'm hopeful,"" said President Nez. ""You've got to be hopeful to be the leader of the Navajo people."""
Spread to US Treasury,Week ahead in Parliament,2024-09-25,2018-02-23,By Mark D'Arcy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-43169995,"Parliament's Brexit phoney war continues this week, with key pieces of legislation being held back by the government. The Taxation (Cross Border Trade) Bill and the Trade Bill have both cleared their Commons committee stages, but they may now be marooned in parliamentary limbo until after Easter, while the fragmented tribes of Commons Remainers plot to attach toxic (to the government, anyway) amendments. Proposals on another key Brexit issue - immigration - float in the clouds nearby.  In the Lords, peers have barely begun their detailed scrutiny of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, and serious attempts to amend it won't start until after Easter.  So much for all the talk of Parliament being swamped by the legislative implications of the Leave vote. Instead, our lawmakers are sweeping up the last vestiges of uncontroversial measures about space ports and nuclear safeguards, and remarking to each other in the tones of a 1950s western, that it's ""quiet, too quiet."" Labour's flirtation with the idea of supporting Britain establishing ""a"" customs union with the EU may have dramatic implications for these and other bills when they do come to the wicket. If Labour whips in favour of amendments along those lines, the government could be in trouble, and Remain Conservatives may face a painful choice between their party and their euro-principles. But that is for the future. Next week there is a bit of novelty to divert MPs, in the form of two days of ""Estimates"" debates. The novel bit is that they will actually get to debate, er, the estimates, the government's detailed plans for spending taxpayers' money. For years Estimates Days were rather strange occasions, on which the Commons would be presented with a select committee report or two to debate, before rubber stamping plans to spend billions of pounds of public money. If any MP had the temerity to stray into the substance of what they were voting on, and suggest that more might be spent on X, and less on Y, they would be ruled out of order by the chair.  For a Parliament that once fought a civil war, and indeed beheaded a king, for the right to control the public purse strings, this seemed a little feeble. And now, some deft behind the scenes re-jigging has given MPs control over the subjects to be debated on Estimates Days. They can pitch ideas for the debates to the Backbench Business Committee, which then chooses the subjects for four debates, each of three hours, spread across Monday and Tuesday, next week. It is a quiet triumph for backbench and select committee power. The chosen subjects are spending on defence, homelessness, the Department for Exiting the EU, and transport. MPs will be able to talk about the spending plans in these areas to their hearts' content. Ministers will then have to respond and justify why, for example, various rail electrification schemes have been put on ice, or parry claims that too much infrastructure spending goes to London.  What they won't be able to do is actually change the spending plans but the hope is that the fear of a rough ride from the Commons will mean MPs can exert some leverage over ministers. We shall see.  Here's my rundown of the week ahead:  The Commons meets at 2.30 pm for Home Office Questions, and any post-weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions will normally follow from 3.30pm Then comes the first revamped Estimates Day (see above). It is divided into two three-hour debates. The first is on the Ministry of Defence, where MPs, including the Defence Committee Chair Julian Lewis, will seek to press the Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson, on the level of defence spending. Dr Lewis wants to see Britain spending 3 per cent of GDP, as it did until the mid 1990s, rather than the NATO minimum of 2 per cent. The threatened cuts to the Royal Marines look certain to feature, as well. (The following day, MPs will vote on authorising spending of £8,852,638,000, £1,363,500,000, and £1,703,385,000 for defence purposes.)  Next there's a debate on the estimates for DExEU - the Brexit department. This is an umbrella term for a debate on the cost of implementing Brexit, the day to day activities and the practical spending on transitional arrangements, as the Brexit process moves into a critical six months.   The adjournment debate, led by Labour's Liz McInnes, is on the future of diabetes care, treatment and prevention. In Westminster Hall (4.30 pm) MPs debate e-petition 200205 ""End the export of live farm animals after Brexit."" The petition, signed by 78,884 people, says the transport of live animals exported from the UK causes immense suffering. It adds that the trade is governed by EU law, not the UK Government, and that the Government should plan legislation to ban the export of live farm animals in favour of carcass-only trade and introduce this as soon as Britain leaves the EU. There's a bit of a rail theme on the committee corridor, with Public Accounts (4 pm) looking at rail franchising in the UK based on a report by the public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, which notes an improved performance in the management of franchises, since the collapse of the West Coast Main Line competition, but highlights continuing risks over the rail infrastructure improvement programme. The Committee will explore those issues with Bernadette Kelly, the Permanent Secretary at the Department for Transport, plus witnesses from Network Rail and major franchise holders.  In the Lords (2.30 pm) peers warm up for their second day of detailed debate on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill with questions to ministers on the National Child Obesity Strategy, representations opposing electrical safety checks in the private rented housing and establishing the proposed new Northern Forest.   Then comes the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill where big Labour amendments on reciprocal health rights for British and EU citizens and on UK participation in the student exchange programme, Erasmus, are next up for debate. Peers may get to Lord Goldsmith's amendment on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. One emerging feature of these debates is the rough treatment of the Brexit minister Lord Callanan. he is regularly getting biffed by peers who accuse him of failing to answer the points they have made. Perhaps it is just the result of the debates dragging on past midnight, but he seems to be becoming a bit of a target. MPs begin (11.30 am) with Treasury Questions followed by the second of the new-look Estimates Days, focussing on homelessness.  This was called for by the Public Accounts Committee, in the wake of their report on homelessness, published last year. This should be a wide ranging debate involving several government departments, including Communities and Local Government, Work and Pensions and Health. The idea is to look at the factors driving the current rise in rough sleeping and homelessness generally. The PAC was critical of the way the government spends the £1.1 billion allocated to homelessness prevention, but the system is likely to change when the Homelessness Reduction Act comes into force in April.  The second debate will be on transport where the issue under scrutiny will be some of the government's big infrastructure decisions on rail electrification, as well as the geographical balance of the spending. Are the regions being short-changed in favour of London?   My committee pick is the Brexit hearing (9.15am) with Pascal Lamy, the former Director General of the World Trade Organisation which will doubtless explore the implications of the UK trading with the EU on WTO terms, rather than with the kind of bespoke deal the government is seeking. In the Lords (2.30 pm) question-time features what appears to be the hot new fashion among soft Brexit/Remain parliamentarians: the possibility of UK membership of the European Free Trade Agency. The Labour peer Lord Lea of Crondall, a former vice president of the European TUC, will ask if membership of EFTA could be a way of remaining in the European Single Market, post-Brexit. Then, peers will deal with Commons amendments to the Space Industry Bill. The main change, which will probably be rubber-stamped with minimal delay, was a requirement for an environmental assessment as part of the process for licensing a space port. Then they will turn to the detail of the Laser Misuse (Vehicles) Bill , which introduces an offence of shining or directing a laser beam towards a vehicle which dazzles or distracts the person with control of the vehicle.   Next comes the second reading of the Haulage Permits and Trailer Registration Bill - a Brexit bill which gives powers to support UK hauliers operating internationally after the UK leaves the EU.  It would allow the government to set up a permit scheme for hauliers if required as part of a deal with the EU, ensuring UK hauliers can obtain the necessary paperwork to provide services to and from EU countries.  In the Commons (11.30 am) business begins with international development questions, with Prime Minister's Questions at noon.  The Labour MP John Mann has a Ten Minute Rule Bill to make social media service providers liable in defamation and libel actions - a major change which would have a dramatic impact on what could be published online in the UK The main debate is on a motion on the independent complaints and grievance policy that the House authorities want to introduce. Te motion, which has cross party support, endorses the recommendations of the working group which drew up the policy and sets in train the work needed to implement it. It includes several elements. One is drawing up a behaviour code for Parliament that covers bullying and harassment, and sexual harassment, and applies to everyone working there. There are also plans to set up the independent complaints scheme which will underpin the code, devise procedures for allegations of sexual harassment and to identify any necessary amendments to the Standing Orders of the House. Then there's the novelty of some opposed private business. It's the report stage of the The Middle Level Bill deals with navigation issues in the Fens. Some MPs have objected to it going through without debate. In Westminster Hall, my eye was caught by Dr Rupa Huq's debate (2.30 - 4 pm) on anti-corruption strategy and the illegal wildlife trade - focusing on the vast profits from dealing in products from endangered species, like ivory and rhino horn, and the link to money laundering. My committee pick is the Northern Ireland Affairs hearing (9.30am) on devolution and democracy in Northern Ireland. MPs will be asking the Northern Ireland Secretary, Karen Bradley what happens now, after the failure of attempts to reinstate devolved government. With talk in some quarters that the Good Friday Agreement, which mandates all-party coalition government in Stormont, needs to be revised, this will be a highly sensitive session. In the Lords after question-time (3pm) peers grind on with day three of their detailed consideration of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill. Watch out for amendments on animal sentience - perhaps one of the surprise Brexit issues. Other issues include future treatment of retained law, such as employment protections, and guidance for domestic courts MPs kick off (9.30 am) with transport questions, which is followed by the revival of a Commons tradition. The St David's Day debate on Welsh Affairs used to be a fixture, since it was first proposed by Megan Lloyd George in 1944,  but with the advent of the Backbench Business Committee, in 2010, it was no longer a guaranteed part of the Commons calendar.  Its return follows strong pressure from Welsh MPs for a chance to raise issues about Brexit, and the implications of a hard border with the Irish Republic. There is also concern that the electrified rail link to London stops at Cardiff, and at delays in giving the go-ahead to the Swansea tidal lagoon project, where a government announcement is thought to be due soon.  These are all part of the staple diet at Welsh questions, but the Labour MP Albert Owen, one of the prime movers behind the debate, wants to press the Welsh Secretary, Alun Cairns, to use his influence to make progress on all these issues.   There's an interesting-looking adjournment debate, on the future of ATMs led by the Conservative, Simon Hoare, who is worried that they are beginning to disappear from rural areas, restricting people's access to cash. He blames changes in the money paid by LINK to the operators of ATMs, and he warns that over-reliance on digital banking is misplaced in areas where broadband speed is slow and mobile coverage is patchy.   In Westminster Hall (1.30pm) the DUP's Jim Shannon leads a debate on freedom of religion and belief . He is chair of the all party parliamentary group on international freedom of religion or belief. In the Lords (11 am) watch out for the question from Lord Sherbourne of Didsbury, the former Political Secretary to  Margaret Thatcher, on the effectiveness of Police and Crime Commissioners in holding their chief constables and police forces to account.  The main debate in the Lords is the second committee stage day on the Nuclear Safeguards Bill, where the main points at key issue are freedom of movement, ONR independence and funding, and a sunset clause.  There's also a short debate on the use of facial recognition technology in security and policing, led by the Green Party's Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb, She argues the system is flawed, gives too many false results, and is intrusive to innocent people. She shares the view of the pressure group Big Brother Watch that  ""facial recognition cameras are essentially biometric checkpoints - no different to DNA or fingerprint checkpoints. They biometrically assess and check the identities of passers-by, turning us all into walking ID cards."" Neither House is sitting on Friday."
Spread to US Treasury,The ill economic winds of coronavirus,2024-09-25,2020-04-06,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-52180789,"The economic crisis has moved from the stress indicators of global stock markets, which can often seem unreal and irrational, to the real world. Market indices have stopped falling so fast (""too late to sell, too early to buy"" was one investor's observation) and we are now beginning to get a sense of the scale of job losses. The tourist industry was hit very hard with the denial of two big earners as far away as August in the Edinburgh festivals (cancelled) and the COP26 environment conference in Glasgow in November (postponed). That underlined the heightened level of exposure for hospitality and tourism, and was a signal of how long this is going to affect the economy.  The prospect, of spectator sport potentially not returning until 2021, adds to that sense that it won't be over by Easter, or summer, or long after that. The most startling numbers were from the USA. One way of measuring unemployment in the States is by the number of people who register each week. In Britain, we don't have data that responds that fast. The US figure the week before last was up by 3.3m, more than four times the previous one-week record. This week, that was up to 6.6m. The closest indicator in the UK is the number of people registering for Universal Credit, up nearly a million in only nine days. A lot of worklessness - that is, having nothing to do - is mitigated by the UK government pouring money into job retention schemes, both for the employed and the self-employed.   That may be a much bigger number than the government thought it would be. A lot of employers are turning to that as a means to keep people on their books, and to handle the sudden drying up of cash flow. Can we be sure those put on furlough will return to work? Not if employers are seeing it as a stepping stone to redundancy.  A downturn like this is an opportunity for companies to shake out inefficiencies. The jobs market has been very tight, putting workers in a strong position. But it's suddenly switched to giving bosses more leverage to cut their payroll costs. Football clubs show that happening. Putting workers on furlough for three months does not guarantee they'll be taking all those people back.  Trade unions are alert to the risk that this furlough could lead to redundancy, so they're pushing for furlough deals that will not lead to redundancy, such as the one announced for more than 30,000 employees of British Airways. One forecaster, the Bank of America, has estimated a drop in UK output of 7.4%, with most of that lost ground being made up next year.  But recovery, it said, depends on the UK Government and the Bank of England taking ever more unconventional measures.  That looks like a hint of much more money-printing (in reality, the buying of bonds using money created by the central bank, as only it can).  And to spark spending, it could push interest rates into negative territory, meaning we would have to pay the banks to look after our savings. A huge amount of government money has been committed to business grants, business rates holidays, loans and loan guarantees. That's borrowed money, of course, with the Debt Management Office saying that it's about to auction £45bn of bonds. The scale of the commitment is staggering. But for companies, borrowing money to get through this, however cheap that debt is, does not look that attractive to many in business, and less so when their banks add tough conditions when the government lending is put out into the market.  The government will back 80% of a loan with its guarantee, and banks have been looking to protect their position with demands of personal guarantees - on company directors' homes, for instance. One of the interesting things to watch in recent days is the way the banks have been prodded, pushed and then forced into relaxing the discipline they usually require of their customers. The financial regulator also stepped in to tell banks to ease up on individual customers, reducing the cost of overdrafts. Holidays are being required on loan repayments and credit card bills, without harming credit ratings. What banks fear is their loan books going badly sour.  Any shock or shakeout in the economy is going to push the weaker companies over the edge.  So we began to see the collapse of some that were already a bit shaky, for various reasons - Brighthouse, the rent-to-ownership retailer was one. Carluccio's restaurant chain was already closing outlets, including two in Scotland.  Debenhams was already working through a programme of closing 50 stores. On Friday, it set about protecting itself against creditors who are not being paid for supply of stock. Others will inevitably follow. The money being thrown at this crisis is intended to ensure it doesn't spread to those in fundamentally good financial health, with the potential to return to business as the economic lockdown is relaxed."
Spread to US Treasury,New Covid rules for parts of England 'within days',2024-09-25,2020-10-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54463081,"New measures to tackle coronavirus are to be announced ""in the coming days"", a minister says, after the BBC was told pubs and restaurants could be closed in the worst-affected areas of England.  There could also be a ban on overnight stays away from home in the locations  - which include the North and Midlands. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the government was ""currently considering what steps to take"". A three-tier system for local lockdowns is also likely to be announced.  Under the system, different parts of the country would be placed in different categories - although ministers are still discussing the precise details of the toughest level of restrictions over the next couple of days. A final decision on the time period or extent of potential closures has not yet been made and a formal announcement is not likely to come until Monday, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said. It comes as North of England and Midlands MPs have been briefed by health ministers and chief medical officer Chris Whitty about the latest coronavirus data. The number of people in the UK to have tested positive for coronavirus rose by 17,540 - an increase of 3,378 on Wednesday's figures - with a further 77 deaths reported. Some politicians in the North of England and the Midlands have shared their frustration about the plans appearing in newspapers before being announced in Parliament.  The Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, told the BBC: ""If it's urgent, give us the detail, give us the evidence behind the proposals. Let's discuss it and let's agree it quickly."" Meanwhile, Labour has challenged the government to publish the scientific evidence behind the 22:00 BST closing time for pubs and restaurants in England.  Leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would not be ""voting down"" the measure in the Commons next Tuesday but the policy ""needs to be reformed"".  Downing Street said that early data suggested a ""significant proportion"" of coronavirus exposure was seen in the hospitality sector, especially in younger age groups.  But pressed on whether the government would publish evidence on the issue, Mr Jenrick told the BBC: ""It is commonsensical that the longer you stay in pubs and restaurants, the more likely you are to come into contact with other individuals. ""The more drinks that people have, the more likely that some people are to break the rules."" He added that it was right to ""take action decisively, rather than waiting for the most detailed epidemiological evidence to emerge"".  On the possibility of additional restrictions for some parts of England, Mr Jenrick did not rule out pubs being closed but said the response would be ""proportionate and localised"". He added the government was trying to give ""greater consistency on rules so they're easier to understand"" and was working on ""slightly broader canvases of regions or cities and counties to avoid differences in people's daily lives if they drive over the border"".  It's a complicated equation. The Department of Health is worried about the spread of the disease, as well as other patients losing out on other treatments because of the focus on Covid.  No 11 is fearful about the impact on the economy, which has already had a profound shock.  And it's No 10's job to worry about all of it, then reach a conclusion.   But Boris Johnson also knows that his own MPs and the opposition parties are more and more sceptical as each day passes about what the government proposes.  It's clear that shutting pubs and restaurants is a possibility - the ""circuit breaker"" that we have talked about lots of times.  But there are many questions still to be settled.   Read more from Laura here. The planned tightening of restrictions in parts of England follows rising infection rates across much of the country, with the Academy of Medical Colleges warning the NHS is at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Nottingham, Knowsley, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle upon Tyne have the highest infection rates in England, according to the latest Public Health England data. From Friday, all pubs and restaurants across central Scotland, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, are to close, while in the rest of Scotland hospitality venues must shut at 18:00 BST and alcohol can only be served outdoors. But industry leaders are warning the measures could be the final straw for many businesses. Health minister Nadine Dorries tweeted that further measures were needed in England because hospital admissions could be at ""a critical stage"" in about 10 days' time.  A government source told the BBC the situation in the North West and North East of England was ""very troubling"", with growing numbers of hospital admissions and more elderly people in intensive care.  These areas will be placed into the top tier of restrictions - with an announcement possibly on Monday - in a new system called the Local Covid Alert Level. There remains a debate within cabinet over how far the restrictions in the top tier should go, with some in No 10 arguing for measures like those in Scotland.  The plan is for schools to remain open in all circumstances. Under the new system, all areas would be subject to the current England-wide restrictions, but there would be much more robust measures for the top tier. There are already tighter restrictions in parts of the North East and North West of England, Birmingham and Leicester - including on households mixing. The Treasury is looking at providing financial support to the hospitality industry in the worst-hit areas, and a memo seen by the BBC shows plans for additional money for local authorities. They would get £1 per head of population if placed into tier two, and £2 per head for tier three. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said if venues were forced to close the industry would need a return to a full furlough scheme and additional financial support.

Spread to US Treasury,Travel firms adopt the brace position,2024-09-25,2020-05-23,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-52783841,"The travel industry has led the way into the Covid economic crisis from the start. With the demise of Shearings and Wallace Arnold coach holidays, it's now showing signs of leading into the next stage - of corporate collapse and job losses, exacerbated by government choices around quarantine and easing of lockdown. The mood music from across travel - international and domestic tourism - is of increasing desperation and frustration. It was, of course, aircraft that spread the infection. Taking people home from ski holidays in Italy, air travel spread it across Europe.  Since then, aviation has largely been grounded. Its eagerness to get back into the air is facing major obstacles as governments place the onus on airlines and airports to do the health checks.  Airport operators are perplexed, not only at the prospects of having to check passengers for signs of infection, but also as the gateway to mass quarantine as international travellers arrive in the UK and Ireland. For two weeks, you're supposed to stay at a private address. You can be checked on there, with a £1,000 fine if you've failed to stay locked down. Who checks and follows up? The police don't seem keen.  Whereas airlines have been compliant in accepting lockdown, the new stage is seeing increasing friction around the easing process.  Always to the fore in ridiculing government rules, Michael O'Leary at Ryanair says quarantine proposals are ""unexplainable, ineffective, and unimplementable"". Others in the travel industry are urging governments to stay true to their claims that they're following the science, because they can't see the evidential basis for new guidelines on easing lockdown. While other business lobby groups want to work alongside governments to nudge them into an understanding of companies' needs, there's a whiff of revolt and anger around tourism. The Scottish Tourism Alliance is blunt, saying that the industry simply faces collapse unless there is support from government, either to increase the flow of emergency funding or to ease restrictions on travel, eating and drinking. Being told in the Scottish government's route map away from lockdown that those with outdoor eating and drinking options will be able to open first has only increased the frustration. For well-known reasons, investment in al fresco dining options has not been a priority for Scottish tourism.  At the UK Hospitality trade grouping, Scottish director Willie MacLeod says the route map ""will do more harm than good. It appears not to be based in any logic and has the potential to create a two-tier sector with many already-hammered businesses being left behind"". It's argued that grocery, pharmacy and pet food stores have shown the way in making physical distancing work indoors, so the lessons can be applied more widely. There's also concern within the sector that the ""keep out"" message from rural communities - given international media prominence in the case of author Neil Gaiman's journey from New Zealand to Skye -  is not helpful, and should be changed to a less blunt ""come back later, please"". There is frustration, too, that grants for tourism firms don't apply for larger premises, with rateable value (estimated annual rental cost) above £51,000. That rules out a lot of hotels. The Scottish government could raise that threshold to expand its grant-giving, if it can find the money. It's looking to the Treasury in London to take the lead. The options available for larger firms, going further into debt, don't look attractive even with government guarantees behind the loans and payments for year one, when company bosses cannot see a path to reliable revenue this year or next. Some are reliant on the tourism industry, but don't get the benefit of that sector's rates holiday. Coach companies say they're more stuck than most. They're not bus operators, so they're not getting a huge tranche of funds to compensate for the loss of passenger revenue. Nor are they much helped by a business rates holiday, because their assets are on wheels. And their main sources of revenue have dried up: tourism, schools and football fans. That brings us to the collapse of Specialist Leisure Group, including Shearings, Wallace Arnold, Caledonian Travel and 44 hotels. Seven of those hotels are in Scotland, and they're not just any hotels. From the Pitlochry Hydro to Portpatrick, Oban, Fort William and Strathpeffer, the hotels caught by this corporate collapse are among the biggest in tourist-dependent towns. Not only are 2,500 people being made redundant across the company and across the UK, after most of them were already furloughed: the impact is on suppliers of food and drink, and the numerous small firms that sell to the coach-travelling holiday-maker; cafes, ice-cream stands, gift shops, visitor attractions. All the towns affected are tourist dependent, and seasonally so. The company's customers are dependent also on such coach operators running budget trips, aimed at those of modest means, particularly retirees. That loss of capacity is a blow to travellers too. The company collapse results from customers demanding refunds on their holidays, quite reasonably. But without any revenue, travel firms like Specialist Leisure cannot pay out on the scale required.  Firms that have tried to fob off claimants with vouchers are being strongly criticised within the industry and by consumer advocates. We now see the effect of applying consumer rights rigidly - the company has gone. The assets will probably be bought out of administration. There will be some low prices. There will be opportunities to start up those hotels again. But not yet. Probably not this year, and there are big doubts about 2021.  Credit may be eased to help existing companies, but that doesn't mean it's going to be easy to secure for new start-ups, or for those wanting to expand by taking on distressed assets. Specialist Leisure Group does not look particularly unusual or unlucky. There's a lot more of this to come."
Spread to US Treasury,Garth's Team of the Week,2024-09-25,2018-03-04,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/43278167,"Manchester City's relentless charge towards the Premier League title continued as they beat last season's champions Chelsea courtesy of a Bernardo Silva goal. It was not such a good weekend for Arsenal, who lost again - this time at Brighton - to further increase the pressure on manager Arsene Wenger. Liverpool brushed aside Newcastle and Tottenham eased to victory over Huddersfield. At the bottom, Swansea claimed a big win, beating West Ham 4-1, while West Brom limped to another damaging defeat - 1-0 at Watford. You've seen my picks this week. But who would you go for? Choose your XI from the shortlist selected by BBC Sport journalists and share it with your friends. Let's be honest, VAR (video assistant referees) has been a disaster. Quite what business the Football Association, which hosts the oldest club competition in the world, is doing experimenting with such a high-profile property beggars belief.  For over 100 years the referee's 'opinion' has been final. With the aid of technology the FA and now Fifa, from what I understand, are about to bow to science, and an element of public pressure, and spit on the game's roots and most sacrosanct tradition by introducing this technological evil.  I know I will be labelled a luddite but before you condemn me let's consider what is at stake here.  The game has, for generations, respected the view of the referee. The technocrats in the game told us that goal-line technology was essential and without it the game was being starved of natural justice. I could have lived without goal-line technology but I see the logic. However, what VAR is attempting to do is reduce the referee to a mere traffic warden.  Every conceivable angle is covered in a Premier League fixture and quite rightly so. The public pay though the nose to see live football and therefore should get value for money. But the game itself should be assessed on the values it has always set itself and that is the referee's 'view' must be the final arbiter and must be respected.  Referees have never had eyes at the back of their heads, and neither should they, but that is what VAR is proposing. What VAR is about to do is challenge every decision based on the letter of the law.  Well, if you did that you could arguably find an infringement in every challenge regardless of which team you supported. The match would eventually grind to a halt.  The game has always been about opinions and on the field of play there is only one opinion that counts and that is the referee. He can only give what he sees. VAR sees everything and will only serve to complicate matters. It will not make the game better.   It is the lack of respect for referees that is in danger of killing the game and allowed VAR to take centre stage. And I must say it is doing it very badly.

Spread to US Treasury,Multi-billion dollar rescue deal for US bank,2024-09-25,2023-03-16,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64973321,"A group of big US banks has injected $30bn (£24.8bn) into a smaller regional bank, First Republic, which had been seen as at risk of failure.  The move came as authorities in the US are trying to quell panic over the health of the banking system, after a series of bank collapses. Worries about the sector have spread globally, raising fears of a crisis.  US regulators called the move ""most welcome"", while the banks said their action reflected their ""confidence"". They said the banking system had plenty of cash and made big profits. ""Recent events did nothing to change this,"" they said. ""The actions of America's largest banks reflect their confidence in the country's banking system.""  Reports of plans for the aid from the 11 banks, led by JP Morgan and Citigroup, helped lift financial markets and sent shares in First Republic surging more than 20% at one point, triggering trading halts.  But a sell-off started again in after-hours trade in a sign that concerns remain.  The San Francisco-based firm had seen its share price plunge nearly 70% over the last week, as investors worried it was the next bank at risk of a rush of customers withdrawing their deposits.  ""This show of support by a group of large banks is most welcome, and demonstrates the resilience of the banking system,"" US financial officials said.   Problems in the banking sector surfaced in the US last week when Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the country's 16th-largest lender, collapsed in the biggest failure of a US bank since 2008.  That was followed two days later by the failure of New York's Signature Bank. Authorities stepped in to guarantee deposits beyond typical limits in an effort to head off further runs on bank deposits, but financial markets have remained jumpy.  In a sign of strains in the system, the US central bank reported a surge in emergency lending to banks, with $318bn in outstanding loans as of Wednesday, up from $15bn a week earlier.   That included roughly $12bn offered through a fund created after the SVB collapse.  ""The size of the spike in the Fed's emergency lending underlines that this is a very serious crisis in the banking system that will have significant knock-on effects on the real economy,"" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics said.  In an appearance before politicians in Washington, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that depositors should have confidence in the system, while acknowledging the severity of the episode.    ""We felt that there was serious risk of contagion that could have brought down and triggered runs on many banks and that's something, given that our judgement is that the banking system overall is safe and sound,"" she said.  Meanwhile, the vice president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Luis de Guindos, said the banking industry in Europe was ""resilient"" and firms there had ""limited exposure to the institutions of the US"". He spoke as the ECB announced a further increase to interest rates from 2.5% to 3%, sticking to its plan for a rise despite concerns about how the move might affect the market turmoil. Central banks around the world have sharply raised borrowing costs over the last year to try to curb the pace of overall price rises, or inflation.  The moves have hurt the values of the large portfolios of bonds bought by banks when rates were lower, a change that contributed to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and has raised questions about the situation at other firms. The Swiss National Bank on Wednesday said it was extending up to £44bn in emergency funds to troubled lending giant Credit Suisse, which was seen as vulnerable in the wake of the US bank failures.  Its shares bounced back more than 15% after big falls a day earlier, while major indexes across Europe also gained. Sir John Gieve, former deputy governor at the Bank of England, told the BBC that central banks were sending a ""message"" that such problems would be contained locally. He added that in Credit Suisse's case, the Swiss National Bank's action was likely to be enough to stop the crisis spreading.  ""What we've seen overnight is the Swiss central bank saying 'no, we will not let this get into a disorderly collapse',"" he said. ""I don't know what the future for Credit Suisse holds but so far they are still standing and it looks like the Swiss central bank will ensure it's standing long enough to rearrange its affairs for the future.""   Credit Suisse, founded in 1856, has faced a string of scandals in recent years, including money laundering charges, spying allegations and high profile departures. It lost money in 2021 and again in 2022 and has warned it does not expect to be profitable until next year. Customers pulled millions of dollars from the firm in recent months. White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said officials had been monitoring the developments at Credit Suisse but its troubles were ""distinct"" from events in the US.  ""Its problems are not related to the current economic situation,"" she said. "
Spread to US Treasury,Coronavirus: Evening update,2024-09-25,2020-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54326730,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you on Tuesday morning.  There should be an ""urgent review"" of 10pm closure times for restaurants and pubs, according to Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham. He said people had been gathering in homes and supermarkets that were ""packed out to the rafters"" once bars closed. Scenes of crowds forming after closing time have been filmed in UK cities including Liverpool and York. There are no specific plans to review the policy, but all measures are kept under review, the PM's spokesman said. But what is the science behind the 10pm curfew? Read Reality Check's analysis here. Autumn is usually the time of year when UK politicians get together at their party conferences. But the coronavirus pandemic has put a temporary stop to the mingling, with this year's events largely being held online. Conservatives, Labourites and Liberal Democrats have to watch their leaders speak via Zoom (other video-conferencing apps are available). The parties insist the events are as vibrant and interesting as possible, but what are the big things to look out for and what has changed? Read more on that here. A BBC investigation has found criminals are setting up fake businesses on an industrial scale and successfully applying for government-backed Covid-19 emergency loans - with no intention of paying the money back. Builder Mark Telling had his details stolen to set up a bogus company - Tellings Home Made Furniture Service - that ""borrowed"" £50,000 from the scheme. Mark, who had no idea the company had been set up in his name, was horrified when the BBC told him what had happened. Victims like Mark could find themselves liable for the debt and have their credit rating badly affected. The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) has confirmed officers are being told not to install the NHS Covid-19 app - which detects when users have been close to someone with the virus - on their work smartphones. But some officers have been told they may not need to obey self-isolate alerts sent by the app on their personal phones, with Lancashire Constabulary telling staff to call its Covid-19 helpline instead. A source said the advice was due to ""security reasons"". The NPCC said the work phones policy was in place across all forces and that it is conducting an urgent review.  During lockdown, many of us have faced the awkward situation of unexpectedly appearing on a work video call wearing pyjamas or our ugliest moth-eaten jumper. Some of the world's biggest fashion houses, including Prada and Valentina Karellas, have unveiled new ""waist-up"" outfits, featuring detailed necklines and relaxed trousers - a potential replacement for those tracksuit bottoms under the desk.

Spread to US Treasury,Europe ramps up coronavirus support for ailing firms,2024-09-25,2020-03-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51874029,"European authorities are increasing efforts to try to stave off the economic effects of coronavirus. The European Union (EU) will put a package of measures in place including a €37bn euro (£33bn) investment initiative. And German finance minister Olaf Scholz said his country could part nationalise firms to tackle the crisis. Norway suspended some airline taxes as global aviation body IATA said carriers could fold over the next few months. Markets have become increasingly volatile as the impact of the spread of the coronavirus becomes more pronounced. Global stocks soared on Friday, after record falls on Thursday. Concerns over the economic effects of the pandemic led to a number of actions by European authorities on Friday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU response package will include giving member states flexibility on budget deficits and state aid. The EU will also guarantee €8bn in loans to 100,000 firms to support the corporate sector, she said. ""I am convinced that the European Union can withstand this shock,"" she said. ""But each member state needs to live up to its full responsibility and the European Union as a whole needs to be determined, coordinated and united."" Ms von de Leyen added that the Commission wanted to ensure ""necessary supplies to our health systems"" and to support people's incomes and jobs. Meanwhile, German finance minister Olaf Scholz said Germany would give tax relief and deferrals to firms which would take billions from the state treasury, and could take bail out ailing firms by taking stakes in them. ""The German government... all agreed together that we will use all means to ensure we can tackle this crisis,"" Mr Scholz said. ""We will every available tool at our disposal to get through these difficult times with all our economic possibilities and to make sure we come out of this situation in good shape."" Airlines have been hit by a slump in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with thousands of flight cancellations as the virus spread. On Thursday, Norwegian Air said it would suspend half of its staff and cancel 4,000 flights because of the outbreak, with the situation exacerbated by sweeping travel restrictions between the US and Europe. On Friday, Norway's government suspended some fees and taxes levied on airlines and said it is in talks with the country's aviation industry on further measures to help alleviate the situation, finance minister Jan Tore Sanner said. ""We are well informed of the wishes of the airline industries... I don't want to speculate on what measures could be implemented,"" said finance minister Jan Sanner said. The chief executive of the International Air Transport Association, Alexandre de Juniac, said more airlines could collapse if the coronavirus crisis last more than another two to three months. Mr de Juniac said on Friday that global revenue losses would be ""probably above"" $113bn that it estimated a week ago, before the Trump administration's announcement of US travel curbs on passengers from much of continental Europe. Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he expected the US economic hit from the coronavirus outbreak to be short-term, and that the Trump administration was keeping its options open for any other future steps that may be needed. Mr Mnuchin said the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve were working to keep markets open and to provide ""unlimited liquidity.""  He also said negotiations with Democrats over an economic relief package were also going well. ""We're going to look at every tool in the toolbox,"" he said."
Spread to US Treasury,The man who 'discovered' China's terracotta army,2024-09-25,2018-05-26,By Kevin Ponniah,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-44244493,"When archaeologist Zhao Kangmin picked up the phone in April 1974, all he was told was that a group of farmers digging a well nearby had found some relics. Desperate for water amid a drought, the farmers had been digging about a metre down when they struck hard red earth. Underneath, they had found life-size pottery heads and several bronze arrowheads. It could be an important find, Zhao's boss said, so he should go and have a look as soon as possible. A local farmer-turned-museum curator in China's central Shaanxi province, Zhao - who died on 16 May at the age of 81 - had an inkling of what he might find. He knew figures had in the past been dug out of the earth in the area near the city of Xian, home to orchards of persimmon and pomegranate trees, and not far from the tomb of China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang. A decade earlier, he had personally uncovered three kneeling crossbowmen. But he had never been certain that they dated back to the rule of the emperor - who unified the Chinese nation for the first time under the short-lived Qin dynasty (221-206 BC).  But what Zhao was about to find would surpass anything he could have imagined. The farmers, it would turn out, had stumbled upon one of the most stunning archaeological finds of the 20th Century: a  terracotta army estimated at 8,000-strong, crafted on an industrial scale 2,200 years earlier to defend the emperor in the afterlife. A ghost army, complete with horses and chariots, hidden underground and never meant to be seen by the living. Zhao headed to the location of the find with a colleague. ""Because we were so excited, we rode on our bicycles so fast it felt as if we were flying,"" he would later write in a 2014 essay. As he arrived, Zhao told the British historian John Man: ""I saw seven or eight pieces - bits of legs, arms and two heads - lying near the well, along with some bricks."" He said he immediately realised these were likely the remnants of Qin-era statues. The farmers - who had made the find weeks earlier and already sold some of the bronze arrowheads for scrap - were told to stop their work immediately. The relics were collected and brought to the museum on the back of trucks. Zhao began laboriously putting the fragments together. Some, he later said, were the size of a fingernail. Finally, after three days of work, two imposing terracotta warriors stood before him - each 1.78m tall. But while Zhao was buoyed by this incredible discovery, he was also nervous. China in 1974 was in the closing stages of Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution - under which the fearsome Red Guards sought to destroy old traditions and ways of thinking to ""purify"" society. Zhao, as Man recounts in his book The Terracotta Army, had personally been subject to a ""self-criticism"" session in the late 1960s, as a person ""involved with old things"". So now although the worst excesses of that period were over, Zhao was worried what might become of the statues. He ""decided to keep it secret"", restore the artefacts, ""and then wait for the right opportunity to report it"". But those plans would be scuppered by a young journalist from state news agency Xinhua, who was visiting the area when he came across the statues. ""He asked: 'This is such a huge discovery. Why aren't you reporting it?'"" Zhao wrote. To which the archaeologist replied: ""Even I don't know how to make sense of this. How could I report it?"" Ignoring his pleas, the journalist publicised the find, and word made its way to the very top of the Communist Party leadership. Zhao's fears that the relics could be smashed for political reasons, however, proved unfounded. The authorities in Beijing decided to excavate the site and within a few months more than 500 warriors had been uncovered. As the work continued, the extraordinary scale of what the First Emperor - a ruthless man who defeated six warring states to unite China under an imperial system that continued until 1912 - had commissioned became clear. He is said to have ordered the subterranean project - which in total covers some 56 sq km - soon after ascending to the throne at 13 years old. The thousands of warriors were placed in battle formation, ready to defend their emperor from whatever might await in the afterlife. The workmanship was detailed, with dozens of different types of heads, and in the burial pits were 100 chariots and tens of thousands of bronze weapons. The actual tomb of Emperor Qin Shi Huang remains sealed. There could be thousands of precious artefacts inside but the risks of opening the tomb, and irreparably damaging what may lie inside, means the Chinese government has held off so far. In 1975, a year after the excavations began, a decision was made to open a museum at the site. And as digging continued in the coming years, word spread about the scale of what had been found. Foreign dignitaries and some tourists began to visit. Zhao was there and lapping up the attention, says Prof Dame Jessica Rawson of the University of Oxford, who specialises in Chinese art and archaeology and visited the sites in the early 1980s.  ""By the time I met him everyone was showing him great respect and he was very much sort of enjoying the esteem associated with the terracotta warriors,"" she said. But the professor added: ""I'm not sure how he or the Chinese authorities viewed it at the time. They were probably not expecting the acclaim and success that it has later enjoyed."" It did take some years for the site to receive widespread global recognition. It was given Unesco World Heritage status in 1987, with the UN cultural body describing the warriors as ""masterpieces of realism"". Today, the site is widely recognised as a Chinese national treasure. But there is a sense that Zhao's personal role in the discovery was never fully recognised. He is by no means well-known in China.  Instead, one of the farmers - Yang Zhifa, whose shovel is said to have unearthed the first artefact  - is described to visiting tourists as the person who discovered the warriors. For years he sat in the Museum of the Terracotta Warriors and Horses, quietly and unsmilingly signing books. It was he, not Zhao, who travelled abroad to tell his story. In 1998, when then US President Bill Clinton visited, it was Yang who shook his hand. A few years ago he admitted that he didn't go and see the restored army until 1995, when the museum gift shop manager asked him to sign books. ""He said he would pay me 300 yuan a month. I thought 'that's not bad', so I came,"" he told the China Daily. Three other farmers would later join him, and their pay was tripled. But all complained they were never rewarded properly for their find, and in fact had their land seized to make way for the museum. Three of the original group of seven farmers died in terrible circumstances. One hanged himself in 1997, and two others died in their early 50s, penniless and unable to pay for medical care, according to the South China Morning Post. A local guide who brings tourists to see the warriors, Liu Guoyang, had not even heard of Zhao Kangmin. But he said imposters posed for visitors, pretending to be Yang Zhifa or one of the other farmers. Zhao was furious when, in 2004, the four surviving farmers officially asked to be registered as the men who had discovered the warriors. They didn't receive a response. ""What they want is money,"" Zhao told the China Daily. ""Seeing doesn't mean discovering. The farmers saw the terracotta fragments, but they didn't know they were cultural relics, and they even broke them. ""It was me who stopped the damage, collected the fragments and reconstructed the first terracotta warrior,"" he said. If he hadn't have turned up, he told John Man, ""it would have been a disaster"". Wu Yongqi, head of the Museum of the Teracotta Warriors from 1998-2007, agreed that Zhao, who he described as a simple but kind man, was the person who ""recognised the significance and true value of those warriors"". Without him, Mr Wu said, the extraordinary find might have been delayed for years. Unlike the farmers, who signed books for hordes of tourists at the main warriors' museum, Zhao remained at the much smaller Lintong county museum. Even in his final years, he could be found sitting next to some warriors he had restored, wearing a trilby hat and chatting to curious visitors. Although he never achieved fame or fortune, Zhao seemed content with the recognition he did receive - proudly saying that during the initial excavation an envoy from Beijing had told him that he had ""made a very big contribution to the country"". In 1990, he was personally acknowledged by the State Council and given a special pension. He is survived by a wife and two sons. Zhao's view of his own position in Chinese history - no matter what others might say - was clear. At the Lintong museum, he would sign postcards and books for tourists with an extravagant description: ""Zhao Kangmin, the first discoverer, restorer, appreciator, name-giver and excavator of the terracotta warriors.""

Spread to US Treasury,Follow rules plea ahead of lockdown exit plan,2024-09-25,2020-11-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-54772931,"People's behaviour during and after Wales' national firebreak lockdown will determine how successful it is in tackling the coronavirus pandemic, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. The 17-day firebreak runs until 9 November and the Welsh Government will later outline what restrictions will be in place when it ends. People have been urged to stay at home while non-essential shops have shut. Mr Drakeford has already said local area lockdowns will not return. He is due to reveal the new set of ""national rules"" across Wales during a news conference at 12:15 GMT after his cabinet met on Sunday. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the lifting of the restrictions must be ""slow and steady"", while Conservative MS Darren Millar called for a ""more targeted approach to intervention"".  Mr Drakeford will say the actions everyone takes during and after the firebreak are more important than the rules and regulations the government puts in place.  ""We need to do everything we can to reduce our exposure to the virus by reducing the contacts we have with other people - at home, in work and when we go out,"" he is expected to say.  ""We need to do the minimum - not the maximum, which the rules allow. ""The main thing I'm asking people to do in Wales is ask each time 'is what I'm doing genuinely necessary?' If it's not it should be avoided."" On Monday morning, he said the new set of Wales-wide rules will be ""simpler and clearer"" and would allow for ""something beyond what we've had during the firebreak period"". Mr Drakeford said non-essential retail, gyms, places of worship and schools - for Year 9 and above - would reopen from 9 November. He added: ""We will be asking people to work from home wherever possible, but on the 9 November the firebreak in Wales will be over and large parts of life will be able to resume as they were on 22 October."" He also said there would be a distinction between what people were allowed to do indoors and outdoors.  Mr Drakeford said it would be a ""couple of weeks"" before it was known if the firebreak lockdown has succeeded in suppressing the spread of the virus, but ""early indications"" from travel data suggested people were abiding by the rules.  He has already said the current firebreak will end on 9 November regardless of the four-week lockdown being introduced across England from Thursday. ""We made a bargain with the people in Wales that if they stuck to everything that we have asked them to do, and I say it's been an extraordinary national effort for 17 days, then we would be able to return to them some of the freedoms that have been denied to them,"" he said.  ""I do not intend to step away from that bargain."" On Monday morning, Mr Drakeford resisted calls to follow England in going into a lockdown until early December in order to have uniformity across the UK.  He said: ""When Cobra last met - which is three weeks ago - I asked then for an urgent further Cobra to discuss the advice of Sage, that a firebreak or a circuit-break period will be the most effective way of bringing the R number down.  ""But Cobra hasn't met ever since. ""While I'm absolutely signed up to better coordination, better information sharing and as I see it, better decision-making, the calling of those meetings is not in the hands of the devolved administrations, it lies in the hands of the UK government. ""Despite being asked to do so, three weeks have gone by and that meeting hasn't happened. In those circumstances there isn't any alternative but for the devolved governments in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales to make the decisions that we think are the right ones for our local populations."" ""By doing everything we're doing and, provided we behave in the right way after the lockdown, we are confident we can get through to Christmas without having to go through this again."" Mr Drakeford said he was ""anxious"" people may travel from England to avoid lockdown rules there.  He said: ""It's very important that Wales doesn't become an escape for people trying to get round the new tighter restrictions being introduced in England."" He said there were ""a number of details"" being discussed with colleagues in England: ""Public transport is one. Many many train journeys begin in England and end in Wales and vice-versa. It's not clear to us yet what the public transport regime in England will be. ""We are waiting to get some details on business support and whether there will be extra money for Welsh businesses."" ""Most importantly of all hospitality. We are having to meet this morning with representatives of the hospitality industry."" ""Think of Wrexham and Chester, literally a couple of miles apart. If pubs are completely closed as they will be in Chester, what impact will that have on people trying to travel into Wales to go to a pub."" However, a restriction on people coming from England will have a ""devastating"" effect on the hotel industry in Wales, one owner has said.  Lynette Esposito, who owns the Elm Tree Hotel in Llandudno, Conwy, has been under local lockdown or firebreak restrictions since September and said the decision to impose a lockdown in England was a ""severe blow"" for Welsh hotels.  She said: ""We would've been in a lockdown for nine weeks and most of the hotels in Wales rely almost 100% on business coming out of England, so for us it's a devastating blow.  ""The restrictions announced today are going to be of interest, but not much relevance."" Conservative Mr Millar said he did not agree with the decision for Wales to enter a firebreak and called for ""more clarity"" on what the new rules would be.  ""We've said all along, that we didn't think that a Wales-wide lockdown was the right thing to do. We felt that because the infection rates were so variable in different parts of Wales."" He said the Welsh Conservatives stood by their stance in Wales despite the decision by the UK government to lockdown England. ""The evidence that's been shared with the Welsh Conservatives by the Welsh Government has been insufficient in our view for a Wales-wide lockdown."" Meanwhile, Plaid Cymru leader Mr Price said: ""We have learnt two key lessons from the response to the pandemic so far - going into lockdown too late increases the spread of the virus and coming out too early risks undoing any benefits gained. That is why the approach to the post firebreak period must be slow and steady. ""There should certainly be no lifting of the travel restrictions which have rightly prevented people coming into Wales from Covid hotspots elsewhere in the UK."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced at the weekend that the furlough scheme would be extended until 2 December. It was due to end on Saturday and be replaced with the new, less generous Job Support Scheme (JSS). The move sparked a war of words between the Welsh and UK governments. Mr Drakeford was unhappy that requests for extra funding during the firebreak were rebuffed by the Treasury, but then furlough was extended when the England lockdown was announced. He previously asked the Treasury to extend furlough for one week to coincide with the Welsh firebreak, but his requests were turned down. Chancellor Rishi Sunak also declined a request for the JSS  - which would cover 67% of wages when it replaces furlough - to be brought forward. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Drakeford said: ""We had asked the chancellor for some flexibility during our firebreak period, the chancellor said to me that it wasn't possible to do that.  ""It turns out that it is possible now, but mostly I just welcome any extra support that businesses in Wales will get over the next period."" The Welsh Government said it had offered to pay the cost for the difference between furlough and the JSS, which a minister estimated was £11m."
Spread to US Treasury,US sanctions Iran's Foreign Minister Zarif,2024-09-25,2019-07-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49182562,"The US Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions against Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. The sanctions freeze any assets Mr Zarif may have in America, the department said. ""Javad Zarif implements the reckless agenda of Iran's Supreme Leader (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei),"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. Mr Zarif tweeted the US had imposed sanctions on him because it considered him as a threat to its agenda. Tensions between the US and Iran have heightened since the US last year withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal that aimed to curb Iranian nuclear activities. There are growing concerns that a number of recent incidents in the Gulf could lead to a military conflict in the vital shipping region. On Wednesday, the US extended waivers which allow Russia, China and European countries to continue civilian nuclear cooperation with Iran.  White House security adviser John Bolton said on Wednesday that it was a ""short 90 day extension"". ""I think the idea here is we are watching those nuclear activities very, very closely,"" he added. Mr Mnuchin described Mr Zarif as the Iranian ""regime's primary spokesperson around the world"". ""The United States is sending a clear message to the Iranian regime that its recent behaviour is completely unacceptable. ""At the same time the Iranian regime denies Iranian citizens' access to social media, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif spreads the regime's propaganda and disinformation around the world through these mediums,"" Mr Mnuchin said. Mr Zarif said the US move ""has no effect on me or my family, as I have no property or interest outside of Iran"". He posted a tweet, mocking the US move. ""The US reason for designating me is that I am Iran's 'primary spokesperson around the world. Is the truth really that painful?"" he asked. ""Thank you for considering me such a huge threat to your agenda."" Last year, the US unilaterally withdrew from the agreement between Iran and world powers. Washington has since reimposed tight sanctions affecting the Iranian economy, and also  The other parties of the 2015 deal - China, France, Germany Russia and the UK - criticised Mr Trump's decision and said they remained fully committed to the deal. Iran responded by breaching the limit on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium set under the nuclear deal. Tehran stepped up production of enriched uranium, used to make reactor fuel but also potentially nuclear bombs, in May. Last week, talks were held in Vienna to try to save the nuclear deal. After meeting representatives from Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, a senior Iranian official said the atmosphere had been ""constructive"". Tensions between the UK and Iran rose in July after British forces seized the Iranian tanker, Grace 1, off Gibraltar. It was alleged to be carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions, a claim denied by Iran. Several days later the British-flagged Stena Impero was impounded by Iran, which said it had been ""violating international maritime rules"". Britain sent a second warship on Sunday to escort its ships sailing through the Strait of Hormuz. Recent incidents have also included:"
Spread to US Treasury,"More than 17 million have used buy now, pay later",2024-09-25,2021-11-29,By Rebecca Wearn,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59433904,"More than 17 million UK customers have now used a buy now pay later (BNPL) company to make an online purchase, company data shows.  The payment method is also set to have its biggest Christmas yet, experts say.  BNPL firms allow people to manage their shopping, either by postponing their bill for a short while, or splitting it into more manageable chunks over time, interest free.   But critics say users too easily end up in debt and tougher rules are needed.  The biggest provider in the UK, Klarna, has seen its customer base double to 15 million since early 2020. The market's other main players, Clearpay and LayBuy, are also expanding fast. Growth is fastest among users in their 40s and 50s, showing BNPL is no longer just a millennial and Gen Z trend. A recent survey for Citizens Advice found that almost one in 10 people were planning to use BNPL to help with Christmas shopping.  Kate Hobson from Citizens Advice urged consumers ""not to spend more than they can afford"".  ""If you're considering using buy now pay later, make sure you understand what you're signing up for, how you'll make the repayments and what will happen if you can't pay on time,"" she added.  The main players in the market, however, feel they offer consumers a hassle-free means to pay for purchases without interest. It is also much cheaper than a credit card if late payment fees aren't incurred, they add. Klarna, which launched in the UK in 2014, charges no interest or fees if payments are on time and claims around 40% of users repay money early.  The service launched a ""pay now"" option and updated its terms ahead of an expected crackdown on the sector.  Platform Clearpay stresses it does not report late paying users to credit agencies, and maintains that many of its users are in fact better with their money than they are given credit for. ""There are misperceptions that young people are bad at saving and investing money, however a report by Accenture on Clearpay users has shown that young people are more cautious with money than older people,"" a spokesperson said. LayBuy saw transactions grow 500% between 2019 and 2020 and the company reported a 56% spike in transactions last November, as Christmas shopping commenced. The family-run business, which was the first to run affordability checks on users, has since listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.  Millions of shoppers use buy now pay later services to spread the cost of their online shopping throughout the year. Like any kind of credit, if you keep on top of it, it can be a sensible way of making sure you're not hit with a big bill at one point of the year.  But of course it also makes it more tempting to spend more than you would do otherwise, especially with fewer credit checks. At this time of year, with so many different credit options available and other bills due for payment, lots of customers can get stuck in a real quagmire.  It's always important to check the terms and conditions before you sign up - figure out what you are expected to pay back and when, don't just clip 'Pay Later' and hope for the best. If you do get into difficulties then flag it up quickly, most of the companies can arrange repayment plans with you which are more manageable if you contact them. And of course get advice from a debt charity directly if you are feeling stuck. The Treasury is consulting on how to regulate the BNPL sector, and the Financial Conduct Authority will publish proposals some time next year.  A Treasury spokesperson said it was taking a ""proportionate approach"".  ""Buy now pay later can be a helpful way to manage your finances so it's important that regulation is balanced and proportionate, ensuring that customers are given appropriate protections.""   But many charities want action to be taken sooner, arguing that many consumers could be pushed into borrowing more than they can afford this Christmas. Debt charity Christians Against Poverty recognises BNPL can be ""attractive"", especially at Christmas, but it worries users could lose track of spending.  ""We're particularly concerned about those consumers who turn to credit like BNPL as a means of keeping on top of essentials, like bills or the weekly food shop,"" said spokesman Jonathan Shaw.  ""Add to this the additional pressure to spend at Christmas and consumers can be left in an even more financially difficult situation.""  Growth in the sector shows no sign of slowing down. Established money brands Paypal and Monzo are poised to enter the market, and BNPL technology is evolving so that some brands can be used to make any purchase on any site. "
Spread to US Treasury,"UK at virus 'tipping point', top scientist warns",2024-09-25,2020-10-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54496508,"The UK has reached a ""tipping point"" in its coronavirus epidemic similar to that last seen in March, one of the country's top scientists has warned. England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said the seasons were ""against us"" and the country was running into a ""headwind"". More deaths would follow a rise in cases over coming weeks, he said, and urged people to limit social contact. On Monday, Boris Johnson is expected to announce tougher restrictions.  In a statement to MPs, the prime minister is expected to set out plans for a three-tier local lockdown system which would see every region in England placed in one of three tiers, depending on the severity of cases. Across the UK, the R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto - is now estimated between 1.2 and 1.5. Anything above 1.0 means cases are increasing. On Saturday, 15,166 people in the UK were reported to have tested positive for coronavirus - up 1,302 on Friday's figure, according to the government's dashboard. There were a further 81 deaths - a decrease of six on Friday. However, the Office for National Statistics estimates 224,000 people in homes in England had the virus, up to 1 October - roughly double the figure reported by the ONS for each of the preceding two weeks. In his statement published on Sunday, Prof Van-Tam said that while the epidemic ""re-started"" again among younger people over the past few weeks, there is ""clear evidence of a gradual spread into older age groups"" in the worst-hit areas. ""Sadly, just as night follows day, increases in deaths will now follow on in the next few weeks,"" Prof Van-Tam said.  He warned that the UK was in a different position than during the first wave because ""we are now are going into the colder, darker winter months"".  ""We are in the middle of a severe pandemic and the seasons are against us. Basically, we are running into a headwind,"" he said. But he also said the UK has ""much improved testing capabilities"" and ""better treatments"" available, meaning that ""we know where it is and how to tackle it"". He stressed the importance of following public health guidance and minimising contact with others, adding: ""I know this is very hard, but it is an unfortunate scientific fact that the virus thrives on humans making social contact with one another."" Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average. If you can't see the look-up click here. It comes as the Labour Party and business groups voiced concern at the ""ripple effect"" of Covid shutdowns that are expected to be announced on Monday. Labour claims that close to one million workers will be at risk because the chancellor's plan to pay staff at UK companies that are told to close 67% of their wages does not extend to those who may be indirectly affected, such as those in supply chains. The Treasury denied firms that are not fully closed would not receive help. A spokesperson said: ""We do not recognise these figures,"" adding that Labour had ""incorrectly"" listed some sectors as not benefitting from the scheme. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will set out the new rules for hotspots in the House of Commons on Monday.  Every region of England is expected to be placed in one of three tiers, with the Liverpool City Region thought to be in the category with the strictest rules.  Plans are not yet finalised, BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said, but that is likely to mean pubs will close, restaurants could face restrictions, people may even be told not to travel in and out of the area. Schools and universities would remain open.  More talks are expected on Sunday between the government and leaders in parts of England that are expecting new restrictions.  Council leaders and mayors have expressed their anger at what they see as inadequate help for those who will no longer be able to work.  Many regions are demanding more local control over contact tracing, while others have raised the possibility of legal action if they do not get the support they demand.  The government says it is committed to involving local leaders in decision-making. Discussions with Downing Street on Friday were described on Merseyside as ""frosty,"" but ""cordial and giving on both sides"".  Leaders in Greater Manchester do not yet have another meeting with the government arranged, Chris Mason added - but one is expected before the prime minister's statement on Monday.  In Nottingham, Newcastle, Sunderland, Leeds and elsewhere, leaders and residents await the announcement of the template for the next phase of the pandemic.  How has coronavirus affected you?

Spread to US Treasury,Lessons learned from failed 'tech bank' SVB,2024-09-25,2023-03-13,By Zoe Kleinman,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64939556,"Uncertainty, panic and urgency are three words I heard rather a lot on Monday morning. I have been talking to some of the UK-based tech firms which had accounts with Silicon Valley Bank, the bank that failed rather dramatically towards the end of last week.  The UK arm of it, with just over 3,000 business customers, has now been rescued by HSBC but as I write, the online banking facility remains frozen. SVB was primarily used by the tech sector, and I know there have been mutterings about how much sympathy UK taxpayers should have for the ""tech bros"" in the event of Treasury intervention. The people I have been chatting to do not fit that description.  I asked one worker whether she expected to get paid this month as her firm had only banked with SVB. It was still unclear how much operational cash - money needed by businesses to pay bills and salaries - remained in limbo. ""I hope so,"" she said. The one thing everyone I have spoken to had in common was that not only was SVB their main bank - it was their only bank. ""At our next board meetings I want to talk about resource concentration,"" said Melanie Hayes, managing partner at the venture capitalist firm BGV, which also banked exclusively with SVB. ""We also need to look at the rest of the business and see where else we might have concentration risk."" To paraphrase: do not put all of your eggs in one basket. And also, may I add - choose big, robust, protected baskets that are more likely to be prevented from failing by regulators and governments. It may sound like a no-brainer, but if you are a tech start-up, it is not as easy as it sounds. ""The main High Street banks are not supportive to start-ups, because we have perceived higher risks,"" says Elin Haf Davies, founder of Aparito, a med-tech start up based in Wrexham that focuses on clinical trials. Ms Davies said that SVB was popular with the med-tech sector, including both her competitors and clients - many of whom are US-based. Aparito is still scoping out how much of an impact those clients' banking problems are likely to have on its own cash flow. As well as financial services, you should also consider the breadth of your client base, she added. ""Try to have a large distribution of clients so you have a secure revenue stream,"" she said, acknowledging that ""it's easier said than done"". The perception that the big banks are less keen on start-up customers is one I hear echoed a lot. ""Many start-ups are with challenger banks because their account opening procedures are so much more straightforward,"" said Ms Hayes. ""It's hard to open up a bank account with a High Street bank if you're a start-up business."" But when I ask why, nobody is quite sure. ""If I knew the answer to that..."" Ms Hayes laughs. Chris Edson from Second Nature, a firm specialising in helping Type 2 diabetes patients manage their lifestyles, said that until recently his firm banked with Metro, but had decided to switch to SVB. The firm had transferred some money into a fixed-term bond before news began to spread about SVB, but there was still about £1m in the account.  ""We faced the dilemma of, 'do we withdraw our cash and make the problem worse or do we wait?'. I was in a WhatsApp groups with other founders and opinion was split."" In the end, Mr Edson opted for a transfer back to the old Metro account on Friday morning and while the money appears to have left SVB, it has not yet arrived in its new destination. But he is confident that under HSBC ownership, all will be well. ""I think every chief financial officer has worked all weekend,"" he said.  ""Sunday seemed like a real black swan, once in a generation, moment for start-ups. It's shaken everybody in the VC [venture capital] world to their core."" One thing it has also done is unite the tech sector together in an unusual moment of business collaboration. ""I've never had so many messages from founders or investors as I have over the last 48 hours,"" said Mr Edson. Ms Hayes said she saw tech bosses sharing ""practical stuff"" like lists of banks which were prepared to open accounts quickly, and personal contacts who may be able to help. They were also co-ordinating a data-gathering exercise to establish the extent of the problem, which involved sharing quite sensitive company information such as the amount of money firms had at risk and their cash flow requirements. ""We saw other people just sharing solidarity and support,"" she said. ""It was good to see people pulling together."" Follow Zoe Kleinman on Twitter @zsk."
Spread to US Treasury,"Who Russia, China and Iran want to win US election",2024-09-25,2020-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54293489,"Will the Kremlin be trying to ""Keep America Great""? Is Beijing rooting for Biden?  These questions are on the minds of the US intelligence community in the run-up to November's vote. An assessment from a top official warns foreign powers will use ""covert and overt influence measures"" to try to sway US voters, singling out Russia, China and Iran. The three should not be compounded, as each, in the view of US intelligence, has their own goal and their own capabilities.  The assessments themselves are under scrutiny too - a whistleblower recently alleged he was asked to downplay the threat posed by Russia as it ""made the president look bad"".  So with a little over a month to go, what do US voters need to know? What does the intelligence say? As you may have noticed, Russia had a scene-stealing role in the 2016 US election and its aftermath.  In short, US intelligence believe Russia tried to sway the vote in favour of Donald Trump, pointing to meetings between his team and Russian officials, a cyber attack against Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democrats, the targeting of state voter databases, and efforts to amplify false or partisan material online. Last month a Republican-led Senate panel gave further support to the view Russia wanted Trump to win, concluding his campaign was an easy target for foreign influence but stopping short of alleging criminal conspiracy.  As for 2020, this time swap Hillary Clinton for Joe Biden. In his assessment, intended to be read by the American public, the head of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) William Evanina said Russia was ""using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice-President Biden"". In the view of FBI director Christopher Wray, Russia has never stopped meddling, calling efforts in the 2018 congressional elections a ""dress rehearsal for the big show in 2020"".  Russia has consistently denied interfering in foreign elections. Earlier this year a Kremlin spokesman called accusations of meddling ""paranoid announcements"" that had ""nothing to do with the truth"".  Whether Russia wants a second term for President Trump or not, another view often expressed by analysts is that the country has a broader aim of destabilising rivals by spreading confusion. For example this year an EU document alleged there was a Russian campaign to push fake news about coronavirus to make it harder for the bloc to communicate its response. Russia called the claims unfounded.  What do the candidates say? Joe Biden recently warned there would be a ""price to pay"" if Russia continues to interfere, calling Russia an ""opponent"" of the US. President Trump has frequently downplayed allegations of Russian interference, putting him at odds with his own intelligence experts. After a 2018 summit with Vladimir Putin, asked whether he believed the US intelligence community or the Russian president about the claims Mr Trump said: ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be."" He later said he had misspoken. What does the intelligence say? Prominent voices in the Trump administration have argued that it is China, rather than Russia, that poses the main threat this year. ""I've seen intelligence. That's what I've concluded,"" the Attorney General William Barr said. Democrat Adam Schiff, who chairs the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, accused Mr Barr of ""flat-out lying"" with the comments. In his assessment, Mr Evanina said US intelligence believes ""China prefers that President Trump - whom Beijing sees as unpredictable - does not win re-election"".  ""China is expanding its influence efforts to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China's interests, and counter criticism of China,"" he said. The use of the word ""influence"" is notable. Although China has sophisticated ways to influence opinions - cyber monitors the Stanford Internet Observatory list ""content farms, 'astroturf' commenter brigades, and fabricated accounts and personas on social media channels"" how far China is actually prepared to go is unclear. ""China will continue to weigh the risks and benefits of aggressive action,"" said Mr Evanina. The intention may be more to do with promoting China's worldview. Facebook recently shut down a network of China-linked accounts much of which supported the Chinese state, such as its interests in the disputed South China Sea.  China has denied interfering in other countries' domestic affairs, saying it is not ""interested or willing to do so"".  What do the candidates say? This month, President Trump approvingly retweeted an article on the Trump leaning Breitbart website entitled ""China seems 'to be favouring Joe Biden' in presidential election"". ""Of course they want Biden. I have taken $Billions from China and given it to our Farmers and U.S. Treasury. China would own the U.S. if Biden & Hunter got in!"" Mr Trump wrote, referring to Joe Biden's son Hunter. US-China ties are at a low ebb, with disputes over everything from the coronavirus to China's imposition of a controversial security law in Hong Kong. Joe Biden has sought to fend off accusations from President Trump he is soft on China, promising to be ""firm"" on human rights and other issues. Democrats though argue that when it comes to the election at least, it is Russia that is being most aggressive.  In 2016, the US government, as well as social media companies, were slow to confront Russian interference. This time no one is staying quiet but the landscape has changed. Companies are talking loudly about what they are doing and the US intelligence community is publishing regular assessments. But the issue has become deeply politicised. Democrats are focused on Russian interference helping President Trump whilst his supporters have tried to switch attention to Chinese influence working against his re-election. National security officials have tried to walk a fine line - acknowledging both are happening (as well as lower-level Iranian influence) but trying to avoid acknowledging there are differences because of concerns of being drawn into the partisan fight.  Russian interference has looked both more organised and covert so far, but not necessarily yet on the same scale or with the same impact as the hack and leak of emails from Democrats in 2016. Tactics have also evolved with those seeking to interference often amplifying genuine, US news and posts rather than making up fake material. And there are worries that more may be coming in the closing stages of the campaign including potentially efforts to undermine the credibility of the electoral process itself. What does the intelligence say? In his statement Mr Evanina says that Tehran is against another term for President Trump, which it believes will result ""in a continuation of US pressure on Iran in an effort to foment regime change"". Iran's efforts, he says, will focus on ""on-line influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-US content"". Backing up the allegations made by US intelligence, computing giant Microsoft said hackers with ties to to Russia, China and Iran, are attempting to spy on key figures involved in the US election.  On Iran, it said an Iranian group known as Phosphorus had unsuccessfully sought to access accounts of White House officials and Mr Trump's campaign staff between May and June of this year. An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman called Microsoft's report ""farcical"". ""Iran is not concerned about who will take presidency in the White House,"" said Saeed Khatibzadeh. A report on Iranian influence efforts earlier this year from the Atlantic Council characterised Iran as being focussed on promoting a national agenda, such as its bid for regional supremacy. ""Nearly all content spread by Iran's digital influence efforts relates directly to its worldview or specific foreign policy objectives. Consequently, it is easier to identify the operations of Iran than those of other actors like Russia, whose content is more likely to be politically agnostic,"" it said.  What do the candidates say? Iran has not figured as prominently in the US election as Russia or China, both in terms of its possible influence or in policy.  President Trump has pursued an aggressive policy against Iran, withdrawing from the nuclear deal and ordering the killing of the powerful general Qasem Soleimani. Joe Biden says this policy has failed. In an editorial for CNN, he said there was ""a smart way to be tough on Iran"", pledging to push back the country's ""destabilising activities"" while also offering it a ""path to diplomacy"".

Spread to US Treasury,Coronavirus: Evening update,2024-09-25,2020-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54326730,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you on Tuesday morning.  There should be an ""urgent review"" of 10pm closure times for restaurants and pubs, according to Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham. He said people had been gathering in homes and supermarkets that were ""packed out to the rafters"" once bars closed. Scenes of crowds forming after closing time have been filmed in UK cities including Liverpool and York. There are no specific plans to review the policy, but all measures are kept under review, the PM's spokesman said. But what is the science behind the 10pm curfew? Read Reality Check's analysis here. Autumn is usually the time of year when UK politicians get together at their party conferences. But the coronavirus pandemic has put a temporary stop to the mingling, with this year's events largely being held online. Conservatives, Labourites and Liberal Democrats have to watch their leaders speak via Zoom (other video-conferencing apps are available). The parties insist the events are as vibrant and interesting as possible, but what are the big things to look out for and what has changed? Read more on that here. A BBC investigation has found criminals are setting up fake businesses on an industrial scale and successfully applying for government-backed Covid-19 emergency loans - with no intention of paying the money back. Builder Mark Telling had his details stolen to set up a bogus company - Tellings Home Made Furniture Service - that ""borrowed"" £50,000 from the scheme. Mark, who had no idea the company had been set up in his name, was horrified when the BBC told him what had happened. Victims like Mark could find themselves liable for the debt and have their credit rating badly affected. The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) has confirmed officers are being told not to install the NHS Covid-19 app - which detects when users have been close to someone with the virus - on their work smartphones. But some officers have been told they may not need to obey self-isolate alerts sent by the app on their personal phones, with Lancashire Constabulary telling staff to call its Covid-19 helpline instead. A source said the advice was due to ""security reasons"". The NPCC said the work phones policy was in place across all forces and that it is conducting an urgent review.  During lockdown, many of us have faced the awkward situation of unexpectedly appearing on a work video call wearing pyjamas or our ugliest moth-eaten jumper. Some of the world's biggest fashion houses, including Prada and Valentina Karellas, have unveiled new ""waist-up"" outfits, featuring detailed necklines and relaxed trousers - a potential replacement for those tracksuit bottoms under the desk.

Spread to US Treasury,The man who 'discovered' China's terracotta army,2024-09-25,2018-05-26,By Kevin Ponniah,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-44244493,"When archaeologist Zhao Kangmin picked up the phone in April 1974, all he was told was that a group of farmers digging a well nearby had found some relics. Desperate for water amid a drought, the farmers had been digging about a metre down when they struck hard red earth. Underneath, they had found life-size pottery heads and several bronze arrowheads. It could be an important find, Zhao's boss said, so he should go and have a look as soon as possible. A local farmer-turned-museum curator in China's central Shaanxi province, Zhao - who died on 16 May at the age of 81 - had an inkling of what he might find. He knew figures had in the past been dug out of the earth in the area near the city of Xian, home to orchards of persimmon and pomegranate trees, and not far from the tomb of China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang. A decade earlier, he had personally uncovered three kneeling crossbowmen. But he had never been certain that they dated back to the rule of the emperor - who unified the Chinese nation for the first time under the short-lived Qin dynasty (221-206 BC).  But what Zhao was about to find would surpass anything he could have imagined. The farmers, it would turn out, had stumbled upon one of the most stunning archaeological finds of the 20th Century: a  terracotta army estimated at 8,000-strong, crafted on an industrial scale 2,200 years earlier to defend the emperor in the afterlife. A ghost army, complete with horses and chariots, hidden underground and never meant to be seen by the living. Zhao headed to the location of the find with a colleague. ""Because we were so excited, we rode on our bicycles so fast it felt as if we were flying,"" he would later write in a 2014 essay. As he arrived, Zhao told the British historian John Man: ""I saw seven or eight pieces - bits of legs, arms and two heads - lying near the well, along with some bricks."" He said he immediately realised these were likely the remnants of Qin-era statues. The farmers - who had made the find weeks earlier and already sold some of the bronze arrowheads for scrap - were told to stop their work immediately. The relics were collected and brought to the museum on the back of trucks. Zhao began laboriously putting the fragments together. Some, he later said, were the size of a fingernail. Finally, after three days of work, two imposing terracotta warriors stood before him - each 1.78m tall. But while Zhao was buoyed by this incredible discovery, he was also nervous. China in 1974 was in the closing stages of Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution - under which the fearsome Red Guards sought to destroy old traditions and ways of thinking to ""purify"" society. Zhao, as Man recounts in his book The Terracotta Army, had personally been subject to a ""self-criticism"" session in the late 1960s, as a person ""involved with old things"". So now although the worst excesses of that period were over, Zhao was worried what might become of the statues. He ""decided to keep it secret"", restore the artefacts, ""and then wait for the right opportunity to report it"". But those plans would be scuppered by a young journalist from state news agency Xinhua, who was visiting the area when he came across the statues. ""He asked: 'This is such a huge discovery. Why aren't you reporting it?'"" Zhao wrote. To which the archaeologist replied: ""Even I don't know how to make sense of this. How could I report it?"" Ignoring his pleas, the journalist publicised the find, and word made its way to the very top of the Communist Party leadership. Zhao's fears that the relics could be smashed for political reasons, however, proved unfounded. The authorities in Beijing decided to excavate the site and within a few months more than 500 warriors had been uncovered. As the work continued, the extraordinary scale of what the First Emperor - a ruthless man who defeated six warring states to unite China under an imperial system that continued until 1912 - had commissioned became clear. He is said to have ordered the subterranean project - which in total covers some 56 sq km - soon after ascending to the throne at 13 years old. The thousands of warriors were placed in battle formation, ready to defend their emperor from whatever might await in the afterlife. The workmanship was detailed, with dozens of different types of heads, and in the burial pits were 100 chariots and tens of thousands of bronze weapons. The actual tomb of Emperor Qin Shi Huang remains sealed. There could be thousands of precious artefacts inside but the risks of opening the tomb, and irreparably damaging what may lie inside, means the Chinese government has held off so far. In 1975, a year after the excavations began, a decision was made to open a museum at the site. And as digging continued in the coming years, word spread about the scale of what had been found. Foreign dignitaries and some tourists began to visit. Zhao was there and lapping up the attention, says Prof Dame Jessica Rawson of the University of Oxford, who specialises in Chinese art and archaeology and visited the sites in the early 1980s.  ""By the time I met him everyone was showing him great respect and he was very much sort of enjoying the esteem associated with the terracotta warriors,"" she said. But the professor added: ""I'm not sure how he or the Chinese authorities viewed it at the time. They were probably not expecting the acclaim and success that it has later enjoyed."" It did take some years for the site to receive widespread global recognition. It was given Unesco World Heritage status in 1987, with the UN cultural body describing the warriors as ""masterpieces of realism"". Today, the site is widely recognised as a Chinese national treasure. But there is a sense that Zhao's personal role in the discovery was never fully recognised. He is by no means well-known in China.  Instead, one of the farmers - Yang Zhifa, whose shovel is said to have unearthed the first artefact  - is described to visiting tourists as the person who discovered the warriors. For years he sat in the Museum of the Terracotta Warriors and Horses, quietly and unsmilingly signing books. It was he, not Zhao, who travelled abroad to tell his story. In 1998, when then US President Bill Clinton visited, it was Yang who shook his hand. A few years ago he admitted that he didn't go and see the restored army until 1995, when the museum gift shop manager asked him to sign books. ""He said he would pay me 300 yuan a month. I thought 'that's not bad', so I came,"" he told the China Daily. Three other farmers would later join him, and their pay was tripled. But all complained they were never rewarded properly for their find, and in fact had their land seized to make way for the museum. Three of the original group of seven farmers died in terrible circumstances. One hanged himself in 1997, and two others died in their early 50s, penniless and unable to pay for medical care, according to the South China Morning Post. A local guide who brings tourists to see the warriors, Liu Guoyang, had not even heard of Zhao Kangmin. But he said imposters posed for visitors, pretending to be Yang Zhifa or one of the other farmers. Zhao was furious when, in 2004, the four surviving farmers officially asked to be registered as the men who had discovered the warriors. They didn't receive a response. ""What they want is money,"" Zhao told the China Daily. ""Seeing doesn't mean discovering. The farmers saw the terracotta fragments, but they didn't know they were cultural relics, and they even broke them. ""It was me who stopped the damage, collected the fragments and reconstructed the first terracotta warrior,"" he said. If he hadn't have turned up, he told John Man, ""it would have been a disaster"". Wu Yongqi, head of the Museum of the Teracotta Warriors from 1998-2007, agreed that Zhao, who he described as a simple but kind man, was the person who ""recognised the significance and true value of those warriors"". Without him, Mr Wu said, the extraordinary find might have been delayed for years. Unlike the farmers, who signed books for hordes of tourists at the main warriors' museum, Zhao remained at the much smaller Lintong county museum. Even in his final years, he could be found sitting next to some warriors he had restored, wearing a trilby hat and chatting to curious visitors. Although he never achieved fame or fortune, Zhao seemed content with the recognition he did receive - proudly saying that during the initial excavation an envoy from Beijing had told him that he had ""made a very big contribution to the country"". In 1990, he was personally acknowledged by the State Council and given a special pension. He is survived by a wife and two sons. Zhao's view of his own position in Chinese history - no matter what others might say - was clear. At the Lintong museum, he would sign postcards and books for tourists with an extravagant description: ""Zhao Kangmin, the first discoverer, restorer, appreciator, name-giver and excavator of the terracotta warriors.""

England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said the seasons were ""against us"" and the country was running into a ""headwind"". More deaths would follow a rise in cases over coming weeks, he said, and urged people to limit social contact. On Monday, Boris Johnson is expected to announce tougher restrictions.  In a statement to MPs, the prime minister is expected to set out plans for a three-tier local lockdown system which would see every region in England placed in one of three tiers, depending on the severity of cases. Across the UK, the R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto - is now estimated between 1.2 and 1.5. Anything above 1.0 means cases are increasing. On Saturday, 15,166 people in the UK were reported to have tested positive for coronavirus - up 1,302 on Friday's figure, according to the government's dashboard. There were a further 81 deaths - a decrease of six on Friday. However, the Office for National Statistics estimates 224,000 people in homes in England had the virus, up to 1 October - roughly double the figure reported by the ONS for each of the preceding two weeks. In his statement published on Sunday, Prof Van-Tam said that while the epidemic ""re-started"" again among younger people over the past few weeks, there is ""clear evidence of a gradual spread into older age groups"" in the worst-hit areas. ""Sadly, just as night follows day, increases in deaths will now follow on in the next few weeks,"" Prof Van-Tam said.  He warned that the UK was in a different position than during the first wave because ""we are now are going into the colder, darker winter months"".  ""We are in the middle of a severe pandemic and the seasons are against us. Basically, we are running into a headwind,"" he said. But he also said the UK has ""much improved testing capabilities"" and ""better treatments"" available, meaning that ""we know where it is and how to tackle it"". He stressed the importance of following public health guidance and minimising contact with others, adding: ""I know this is very hard, but it is an unfortunate scientific fact that the virus thrives on humans making social contact with one another."" Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average. If you can't see the look-up click here. It comes as the Labour Party and business groups voiced concern at the ""ripple effect"" of Covid shutdowns that are expected to be announced on Monday. Labour claims that close to one million workers will be at risk because the chancellor's plan to pay staff at UK companies that are told to close 67% of their wages does not extend to those who may be indirectly affected, such as those in supply chains. The Treasury denied firms that are not fully closed would not receive help. A spokesperson said: ""We do not recognise these figures,"" adding that Labour had ""incorrectly"" listed some sectors as not benefitting from the scheme. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will set out the new rules for hotspots in the House of Commons on Monday.  Every region of England is expected to be placed in one of three tiers, with the Liverpool City Region thought to be in the category with the strictest rules.  Plans are not yet finalised, BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said, but that is likely to mean pubs will close, restaurants could face restrictions, people may even be told not to travel in and out of the area. Schools and universities would remain open.  More talks are expected on Sunday between the government and leaders in parts of England that are expecting new restrictions.  Council leaders and mayors have expressed their anger at what they see as inadequate help for those who will no longer be able to work.  Many regions are demanding more local control over contact tracing, while others have raised the possibility of legal action if they do not get the support they demand.  The government says it is committed to involving local leaders in decision-making. Discussions with Downing Street on Friday were described on Merseyside as ""frosty,"" but ""cordial and giving on both sides"".  Leaders in Greater Manchester do not yet have another meeting with the government arranged, Chris Mason added - but one is expected before the prime minister's statement on Monday.  In Nottingham, Newcastle, Sunderland, Leeds and elsewhere, leaders and residents await the announcement of the template for the next phase of the pandemic.  How has coronavirus affected you?

Spread to US Treasury,Europe ramps up coronavirus support for ailing firms,2024-09-25,2020-03-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51874029,"European authorities are increasing efforts to try to stave off the economic effects of coronavirus. The European Union (EU) will put a package of measures in place including a €37bn euro (£33bn) investment initiative. And German finance minister Olaf Scholz said his country could part nationalise firms to tackle the crisis. Norway suspended some airline taxes as global aviation body IATA said carriers could fold over the next few months. Markets have become increasingly volatile as the impact of the spread of the coronavirus becomes more pronounced. Global stocks soared on Friday, after record falls on Thursday. Concerns over the economic effects of the pandemic led to a number of actions by European authorities on Friday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU response package will include giving member states flexibility on budget deficits and state aid. The EU will also guarantee €8bn in loans to 100,000 firms to support the corporate sector, she said. ""I am convinced that the European Union can withstand this shock,"" she said. ""But each member state needs to live up to its full responsibility and the European Union as a whole needs to be determined, coordinated and united."" Ms von de Leyen added that the Commission wanted to ensure ""necessary supplies to our health systems"" and to support people's incomes and jobs. Meanwhile, German finance minister Olaf Scholz said Germany would give tax relief and deferrals to firms which would take billions from the state treasury, and could take bail out ailing firms by taking stakes in them. ""The German government... all agreed together that we will use all means to ensure we can tackle this crisis,"" Mr Scholz said. ""We will every available tool at our disposal to get through these difficult times with all our economic possibilities and to make sure we come out of this situation in good shape."" Airlines have been hit by a slump in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with thousands of flight cancellations as the virus spread. On Thursday, Norwegian Air said it would suspend half of its staff and cancel 4,000 flights because of the outbreak, with the situation exacerbated by sweeping travel restrictions between the US and Europe. On Friday, Norway's government suspended some fees and taxes levied on airlines and said it is in talks with the country's aviation industry on further measures to help alleviate the situation, finance minister Jan Tore Sanner said. ""We are well informed of the wishes of the airline industries... I don't want to speculate on what measures could be implemented,"" said finance minister Jan Sanner said. The chief executive of the International Air Transport Association, Alexandre de Juniac, said more airlines could collapse if the coronavirus crisis last more than another two to three months. Mr de Juniac said on Friday that global revenue losses would be ""probably above"" $113bn that it estimated a week ago, before the Trump administration's announcement of US travel curbs on passengers from much of continental Europe. Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he expected the US economic hit from the coronavirus outbreak to be short-term, and that the Trump administration was keeping its options open for any other future steps that may be needed. Mr Mnuchin said the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve were working to keep markets open and to provide ""unlimited liquidity.""  He also said negotiations with Democrats over an economic relief package were also going well. ""We're going to look at every tool in the toolbox,"" he said."
Spread to US Treasury,Halloween: Can we go trick or treating or not?,2024-09-25,2020-10-02,By Becky Morton and Doug Faulkner,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54180119,"From trick or treating to apple bobbing, the traditions of 31 October aren't things you would immediately consider to be ""Covid-safe"". So does that mean Halloween is cancelled? The answer kind of depends on where you live. In Scotland, trick or treating - or guising - has been strongly discouraged by the government, with Deputy First Minister John Swinney telling parents going door-to-door ""brings an additional and avoidable risk of spreading the virus"". ""Our clear advice for families is to avoid it,"" he said. And with people banned from meeting other households indoors, Halloween parties are also definitely off the cards. In Wales, Halloween falls during a 17-day firebreak lockdown, meaning meeting people from other households, either indoors or outdoors, is not allowed. ""We are asking people to stay home during the firebreak period to slow the spread of coronavirus and help save lives,"" a government spokesman said. Northern Ireland's Public Health Agency (PHA) has said it is important people continue to follow the restrictions, which prevent meeting indoors with other households and restrict the number of people who can meet outside to 15. Dr Gerry Waldron, head of health protection at PHA, said apple bobbing was a definite no-no, and asked people not to trick or treat. So what about in England? Well, it depends on what tier your local area is in. Downing Street has suggested trick or treating can take place as long as the local restrictions are followed. The prime minister's official spokesman this week said: ""The rules are those which apply to household mixing in general and what that means in practice is if you are in a very high alert level (Tier 3) then you cannot mix with other households indoors or in private outdoor spaces. ""If you're in a high Covid alert level (Tier 2) then the rule of six applies in private gardens and outdoor spaces but households must not mix indoors. ""And in terms of the medium alert level (Tier 1), you can meet indoors and outdoors in groups of no more than six people."" He added people would have to use their common sense. The Cabinet Office said people should check which restrictions applied to them, but said it was not planning to give specific guidance on Halloween. In the US, where Halloween is big business, some cities have already said traditional trick or treating is not recommended. And the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has outlined guidance on how risky Halloween activities are, ranging from lower-risk activities to higher risk ones. The safer activities, it said, included having a movie night with your family, carving pumpkins with your own household or going on a socially-distanced scavenger hunt to find Halloween-theme items outside. Higher risk activities include traditional trick or treating, where sweets are handed to children, and fancy dress parities indoors. So what are the risks of trick or treating? ""If you're doing something that increases your contacts with other people then you are automatically increasing their risk and your risk,"" says Dr Chris Smith, a virologist at the University of Cambridge. Covid-19 can be spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus, as well as through droplets breathed in.  ""There's the issue of how you give a treat,"" he said. ""If everyone's scrabbling round in a bucket full of sweets and they touch all of them then there's a risk of transmission."" To reduce this risk, he recommends giving out individually wrapped sweets so children aren't touching something they then put straight in their mouths.  Safer still, you could leave sweets outside the door for people to help themselves. But while large gatherings are probably off the cards this year, virtual events are still a possibility. Elizabeth Lusty runs online choirs for children and adults and is hosting a Halloween-themed session with fancy dress and singalongs to tunes like Monster Mash and Time Warp.  Usually she would host a Halloween party for her children, Scarlett, aged three, and seven-year-old Frank, but this year the family, from west London, won't be able to.  Instead, she's still planning to decorate the house and hopes to try to organise a safe trail with some of her neighbours who are doing the same. In Bristol, a map of the ""spookiest houses"" has been created by a mother of five who says she is ""obsessed by Halloween"". Natasha Wood set up the Facebook group Halloween displays in Bristol when she realised trick or treating would be different this year due to coronavirus, Since then more than 170 decorated Halloween houses have been added to a digital map covering most of the city. Among the displays is an 18ft (5.49m) pirate ship complete with skeleton crew. ""I didn't expect it to but it has literally snowballed and gone crazy in the last two weeks,"" Ms Wood said. A similar scheme has been organised in the Marple area of Stockport, with an online map of decorated houses created for families to follow.  People are being encouraged to remain two metres apart and not to knock on doors or leave out treats - so children will only be able to admire pumpkin displays from a distance.  And of course, if you're dressing up, why not make your mask part of your costume. ""Because it's Halloween I'd say people are quite likely to be wearing a mask anyway,"" Dr Chris Smith adds. ""So if they can make a face covering work it's way into their costume then even better."""
Spread to US Treasury,Officials hint at tougher restrictions in Scotland,2024-09-25,2021-12-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-59717594,"Senior officials have suggested Scotland could face tougher Covid-19 restrictions around the new year. Prof Jason Leitch said it was better to ""act harder"" and ""early"" while Scotland Office minister Iain Stewart said ""big decisions"" may need to be made. A four-nations Cobra meeting was held this weekend following calls for more financial support for businesses. However, the first minister said she had no plans to recall Holyrood to discuss further measures. She said the situation was ""unpredictable"" and that parliament ""will sit as necessary"", following a report in The Herald on Sunday. She tweeted: ""No idea what basis of this headline is, and it's not helpful to add to anxiety people already feel. It's a week before @ScotParl is even in recess."" Exactly one year ago the first minister tightened restrictions around Christmas after it was hoped the rules would ease between 23 and 27 December. Omicron is now the dominant variant in Scotland, with more than 10,000 UK cases reported on Saturday alone. Currently, Scots are being advised to reduce their socialising as much as possible and to limit gatherings to three households - though large-scale events including the Scottish League Cup final and Edinburgh Hogmanay are still going ahead. However, Prof Jason Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, said the Scottish government's tone had ""shifted"" in the last few days. Speaking to BBC Scotland's Sunday Show, he said: ""The position is worrying, I make no bones about that. This new variant didn't exist 21 days ago - it's quite astonishing and it's happened just before Christmas again. ""Better to act early than later, better to act harder than softer - we've learned that over two years I'm afraid."" While about 53% of the eligible Scottish population has now received a booster jab, Prof Leitch added that the population was ""not vaccinated enough"" - and he shared concerns about mass gatherings such as football matches. He said: ""Buses, trains, all of them worry me - the outdoor experience at St Johnstone or Hampden, that doesn't worry me particularly, but getting to and from it do.  ""I don't think any of these events are safe but nor is your studio and nor is my house. What we're trying to do is create safer environments for people as best as we possibly can."" Prof Leitch spoke shortly after the UK's Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the Andrew Marr Show he would not rule out new coronavirus measures before Christmas - saying there are ""no guarantees"" in the pandemic. In leaked minutes seen by the BBC, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) suggested that if no further restrictions were introduced, hospital admissions could peak at between 3,000 and 10,000 a day - and deaths between 600 and 6,000. But Mr Javid said the government was challenging scientific data and considering wider factors before bringing in more measures, adding: ""I don't think it would be appropriate for government to take it [the advice] verbatim."" Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, called for tougher restrictions in Scotland. ""We can't boost ourselves out in time,"" she said. ""We need more restrictions now. There are lots of things we can do individually which will make a huge difference but making things more official - and by that I'm talking about curtailing access to certain things, closing certain things - does bring the numbers down and buys us more time for people to be boosted."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned on Friday that Omicron was now the dominant strain of the virus and a ""tsunami"" was beginning to hit Scotland. New guidance for shops, hospitality venues and other businesses was introduced that same day, in a bid to stem the transmission of Covid. Normally it would have been the busiest day of the year for many firms, but the hospitality sector reported a ""bleak Friday"" and repeated calls for more financial support. Scotland's Finance Secretary Kate Forbes is seeking £500m from the Treasury, a figure she said was based on previous monthly furlough costs and grants. Scotland Office minister Iain Stewart told the Sunday Show the UK government had already provided ""considerable help"" for the hospitality sector. However, he conceded that ""big decisions may need to be made"" as discussions between governments were ongoing - which included negotiations on support from the army for the booster rollout. He said: ""There isn't a playbook for this and there are no cost-free decisions - every measure you take to provide public health restrictions because of the virus has other consequences, not just economic. It has effects on people's mental health and children's learning. ""I know the effects this is having on hospitality and leisure and there are discussions happening this weekend on what the appropriate response will be to that."" Appearing on BBC Breakfast, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said there was clear evidence people in Scotland were changing their activity in response to the new guidance.   Asked what it would take for more measures to be introduced, he said the government was continuing to monitor the ""really aggressive"" spread of Omicron. He added: ""We will, of course, be updating parliament in the course of this week, on the further views that we have about any other measures that we need to take."""
Spread to US Treasury,Hogmanay events cancelled as Covid rules tightened,2024-09-25,2021-12-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-59745262,"Edinburgh's Hogmanay events have been cancelled and football matches will be effectively spectator-free as part of tough new Covid rules in Scotland. All outdoor events will be limited to just 500 people to help slow the spread of Omicron. Indoor events such as concerts will be limited to 200 people if they are seated, or 100 for standing.  The new restrictions come into force on Boxing Day. They will be in place for three weeks - although there will be no limit to how many people can meet up at Christmas.  The Old Firm derby between Celtic and Rangers on 2 January and the Edinburgh derby between Hearts and Hibs the following day are among the football fixtures that will be affected by the new rules. The government fears that last Sunday's League Cup Final in front of a capacity crowd at Hampden may have been a ""super spreader"" event, with Deputy First Minister John Swinney saying he regrets not making the decision to play matches without spectators sooner. Celtic have asked for the Scottish Premiership's three-week winter break - which is due to start after the Edinburgh derby on 3 January - to be brought forward to ""maximise the prospect of all supporters being able to attend matches and support the game they love."" All of the major Hogmanay events in Edinburgh - including the street party, the torchlit precession and the midnight firework display - have now been cancelled, as have many other events in towns and cities across the country.  Physical distancing of 1m will now need to be in place for all events that do go ahead under the restrictions. Pubs and other hospitality venues selling alcohol will need to reintroduce table service from 27 December. And indoor hospitality and leisure venues will be required to ensure there is a 1m distance between groups of people who are attending together - which could force nightclubs to close. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""This will of course make sports matches, including football, effectively spectator-free over this three week period. ""And it will also mean that large-scale Hogmanay celebrations - including that planned here in our capital city - will not proceed"".  Wales had already announced plans for sporting events to be held without crowds from Boxing Day, and London has cancelled its New Year's Eve event in Trafalgar Square. Many concerts, theatre productions and other events had already been cancelled voluntarily in Scotland.  Omicron is now thought to account for 62.9% of all Covid cases in Scotland, with the first minister saying there was ""still no compelling evidence that Omicron is intrinsically milder than previous strains"". Ms Sturgeon said the much higher transmissibility of the new variant meant that large gatherings ""have the potential to become very rapid super-spreader events, putting large numbers at risk of getting infected very quickly"".  She added: ""Limiting these events helps reduce the risk of widespread transmission. It also cuts down the transmission risks associated with travel to and from such events  ""And these large events put an additional burden on emergency services, especially the police and ambulance services. ""At a time when these services are already under severe pressure and also dealing with high staff absences, limiting large scale events will help them focus on delivering essential services to the public."" Ms Sturgeon stressed that the priority for the government was to ensure that schools re-open as normal after the Christmas holidays. And she again urged people to cut their contacts with people in other households as much as possible ahead of Christmas, and to stay at home as much as possible.  The Federation of Small Business said the new measures would make trading ""drastically more difficult for huge numbers of small businesses in Scotland"".  Its policy chair, Andrew McRae, said: ""The social distancing restrictions will mean shops and hospitality firms can serve fewer customers.  ""And the changes to events, such as sports matches and Hogmanay celebrations, will have a knock-on impact on local economies."" The Scottish Licensed Traders Association said the restrictions would be a ""knockout blow""  to many businesses that were already struggling because of the pandemic. The Scottish government will now double the £100m it had already pledged to businesses hit by new Omicron restrictions.  And Ms Sturgeon said recent announcements by the UK Treasury ""give us additional spending power now of £175m"" - bringing the total to £375m, all of which will be allocated to business support. While there are no changes to the rules and advice for Christmas gatherings, significant new restrictions will take effect as we head towards the new year. Edinburgh's Hogmanay is off for the second year in a row and big football matches can only be played before the smallest of crowds. The return of one metre distancing indoors will reduce the capacity of pubs and restaurants, theatres and cinemas - reducing their potential turnover too. There is fresh financial help worth £275m from the Scottish government which draws on additional funding announced by the UK Treasury at the weekend. Even though that's on top of an initial £100m earmarked by Holyrood ministers last week - it is unlikely to be nearly enough to offset the economic damage restrictions will cause. The first minister has renewed calls for the Chancellor to re-introduce a furlough scheme - something the Treasury has not included in the support package it announced today. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said he understood the ""frustration and anger"" that many people would have over the new restrictions, but urged people to come forward for vaccination as the ""best way out of this"". He also called for household contacts of Covid cases to be allowed to end their self-isolation if they test negative, saying the current rules were well-intentioned but could ""grind our transport network, our economy and public services to a halt"". ScotRail cancelled more than 100 trains on Monday, largely because of crew members being affected by Covid.  Ms Sturgeon said the government was ""actively considering"" changing household isolation rules once the booster campaign is complete, but said it would be ""counter-productive"" to do so while case numbers are rising. Meanwhile Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar said there should be ""much more significant financial support"" for businesses and a ""furlough-type scheme"" for sectors which are effectively shut down."
Spread to US Treasury,The tax that hits struggling High Streets hardest,2024-09-25,2020-03-09,By Emma Simpson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51676242,"Finding a new retailer for a prime spot in Blackpool town centre used to be easy. In the 1980s and 1990s, firms would have been fighting over the keys to 18-22 Victoria Street, a large, modern two-storey unit directly opposite the shopping centre. Not any more. Until last month, the property had been rented to Topshop and Topman. But their owner, Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group, walked away when the lease came up for renewal. His shops have been struggling to keep up with the competition, and dozens, up and down the country, are being closed. ""We are having difficulty attracting any interest, never mind a national retailer,"" says Paul Moran, a ratings surveyor whose company, Mason Owen, is tasked with finding a new tenant. Business rates, he says, were a factor in Arcadia's decision to pull out, and they're now a big barrier to someone else moving in. ""The first thing tenants look at are their outgoings. And when they see the rates bill, they will be put off by that. Normally you'd expect to be paying 50% of your rent in rates, but the rates bill in this shop is dramatically higher than that."" With retail in turmoil, pressure is growing for change. So what are business rates and why are they a problem? Business rates are a kind of council tax for commercial property. All sorts of premises have to pay them, from offices, warehouses and pubs, to power plants, train stations and shops. Bills are worked out based on the government's estimate of how much the property would cost to rent on the open market. Businesses have to pay the tax regardless of whether the space makes any profit or not. As a rule of thumb, your business rates bill is now typically half of your rent. That's a big financial burden in itself for retailers with lots of shops. But many of our national chains aren't even being charged the right amount to begin with. They're paying millions of pounds more in rates than their rents would imply. Properties get revalued every few years by the government to make sure the occupiers are paying the correct sums. Some bills go up and some go down. The last revaluation was in 2017.  For towns like Blackpool, this should have been good news because retail rents had collapsed. Their business rates bills should have dived as a result, bringing some relief to a town grappling with too many empty shops and years of government austerity.   But here's the problem. Changes in bills, both up and down, are phased in gradually over several years to help businesses adjust. It's like a shock absorber, and it's called ""transitional relief"".  The system is good news if your bills are going up, but not so good if you're in a property due a big reduction. It's a bit like being told you're due a tax cut, but your bill will only be cut incrementally over five years, and you may never get the full reduction. It works like this because the government wants to make sure it receives the same amount in business rates in real terms, or adjusting for inflation, each year. So rate rises and decreases must balance. This is an England-only policy. And it's the largest stores occupied by big chains that are the most affected. Blackpool's 18-22 Victoria Street is a good example. Back in 2010, this property was valued at £246,000. Remember, this is the equivalent of what it could be rented for. By 2017, this had dropped to £146,000. This fall should have produced a business rates bill that year of £69,934. The actual bill was £118,364. ""The annual business rates bill for this property today is still £112,000,"" says Mason Owen's Paul Moran.  ""I've been involved in ratings valuations for 40 years. But I've not seen a situation where the actual liability for a shop is so out of line with the… rental value in locations like Blackpool. It's unsustainable."" Down the road is Poundland, and its business rates numbers are even more striking. Its business rates bill should have dropped by 46% between 2010 and 2017. Instead it will only have gone down in real terms by 13% by the next revaluation next year. According to Altus Group, a ratings advisory company, this one store is effectively paying £167,121 more in rates than it should. Poundland isn't struggling - far from it. Unlike a lot of other retailers, it's still managing to grow sales in its physical stores. It has 850 shops in the UK and Ireland and is interested in opening more. Still, its UK and Ireland boss, Barry Williams, says transitional relief is costing his business millions of pounds. ""Transitional relief? I call it comic relief. It needs to be scrapped,"" he says. ""I could open more shops. I could employ more colleagues. I could create better products. It just holds the business back from investing and from driving growth. It makes us question certain sites that we'd move into and for many of our competitors it means they are actually closing stores,"" he says. The crisis on our High Streets was a big issue on the doorstep during December's general election. The new government, which is on a mission to ""level up"" regional inequalities, is spending about £3.6bn to revitalise struggling town centres. But at the same time, many of these places are the hardest hit by transitional relief. ""The phasing in of very large tax rises is a good thing when there are big upward shifts in property values. The big question is how you pay for that,"" says Robert Hayton, head of UK business rates at Altus Group. ""A very small supplement on all bills would spread the burden. But taking from those local economies that have struggled isn't the answer. It affords them no respite to recover and rebuild and certainly doesn't aid the levelling up of prosperity.""  The leader of Blackpool Council says rates bills just need to match current rents. ""There is some £7m which isn't in our pockets because it's going elsewhere, and that is always the complexity of a tariff and top-up system. There is an unfairness inherent in the whole system. It's outdated,"" says Councillor Simon Blackburn.  There are always individual winners and losers with business rates. It's the way this tax works - the burden is redistributed when one area becomes better off relative to another. But if you take a deep dive into the numbers, there are also winners and losers in different parts of our economy. The chart below is based on the government's own numbers, which show how much each sector has been granted in relief to phase in large increases, as well as the amount of tax reductions that have been held back. The biggest winner is the Central List, which includes some of Britain's biggest private infrastructure companies, such as utility firms and telecommunication providers. ""Other"" is basically everything else that isn't office, industrial or retail businesses. It covers public sector buildings like schools and hospitals (which are required to pay business rates), as well as leisure and hospitality. The losers are those sectors on the left, and the biggest one is retail. Over the past three years this sector has paid an extra £543m because of transitional relief. ""Retailers are paying a disproportionate slice of the UK's business rates bills, and this burden is based purely on the size and value of their properties, no matter how well their businesses are doing,"" says John Webber, head of ratings at Colliers International. ""Not only that, they are being clobbered by transitional relief."" You can understand why the government has been reluctant to meddle with this system of taxation. Business rates generated £25bn for HM Treasury in England alone this financial year, according to Altus. The tax is also easy to collect and difficult to avoid. The government has promised a fundamental review of business rates and will halve rates for small shops from April. ""Since 2016 we've cut business rates across the board, with reforms that will reduce their cost by £13bn over the next five years,"" says a Treasury spokesperson. It's worth pointing out that a lot of smaller, independent retailers don't pay any rates. That's because if a business's property is deemed to be worth less than £12,000, it is eligible for 100% relief. It's bigger stores that have a rateable value of more than £51,000, and get no government help, that pay 70% of the sector's overall rates bill. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, it isn't business rates which are hurting the High Street, but competition from online. It says abolishing rates, for instance, would largely lead to higher shop rents.   But one experienced retail property investor argues this view misses the point.  ""Yes, some rents would potentially go up if you reduce rates… but this isn't a normal market any more,"" says Mark Williams of RivingtonHark, which invests in and manages a range of town centre properties. ""There's a huge structural change going on, and there are many examples where landlords are subsidising the rates payable by the occupier simply to try and let space."" In Nuneaton, for example, the local council charges Poundland just £1 each year to rent a store in a shopping centre it owns because it is desperate to attract tenants. The business rates bill is £117,000. Reforming business rates won't stop the huge shift to online shopping and the need for fewer shops, which are the big challenges for UK retailers. In other words, there's too much retail space and not enough demand. While business rates are never the sole reason for a retailer shutting up shop, it does feel like the tax is out of kilter with the seismic changes taking place on the High Street. More frequent revaluations would help. And this is something the government is introducing from April next year when revaluations will move to every three years from the standard five-year period. The clock is ticking. The next period for bills is set to begin in April 2021. If transitional relief isn't sorted by then, John Webber of Colliers says the problem is going to get even worse. ""We will see an increasing number of empty shops because retailers will no longer be able to afford to stay in the same number of physical units,"" he says."
Spread to US Treasury,Government position on teacher pay 'shameful',2024-09-25,2020-07-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-53408375,"The Isle of Man government's position on pay increases for teachers is ""nothing less than shameful"", teaching unions have said. A joint statement from four unions said the government had refused ""any negotiations other than to discuss cuts"" during a meeting earlier.  It follows a long-running dispute over pay conditions with the Department of Education, Sport and Culture (DESC). The DESC said Covid-19 had placed ""unprecedented demands"" on finances.  The National Education Union (NEU), Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) and the National Association of Schoolmasters, Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) called on the government to negotiate in ""good faith"" and avoid making cuts to education to facilitate any raises.  The dispute began in 2018 after the School Teachers' Review Body's recommendation of an across-the-board 3.5% pay rise was not fully implemented. A deal that would see newly qualified teachers paid almost £30,000 and the lowest pay bands scrapped was accepted by the NEU on 17 January but rejected its by members.  Meanwhile, members of ASCL and NAHT began action short of strike in January, with NASUWT members following suit in February. Talks between unions and the government were halted in March due to the coronavirus outbreak. In the joint statement, the unions said representatives had been left ""deeply disappointed"" by the meeting earlier in which they said the DESC had ""cited clear instructions from the treasury, allegedly received 15 minutes prior to the commencement of the meeting, that no additional funds were available"". ""The joint trade unions were shocked and frustrated that despite agreeing to the meeting, the government refused to enter into any negotiations other than to discuss cuts,"" the statement said, adding that they were ""further appalled that there seemed to be no immediate appetite... to request any additional funding"". ""The government's position is nothing less than shameful, and will come as a tremendous disappointment to all teachers who continue to go the extra mile,"" it added. Speaking after the meeting, the NAHT's Rob Kelsall said it ""could lead to a resumption of industrial action"", while the ASCL's Sara Ford said the union was ""committed to trying to find a resolution to this dispute"". DESC Minister Dr Alex Allinson said having made ""numerous offers"", all of which had been ""turned down by the trade unions side"", the government had made it clear that ""circumstances had now changed following the health emergency"". ""It had been hoped that new resources might be available to support a pay offer... budgetary constraints caused by the pandemic have meant that no such commitment can be given."" He said teachers had ""already received a pay increase of 2.75% for 2019-20"" and the unions had wanted ""an additional 9% spread over three years in addition to unconsolidated lump sums [worth] £1.75m for those on the upper and leadership pay scales"".  He added that the unions had ""appeared unable to appreciate the unprecedented demands on government's finances as a result of the pandemic"", but said he was ""still optimistic"" that a ""positive resolution"" could be reached.

Spread to US Treasury,Russia and Turkey risk turning Libya into another Syria,2024-09-25,2020-05-31,By Jeremy Bowen,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52846879,"Libya looks to be at the end of one bleak chapter, but there is no guarantee that the next will be any better for a country that has been torn to pieces by civil war and foreign intervention since Col Muammar Gaddafi met his grisly death in 2011.  Since last year Gen Khalifa Haftar, the strongman of eastern Libya, has been trying to capture the capital, Tripoli, in the far west of the vast country. Intervention by Turkey in support of the Tripoli government, recognised by the United Nations, looks to be decisive. Gen Haftar's men, along with a force of several thousand Russian mercenaries, are in retreat.  But that does not mean that Libyan civilians can expect the peace they crave. Once again they are the biggest losers.  Their country, richly endowed with oil and gas, should be able to guarantee them rights of which they can only dream: education; healthcare and a decent standard of living. They don't have any of them, or safety.  Libyans who have not lost their homes have been locking down to prevent the spread of Covid-19, hoping they do not also become the target of artillery, drones or warplanes. The war has destroyed most of Libya's clinics and hospitals.  Around 200,000 civilians in western Libya have already been displaced from their homes, according to Hanan Saleh of Human Rights Watch.  In a recent webinar organised by the think-tank, Chatham House, Ms Saleh said that ""you have to look at Libya currently as an accountability-free zone and it has been that way unfortunately since 2011"".  All parties in the war have been reckless in their treatment of civilians, though Gen Haftar's side, she said, has committed more documented abuses that could potentially be crimes of war.  It is hard to believe now, but after Col Gaddafi was overthrown it looked for a while as if Libya might have a decent future.  Back in 2011 I walked with the British ambassador through the ruins of his embassy in Tripoli; it had been attacked and torched by a mob after Nato started bombing the Gaddafi regime's forces.  Next to the charred frame of what had been a 1920s billiard table, we talked about the pride that Libyans had in their revolution, their luck in not being cursed with significant sectarian differences like Syria or Iraq, and about the treasure house of oil and gas under the vast Libyan desert.  Perhaps even tourism would be possible. Libya has 2,000 kilometres of Mediterranean beaches, and Roman archaeological sites that are the equal of anything in Italy. But Libya was broken, and in almost a decade since that conversation it has continued to fragment. You may be interested in:  The militias that took on the Gaddafi regime never disbanded, and came to like their power.  Once the colonel, his sons and the family's cronies were gone, no kind of functioning state was left. The men who acquired the important job titles found that if there were any levers of government to pull, they came away in their hands.  Libyans who saw themselves as revolutionaries were in no mood to ask for much help from the powerful countries which had provided weapons and most importantly an air force to help them win.  In turn, the outsiders were relieved to be able to turn away, declaring the job was well done. Removing Gaddafi was one thing. Helping to build a country was something very different.  It did not take long for the remains of Libya to fall into even smaller pieces. The bigger towns became city-states.  The militias had their own agendas and would not lay down their weapons. A series of diplomats, mostly under the auspices of the United Nations tried, unsuccessfully, to promote dialogue and reconciliation.  By 2014 Gen Haftar had emerged as a power in the broken land, expelling radical Islamists from Benghazi, Libya's second city and the capital of Eastern Libya.  Gen Haftar was well known in Libya, as a general who had fallen out with Gaddafi. In exile he had spent years plotting Gaddafi's downfall from a new base in Langley, Virginia - the American town that is also the headquarters of the CIA.  Libya, in reality already in pieces, eventually found itself with two rival governments.  Gen Haftar controlled the east from Benghazi, and set about unifying the country by marching west to attack Tripoli, the capital, aiming to unseat the internationally recognised Government of National Accord led by Fayez al Sarraj.  Supporting Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj (l) Supporting Gen Khalifa Haftar (r) It was certain that foreign powers would get involved in the civil war. Libya is a desirable prize. It has the biggest reserves of oil and gas in Africa, with a population of less than seven million.  Strategically, it is opposite Europe and its hydrocarbons can be exported direct to markets in the west through the Mediterranean. Rival producers in the Gulf need to ship their exports through potentially dangerous sea lanes.  Gen Haftar's most important backers are Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.  Turkey is the key ally of the Sarraj government in Tripoli.  The US has sent a variety of signals out about Libya under President Donald Trump, offering encouragement at different times to Mr Sarraj and Gen Haftar, and bombing jihadist extremists when they can find them.  Now their biggest concern is that Russia's President Putin might be establishing himself in Libya in the same way that he has dug into Syria.  Libya's war has developed disturbing similarities with Syria's. The arbiters of the fate and future of both are the same foreigners.  The proxy wars in Libya have become, in many ways, a continuation of the proxy wars in Syria. Both sides have flown in Syrian militias to apply the skills they have gained in almost a decade of war in their homeland.   It is possible that Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Russia's President Vladimir Putin have applied in Libya a version of the deals they have made in Syria.  The Russian mercenaries who have fought with Gen Haftar are from an organisation known as the Wagner Group, run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close associate of President Putin. The Wagner fighters have also been used in Syria.  It is significant that the Russian pullback from Tripoli has not been harassed by Turkey's highly efficient military drones. The Russians have also moved advanced warplanes into Libya.  President Putin and President Erdogan could have agreed to end Gen Haftar's offensive against Tripoli so they can split the spoils between them, according to Wolfram Lacher, a German academic who has just published a book about the fragmentation of Libya.  In the Chatham House webinar he said: ""We are talking about two foreign powers trying to carve up spheres of influence in Libya and their ambition may well be for this arrangement to be long term.""  He doubted whether the other powers involved in Libya, and the Libyans themselves, would quietly accept the arrangement.  The next big battle could be for Tarhuna, a town that lies around 90km (55 miles) south-east of the capital.  It is Gen Haftar's western stronghold, controlled by a militia known as al-Qaniyat, mainly made up of men previously loyal to the Gaddafi regime.  Troops loyal to the Tripoli government, former opponents of Gaddafi, are advancing on Tarhuna.  The fight against the old regime is still a factor in Libya's never-ending war. "
Spread to US Treasury,Fleeing Dunkirk: A 1940 holiday in hell,2024-09-25,2017-07-15,By Nadia Ragozhina,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40428015,"Christopher Nolan's World War Two thriller Dunkirk hits the screens in the US and the UK this month, dramatising the daring rescue of 300,000 Allied troops from the approaching German army.  But as they escaped across the English Channel, thousands of civilians were left to fend for themselves. This is the story of one family. It was May 1940 and Eva Zusman, her husband Stanislas and four-year-old daughter Anita had arrived in the Belgian beach resort of De Panne from their home in Antwerp. They were joined by Stanislas's father and close family. It was a holiday arranged at the last minute to celebrate Eva's return from her hometown of Geneva, where she was visiting her family.  De Panne was ideal for a family summer holiday. White sandy beaches stretched as far as the eye could see.  But the day after their arrival on 10 May, Germany invaded Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. For Anita - who is now 80 and living in Geneva - the news came from a local police warden carrying a drum.  Belgium's resistance did not last long. Thousands of Nazi troops were marching across the Low Countries towards northern France and the coast.  Eva and Stanislas hesitated, aware that as Jews they would be among the first to be targeted in occupied Belgium. After several days they joined others making their way on foot towards France. The pace was slow. Born with a deformed hip, Eva limped heavily while her father-in-law, Abraham, needed a wheelchair. Anita and her cousins, at first terrified of what was happening, were soon distracted by views of the sea and ran ahead.  Stanislas bought a car and hired a young local man to drive the Zusman family towards the border. Once in France, they stopped at a guesthouse to rest.  They left their suitcases in the car and paid for their driver to spend the night at the guesthouse with them. In the morning they were to continue their journey south. Eva would not be separated from the fur coat that she had bought in Geneva the previous winter. It was to accompany her every step of her journey.  In the morning both car and driver had disappeared. Their only means of transport and their belongings had gone.  By 15 May the Netherlands had surrendered to Germany and the Zusman family were on their way to Dunkirk. When they arrived days later, the city felt unnaturally quiet. Bomb explosions could be heard in the distance and smoke was visible to the north. Eva searched for provisions and a place to stay, and found both in a farmhouse on the outskirts of the city.  What happened in Dunkirk was to haunt Eva for many years after the war and she wrote down her memories in her diary.  ""We didn't know that the entire British army was back in Dunkirk as they were trying to escape back by the sea. We spent a terrible night under bombardment in Dunkirk, we didn't know what awaited the soldiers on the beach. Stanis thought we should board one of the boats heading to England too."" By 21 May, British, French and Belgian troops were in effect trapped along the French coast.  A French division had held the Germans near Lille and given the Allies time to gather in Dunkirk, but time was running out. Prime Minister Winston Churchill had called for small private boats and ships to gather along the coast to take part in the evacuation. Stanis and his family joined other civilians fleeing the bombardment. They headed south-east, hoping for a train to take them away from the fighting. Bikes, carts, horse-drawn carriages, trucks, prams, young and old, women and children fled south in whatever way they could.  Nobody knew how long the journey would last or where they would spend the night. More than 20,000 civilians were to lose their lives in France in May and June 1940.  Anita still remembers the warmth of her mother's fur coat. She slept on it and covered herself with it when it was cold at night. It became more of a treasure than Eva could have ever imagined. Then came the separation. Stanis decided to buy a motorcycle with a sidecar.  A young man was found to drive it and Eva was to go in the sidecar with her daughter, while Stanis would follow with his father and his brother's family. Their aim was to head south to Lyon, from where they thought they would take a train. The journey was slow because of the crowds of refugees. Eventually the petrol ran out and mother and daughter continued on foot.  Even now Anita remembers the hunger. They went for days with little or nothing to eat, sometimes buying bread and vegetables from locals. Eva wrote in her diary: ""I will never forget a farmer who gave me an egg for Anita and a lady who wanted to snatch it from me to give it to her elderly husband. I kept it for Anita, I was able to boil it, she ate it very happily and she vomited it straight away."" Most people on the roads slept under trees and in the bushes, but Eva hoped for a safer place.  One night she knocked on the door of a farm, asking for food and a place to sleep. But the farmer was overwhelmed by the number of refugees on his doorstep. Turned away, they sheltered in nearby fields and awoke to the siren of an approaching German Stuka dive-bomber.  Stuka bombers terrified the local population at this time, their sirens a warning of imminent attack. Eva watched the plane dive as it approached its target, its machine-gun spraying bullets everywhere. Then it dropped a bomb and the farm went up in flames.  Eva and Anita ran as far as they could, to escape the heat of the flames, and the danger that the fire would spread to the dry fields nearby.  Eva threw herself on the ground, trying to cover Anita with her own body. What would happen to her child if she died, she thought. It would be better if they died together.  The German checkpoint was barely visible, as so many people were attempting to get through.  Long lines of trucks, carriages and those on foot had found their journey brought to an unexpected stop. Eva had heard rumours that the Germans were coming. But no-one realised that the occupying army was already everywhere.  At the checkpoint Eva came face to face with the first Nazi soldier she had ever seen. Unsure how to address him, she decided on German, to do everything in her power to get herself and her daughter out of the French fields and back to the Belgian capital, Brussels. While Eva had been talking, Anita had been picking daisies and came to her mother's rescue. She handed him the bunch of flowers she had picked and remembers the scene to this day. ""He took me in his arms with the flowers, and told my mother that he had a daughter my age at home. He asked us where we came from and what he could do to help. When my mother said Switzerland, he laughed."" There were no open roads into neutral Switzerland, but he did help get them to Brussels.  As the rest of the queue looked on in envy, Eva and Anita got into a chauffeur-driven German Volkswagen and were taken to Brussels. After six weeks on the road they were finally reunited with Stanis. The Zusmans returned to their lives in Belgium, but as anti-Semitic laws intensified in Brussels, Anita was put on a Red Cross train to Switzerland, and was followed by her mother.  Stanis tried to join them but was caught and eventually murdered by the Nazis at Auschwitz in February 1943.  Nadia Ragozhina is a distant cousin of Eva Zusman and is working on a book on her family's past through the 20th Century. "
Spread to US Treasury,New Covid rescue scheme to pay up to half of wages,2024-09-25,2020-10-22,By Robert Plummer,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54644241,"The chancellor has unveiled increased support for jobs and workers hit by Covid restrictions after growing clamour from firms in tier two areas. Rishi Sunak announced big changes to the Job Support Scheme (JSS) - set to replace furlough in November. He told the Commons that even businesses not forced to shut were facing ""profound economic uncertainty"". Under the revised scheme, employers will pay less and staff can work fewer hours before they qualify. At the same time, the taxpayer subsidy has been doubled. At an afternoon news conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked the chancellor for introducing measures that ""will protect people's livelihoods"". But he warned that the UK would face ""many thousands more deaths"" if it put the economy before health. Businesses in tier two areas, particularly in the hospitality sector, had complained that they would be better off if they were under tier three restrictions.  They argued that although they would be forced to close, they would benefit from greater government support. One prominent chef, Yotam Ottolenghi, had said conditions for his restaurants were ""terrible"" since tier two restrictions were applied to London, adding: ""We are on our knees now."" In response to such arguments, Mr Sunak has now changed the terms of the JSS. Referring to those businesses, he said: ""It is clear that they require further economic support."" Instead of a minimum requirement of paying 55% of wages for a third of hours, as announced last month at the launch of the Winter Economic Plan, employers will have to pay for a minimum of 20% of usual hours worked, and 5% of hours not worked.  The government will now fund 62% of the wages for hours not worked. This more than doubles the maximum payment to £1,541.75 a month. In the most generous case, the taxpayer will now go from funding 22% of wages to just under half. The scheme will, as before, be open to all small businesses and larger businesses that can show an impact on revenues.  It is aimed at addressing the gap in support for businesses in tier two restrictions, such as London and Birmingham, but is not explicitly tied to that status, and is available across the UK. Noel Hutchinson, director of Poole-based powerboat experience firm Get Lost Sailing, is one small businessman who is feeling overlooked by the new measures. His firm is in a tier one area and so is not receiving any support, but he is seeing far fewer customers as a result of the virus. ""Whether or not businesses are in tier one, two or three, they are all being massively affected by the virus,"" he says. ""A hospitality and tourism business such as ours depends on out-of-town visitors and these people are no longer travelling. Our bookings have slowed massively."" Mr Hutchinson feels that a national lockdown would serve him better, since any government support would then be distributed across the country. ""It would be better for our industry if the whole country was locked down at once and every business in receipt of a fair proportion of the support packages."" The scheme is UK-wide. However, the system of tiered restrictions in England, which gave rise to the government's newly increased economic support, is not. While England has a three-tier system, Scotland is due to bring in a five-tier system of virus alert levels from 2 November. The middle three will be ""broadly equivalent"" to the English three, but the Scottish system will add an extra tier at the bottom and one at the top. Wales is about to enter a two-week national lockdown from 18:00 BST on Friday, while Northern Ireland began a four-week lockdown last Friday. All the devolved nations have been promised extra central government funding so they can award grants at a local level. Almost as soon as the heads of the CBI and the TUC appeared on the steps of Number 11 Downing Street to endorse last month's Winter Economic Plan, there were some doubts about its effectiveness.  Business and union leaders were happy that some support for part-time working had been announced - itself a revolution for the UK - but the levels of support fell well short of German-style schemes. In particular, employers faced a hurdle of having to pay at least half of workers' wages.  This was not a bug in the system - it was the strategy. The Treasury wanted the scheme to lean into a process of economic restructuring to a post-Covid ""new normal"" and not seek to prevent those changes. But all that was predicated on the pandemic being on the wane and the recovery assured. That has not proven to be the case, and indeed some had spotted that, even at the time of the original plan. This is an acknowledgement of gaps in that scheme and that large swathes of the economy are in survival, not restructure mode. For the chancellor, this is a sign that he will offer the right support at the right time. Others will say that the data was going in this direction a month ago, and that some jobs have unnecessarily been lost. Hospitality businesses gathered at a south London pizza restaurant also told the chancellor of their need for help with rents from landlords - something the Treasury thinks is far more tricky than, for example, mortgage holidays.  In Greater Manchester, they will wonder why this wasn't offered to areas that were under strong social restrictions earlier. But this is a significant package worth several billion pounds, recognising the economy clearly needs support now before some inevitable fundamental changes. ""I've always said that we must be ready to adapt our financial support as the situation evolves, and that is what we are doing today. These changes mean that our support will reach many more people and protect many more jobs,"" Mr Sunak said. ""I know that the introduction of further restrictions has left many people worried for themselves, their families and communities. I hope the government's stepped-up support can be part of the country pulling together in the coming months.""  Responding to his statement, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds criticised the government for what she said was a ""patchwork of poor ideas, rushed out at the last minute"". She said its approach to support for areas entering tier three had been ""nothing short of shambolic"". In other political reaction, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham tweeted that the new measures had not been ""put on the table"" during negotiations with the government this week that failed to agree a £65m package of support. ""Honestly, can barely believe what I'm reading here,"" he said. The chancellor also announced specific help for hospitality and leisure businesses in tier two areas.  English councils will be funded to give monthly grants of up to £2,100 to 150,000 hotels, restaurants and B&Bs. Devolved nations will be given the equivalent funding for other nations, under the Barnett Formula. The generosity of the self-employment scheme has also been doubled from 20% to 40% of profits, with a maximum grant now of £3,750 over a three-month period. Furlough and redundancy are cutting incomes - and millions of people's finances are not in a position to cope. Some 12 million people in UK have low financial resilience - meaning they find it hard to pay bills or make loan repayments, according to research by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. It found that those from a black and minority ethnic background have been more likely than most to be affected by Covid-related falls in income, with 37% of those surveyed taking a hit. Also, people aged between 25 and 34 were the most likely, by far, to have had a change in employment as a result of the pandemic. That has led thousands of people to take payment ""holidays"" - deferrals on household bills such as rent or energy bills. From 31 October, anyone who arranges a break on repayments of mortgages, loans and credit cards will see their credit record marked - potentially making it harder to borrow more from then on. Business leaders welcomed the changes, with the CBI employers' group calling it a ""big step towards a more standardised approach"". UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls described it as ""a hugely generous package of support and very welcome news just when we needed it"".  She said the changes to the scheme would ""help to safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs"" and give firms ""a much-enhanced chance of being able to overcome the challenges and survive into 2021"". Adam Marshall from the British Chambers of Commerce said it was a ""significant improvement"" for many struggling businesses. But he added: ""The true test of these reforms will be whether they help businesses on the ground get through the difficult months ahead."" Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation think tank, which works to improve the standard of living of low-paid workers, said Mr Sunak had done the right thing by expanding help for companies. ""Doing it earlier, given the obvious flaws, would have saved more jobs, but at least we've got to the right place 10 days ahead of the Job Support Scheme coming into effect,"" he said."
Spread to US Treasury,Things the US has got wrong - and got right,2024-09-25,2020-04-01,By Anthony Zurcher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52125039,"It has been more than two months since the first case of coronavirus was diagnosed in the US. Since then, the outbreak has spread across the nation, with more than 236,000 cases and over 5,600 deaths. The US is now the global epicentre of the pandemic, surpassing the number of reported cases in China, where the virus began, and Italy, the hardest-hit European nation. Although public health officials report that the peak of the outbreak in the US is still weeks, perhaps months, away, shortcomings in the US response - as well as some strengths - have already become apparent.  Here's a look at some of them. Masks, gloves, gowns and ventilators. Doctors and hospitals across the country, but particularly in areas hardest hit by the pandemic, are scrambling for items essential to help those stricken by the virus and protect medical professionals. The lack of adequate supplies has forced healthcare workers to reuse existing sanitary garb or create their own makeshift gear. A shortage of ventilators has state officials worried they will soon be forced into performing medical triage, deciding on the fly who receives the life-sustaining support - and who doesn't. On Tuesday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo complained that states, along with the federal government, were competing for equipment, driving up prices for everyone. ""It's like being on eBay with 50 other states, bidding on a ventilator,"" he said. It didn't have to be this way, says Jeffrey Levi, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University. The US government failed to adequately maintain the stockpile of supplies necessary to deal with a pandemic like this - and then moved too slowly when the nature of the current crisis became apparent. ""We lost many weeks in terms of ramping up the production capacity around personal protection equipment and never fully utilizing government authority to make sure that production took place,"" he says. According to Professor Levi, ramping up testing at an early date - as done in nations like South Korea and Singapore - is the key to controlling a viral outbreak like Covid-19. The inability of the US government to do so was the critical failure from which subsequent complications have cascaded. ""All of pandemic response is dependent on situational awareness - knowing what is going on and where it is happening,"" he says. Without this information, public health officials are essentially flying blind, not knowing where the next viral hotspot will flare up. Comprehensive testing means infected patients can be identified and isolated, limiting the need for the kind of sweeping state-wide shelter-in-place orders that have frozen the US economy and led to millions of unemployed workers. Levi says the responsibility for this failure lies squarely with the Trump administration, which disregarded pandemic response plans dating back more than a decade to the George W Bush presidency and failed to fully staff its public health bureaucracy. ""The political leadership in this administration really doesn't believe in government,"" Levi says. ""That has really hampered their willingness to harness the resources the federal government had to respond at a time like this."" The numbers, particularly on testing, bear this out. The initial tests sent in February to just a handful of US laboratories by the administration were faulty.  By mid-March, the administration was promising at least 5 million tests by the end of the month. An independent analysis of totals on 30 March, however, indicate only a million tests have been conducted. That's more than any other country but the US population is roughly 329 million people. What's more, because of crush of testing that has followed the initial shortages, the labs that analyse the results have been overwhelmed, leading to delays of a week or more before tested individuals can learn if they have the virus. At his press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Donald Trump offered a grim outlook for the nation. ""I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead,"" he said. His public health advisers followed that statement up with charts predicting at least 100,000 American deaths from the virus even under the current mitigating efforts. The president's comments stood in stark contrast to remarks even just a week earlier, when he expressed hope that the US could begin to reopen businesses by the mid-April Easter holiday. In January and February, as the viral outbreak devastated Chinese manufacturing and began exacting a high toll in Italy, the president repeatedly downplayed the threat to the US. Following the first few American cases, Trump and other administration officials said the situation was under control and would dissipate in the summer ""like a miracle"". Inconsistent messages from the top are a real problem, Professor Levi says. ""Pandemic preparedness is a constantly changing environment, and sometimes your message does change. In this case, however, you've also had whiplash around messages that are not necessarily reflecting a change in the science or what's happening on the ground, but instead reflecting political concerns."" The president has also feuded with Democratic state governors, criticising New York's Andrew Cuomo and belittling Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer on Twitter. He said state leaders needed to be ""appreciative"" of the federal government. College students on spring break from classes packed Florida beaches. New York City residents filled subway cars. A church in Louisiana continues to welcome thousands despite pastor Tony Spell being criminally cited for violating an order limiting the size of gatherings. ""The virus, we believe, is politically motivated,"" Spell told a local television station. ""We hold our religious rights dear, and we are going to assemble no matter what someone says."" Across the country, there have been numerous examples of Americans failing to heed the calls by public health professionals to avoid close social contact, sometimes abetted by local and state government officials who have been reluctant to order businesses to shutter and citizens to shelter in place. ""If I get corona, I get corona,"" one Florida beachgoer told CBS News in mid-March. ""At the end of the day, I'm not going to let it stop me from partying."" Even steps taken with the best of intentions might have had adverse consequences. Curtailing public-transportation services, such as New York's subway, may have led to trains and busses that were more crowded. Universities that sent students home to their families may have contributed to the spread of the virus by returning infected individuals to cities, neighborhoods and homes not yet in full lockdown. The lack of clarity in the president's order to halt entry into the US from Europe - which at first seemed to apply US citizens as well as foreign nationals - led to a crushing crowds at airports where unscreened infected passengers could easily transit the disease to others. Decisions like those may have had dire consequences, hampering efforts to contain the spread of the disease throughout the nation - the public health equivalent of throwing petrol on an already raging fire. Last week the US Congress passed a $2tn coronavirus relief bill, which included direct cash payments to many Americans, expanded unemployment assistance, aid to states, healthcare facilities and other public services, support for hardest-hit industries, and loans to small- and medium-sized businesses that can be forgiven if they avoid layoffs. It was a massive, record-breaking piece of legislation that was the result of negotiations involving Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress, as well as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and his deputies. ""This should be described as a survival bill, not a stimulus bill,"" says Columbia's Graetz, author of the book The Wolf at the Door: The Menace of Economic Insecurity and How to Fight It. ""Everybody has things they don't like or they wish for better, no one is going to be satisfied with it,"" he says, ""but I think it should get pretty high marks for a beginning."" Part of the challenge for lawmakers, Graetz says, is the current system of unemployment insurance for American workers is woefully outdated - a patchwork of state-run programmes with varying benefits and qualification requirements ill-suited for the modern economy. Congress attempted to address this in the coronavirus legislation by ensuring that freelance and gig-economy workers are covered and temporarily supplementing the existing benefits. ""It's going to be too little for a lot of people, but it was the only solution available,"" he says. ""Congress started this process with a very weak hand in terms of a solid system of social protections or safety nets that it could build on."" Both Trump and Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi have already talked about working on another aid bill, perhaps with infrastructure investment and additional healthcare benefits, suggesting this recent bipartisan co-operation is just a beginning. If the coronavirus is exposing some of the flaws in the US healthcare system - high costs, a lack of universal coverage and supply chains that are unable to withstand a shock - it also could end up highlighting the strength of the nation's research and drug development infrastructure. Pharmaceutical manufacturers and medical researchers are rushing to learn more about the virus in an attempt to devise new strategies to defeat the pandemic. One company has developed a new fast-response test that can identify those carrying the virus almost immediately, ending the current testing backlog and allowing public health officials to quickly identify new outbreak hotspots and make quarantining decisions.  ""The long-term prospects around vaccine and therapeutic development is more encouraging,"" Levi says. ""The science is getting done."" He adds that pharmaceutical companies that are researching treatments and cures are receiving assurances from the government that there will be a market for their products and they will be adequately compensated for their investments. The problem, he says, is that the efforts made today will take months - or longer - before they show results. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, predicted that it would be at least a year before a widespread vaccine is available. The goal of public health policy for now is to limit the toll the virus takes on the population until that day arrives. The US federal system of government, which delegates broad powers to individual states, has proven to be both a blessing and a curse. In good times, it allows local leaders to experiment individually with various public policy solutions, testing out best practices that can then be adopted across the nation. In the case of a deadly pandemic, however, a patchwork response can be inadequate - and result in avoidable deaths and economic disruption. ""Every governor is making decisions on their own,"" Levi says. ""Some are making good decisions; some are not."" He points to governors like Gavin Newsom of California and Jay Inslee of Washington, who took early steps to close schools and issue shelter-in-place orders that have resulted in a slower spread of the virus in their populations. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has also received praise from many quarters for his decisive early moves that at the time were viewed by some as too drastic. Health officials say most major US metropolitan areas were going to be hit has hard as New York City has been. That, they said, may not end up being the case. Some states are working hard to avoid suffering New York's fate, but Levi warns that their efforts may be hampered by other locations not doing nearly enough. ""The problem we have in the US,"" he says, "" is the capacity to respond varies so dramatically on a state-by-state basis because of the willingness to invest in public health."" ""We are only as protected as the weakest states."""
Spread to US Treasury,The Tortoise and the Share,2024-09-25,2018-03-02,By Amol Rajan,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43230640,"I had the privilege of delivering this year's Bob Friend Lecture at the University of Kent at Canterbury. Bob was part of the original Sky News line up, described by Rupert Murdoch as a ""distinctive journalist and admired news broadcaster"".   I'm sorry to say I never met him, though of course I know a great deal about his reputation. I believe very strongly that we have obligations to the dead, not only to respect their memory and honour their contribution to our world, but also - if we can - to continue to learn from them, and to continue the good deeds and works that, were they still with us, they would be performing. That's one of my themes here. I believe in journalism, as Bob Friend did, and in honouring his memory by discussing this subject in front of a room full of potentially great journalists, I hope I can support the principle that journalism is a noble trade, maybe inspire a few to go into it, and above all prosecute an argument about the nature and future of journalism that I think deserves a hearing. Just before I outline that argument, let me say, a helluva lot of lectures about the future of journalism are given these days. Aside from this annual event, big recent lectures have been given by newspaper editors from Lionel Barber to Alan Rusbridger. There's the annual MacTaggart Lecture in Edinburgh, and the Cudlipp Lecture which James Harding is giving in March. My distinguished colleague Nick Robinson gave the inaugural Steve Hewlett Lecture last year. The challenge, then, is to be at least mildly original. So I'm going to take some of those people and some of their arguments on. In fact, my enemy today is conventional wisdom, or rather conventional wisdoms - specifically, the claim that new technology provides an existential threat to the news business. Doubtless it offers a threat; I just don't believe it's an existential one.  And I'm going to argue that some of the claims made by journalists about the threats to the news business - for instance, the whole idea of fake news - are in fact not only often gross errors of judgement, but a kind of displacement activity, an attempt to distract audiences from the true problems afflicting the trade, which lie closer to home. British journalists have been very good at blaming everyone but themselves. As Michael Jackson sang, in lyrics you guys are doubtless familiar with from Freshers Week, ""no message could have been any clearer: if you want to make the world a better place, take a look at yourself and make that change."" I'll then move on to what I think are indeed the biggest threats to my trade and some proposed solutions. Let me start, then, by attacking three myths about the current state, not to say plight, of journalism. My joining the BBC as the Corporation's first Media Editor in late 2016 coincided very closely with the election of Donald Trump and, with it, a sudden explosion in concerns about fake news. This was a case of correlation rather than causation, I can assure you.  Due to his relentless and ferocious attacks on the mainstream media, his courting of alternative forms of media - including his embrace of conspiracy theorists - and his elastic relationship with the truth, Trump very quickly became seen in much of the media as a terrifying foe.  This fear was radically accentuated when Sean Spicer, the entertaining former Press Secretary to Trump, launched what I call the Spicer Doctrine: the belief that it was the job of government to hold journalists to account.  In a White House press conference early in Trump's presidency, Spicer said: ""There's been a lot of talk in the media about the responsibility to hold Donald Trump accountable. And I'm here to tell you it goes two ways. We're going to hold the press accountable as well"". This inversion of the traditional relationship between journalism and government - in which it apparently becomes the task of those in power to scrutinise the scrutinisers - was added to the list of points made by those who said Trump was a mortal threat to journalism. It's important to note this idea became, for a brief flicker of history, something like a prevailing orthodoxy. When Trump tweeted a video of him seeming to wrestle a CNN reporter to the ground, not long after insulting that organisation in a very public manner, it became widely accepted that journalists were - literally - under attack as never before in the history of the modern West.  The Committee to Protect Journalists warned of ""a threat to press freedom"". Chris Wallace of Fox News said the President had ""engaged in the most direct, sustained assault on the free press in our history."" Joe Kahn of the New York Times bewailed ""an American President and his close allies who treat reporters as 'enemies of the people' - with no attribution to Stalin or Mao"". Yet these arguments were, on closer inspection, the exact opposite of the truth. Donald Trump isn't the enemy of the media. He's a potential saviour of the media.  It's largely thanks to Donald Trump that record numbers of people in the English-speaking world are viewing, listening to, or reading the news. And, crucially, that record numbers are paying for it. All media - left, right, mainstream, alternative, digital, print - have benefited from a Trump bump.  In the three weeks after his election, the New York Times sold 132,000 digital subscriptions - a tenfold increase on the usual rate. They have been engaged in a truly wonderful, almost nostalgic newspaper war with The Washington Post, whose business model is also humming thanks to Trump, where the two papers are vying to out-scoop each other with a series of brilliant stories. It's been riveting - and readers are the winners. Just this month, in fact, the New York Times announced an extra 157,000 digital subscribers for the fourth quarter of last year, with subscription revenues passing $1bn for the first time. Obviously that was the result of a team effort; but if, at a push, you had to give credit to one person for this exponential expansion, it wouldn't be Dean Baquet, the Executive Editor. It would be Donald J Trump.  As for television, virtually every American news network is up on its ratings, from Fox to MSNBC and of course CNN, which had its most watched year ever in 2016. Why? Two words. Donald Trump. And ad-funded, traffic hungry websites from Buzzfeed to Mail Online to The Independent have found nothing drives traffic like this President. He is - as he often boasts himself - good business.  And for obvious reasons. The Trump Presidency is not only one of the most astonishing facts of modern history, it is also one of the most astonishing stories of modern history - a gift that keeps on giving, and giving. And giving.  Also in February, Twitter, which is essentially just a news stream, posted a profit for the first time. There are complex and structural reasons for this of course, but I know from speaking to them that senior executives at Twitter are delighted, to put it mildly, that this President spends his twilight hours on the platform. Every news organisation in the world has been boosted editorially by his remarkable ascent, and unless they are run by idiots, each of those organisations has found this presidency to be a commercial boon too. Next time you hear the idea of Trump's ""war with the media"", remember, then,  that you're hearing a self-serving phrase which is essentially nonsense.  This isn't a war. It's a marriage of convenience. Closely associated with the ascent of Trump is the phenomenon of fake news. Of course, when Trump uses that term, he's just referring to news that he doesn't like. The Russia investigation is fake news, the fake news media can't be trusted, and so on. There is, however, a genuine and relatively new phenomenon which warrants the label fake news - and that is deliberate lies told for political or commercial purposes transmitted around the world through social media.  This material should be distinguished from the false news - that is, lies and propaganda - that has been circulating in media for years, for instance through the vile practices of the late sexual predator Max Clifford. Britain's tabloid press, for instance, has knowingly been publishing lies for decades, also for commercial gain. Freddie Starr never ate the hamster, as Clifford claimed. For those of you too young or innocent to get that reference, it refers to a famous newspaper front page headline. For those of you too young or innocent to know what a newspaper front page is, I give up.  The recent phenomenon of fake news is different to the ancient phenomenon of false news through its deployment of digital technology. This technology incentivises massive audiences: the bigger the audience, the more money can be received from selling ads around those fake news stories. And that's the in-glorious issue with fake news: because it's made up, it's sensational; and because it's sensational, people want to share it. Compared to fake news, the truth is boring. It would have been amazing if the Pope or Denzel Washington had backed Trump. Somewhat boringly, they didn't. But here's the thing about fake news. Whisper it, but it's not actually that widespread a phenomenon.  Yes, foreign actors used bots - those automated bits of software that feign human characteristics - to sow discord and disinformation. But in terms of what we know, fake accounts are a tiny, tiny fraction of the total amount of information available online. For instance, Facebook has said that it thinks the number of fake accounts on its platform are around 3 per cent of the total, and the number of duplicate accounts could be around 10 per cent. Depending on how many fake accounts are duplicated, that could add up to a very sizeable number. But as a proportion of the overall total, it is, while significant, far from overwhelming - and the company and its community are getting better at discovering and eliminating such accounts.  What we know about fake news is that it spikes dramatically around big news events. In a tight election, the use of bots to amplify some messages, or sow confusion, could certainly make a difference. And Trump's election and the Brexit referendum were tight elections. But as of yet, we do not have anything approaching conclusive evidence that these democratic events were tipped by fake news. So, seen in its proper context, fake news is nothing new - though the capacity for disinformation and lies to reach hundreds of millions of people is, I accept, a recent and worrying development. Similarly, we still know very little about the true extent of fake news; what we do know suggests it is a small proportion of the total information on the biggest social media platforms, and that it spikes around irregular events. Nobody has suggested the Pope backed Trump for a while. But the principal reason to be sceptical - though not dismissive - about fake news is that so many of those who bang on about it have an incentive to inflate the threat. For ambitious politicians, it creates a chance to show themselves to be digitally savvy, and deeply concerned about the rise of new technology. For top ranking politicians, fake news and disinformation online can offer an excuse to cover their own failings. I had the privilege last year of interviewing Hillary Clinton on The One Show on BBC One. She was noble and honest enough to say that blame for her loss to Trump lay principally with her - but it was clear from talking to her, and will be clear to anyone who reads the book, that she puts a lot of weight on the claim that fake news was a key factor in his victory. It wasn't. It may have had an influence on some voters, but it wasn't Facebook wot won it for the President. I sometimes get the impression that even technology companies don't mind talking about fake news, because it gives them the opportunity to flaunt their social consciences, and even distract from other social obligations, such as paying tax. But the people who most relentlessly bang on about fake news are also the people who have the biggest incentive to show they can be trusted. And that is - though I hate the phrase, implying as it does mediocrity - the often loathed mainstream media of which I am part. Obviously if you work for the BBC, or The Times, or Channel 4 News, or CNN, when you give coverage to fake news, you hope the audience will see that you are different and that you will be flattered by comparison. If some news is fake, then presumably some isn't, and we the aforementioned great media brands deal in Truth... that's their message. Let me repeat that there is a new threat from the viral spread of disinformation online. But its effects are still unclear; false news is far from new; what we do know about fake news suggest that it is limited and spikes around big news events; and the key point is that most of those who talk about fake news have a very great incentive in inflating the threat. The third myth that I want to debunk is the notion that people won't pay for news online. I accept completely that most people under the age of 30 have grown up in a news environment where they expect, and are given, high-quality news for free. I also accept that a very major reason for this in Britain is the existence of the BBC website. But what I don't accept is that when these people grow up - when you guys grow up - and come to have a bit of money, and maybe realise you need to be well informed to get by, you won't pay for news. Because the fast accumulating evidence points in one direction: if it's good enough, people will pay for content.  It's worth saying that around a decade ago, it was absolutely the prevailing view that content online had to be free. The Guardian was perhaps the most militant proponent of this view. Its then Editor, Alan Rusbridger, championed 'open' journalism, using that most loaded term to imply that when people charged for content, they were part of a 'closed' system, rather than just trying to run viable businesses.  When Rupert Murdoch said he was going to ask people to pay for content, many said he was mad. His argument was: quality costs; if you want quality, you have to pay for it; if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys; and that readers would pay for journalism if it was good enough.  I'm here to tell you that Rupert was right, and those who championed the free model were wrong. Now, thank goodness, people are coming together in their millions to restore the link between top calibre journalism, and paying for that.  I mentioned the New York Times' recent, excellent numbers. Perhaps many of you in this room have a subscription to Spotify. Or to Netflix, which has built a committed audience of over 100 million subscribers in just a few years - mostly, by the way, by using other people's content. Public support for the licence fee of the BBC remains high for now. And look elsewhere, too: the Financial Times is approaching a million subscribers. And if you include digital subscribers, The Times recently overtook The Daily Telegraph.  This brings us to a key point. People will pay - but they will obviously only pay if they place a high value on the journalism - i.e. if it's good enough to justify parting with cash. I used to think that the only way to encourage payment was to specialise; indeed, there was a strong case for believing, a few years ago, that the future of journalism is specialism. Specialism - being a magazine dedicated to fishing, or a website dedicated to the hedge fund industry, or a fortnightly satirical magazine like Private Eye, for example - allows you to focus your editorial energies in one domain, target a particular industry, chase advertisers with a unique focus, and distinguish yourself from the great rump of journalism now available online. But it turns out people are now willing to pay not just for specialism, but for general news too, if it's good enough - for instance, that of The Times. When the facts change, I change my mind. So I've updated my view. Now I think the future of journalism isn't just specialism; it's also generalism, or general news, that has special qualities, and obtains unique standards. This brings me neatly to the question of the economics of the industry, and the first of the three major areas of concern for my trade that I would like, with your permission, to briefly discuss. So far I have addressed what I believe to be three myths about journalism - that Donald Trump is a mortal threat, that fake news is consuming the whole ecosystem in which we live, and that people won't pay for news online. If these are the mythical threats, what are the real ones? I want to split them into three categories: economic, sociological and editorial.  I hope I have demonstrated that there is now clear evidence that people will pay for news, both specialist and general, provided it is good enough. Over the past decade, a toxic combination of scepticism toward this view, groupthink and sheer myopia has prompted many organisations to conclude that, if revenues directly from the audience couldn't be relied on, then it would have to come from advertising. It's extremely important that people in this room realise that there is nothing original about the dependence of news media on advertising for a majority of revenues. As recently as the 1990s, which I'm conscious is when many of you were born, august titles such as the Financial Times got some 80 per cent of income from classified and display advertising, with only 20 per cent coming from cover price revenue. It's no wonder, then, that the people running news organisations today, many of whom were just beginning their careers back then, thought it reasonable to rely on digital advertising for income. But relying on advertising online is almost always a disastrous strategy.  There are two main reasons for this. The first is that it necessarily distorts your editorial values. If you give away your content for free, you become desperate for traffic; and the way to generate traffic is to go relentlessly down-market. This temptation has proved too much for many titles. The Independent, which was in print a high-minded title, today has a very different flavour, on social media at least. That might, by the way, be why it's very much profitable. Other websites from BuzzFeed to Mail Online do some very fine journalism; but it is often paid for by clickbait and trash. I know too well how chasing clicks, not least through tweaking SEO, distorts editorial priorities. At the end of my first week on The Independent website, I once had just one article left to publish. I was desperately short of numbers on the traffic front, and it would have spoilt my weekend if I didn't hit my target. Alas the only piece I had left to publish was by Andreas Whittam Smith, the founding Editor of the paper. He was a great journalist but not a big mover of traffic, and this piece was about the need for greater transparency in the House of Lords and civil service - not the sort of salacious, traffic-generating subject you'd see in the Mail's Sidebar of Shame. Desperate for traffic, I looked at what was at the top of Google News. I saw that One Direction had just released an album in Canada. So I put a headline on Andreas's piece that said: 'All the evidence points in one direction: we need reform of our institutions now'.  It was the most read piece on independent.co.uk that month. I love the idea of all these teenage girls in Canada looking up the latest song by Harry Styles and Zayn Malik, and instead coming across an essay by the founder of The Independent on restructuring the Treasury... Suffice to say, tweaking headlines in this fashion ain't what I went into journalism to do. The second reason not to rely on advertising, is that in practice it means relying on the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, and when it comes to publishers generating traffic via Facebook, it turns out he is a fickle friend. In January, he announced huge changes to Facebook that would prioritise ""meaningful interactions"" - i.e. stuff from friends and family - over information from news publishers. Already this has had a dramatic impact on the traffic, and therefore the bottom line, of many publishers.  In recent months BuzzFeed, Mashable, and Mic, three websites dependent on viral energy for their business models, have either announced layoffs or surprisingly low valuations. All commercial models are dependent, obviously, on external forces and market conditions. That does not mean it is ok or smart to fund journalism by relying on the algorithms that Zuckerberg and his team tweak on a daily basis. On the contrary, it is much safer to ask readers to pay. If you can get them to do so, you make them - and not the advertisers - your most important customer. You can collect commercially valuable data about them too. Above all, you are liberated from the vicissitudes of the social media world, whose constant upheaval will never provide as sturdy a basis for top quality work as money direct from your audience.  Media organisations have always been funded by a combination of audience revenue and advertising. The evidence is abundantly clear and growing: in the digital age, you cannot rely on the latter. Not only are Facebook and Google gobbling up ever more digital ad revenue; they are also liable to change on a whim. Luckily, however, the evidence is also abundantly clear and growing that - if you provide a service that is good enough and unique enough - readers will pay for digital output.  This of course means that some platforms will die out. The future for local newspapers is unrelentingly grim. Many television channels will become irrelevant or redundant as streaming takes over. The whole process is Darwinian. But that could prompt a new generation of hacks to produce ever greater work - and take pride, rather than feel guilt, in asking the audience to fund it.  Ah yes, the new generation. In a moment, I am going to examine some of the editorial failings of the news industry. But before I look at why so many journalists have missed the big stories in recent years, I want to focus on one particular cause of those editorial failings in detail - and that is the composition of the news industry itself.   Much of what I am arguing tonight is, I hope, an antidote to the feeling of crisis that has been the background noise of my own journalistic career. I think for reasons you've just heard there are plenty of reasons to be hopeful, and some of the supposed threats are mere phantoms. But I do think there is one reason to panic, one existential threat, one crisis that is engulfing the trade.  That is the astonishing - and growing - disconnect between journalism and the lives of poor people around Britain. Journalism today feels more like the preserve of the moneyed and metropolitan middle-classes than ever before. I think the problem has got markedly worse in my time in the business. And I think we need very urgent remedies.  As I wrote on my BBC blog in December, the most shocking thing I discovered in my first year in broadcasting is the absence of poor people. There are many reasons for this, plenty of them manifested at the societal level. Indeed the capture of journalism by the relatively wealthy is a symptom of much deeper ills in our society. My own view is that the most neglected reason for it is that the poor have no lobby in broadcasting.  Other disenfranchised groups have highly effective and energised lobbying operations. Those campaigning for greater gender equality and equal pay at the BBC, for instance, have sought and received an audience with the Director-General. Champions of ethnic minority representation include Lenny Henry and Simon Albury, the former boss of the Royal Television Society. As for regional devolution, the voice of MPs and local politicians from around the country has been heard loud and clear in, for instance, the BBC's expansion into Salford, or the calls for Channel 4 to move out of London.  But the poor have no lobby in broadcasting. One reason for this is that they are hard to define. The greatest sociologists in Britain struggle to define class, knowing there's more to it than economic capital, and that the rapid changes in the nature of work and wages means old language about the working-class are no longer valid. You can define being poor or working-class through current circumstances, or family, or to some extent even geography. Another reasons the poor have no lobby is that, being an amorphous group, they are hard to see. If I look at any newsroom in Britain, I can immediately tell you how many people are from an ethnic minority, what the gender split is, and how young or old the place is. What I can't tell you is how many people have a dad who worked in the mines, or a mum who didn't finish school, or grew up in a council state, or were on free school meals at a school where less than half of pupils went on to university. These two related problems - a lack of easy definition, and categorical invisibility - should not, however, be an excuse to ignore the disconnect between journalism and the people it should serve. Lest there be any confusion, let me be clear, I'm not pretending to be some sort of proletarian hero myself here: I live in Islington, went to a good state school, and my parents were immigrants who simply wouldn't let their sons be wasters. I know what it's like to be skint, believe me, but I'm not any more.  My concern is that the crisis of trust in newspapers is directly related to the fact that most people don't feel journalists look, sound, think, or feel like them in the way they used to. The gradual decline of Britain's tabloid newspapers accentuates this. Of course the tabloids have done some awful things, and coarsened our culture; but in their heyday they were tribunes of the poor. The Mirror of my hero, Hugh Cudlipp, carried a slogan below its masthead: ""Forward with the People"". I just can't think of many British media organisations that espouse that philosophy now. Similarly, local papers made journalism a reasonably remunerated trade for those from poorer backgrounds around the country. But no more, for the most part. When the Grenfell Tower horror unfolded, there was huge anger among residents about the media coverage. And yes, there were conspiracy theories floating around. I reported from the foot of Grenfell, which even now stands as a sickening, ashen monument to human suffering and political and social failure. I have to say that when residents said to me, again and again and again, that the media don't speak for them, precisely because they don't relate to them, and because they don't cover their lives until it's too late and the pictures make good telly, well, I think they weren't completely wrong.  There is a crisis of trust in the news industry, and with it a crisis of relevance, and until the sociological make-up of the industry changes to reflect the people we serve, journalism will stagger from failure to failure. This is most urgent, and most existential, at the BBC, where staff are twice as likely to be privately educated as the rest of the population.  This failure of representation is, I think, the main reason that, taken as a whole, journalists have missed many, if not all, of the big stories of the past decade.  I hope that in what I have done so far I have made clear that, it seems to me, journalists have a tendency to blame everyone but themselves. It's President Trump's fault, because he's launched an assault on CNN. It's other politicians' fault, because they won't come on our shows any more, knowing they can use social media to circumvent pesky journalistic questioning. It's other legislators' fault, for suggesting new regulation that would cripple a centuries-old commitment to press freedom. It's Mark Zuckerberg and the tech giants' fault, because they're taking all our advertising dollars and now not even referring people to our websites.  And best of all, it's the audiences' fault! They're not paying for quality any more, and they're too distracted by better offers from elsewhere, like watching sport or eating ice creams or raising families.  Well, to this litany of cowardice, this catalogue of doom, this pathetic poltroonery, I say quite simply: enough is enough.  Stop blaming everyone else for the failures of modern journalism, and take a look in the mirror. Because the evidence suggests that the greatest enemy facing this noble trade is closer to home. The renaissance and renewal in modern journalism that we should all desperately want will only happen when journalists confront, and vanquish, the enemy within. The fact is, with very few exceptions, the vast majority of journalists have missed most of the big stories of the past decade. Of course, I must include myself in this. We didn't see the financial crash coming. We were taken aback by the 2010 result and the formation of a Coalition. We didn't see the nationalist surge in the Scottish referendum, the 2015 Conservative majority, the Corbyn surge in 2017 - or, perhaps most remarkably, the actual possibility of Brexit. (Though the BBC did give due weight to the possibility of a victory for Leave). And of course, like many American journalists, we were shocked by the election of Trump. In terms of my own scorecard, I did better on Brexit and Trump, but I still got the majority wrong.  As I say, there are exceptions to all these cases, but taken as a whole, the profession of British journalism was caught unawares by every single one of these seismic events. To miss one huge story would be, perhaps forgivable - two less so; but all of these, in the space of a few short years? I am, as I say, hugely culpable myself: as Editor of The Independent, I looked at the 2015 election too much through the prism of a hung parliament that every poll suggested likely, but which didn't accord with the result.  So I don't for a minute absolve myself from blame for this. But we have to look at what is going on here, and why. Given most of the events I've just referred to are political, and to give some focus to my argument, I'm going to suggest where political journalism may have been led astray. Without wanting to make this section of my lecture feel like a stroll through Caveat City, I should say again that when I criticise political coverage, I am including myself among the guilty men and women; and, moreover, there are some truly outstanding political journalists in Britain, many of them my colleagues at the BBC. Why might it be that political journalism has been caught so unawares by all these stories? One reason, undoubtedly, is the utter tyranny of opinion polls. I cannot emphasise enough to you the extent to which, through the 2010 and 2015 election, the news agenda was hijacked - utterly hijacked - by opinion polls. All my conversation with senior politicians and leading political journalists started from a premise set by the opinion polls. And this despite the fact that the opinion polls have been caught with their pants down time and time and time again.  I'd really encourage you to search on YouTube for ""Christopher Hitchens opinion poll racket"". There, my hero, the late, great polemicist can be seen more than 25 years ago discussing a cover piece he wrote for Harper's magazine with the headline 'Voting in the Passive Voice: What Polling has done to American Democracy'. That, he says, is about ""how the opinion poll racket"" has tried to be a substitute for democracy"" - and how lazy journalists use opinion polls - many of them rigged, by the way - to generate news, instead of going out and finding real news. Opinion polls are a snapshot rather than a forecast, but they give journalists the chance to inject drama and narrative in the often remorseless drift of political life. Broadly speaking, I think political journalism in this country is in danger of being too much Westminster, and not enough Whitehall. That is, it's so caught up in the fast sport of party politics, the slow business of government struggles to get a hearing. At the Independent, I gave Oliver Wright, our brilliant Whitehall Editor, an Inside Whitehall column for this very reason. There are many journalists who cover policy and government superbly, of course. I think Chris Cook of Newsnight is outstanding.  Then there is the revolving door between journalism and politics. I don't by this mean the great many journalists of all persuasions, including BBC staff, who end up in politics. I mean the tendency of senior political journalists to cross the rubicon, to become special advisers or Directors of Communication. You can of course understand why this should happen; they have the requisite skill and contacts, and I for one do understand the frustration, as a journalist, of feeling like at times you're stuck outside throwing rocks in, rather than in the room, making the decisions. But this revolving door just can't help but create the sort of clientism that substitutes propaganda for proper scrutiny.  All pack journalism is inherently dangerous. I'm told by some senior political journalists that the fabled lobby, the pack of Westminster journalists, doesn't exist any more, though I keep seeing evidence to the contrary. Pack journalism encourages groupthink, and strikes me as belonging to the age before social media. In the Palace of Westminster it is particularly hard not to be captured by various factions within politics, or to go along with what other journalists in the pack - the lobby - have determined to be the news. This means it takes real guts to strike out on your own and say, ""hang on: everyone seems to be doing this story, but I don't think it actually amounts to much - and the real story is elsewhere"". The demands of rapacious social media, combined with the groupthink inherent in all pack journalism, makes covering politics highly prone to what, in my view, are errors of judgement. Let me re-iterate that I'm not talking about specific individuals here, but give you a couple of examples.  First, Moggmentum. I'm sure you all know who Jacob Rees-Mogg is. Last year, especially through what has become known as silly season, there was a burgeoning industry in speculation over whether this idiosyncratic and intelligent backbencher was a future leadership contender for the Tories. I read article after article after article about how he was the grassroots' favourite, and various Tories were coming together to plot his takeover, lest Theresa May fall.  But who does such speculation benefit, other than Jacob Rees-Mogg? And is there actually any substance to the story? It is of course one of those self-perpetuating things. Once the story starts to gather, if you excuse the pun, momentum, it does have the effect of inflating Rees-Mogg's reputation, and making him seem more plausible. But do ordinary members of the public really care about personalities in politics as much as journalists do? Runners and riders stories always seem to reflect the interest of hacks and pundits rather than audiences at home.  Or take an example from America. The mad boosterism around Oprah Winfrey is their version of the same thing. After her speech at the Golden Globes there was an explosion of chat online about whether she might run for President. Does that mean it should be covered as news? Hell no! But did CNN cover it as news? Hell yes! One of their reports carried the headline: ""Sources: Oprah Winfrey 'actively thinking' about running for president"". Where to begin with this? I spend weekday evenings 'actively thinking' about becoming a reggae producer, or eating Nutella straight from the jar. That doesn't mean it's going to happen. The fact that this speculation was coming nearly a year before the mid-terms of Trump's first term was no barrier to the idle speculation. And if you actually read the story, it contained sentences such as: ""One source emphasised that Winfrey has not made up her mind about running""... and ""For now, it's all just talk"". Er, you don't say.  But the pièce de résistance came out last July. I was on a stag do in the south of France, munching brie and drinking rum sharpeners next to a swimming pool. Suddenly my phone exploded with alerts from news organisations that I follow, including the Telegraph. And what was this remarkable news story? It was Theresa May saying that she would carry on until 2022. As the Telegraph story put it, the Prime Minister's spokesman said she's no quitter and wouldn't be standing down after Brexit happens in March 2019. A follow-up story, by the way, said that Jacob Rees-Mogg had offered the Prime Minister his support.  I have to say, even now I struggle to contain my anger at this alleged news story. First of all, it's a ridiculous question, because how on earth can she possibly know what the situation is going to be in 2022. I barely know what's going to happen next week, let alone next year. What with all the fluctuations in History between last summer and 2022, four and a half years, the idea that Theresa May can accurately predict her own state of mind is ludicrous. The next thing is, what's she supposed to say? If the Prime Minister, or indeed her spokesman, had said, no, she won't be staying on until 2022 because it's generally felt that she's lost the confidence of her party already, that would have been a much bigger story. So here's some advice for young journalists: if you ask a question to which an honest answer is impossible, don't treat the less than honest answer as a great revelation. And finally, there's the simple fact that we just don't seem to learn from history. Through the Brexit campaign, David Cameron said that if Brexit happened, he would stay on as Prime Minister. He did that because he knew that if he said he would step down, it would change the narrative of the referendum and, quite understandably, journalists would run with a different story - just as they did when he said, going into the 2015 election, that it would be his last as Prime Minister. So during Brexit he said he would carry on. After Brexit, he left. That should have taught us that you can't always believe Prime Ministers when they answer this question. And yet still my stag do was interrupted by the frenetic excitement among journalists who thought they'd landed a big story. All this speaks to a deep problem within journalism, which is the editorial judgements and interests of those who cover certain professions are often terrible. Amid the endless brilliant coverage, they often miss the real story. Not because they're stupid, but for reasons I have suggested: they subscribe to a pack mentality; they have a - quite reasonable - impulse toward drama and narrative and conflict; their interests do not reflect those of most of the public; they're part of a revolving door between journalism and the professions they cover - whether in politics, education, health or wherever - driven in part by the explosive growth in the PR industry. But there is one reason why all of these tendencies are getting worse. And as I turn now to my concluding remarks, in which I shall propose some solutions to the problems I have outlined, I want to suggest that the defining qualities of modern journalism points to a way out of the difficulty the trade has found in.  The defining qualities of modern journalism are its scale, its sociability and its speed. And that is why I want to finish by re-introducing you to the parable of the Tortoise and the Share.  Forgive my indulgence for a minute, but it's worth saying that I really believe in the power of parable, and as journalists I think we all should. Another hero of mine, with whom I often disagree, was Isaiah Berlin. He wrote a notorious essay called The Hedgehog and the Fox, about the two kinds of intellectual. Hedgehogs knew mostly about just one thing, and saw the world through that prism. Foxes knew about plenty of things, and drew on multiple sources and schools of thought. Though Berlin later said that he was being mildly ironic, people always asked him if he was a hedgehog or a fox. The truth is, he was a hedgehog about being a fox: his one big idea was that there was no one big idea. Similarly I'm sure many of you know the story of the Hare and the Tortoise, or the Tortoise and the Hare. This fable by Aesop has many interpretations, few of them as simple as commonly thought. But there is one key lesson, summarised to generations of children as ""slow and steady wins the race"". I think modern journalism should be less hare, and more tortoise.  We are living through - and you guys are inheriting - the Great Acceleration: a period in History in which, thanks to technology, everything is speeding up. Journalism hasn't escaped this revolution; in fact, it has both reflected and contributed to it. But I think the paradox and predicament of our trade is that, as the world speeds up, journalism needs to slow down.  I still haven't seen the recent film about The Washington Post, called simply The Post. I wonder if any of you have seen All the Presidents Men, about Watergate; or Spotlight, about the work of the Boston Globe; or Attacking the Devil, about the thalidomide scandal that Harry Evans and The Sunday Times so brilliantly exposed. All of these films obviously ooze an irresistible nostalgia, and having grown up on, and in, newspapers, I enjoyed them. But something about watching them as a newspaper Editor, as I then was, hurt me too. That was the realisation that while I was scrambling relentlessly to get a newspaper out, juggling several full-time jobs, and trying to manage a digital turnaround, the people doing the journalism I revered had one fundamental resource that I didn't. Time. Did you know that the thalidomide scandal exposed by The Sunday Times, one of the signature newspaper investigations in the English language of the 20th Century, unfolded over a decade? All of the great investigations in journalistic history have taken time to land. Even more recently, The Times' brilliant work on alleged sexual harassment at Oxfam emerged from a 10-month courtship of an anxious source by Chief Reporter Sean O'Neill.  And yet the advent of 24-hr news and the internet - both of them, by the way, exceptionally recent phenomena when you consider the grand sweep of journalistic history - has created an impulse toward relentless, breathless stories; towards roiling oceans of information in which, inevitably, poor judgements are made. And all of this is exacerbated and intensified by the social media driven, dopamine-fuelled desire to make stuff go viral.  There is nothing wrong with going viral; on the contrary, it's an admirable achievement, provided it's done in the right way, for the right reasons. Another hero of mine, George Orwell, wrote in his seminal essay Why I Write, ""My initial concern is to get a hearing"". All journalists want to be read, and that's completely reasonable. But the danger is that the pursuit of virality - in other words, clickbait - distorts our editorial values, making us prize being read widely above getting the story right. That's why I contrast the tortoise - who was slow and steady, and had a clear sense of his goal - not just with the hare, whose slapdash and speedy approach was his undoing, but with the 'share', because I fear the speed of social media, which allows journalists to reach vast audiences in seconds, is corroding the soul of journalism.  Without a recrudescence in the ancient virtues of journalism, digital technology, which ought to elevate us, will enervate instead.  Obviously, I am not trying to militate against the journalistic impulse to get a story first, or to be on the scene of a crime or major event before your rivals. Breaking stories and scoops is our lifeblood. We should always want to be first, so long as we're right, and the impulse to get fresh top lines on a story, and so push it on, is a noble one. But for many journalists, being liberated from the need to cover every story as it breaks will free up more time to focus on the stories that most matter.  Clearly, specialist publications such as Private Eye have the huge advantage in being fortnightly, and not covering breaking news. But that doesn't stop them breaking news stories. Together with a unique wit, it's the quality of the journalism that has driven the magazine to record circulation.  Or take The Times. I really think one of the most neglected innovations of recent years was the decision by that publication to move to four editions a day. As Emma Tucker, the Deputy Editor, told me on Radio 4's The Media Show last week, that has freed up tremendous resources to focus on big stories, because they recognise that they just can't compete when it comes to breaking news 24/7.  On which point, by the way, I'm not getting paid for this lecture, obviously - but if there were one favour I were to humbly ask of all of you, it's that you immediately subscribe to The Media Show podcast - and, if you don't think I'm a waste of space, or in fact even if you do, you rate and review it. Just search online for The Media Show podcast, and click on subscribe. Ladies and gentleman, so far I have given you description aplenty. Let me finish on a positive note by giving you prescription instead. I started by saying I would finish with some solutions for the undoubted difficulty journalism faces. Let me cluster them according to the three areas of concern: editorial, demographic, and economic - in reverse order. Editorially, British journalism has historically got a huge amount right, and continues to even today. But I think four simple steps worth taking immediately are: 1/ First, a radical shift to context, to the underlying trends and complex ideas behind the news. This is more likely to take place in what you might call the broadsheet end of the market, I'll grant. So be it. I think deep analysis of why events are happening should be considered as worthwhile as descriptions of what is happening. Pockets of British journalism are doing this of course. I want to see a mentality in which Editors say, what are the 5 or 6 huge trends that are going to change how we live - from AI and graphene, to the rise of China and the data economy, to people living for much longer. And then for their best reporters to be unleashed on those stories. 2/ A shameless embrace of the principle that it is better to be right and second than first and wrong; and a recognition that committing to the former will sometimes lead you to look slow on the uptake. There is a culture war going on, in which the idea of absolute truth has been denigrated. Only by shamelessly fighting for truth can the reputation of journalists be restored. That's why initiatives like Channel 4's Fact Check, the BBC's Reality Check, and other fact-checking services are hugely welcome. They should be given greater prominence. 3/ Related to this, I think we need to make immediate and unforgiving statistical correction one of the aims of broadcast journalism. The peerless Mark Damazer, former Radio 4 Controller, has suggested having statistical experts on standby after broadcast interviews, to check whether claims made on air are correct. Far too often, these checking mechanisms are too slow, or arise in places far from the original interview, for instance, on websites or social media an hour later. But one of the key reasons for loss of trust in the media is the ludicrous abuse of statistics. If independent arbiters with the authority and expertise of, for instance, psephologist Professor John Curtice, were on standby, falsehoods could immediately be debunked, and trust regained.  4/ Speak for and with the poor, rather than to or at them. I know this sounds hopelessly vague. But one of the main reasons for the breakdown in trust between journalism and the public is that capture by middle-class professionals that I mentioned. I take it as a moral duty, being a journalist, to consider myself a tribune for the poor - not because I am a class warrior or proletarian hero - but rather because I know too well how disconnected they feel with our trade, how that rift is widening, and the social consequences of journalism losing touch with millions of people. That means commissioning brilliant programmes, essays, reports and features about the lives of millions of people in poor and provincial Britain - and telling their stories in compelling ways that give them a voice and don't patronise them. This will be much more likely to happen if we change the composition - the demographics - of the trade. I have argued that this is one of the most urgent problems we face. It is one so serious that I think we should consider positive discrimination, in the best sense of that phrase. I should say at this point that, in principle, I am against positive discrimination. It engenders suspicion and resentment, and often demotes merit as a criterion for promotion. But sometimes particular situations are so urgently in need of remedy, and the public cost of not acting, is so high, that positive discrimination goes from being a bad to good idea. Positive discrimination by class is very hard, for the reasons I mentioned: class is hard to describe, and it shifts in a way that, for instance, gender and ethnicity do not. There are also very impressive apprenticeship schemes already in place in many institutions, not least the BBC. But, short of quotas, I would consider positive discrimination toward working-class journalists from outside of London a valuable option for the BBC, when promoting or hiring on and off-air journalists. And though I don't know much about any lobbying organisations within broadcasting set up to help kids from poorer backgrounds, I hope any such efforts can be improved. As for the economics, Simon Fox, the Trinity Mirror CEO, told me on The Media Show last week that there are two models in journalism now: scale, and specialism. As I have argued, I believe the scale model is inherently vulnerable, because it depends on advertising that cannot be relied on, puts publishers at the behest of social media giants, and potentially distorts editorial values. Further to this, there is now exhilarating evidence that, if you produce journalism that is unique and of outstanding quality, and you make it easy for them to pay online, they will do so. So if you're not in the fortunate position of being funded by a licence fee, have the balls to charge, and take pride in it rather than feeling guilt. You know, I'm part of the generation that missed out on the supposed Golden Age. Not for me the hot clanging metal and inky glory of the old Fleet Street, nor the public broadcaster awash with cash, where you could get paid the salaries of yore for presenting the News, at a time when the salaries of yore went a lot further. I work extremely hard, not because I get paid so much - though I do get paid very well - but rather because I love it. Journalism, in that hackneyed phrase you often find in university prospectuses, is a state of mind rather than a career choice. Technology has made this trade much more sociable, and much more partisan - just as it was in the coffee houses of the 18th century where the trade really got going. But it has also made it much more fast. It is absolutely imperative, when breaking a story, to be first if you can; but scoops, while vital, are not all we do. And as an approach to journalism, the impulse to be fast, and to be shared among our friends, can too often distract us from the higher callings of our profession, which is to apply scrutiny to power, find truth where it is hidden, and enlighten our culture.  ""Slow and steady wins the race"" was never meant to sound galvanising. But it was meant to point to a deeper truth - and truth is our currency. As the sprint of the hare was his undoing, and the dopamine-fuelled thrill of the share is ours, so the enduring wisdom of the tortoise should be our inspiration. It's all a matter of time, my friends. Journalism today, and tomorrow, will be at its best when it re-learns the habits inherited from yesterday. That re-learning is my task as well as yours, and I commend it to the University of Kent. ""The Tortoise and the Share - or, How to Save Journalism (from Itself)"" was The Bob Friend Lecture 2018 at the University of Kent at Canterbury on 22nd February, 2018.  If you're interested in issues such as these, please follow me on Twitter or Facebook; and also please subscribe to The Media Show podcast from Radio 4. I'm grateful for all constructive feedback. Thanks."
Spread to US Treasury,Nightclubs in NI to close from 26 December,2024-09-25,2021-12-22,By Jayne McCormack,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-59756633,"Nightclubs will have to close from 06:00 on 26 December and indoor standing events will be prohibited.  From then, dancing will also be prohibited in hospitality venues, but this will not apply to weddings. Stormont ministers met for more than four hours this afternoon to agree measures to tackle rising Covid cases. From 27 December, hospitality venues will return to table-service only, with limits of no more than six people allowed to sit together at a table. Again, this measure will not apply to weddings or civil partnership celebrations.  Northern Ireland today recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases - 3,231 - since the pandemic began.  It's understood that Omicron is now the dominant strain of Covid in Northern Ireland and makes up almost 60% of cases. Also from 27 December, people will also be urged to limit meetings inside private homes to no more than three households, but this will be guidance and students returning home will be part of their original household. Sporting events can continue with no limit on capacity but this will be reviewed on 30 December - but there will be guidance to those travelling to and from games not to car share.  The work from home message is to be bolstered, with legislation to require 2m social distancing in the workplace or provide alternative mitigations.  The rules on face coverings will also be strengthened, with some exemptions removed and a statutory duty placed on businesses to promote compliance. Ministers said they will keep the measures under review.  From 06:00 on 26 December: From 06:00 on 27 December: First Minister Paul Givan said the new restrictions were ""balanced and proportionate and based on where we are today"". He added: ""The message is the same, whether it is in regulation or guidance, we appeal to public to follow us and to put into practice those public health messages."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said ministers are working on a financial package to support affected businesses affected and said they would continue to press Westminster for more support. She added: ""This intervention is informed by the medical and scientific advice and it takes account of the wider economic and societal impacts."" She said it was an ""evolving situation"" and that the data will be reviewed ""night and day"". Health Minister Robin Swann said the Omicron surge ""is deeply concerning for us in the health service"". He hinted that limits on funding have prevented Stormont from imposing tougher restrictions. Last week, health officials warned that a ""significant intervention"" could be needed after Christmas. The vaccination and booster programme have been stepped up in a bid to tackle the rise in cases.  Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has tweeted criticism of the executive's decision to close businesses without providing financial support. He said ""it is very disappointing to see Northern Ireland hospitality businesses closing without support in place"".  ""The NI Executive must urgently offer clarity on the financial support available to those affected,"" he added. However, the Department of Finance has previously said that extra Covid-19 funding announced by the Treasury last week was mostly not new money and that much of it already featured in Stormont's spending plans. Stephen Boyd from Thompsons nightclub in Belfast said he ""doesn't feel great"" following the announcement but that it was ""expected"". Speaking on BBC's Evening Extra programme he said: ""I am disappointed because we did put a lot of mitigations in place.  ""We would have been happy enough if they had of said - to get into nightclubs you need a Covid pass and a negative lateral flow - but that is obviously not going to happen now. ""We are going to have to remodel ourselves as a lounge now with table service and that is something we can deal with. ""However, it will be interesting to see if a curfew will be introduced later."" The chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill, said the industry was ""crying out for support"". ""Business owners and staff have been left high and dry about their future over Christmas,"" said Mr Neill. ""Announcing business closure without financial support is contemptable and shows no consideration for staff and business owners."" Fiona Davey, who owns Brunel's restaurant in Newcastle in County Down, said the hospitality industry is ""effectively closed"".  Speaking on Evening Extra, Ms Davey said: ""The amount of cancellations we are seeing is staggering. ""For an industry that is already in a critical state and the lack of staff we have - these restrictions are just creating more problems. ""We're asking the executive for some sort of package to help staff."" Belfast Chamber chief executive Simon Hamilton said the measures were ""unacceptable and unforgivable"". He added: ""As well as having to deal with the impact of additional measures, businesses haven't been offered a single penny in financial support."" Northern Ireland Hotels Federation (NIHF) said the uncertainty of the last month, including ""lack of clarity"" around Covid passports, had taken a ""real toll"". Chief executive Janice Gault said the industry would continue to work with government to ensure support, adding: ""A scheme is being developed, but without intervention from the Treasury, anything of a meaningful nature may not be possible."" Earlier, Wales' first minister announced that groups of no more than six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants from 26 December.  Scotland has also announced new measures to come into force from 26 December and Edinburgh's Hogmanay events have been cancelled. Tighter restrictions are already in place in the Republic of Ireland, where hospitality and cultural venues including pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres have been required to close by 20:00 since Monday. On Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson ruled out introducing new Covid restrictions in England before Christmas. The list of Health Trust vaccination clinics is available on Trust websites at these links. • Belfast Health and Social Care Trust • Northern Health and Social Care Trust • South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust • Southern Health and Social Care Trust • Western Health and Social Care Trust More details of vaccinating pharmacies are available here: • Community pharmacy booster COVID-19 vaccination service"
Spread to US Treasury,Living where the sea turns to ice,2024-09-25,2016-07-25,Andrew Evans,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20160721-living-where-the-sea-turns-to-ice,"A five-year-old from Greenland’s Uummannaq Children's Home shares his life in this remote and frozen corner of the globe. Dharma wanted to go out on the ice. The black-haired boy was already climbing into his snowsuit, zipping up the front before yanking soft mittens over his hands. Stine, the social worker from Denmark, helped him with his boots and then pulled a woollen cap over his head. I wondered: was she there to chaperone the child, or me? Dharma beckoned me to follow him outside into the frigid blank whiteness. The snow had been falling since yesterday and now he was knee deep in the stuff, kicking at it with gusto before climbing onto his wooden sled. He commanded me in Greenlandic, an Inuit language that is older than most European cities. Even from a child’s mouth, the words sounded guttural and ancient. “He wants you to push him down the hill,” guessed Stine, who knew no more Greenlandic than I. We were clueless adults, trailing behind our five-year-old guide, grown-up guests in his world. I nudged Dharma gently down the frozen slope, away from the orphanage where he lived. Winter had replaced the slanted streets with a path of solid ice, and the boy flew away faster than I could waddle after him. The small village of Uummannaq in northwest Greenland is a craggy lump of granite rising up from a silver fjord, covered with a confetti of gabled houses painted blue, green, yellow and red. Arriving by helicopter, the island looks like a melted ice cream cone scattered with a child’s rejected Legos. But on the ground, chasing Dharma down to the harbour, life in Ummannaq came into focus. Codfish – sliced, gutted, salted, dried and frozen – hung on clotheslines, swimming headless in the wind. Someone’s porch was coated in narwhal blood, a plastic tarp flapping over half the whale’s speckled corpse. Spiralled narwhal tusks leaned against the wall, each one a testament to a successful hunt. A pair of polar bear trousers, fluffy and white, stood upright, ready for a trip on the ice. The fishing boats sat frozen in the harbour, useless until spring. In the violet and lingering winter dusk, the mournful wail of sled dogs building like a monastic chant against the arctic wind, Dharma’s silhouette stood out among the bluish mounds of crusty ice on the shore. My parental instinct was to grab the boy before he slipped, but I held back. He walked with ease on the ice, which is at least six feet thick, the fishermen say. Their safe path was marked with tyre tracks and a winter’s worth of snowmobile runs, leading us further and further away from the granite edge and out to the blank spread of sea ice. Young Dharma knows ice better than he knows leaves on trees, or cows or trains. For half the year, his own backyard is ice, and I watched him play with broken chunks of iceberg as big as television sets. “He wants you to carry the ice,” Stine said, mumbling something at Dharma in Danish. I joined in the childish game, piling the ice up on the sled and pushing it to shore, as if returning with some great treasure. Over and over, the ice fell off the wobbly little sled, but I humoured Dharma’s relentless commands, gathering more and more and carrying it all the way back up to the orphanage. The Uummannaq Children's Home sits at the base of the island’s heart-shaped mountain. The 40-odd children who live here come from all over Greenland, but exactly how and why they are here is a mystery. Only the children know their own stories: some have escaped difficult lives in their communities, some come from destitute homes with alcoholic or abusive parents, some have suffered tremendous neglect. Such are the struggles that face many remote, indigenous communities around the country – and vulnerable kids like Dharma find a loving refuge and a new life in Uummannaq. When we entered, good cooking smells hit my nose and I heard the lilting sound of Greenlandic radio from the kitchen. Dharma shook off his winter wear and ran off to join some of the older children who were back from school. The Uummannaq Children's Home is anything but institutional. The big house on the hill is three times the size of a typical island home, and all the children all have their own bedrooms, filled with their own clothes and toys. “It’s important that they have their own space,” explained Stine. There are sprawling living rooms with couches and coffee tables, thick Persian rugs, and walls hung with framed art: oil paintings of gargantuan landscapes, block prints of Inuit hunters, soft watercolours of polar bears and seals. And there are souvenirs: aluminium Eiffel towers and Statues of Liberty. Many of these children have already seen the world – they have travelled from Australia to New York, from Paris to Japan. Part of their education is to learn to play musical instruments and to sing and perform; after which they tour the globe, sharing their Greenlandic culture. Most of the children are away on tour now, while Dharma – who has yet to learn how to sing or play the viola or cello – has been left behind. He is too young. Dinner was roasted narwhal. The meat was heavy and dark, the blubber sizzling hot with the marbled pattern of whale skin still attached. Nobody spoke – not the children, not the many matrons who manage the home day and night, not the visiting social workers from Denmark and not me. Silence is the rule at the table, and so I chewed the whale blubber quietly, swallowing hard. “Most of these kids come from very troubled homes. Places where there was always yelling and crying – just chaos. We try to make a place that is quiet and without chaos. Dinner is always silent,” Stine whispered. The children stayed in their seats until the last person had finished eating. We were excused together, and we all brought our dishes to the sink. The whole thing felt vaguely monastic. After I said goodnight to Dharma and the others, I bundled up and trudged through the snow to my own room in a separate wing of the house. The Northern Lights glimmered overhead, green and gauzy, swirling like a ghoulish phantasm. I lay down in the cold and watched the oozing colours melting away, then brightening once more. The air stung my lungs and my head was hard on the frozen rock, but I could almost have stayed there all night, lost in the lights, listening once more to the mournful lullaby of dogs.   The next morning, Ummannaq had disappeared. When I looked out the window, the island was gone. There was nothing but white, and on my way to the kitchen, I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face. This was snow and fog together, a frozen cloud pressing down on us at the top of the world. There is no such thing as a snow day in Greenland and the remaining older kids had already left for school. I ate my silent breakfast at the table with Dharma, who made faces at me between spoonfuls of cereal, smirking and giggling until one of the matrons rebuked him to silence. The two of us ate, smiling, until another of the Greenlandic aunties swooped in and whisked my friend away for his lessons. There was no point in going outdoors today, for there was literally nothing to see. Also, the wind was strong enough to blow me over. I remained indoors like a sorry spring breaker in the rain, a prisoner of circumstance. My world shrunk down to the size of a single bed in a guest room. Stine was off today, so there was nobody to converse with, there was no wi-fi and there were no books in English. I attempted to be productive, studying my Greenlandic phrasebook and speaking the words out loud: Nnuappunga (I have a cold), Isigaalerpunga (my toes are freezing), Ajorpunga (I don’t feel well). But how do you say, “I love the late winter of northern Greenland. I love how big and unpredictable the snow can be, and I love how the ice goes on forever – or at least as far as the high cliffs at the opposite end of the fjord. I love the kids playing football a good mile offshore, kicking the ball back and forth on top of the ocean.” How do you say, “Uummannaq is amazing because it is so separate from the world I know – Manhattan and Miami, big American cities and the highways that cross them. I love how Greenland stands apart, home to a people who have never forgotten how to live, no matter the weather.” I accept the fact that I will never learn to say these things in Greenlandic, that the people in this town will never hear the real words that I feel. I accept that upon this rock in the ice, my lifetime of knowledge and experience is useless, and that I am reduced to a somewhat foolish man who is in awe of the ferocious weather, yet still fears it. Up here, the greatest value lies in the invisible knowledge around us: how to find food in the dead of winter, how to stay warm when it’s well below freezing, when to stay inside and where to step on the ice. The storm continued for two days­. My helicopter out was cancelled, granting me an extra night at the Children’s Home, where I spent a few hours showing Dharma how to take pictures with my camera. In 20 minutes he shot my entire 32GB flashcard. The sky cleared by morning, revealing a row of far mountains that pointed to the immense ice cap that fills Greenland like a bowl. Dharma did not understand my English goodbye, but I shook his little hand and said qujanaq (thank you) over and over again. I do not expect Dharma to remember me – I have very few memories of the adults I encountered as a five-year old – but he is on me like a tattoo now. Years from now I will guess his age, and wonder what he is up to; whether he has left the home, if he is happy and well. Dharma is part of my map of the world, a smiling face on the nation that I know only slightly better than before.

Spread to US Treasury,The world's largest landlocked country,2024-09-25,2023-08-09,Yulia Denisyuk,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20230808-kazakhstan-a-road-trip-through-the-nations-immense-landscapes,"Photographer Yulia Denisyuk returned to the land of her birth to discover how Kazakhstan's endless steppes and rugged mountains tell the nation's rich story. Sipping black tea with milk from a blue-and-white piala ceramic bowl, I felt like a child again. We'd arrived at Saty, a small village in southern Kazakhstan, after driving all day from Almaty through an otherworldly terrain of wide steppe grasslands, narrow gorges and snow-capped mountains. I was born in Almaty, Kazakhstan's former capital and its biggest city. Although I moved to Estonia when I was three years old, I returned to Kazakhstan every summer to visit my grandmother. Yet, until now, I had barely explored the rest of the country outside the city limits.  The sky-scraping peaks of the Tian Shan mountain range form a natural barrier between Kazakhstan's south-eastern corner and neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and China. It's here, in the Almaty region, where the country's most spectacular landscapes lie. After years abroad, I returned to fulfil a dream: getting to see this vast nation beyond my birth city.  I'm not the only traveller who hasn't seen much of Kazakhstan. Despite being 40 times larger than its Caspian neighbour Georgia, only one-ninth as many foreign visitors came to Kazakhstan as Georgia in 2022 – and most stay in the nation's two largest cities: Almaty and Astana. But those who venture beyond the cities get to experience a rugged land, where horses and camels graze on the endless steppes and the Indigenous Kazakh culture comes alive. Kazakhstan has a layered past. For centuries, nomadic Turkic tribes and Silk Road caravans crossed these steppes. In the 15th Century, a nomadic state formed that lasted for roughly 400 years until the Russian Empire took over. But this history is nearly invisible in Almaty, a former Russian frontier military outpost that birthed the modern city in 1854.  ""A lot of Kazakh culture was forgotten in the Soviet era,"" said Almaty-based Kazakh filmmaker Timur Mugynov. ""But today's youth want to learn about their roots.""  This is what I wanted to see. As a child, when I visited my grandmother, I loved exploring the mountainous apple and apricot gardens on the outskirts of Almaty and climbing the Ile-Alatau, Almaty's imposing mountain range. Some of my favourite memories are of riding in the backseat of my grandfather's old Soviet car to go to our dacha country home. But as I grew up and moved away, I started learning about Kazakh identity, history and its Silk Road legacy from afar, and realised that there's much more to the nation than just Almaty.   In the last few years, many Kazakhs have been increasingly discovering the nation's diverse rural landscapes. Since the pandemic, the country has improved facilities at national parks and opened several high-profile eco hotels. With this road trip, I hoped to see the remote Kazakh countryside before others started descending. It turns out, I didn't have to go far. Despite Kazakhstan being the world's ninth-largest country (and the largest landlocked country), its small, south-eastern Almaty region is something of a national highlight reel.  ""Almaty region is unique,"" said Konstantin Ludanov, an Almaty-based guide with Photosafari Travel who drove the all-terrain vehicle I'd hired for my trip. ""It is the only place in Kazakhstan where you can drive for a few hours and see desert dunes, Alpine lakes, mountain ridges and steppes all without leaving the region.""  We set off on Almaty's sleepy streets at 05:00 and were soon driving along the Kuljin, a 19th-Century road that became a concrete highway (A-351) during Soviet rule, despite keeping its colloquial name. The Kuljin stretched eastward to the Chinese border with the Tian Shan mountains appearing in the distance. Passing townships on the outskirts of Almaty, we veered south to begin our eventual ascent to Asy Plateau, a 60km stretch of breathtaking alpine meadow at a nose-bleeding altitude of 3,200m. This ancient landscape is an example of Turkic transhumance, a practice still alive in rural Kazakhstan, where shepherds set up camp with their herds on high-altitude pastures in the summer and move down the mountains at the season's turn.  Here, eras change with each kilometre. At the western end of the plateau, Kazakhstan's largest astronomical observatory, Assy-Turgen, has been in operation since 1981. Equipped with one of the world's largest telescopes, it recently made a groundbreaking discovery by observing one of the most powerful explosions in the Universe – an event that occurred five billion light years away. The observatory is closed to visitors, but I asked Ludanov to stop nearby so I could absorb the ravines, rolling hills and mountainous peaks stretching towards the skies. Further east on the plateau, I spotted mysterious burial mounds called kurgans along the banks of the Asy River. These are remains of the Saka culture, a nomadic warrior people that inhabited this area in the Iron Age. The medieval Silk Road caravans chose this route, too, on their way to Kyrgyzstan and China as part of the Unesco-inscribed Chang'an-Tianshan Corridor. Charting the same path as generations before me, I felt a missing piece of my birthplace was starting to take shape.  By nightfall, we'd reached Saty, where Shakira Dosumova, owner-operator of the Algados guesthouse was busy setting dastarkhan, a festive table spread prepared by Kazakh people when guests arrive. ""I love meeting travellers from all over the world and I want to feed them well,"" she said. ""We often encounter a language barrier, but when what you do comes from the heart, words aren't needed.""  Even today, Kazakh culture is guided by a centuries-old tribal system of zhuzes: the three large regional clans whose members are said to share certain socio-political leanings and even personality traits. ""Almaty region traditionally belonged to the Upper Zhuz,"" said Mugynov. ""The people here are extremely hospitable and they will stop at nothing to make their guests feel like royalty."" The generous spread and welcome took me back. When I visited my grandmother, long tables would be thrown together for the occasion, our extended relatives gathered, singing folk songs and eating dishes like kazy horsemeat sausage and honeyed chak-chak dessert. Celebrations went on for hours, often lasting well into the night. When Dosumova insisted I eat a second bowl of shurpa (a rich lamb and potato soup), it reminded me that in Kazakhstan, feeding people is how we show our love.  As we made our way further east to Charyn National Park, I noticed strange bunker-like structures facing China on the roadside hills. ""These structures, called DOTs, or long-term firing points, were built by the Soviets in response to the little-known 1969 Sino-Soviet border conflict,"" said Ludanov. He explained that special permits were required to access this border area during Soviet rule, and now some travellers journey here just to visit these curious relics from Kazakhstan's past.  Only three hours from Almaty, the network of canyons inside Charyn National Park is is often compared to the US' Grand Canyon. Cut 300m into the earth by the Charyn River, the Charyn Canyon's 12-million-year old sediments form a parched, pinnacled landscape of red, yellow and white rock that constantly shifts due to wind and erosion. Dwellings, burial structures and tools from the Stone and Iron Age have all been found here. Awestruck, I descended into the Valley of Castles, a 2.5km gorge where many of the Valley's whimsical sedimentary rock formations resemble faces, and I wondered if ancient Kazakhs may have walked this path, too.  Further downstream, more threads of Kazakhstan's story are hidden in plain sight: the endemic Sogdian ash trees inside the Charyn Canyon are named after the Sogdians, the long-forgotten Silk Road merchants who facilitated the exchange of knowledge and beliefs across the Silk Road.  As we turned west back towards Almaty, we set our sights on Altyn-Emel, one of Kazakhstan's largest national parks with deserts, mountains and steppes within its borders. The park's impressive biodiversity has made it a Unesco Biosphere Reserve, and its Martian-like red-and-white Aktau mountains date back 400 million years. Just as Kazakhstan was once a melting pot of peoples on the Silk Road, Altyn-Emel today is the meeting place for rare and endangered species – among them Turkmenian kulan donkeys, Bukhara deer, Persian gazelle and the Siberian salamander – seeking refuge in the reserve. Altyn-Emel's premier treasure is Aigaikum, (the ""Singing Dunes""), a 240-hectare double sand dune stretching more than 3km. Around 200,00 years ago, an earthquake split the surrounding mountains apart and a strong wind corridor formed, carrying grains of sand from the foot of the mountains into the eventual dunes. I wanted to hear Aigaikum's elusive song: at certain conditions, the dune produces a loud, low-pitched vibration sound akin to the nomadic throat-singing tradition that's being repopularised by young Kazakh folk groups like Turan.  ""I came to Altyn-Emel originally to help my parents,"" said Saltanat Bayadilova, owner of the nearby Aigai Kum guesthouse, as she poured me a cup of fresh-from-the-cow raw milk, a drink that's still commonly found in rural areas. ""I never left. Our nature is so special, and I love the fact that I live here.""  Setting off on the A-3 road that would eventually bring us back to Almaty, I was quieter than usual. As petrol stations, fast food restaurants and the tell-tale signs of urbanity reappeared, I thought back to what Mugynov told me: ""Our culture is all about the land. It's important for us to see what our land looks like, to develop a connection."" ""We were nomads,"" Mugynov added. ""We were not living in the cities, we were traversing this land. This is who we are."" The Open Road is a celebration of the world's most remarkable highways and byways, and a reminder that some of the greatest travel adventures happen via wheels. --- Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

Spread to US Treasury,Budget promises 'no regions will be left behind',2024-09-25,2020-03-11,By Patrick Burns,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-51838917,"""What's in it for us?"" That's the question thousands of Midlanders are entitled to ask of today's Budget, especially those Labour voters who broke the habits of several lifetimes by switching to the Conservatives in areas of the Black Country and North Staffordshire where, until recently, any such thing would have seemed unthinkable.  Remember this Budget is not only the first to be presented on behalf of a new government by a very new chancellor. It's also the first after Brexit and the first after our own flooding emergency along the rivers Severn, Teme and Wye which has left local communities facing long and relentless battles to rebuild their lives and their livelihoods.  What's in it for them, too?  And on top of all this, the deepening health emergency caused by the spread of coronavirus guaranteed that Rishi Sunak's debut could hardly have come at a less promising moment.  For once, Boris Johnson was the warm-up man - Prime Minister's Questions coming immediately before the chancellor's statement.  He did his best to take everyone's minds off coronavirus for a moment. He told Stoke South's Conservative MP Jack Brereton that the Budget would turn his city into ""the crucible in which the future prosperity of this country is to be forged"".  While Dudley South's Conservative MP Mike Wood asked the PM if the Budget would help the West Midlands' Conservative ""metro mayor"" Andy Street's drive for ""investment in skills and transport infrastructure to power the Midlands Engine"".  Mr Johnson replied that the Budget would be ""transformational to the infrastructure in this country and in Dudley in particular"". In the event, there was no getting away from the health emergency, however determined the chancellor may have been to avoid this being remembered as ""The Coronavirus Budget"". The NHS, he promised, would be given whatever it needed to cope with the emergency.  Next came flooding relief. The headline figures of £120m to repair the immediate damage, £200m for local authorities to improve flood defences and £5.2bn capital investment in improving resilience measures also include £23m for communities in the Severn Valley.  So at least there is something in this Budget for the people who met Mr Johnson during his visit to Worcestershire 10 days ago when they told him he must ""get Bewdley done"". Some of the other stand-out numbers:  No less bravely, Mr Sunak made a pledge close to Mayor Street's heart: to eradicate rough sleeping during the lifetime of this Parliament.  While Mr Street may be celebrating all these name-checks here at Westminster, he'll not need reminding that, Covid-19 permitting, he faces a mayoral election in May, when he will face a Labour challenger who knows a thing or two about Budget Day himself.  Liam Byrne was a Cabinet Minister at Treasury in the last Labour government. Already he's blamed Mr Street's ""dithering"" over local rail franchises for the misery that's been visited on hapless local commuters.  Mr Byrne has followed this up by tweeting his ""anger and disappointment"" that the Budget funds just 20% of what's needed for East Birmingham extension to the Midlands Metro. Even this, he says, will have to be shared with Sprint Bus Phase One where he calculates there is a £73m funding gap.  A landmark Budget this may be, with a Conservative government promising to ramp up public spending. But the opposition insist they are only repairing some of the damage of their own making during the Tories' decade of austerity.  Yet again, we have a Budget wrapped up in complex number-crunching. But that won't stop the raw politics following close behind. "
Spread to US Treasury,Political reaction to the RHI report,2024-09-25,2020-03-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-51869614,"The report into the renewable energy scheme, which contributed to the collapse of Northern Ireland's government three years ago, has been published. It found the scheme was a ""project too far"" for the Northern Ireland Executive and ""should never have been adopted"". The 656-page report said that while there was ""unacceptable"" behaviour by some officials, ministers and special advisers, what went wrong was a ""compounding of errors and omissions over time and a failure of attention"". Here's what major figures in Northern Ireland's political world have been saying about the long-awaited report. ""For my part, I am determined to learn from my mistakes and to work to ensure that the mistakes and systematic failures of the past are not repeated."" ""In my conference speech to the Democratic Unionist Party in 2018, I indicated that the best of intentions do not make us immune from mistakes and misjudgements. Today I again apologise for my failings in the implementation of the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme.   ""As I look back over the events of the last number of years, and with the benefit of that hindsight, there are many things that could and should have been handled in a very different way.   ""However the unalterable truth is that none of us can change or relive that which has already happened but we can take the experience and use it to shape the road ahead."" On the treatment of businesswoman and whistleblower Janette O'Hagan, who pointed out problems with the scheme, Mrs Foster said: ""She should have been taken much more seriously by the department and of course I regret that that was the case."" Asked about her relationship with Sinn Féin leader Michelle O'Neill, she said: ""We have differences in approach, but we have to work through those and not get back to position where we have to collapse the government."" ""I have no doubt that this report is extremely challenging for everybody here. The responsibility now is to put those recommendations into action to change the system.  ""The recommendations of this report will be worked through and an action plan will be brought forward.  ""The inquiry team has completed its work and now it's over to us to turn the recommendations into real action and reform.  ""We need effective government and we need good practice in terms of our handling of public finances and we need to ensure that an issue such as this... can never arise again."" ""The systemic mismanagement of the RHI scheme was the biggest financial scandal in the history of devolution.  ""The subsequent attempts to frustrate scrutiny of the scheme and the failure to candidly admit what had gone wrong immediately were disastrous errors of political judgment.  ""The finding in the report that the Economy, Trade and Investment committee was unable to discharge its scrutiny function is particularly concerning. This has contributed in a significant way to a collapse in public confidence in these institutions and in politicians. ""I have said previously that the last executive was the most secretive in the history of devolved government. This inquiry report presents an urgent case for immediate reform of the processes of government.""  ""At first glance, it appears there are clear lessons to be learned and issues of real public concern, showing why reform of the institutions is essential. ""This report must act as a watershed moment for those who have been criticised directly, as well as the wider culture and system of governance, which enabled their actions and inactions. ""Alliance has always been a champion of openness and transparency, alongside ethics and effective scrutiny of government. This report gives us a strong basis for doing precisely that within the current executive.  ""Rules and procedures are important for a government to effectively work and ensure faith from the public. They cannot be viewed as optional or discretionary."" ""We have to remember the damage that has been done to Northern Ireland PLC with regard to those, not just administrative failures, but political failures also.  ""We need to show a maturity, that we are going to learn from what is within these documents, that we will be brave in taking the steps to ensure that failures of these proportions do not happen again. ""There was a culture that was unhealthy with regard to availing of treasury money and if you look at those fiscal problems we have today, have those lessons been learned?  ""What does the reputation of Northern Ireland look like, not only within the UK but across the world when we come to a fill-your-boots type of mentality?""  ""Although the language in the report is quite neutral, it's abundantly clear that the panel was appalled by what they found that passes in government here, leading them to the conclusion that this government was never fit to handle a scheme like RHI. ""There was an appalling level of ineptitude and no accountability. ""It may be because the blame was spread so widely that some who deserve more criticism have gotten off lightly. ""A key question, in terms of all the findings, is will there be any consequences? Will any heads roll?  ""If ministers who floundered in a department carry on as if nothings happened, is that good enough? I think not."""
Spread to US Treasury,Trump says China to cut tariffs on US cars,2024-09-25,2018-12-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46422320,"Beijing will ""reduce and remove"" the 40% tariffs it places on US cars imported into China, US President Donald Trump has said. China has declined to confirm President Trump's announcement, which he made on Twitter without providing details. The move, if confirmed, would be welcomed by a car industry unsettled by the escalating US-China trade war. President Trump and Xi Jinping have now agreed to a temporary truce in the bitter dispute.  Over dinner at the G20 summit, they agreed to not increase tariffs for 90 days to allow for talks. Failure to strike a deal would have seen tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese goods rise from 10% to 25% at the start of next year, and would have opened the way for tariffs on additional Chinese goods.  President Trump was in ebullient mood after the developments. On Monday, China's foreign ministry said the presidents of China and the US had instructed their economic teams to ""intensify talks"" towards removing all tariffs following the G20 meeting, However, it did not say if that was a plan with specific goals or something that was merely desirable. Asian markets rallied after news of the trade war truce. In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index climbed 2.5% and the Shanghai Composite index jumped 2.6%. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 1%. The gains spread to Europe, with the UK's FTSE 100 index, the Cac 40 in France and Germany's Dax index all up by about 2%.  The trade war has seen the US and China hit each other with escalating tariffs in an attempt to make their domestically made goods more competitive.  The US says its tariff policy is a response to China's ""unfair"" trade practices and accuses it of intellectual property theft.  Since July, the US has hit China with tariffs on $250bn (£195.9bn) worth of goods. China has retaliated with duties on some $110bn of US goods over the same period. As part of this, the US imposed a 25% tariff on Chinese cars, on top of the 2.5% already in place.  In July, China, which is the world's largest market for cars, imposed a 40% tariff on US vehicle imports. The rate is much higher than the 15% it places on other trading partners and forced many carmakers to raise prices.  In his tweet, President Trump said Beijing had ""agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the US"".  He did not provide a new level for the Chinese tariffs, and Beijing did not immediately confirm the statement.  In a statement, the White House said US tariffs on Chinese goods would remain unchanged for 90 days, but added: ""If at the end of this period of time, the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the 10 percent tariffs will be raised to 25 percent."" The US said China agreed to ""purchase a not yet agreed upon, but very substantial, amount of agricultural, energy, industrial, and other products from the United States to reduce the trade imbalance between our two countries"". Both sides also pledged to ""immediately begin negotiations on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and cyber theft"", according to the White House.  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters after the talks that ""the principal agreement has effectively prevented further expansion of economic friction between the two countries"". Yes. The truce prevents raising tariffs as planned on $200bn worth of Chinese goods.  But it does not remove tariffs that apply to a total of $250bn of Chinese goods targeted since July. The truce also does not affect the existing duties China has imposed on $110bn of US goods in a tit for tat retaliation. While the result of the G20 meeting was better than expected, it is unclear how the two countries will manage to resolve their underlying differences. ""There should be no wishful thinking that the truce would end the trade war between the world's two largest economies,"" DBS strategist Philip Wee wrote in a research note.  He said it ""remains to be seen if real progress could be achieved during this narrow window to resolve the contentious issues, not just on trade, but also intellectual property"". Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, said while the agreement itself was ""positive"" the next steps remained unclear.  ""Whether we will see further de-escalation or whether it is temporary reprieve continues to be very much up to a political decision in Washington DC - that will continue to make this uncertain,"" Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics said.

Spread to US Treasury,Historic church destroyed in large blaze,2024-09-25,2023-01-27,By Liz Jackson & Celestina Olulode,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-64421569,"A Grade II* listed church in north-west London has been destroyed in a fire overnight. Eighty firefighters were deployed to St Mark's church in Hamilton Terrace, St John's Wood, at 23:20 GMT on Thursday. Videos on social media showed the entire two-storey building alight, while witnesses said the roof of the ornate Victorian building had caved in. London Fire Brigade (LFB) said there were no injuries and the cause of the fire was not known. The National Churches Trust has described St Mark's as an ""architectural and historical treasure"". The building, which is more than 170 years old, has links to author Lewis Carroll and Queen Victoria's son Prince Leopold and is situated near Abbey Road Studios and Lord's Cricket Ground. The vicar of St Mark's, the Reverend Kate Harrison, told the BBC the fire was ""heart-breaking for us as a church and a local community"". ""We remain in deep shock, but are so grateful for the prayers and messages that continue to come in, and commit to continuing to serve the local community as best we can,"" she added. Sophia Tennant, who witnessed the fire, said she was getting ready for bed when she looked out of the window and saw flames rising from inside a building which she later realised was the church. After calling the fire brigade, she said she ""came and watched and it was really flaming, most of the roof seemed to be on fire"".  ""You could see the fire inside the church going up what would have been the stained glass window at the east end, so it's pretty disastrous,"" she said. Reema Raisinghani, 32, lives in Hamilton Terrace directly opposite the church and said residents living on the ground floor of nearby buildings were told to evacuate as the flames spread. She said the building was fully alight, including the spire, by 00:30 and ""pieces of the church were actually falling down the façade"". ""It's an iconic church, I'm used to waking up to it every single morning. It's one of those massive community churches, it's just a centre point for the whole terrace as well,"" she said. ""The beautiful stone colour is now all black, it's a black shell. There's ash everywhere, including outside my whole flat."" Another witness described seeing ""lots of flames"" which became ""much bigger before the roof caved in"".  More than 10 fire engines were deployed to the scene, with crews from North Kensington, Paddington and West Hampstead working to put out the flames. Firefighters used three ladders to spray water on to the building, including two 34m (111 ft) ladders and one 64m (209 ft) ladder that is the tallest of its kind in Europe. Eddie Tulasiewicz, from the National Churches Trust, said it was a tragedy that such a ""beautiful, historic church"" had been struck by fire, but he hoped ""a lot of the interior can be saved"". ""Churches are full of wood and most have fire detectors, but what they need is sprinkler systems,"" he said. Households in the area were previously advised to keep windows and doors closed, and police asked the public to avoid the area to allow emergency services to work.  LFB said fire teams remained on site making the scene safe and were carrying out investigations into the cause of the blaze. Westminster City Council said there would be local road closures until late morning, but all residents were ""safe and accounted for"". Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Spread to US Treasury,Who is in Boris Johnson's new cabinet?,2024-09-25,2019-07-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49043973,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has carried out a reshuffle of ministers in cabinet positions, two months after winning the general election. There was speculation ahead of the reshuffle about how diverse the new Cabinet would be, particularly considering women and people from ethnic minority backgrounds. Who's in what job? Here's a guide to the people that make up Mr Johnson's cabinet, with the latest new faces and who's changed places.  Note: BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) is a term widely used in the UK to describe people of non-white descent, as defined by the Institute of Race Relations. This is the second reshuffle for Mr Johnson, who became prime minister last July after winning a Conservative leadership election. Big names to have left cabinet on Thursday included Chancellor Sajid Javid, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom. The make-up of the cabinet has also changed. The proportion of women in it has increased - but the actual number has fallen from eight to seven because some positions were closed. Members of the cabinet are more than 10 times more likely to have gone to a private school than members of the public.  Under Mr Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, 70% of cabinet had not been privately educated, whereas almost 70% of Mr Johnson's new cabinet have. According to the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, every prime minister since 1937 who attended university was educated at Oxford - except for Gordon Brown.  Half of Mr Johnson's cabinet went to Oxford or Cambridge universities. This compares with 27% of all Conservative MPs and 18% of Labour MPs. Sir Peter Lampl, founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust, said December's election led to a seismic shift in the political landscape and Conservative MPs now represent a more diverse range of constituencies than before. ""Yet in terms of educational background, the make-up of Johnson's cabinet is still over 60% from independent schools,"" he said. ""Today's findings underline how unevenly spread the opportunities are to enter the elites and this is something Boris Johnson must address."" Michael Gove is by far the most experienced of Mr Johnson's new top team. The ministers who have had 204 days of cabinet experience are new faces appointed by the PM when he took power in July last year. Click here if you cannot see the Cabinet Guide."
Spread to US Treasury,US plans to pay Americans as part of $1tn stimulus,2024-09-25,2020-03-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51932403,"US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says he supports sending money directly to Americans as part of a $1tn (£830bn) stimulus aimed at averting an economic crisis caused by the coronavirus. ""We're looking at sending cheques to Americans immediately,"" he said. The $250bn (£207bn) in cheques are part of a huge aid package which the White House is discussing with Congress. It follows widespread school and shop closures as the number of coronavirus cases in the US approached 6,000. The US has been debating how to provide relief as activity grinds to a halt in response to curfews and other measures intended to slow the spread of the virus. Details such as the size of the cheques, and who would qualify for them, are still under discussion. A $1tn aid package - roughly the size of the entire UK budget - would be larger than the US response to the 2008 financial crisis, amounting to nearly a quarter of what the US federal government spent last year. In addition to the $250bn in cheques for families, the plan includes a bailout for airlines and hotels, among other measures. The proposal must be approved by Congress to move forward.  Wall Street rebounded sharply on Tuesday after the plan was announced, though not nearly enough to make up for the previous day's heavy losses. Separate from the $1tn package, Mr Mnuchin said the government would also allow companies and individuals to delay their tax payments for 90 days.  ""We look forward to having bipartisan support to pass this legislation very quickly,"" he said. US President Donald Trump initially proposed a payroll tax cut, which would reduce the money the government automatically withholds from worker pay to pay for social programmes. However, critics said that relief would come too slowly and leave out those without jobs. Several high-profile economists had urged more direct assistance, including $1,000 payments, winning support from lawmakers such as Republican Senator Mitt Romney. Mr Trump said he had come round to the view that faster, more direct relief is necessary. ""With this invisible enemy, we don't want people losing their jobs and not having money to live,"" Mr Trump said, adding that he wanted to target the relief to those who need it. Mr Mnuchin said he hoped to send the cheques within two weeks.  ""Americans need cash now and the president wants to give cash now and I mean now, in the next two weeks."" Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University who had championed the idea, wrote on Twitter that he was thrilled to see it gain traction. Speaking to the BBC earlier, he said direct payments would help, even with so many shops closed for business. ""It would enable people to not work, if that's what they need to do. It will prevent some people from not making their rent payments,"" said Mr Furman, who served as a top economic adviser under former President Barack Obama.   ""There are a lot of ways to spend money that don't involve going out."" But economist Gabriel Zucman, a professor at the University of California who has advised Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, said the government should prioritise help to businesses if it wants to avoid mass layoffs and company failures. ""What the US needs is massive support to small businesses to cover wages and maintenance costs during shutdown,"" he said, adding that lawmakers could opt to do both. The White House push for relief comes as Republicans and Democrats in Congress remain divided about what help is necessary. It follows actions by the Federal Reserve to ease financial strains.  The bank on Tuesday said it will use emergency powers to purchase up to $1tr in short-term corporate debt directly from companies, reinstating a funding facility that was created during the 2008 financial crisis.  It is also offering another $500bn in overnight loans to banks. It has previously enacted two emergency rate cuts, and other stimulus measures. US markets rallied about 6% following Tuesday's announcements after steep falls a day earlier. They have been in turmoil for weeks, as investors respond to the likelihood that the coronavirus will cause a sharp contraction in the US economy in coming months."
Spread to US Treasury,Is Grenfell council outspending government?,2024-09-25,2017-10-24,By Dominic Casciani,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41724262,"The Claim: Kensington and Chelsea Council says it will spend more on the rehousing and recovery operation for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire than the government has promised to spend on housing in one quarter (three months) in the whole of the UK. Reality Check Verdict: The £235m that the council has set aside so far for Grenfell is less than the additional £250m allocated for affordable housing in England and Wales a quarter, so on these figures the council is wrong. The council predicts it will ultimately end up spending more on Grenfell but hasn't provided the figures. However the government is due to spend a total of £455m a quarter on affordable housing up to 2021. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea says it has set aside £235m so far on what it calls the Grenfell ""recovery"" operation.  This money includes:  There's no doubt that all of this is going to cost a fortune - not least because the borough is one of the most expensive areas of the UK. But even taking into account the sky-high prices of west London land, the council's claim doesn't stack up. So why did it get it wrong? It's not hard to understand why the council got into a muddle.  It all comes down to one of the biggest problems faced by anyone trying to get their head around government spending: knowing for sure when the cash is going to be spent.  The council told BBC Reality Check that it was comparing its spending with the government's Affordable Homes Programme.  This is the key scheme overseen by the Department for Communities and Local Government to funds new homes in the social sector.  The AHP was set up in 2010 and it runs until 2021. Up until the end of the summer, the Treasury had approved £7bn for the second five-year phase which we are now in. That works out at £350m a quarter. But that's not the figure to which the council is referring. Instead, it is referencing a new part of the affordable homes spending: an additional £2bn that the prime minister announced at October's Conservative Party Conference.  If that £2bn was spread over the five years to 2021, it would work out as £100m per quarter. That's lower than Kensington and Chelsea's Grenfell spending - so the council looks like it's right.  But in fact, that new money is an additional investment for only the final two years of the Affordable Homes Programme.  That works out at £250m per quarter. And that's more than the council has set aside so far for the Grenfell recovery bill.  The council predicts it will ultimately end up spending more on Grenfell but hasn't provided the figures.  BBC Reality Check likes to challenge itself by discovering new and complicated ways to push figures further.  We lumped all £9bn of the government's current affordable homes spending together, without worrying too much about which particular year it applied to. When you spread that total over the five years of the programme, the projected quarterly average was £455m - still more than the council has set aside so far.

Spread to US Treasury,Scots hospitality curbs extended for another week,2024-09-25,2020-10-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-54631004,"Bars and restaurants in Scotland's central belt are to remain closed for another week after short-term Covid-19 restrictions were extended. The move comes as a further 28 deaths linked to the virus were recorded. Scotland is due to move to a five-tier system of virus alert levels from 2 November. The temporary restrictions targeting hospitality venues in the central belt in particular will continue until then to enable a ""smooth transition"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it would ""not be safe"" to ease any restrictions in the short term, but said ""we believe they may already be making a difference"" to the spread of the virus. Business and hospitality leaders said they were ""extremely disappointed"" with the extension, which they described as a ""hammer blow to pubs and breweries across the country"". Bars and restaurants in Scotland's central belt - an area containing about 3.4m people - were closed on 9 October as part of what Ms Sturgeon called a ""short, sharp action to arrest a worrying increase in infection"". Hospitality venues in other parts of the country can only serve alcohol outdoors. These measures were originally meant to expire on 26 October, but Ms Sturgeon said they would now continue until a new ""strategic framework"" comes into force. This multi-tier system will involve different levels of restrictions that can be applied nationally or regionally depending on the level of infection. It is due to be published on Friday, and debated by MSPs after Holyrood's half term recess. Ms Sturgeon said she had agreed with her cabinet on Wednesday that the short-term restrictions should remain in place in the interim to ensure a ""smooth transition to the new system"". Business groups hit out at the move, with Liz Cameron of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce saying the hospitality sector in particular would be ""absolutely devastated that restrictions now look to be in place indefinitely"". Joe Crawford from the Campaign for Real Ale group said the move was a ""hammer blow"" to pubs and breweries ""who feel like they're being offered up as a sacrificial lamb without sufficient evidence"". And Andrew McRae from the Federation of Small Businesses said the current measures had a ""disproportionate"" impact on smaller firms, adding: ""This new strategy must have meaningful input from the business community."" Ms Sturgeon said the move was ""first and foremost a public health decision"", having earlier set out rising numbers of cases, people being treated in hospitals, and deaths. The latest figures include: Meanwhile, and figures from the National Records of Scotland said Covid-19 had been mentioned on 75 death certificates in the week to Sunday, an increase of 50 on the week before. In her briefing, the first minister set out details of how the new five-tier system will work, saying the middle three would be ""broadly equivalent"" to the three-tier system in use in England. The Scottish system will add an extra tier at the bottom - which Ms Sturgeon said will be ""the closest to normality we can reasonably expect to live with until we have a vaccine"" - and one at the top. She said: ""When England published their system the chief medical officer at the time said he thought the top level was not enough to necessarily, in all circumstances, get the virus down. ""We think we need one above that, not identical to but perhaps close to a full lockdown, if things got to be that serious."" The new five-tier framework will include details of financial support for businesses hit by enforced closures, which Ms Sturgeon said will be ""broadly similar"" to that on offer in other parts of the UK. She said: ""While the level of support we set out will be the maximum that the Scottish government is able to provide within the resources available to us, it is the minimum we think is necessary. ""In common with other devolved administrations and many councils in England we will continue to pursue urgent discussions with the Treasury about provision of adequate support to help businesses and individuals through the restrictions likely to be necessary in the time ahead."" Ms Sturgeon said the continuing rise in infections and deaths was ""clearly concerning"", but she believed it ""should not be taken as an indication that the current restrictions we are living under are not having any impact"". She said: ""We do believe these restrictions will make a difference, and we believe they may already be making a difference. Even allowing for today's figures, we may be seeing a reduction in the rate at which new cases are increasing."" The first minister discussed the new strategic framework with opposition party leaders on Tuesday. The Scottish Conservatives said the government must stop ""stalling"" and get support to businesses, saying they had been given ""barely any notice"" of the changes. Leader Douglas Ross said: ""There's a very real risk that the SNP take so long to get support out to these businesses that it will too little, too late. Promises of support sometime in the future won't protect Scottish jobs today.""  Scottish Labour's Richard Leonard said Ms Sturgeon's administration ""must take the right action to control the virus"" as positive cases, hospital patients and deaths increase.  He added that it was ""clear"" that the test and protect system was not working ""well enough"" to contain the virus, saying: ""We need the government to step up and ensure our testing and tracing system is fit for purpose"". Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said he was worried about ""how things are developing"" and said the government needed to ""get on top of this situation"" if the virus was going to be curbed. He said: ""We have had four strategies in three weeks, starting with the route map then the 16 days of restrictions that has now turned into 23 days, and we will have the new strategy announced on Friday. It doesn't look like we're in control of the situation."" ."
Spread to US Treasury,Pubs and restaurants warn time running out to help,2024-09-25,2021-12-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59725527,"The chancellor needs to ""get his act together"" and provide support for struggling hospitality businesses, the boss of two restaurant chains has said. David Page, chairman of the firm which runs the Real Greek and Franco Manca, said Rishi Sunak needed to provide financial help ""in the next 24 hours"". It comes as 100,000 retail, hospitality and leisure businesses called on government for more support.  The government is yet to offer further measures for struggling businesses. Mr Page said the country was in ""lockdown by stealth"" due to government advice to limit social contacts. ""The chancellor better get his act together otherwise it's going to be a really horrible Christmas for our sector,"" said Mr Page, chairman of Fulham Shore. ""If you want a choice of restaurants the chancellor, needs to do something very, very quickly. ""I'm not sure any of the cabinet understand cash flow and cash flow is the problem at the moment, over the last week or two and over the next 10 days."" Restaurants and pubs have been dealing with large numbers of cancellations in the run-up to Christmas as fears have risen over the spread of Omicron. The hospitality industry has estimated takings in December will be down by 40% - with the damage up to twice that in London. A letter to the chancellor, penned by 100,000 businesses, argued existing support from the government was ""insufficient"". Matthew Sims, head of Croydon Business Improvement District, said it was ""alarming"" that Mr Sunak was ""doggedly sticking to measures which are out of date and out of touch with the stark and desperate reality retail, hospitality and leisure businesses are facing"". Mr Page said that while city centre branches of Franco Manca and Real Greek restaurants were experiencing a dip in sales, trade in commuter areas across England was up.   ""We have got a geographical spread, that helps us. If you're exposed to central London and you've only got one or two sites, you're in trouble at the moment,"" he said. Nick Mackenzie, boss of pub chain Greene King, said bookings had been ""decimated"" across the business amid the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. He agreed with Mr Page that the country was in lockdown ""in all but name"", due to government messaging. He called on the government for ""urgent"" help, with others saying firms needed support ""in the next 24 hours"". Greene King, which manages 1,700 pubs and rents out 1,000, faced an ""incredibly difficult"" situation during what would usually be its busiest trading period of the year, Mr Mackenzie said.  ""Demand has dropped, bookings have been decimated, in some parts of the country we are 70-80% down on 2019,"" he said. Mr Mackenzie said the government ""should be commended"" for the measures it brought in to help hospitality businesses earlier in the pandemic, but added that the situation was ""urgent again now"". ""We need them to move towards things like furlough support for [pubs] that we are having to close or those severely impacted, business rates relief, and removal of the cap on business rates."" The government has not ruled out bringing in further Covid restrictions before Christmas, with Health Secretary Sajid Javid telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there were ""no guarantees"" in a pandemic. Greene King said if it had to close sites due to government restrictions, the shut down and then reopening costs to the business would be about £5,000 per pub. The UK's food and drink wholesalers, which supply schools, care homes and hospitals as well as pubs and restaurants, have warned they face losing millions of pounds if a new lockdown is announced, with millions of tonnes of food currently in warehouses going to waste. The Federation of Wholesale Distributors (FWD) said businesses could ""no longer absorb the losses caused by last-minute closure of their customers"".  Chancellor Mr Sunak met with representatives from the hospitality sector last Thursday to discuss their concerns, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised people to ""think carefully before you go"" out to socialise. The UK's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty also urged people not to ""mix with people you don't have to"". A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The chancellor has spoken to a range of business and industry leaders in recent days. ""We recognise how important the festive period is for so many businesses and the government will continue to engage constructively on how it can best provide ongoing support to the businesses and sectors affected."""
Spread to US Treasury,Hogmanay events cancelled as Covid rules tightened,2024-09-25,2021-12-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-59745262,"Edinburgh's Hogmanay events have been cancelled and football matches will be effectively spectator-free as part of tough new Covid rules in Scotland. All outdoor events will be limited to just 500 people to help slow the spread of Omicron. Indoor events such as concerts will be limited to 200 people if they are seated, or 100 for standing.  The new restrictions come into force on Boxing Day. They will be in place for three weeks - although there will be no limit to how many people can meet up at Christmas.  The Old Firm derby between Celtic and Rangers on 2 January and the Edinburgh derby between Hearts and Hibs the following day are among the football fixtures that will be affected by the new rules. The government fears that last Sunday's League Cup Final in front of a capacity crowd at Hampden may have been a ""super spreader"" event, with Deputy First Minister John Swinney saying he regrets not making the decision to play matches without spectators sooner. Celtic have asked for the Scottish Premiership's three-week winter break - which is due to start after the Edinburgh derby on 3 January - to be brought forward to ""maximise the prospect of all supporters being able to attend matches and support the game they love."" All of the major Hogmanay events in Edinburgh - including the street party, the torchlit precession and the midnight firework display - have now been cancelled, as have many other events in towns and cities across the country.  Physical distancing of 1m will now need to be in place for all events that do go ahead under the restrictions. Pubs and other hospitality venues selling alcohol will need to reintroduce table service from 27 December. And indoor hospitality and leisure venues will be required to ensure there is a 1m distance between groups of people who are attending together - which could force nightclubs to close. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""This will of course make sports matches, including football, effectively spectator-free over this three week period. ""And it will also mean that large-scale Hogmanay celebrations - including that planned here in our capital city - will not proceed"".  Wales had already announced plans for sporting events to be held without crowds from Boxing Day, and London has cancelled its New Year's Eve event in Trafalgar Square. Many concerts, theatre productions and other events had already been cancelled voluntarily in Scotland.  Omicron is now thought to account for 62.9% of all Covid cases in Scotland, with the first minister saying there was ""still no compelling evidence that Omicron is intrinsically milder than previous strains"". Ms Sturgeon said the much higher transmissibility of the new variant meant that large gatherings ""have the potential to become very rapid super-spreader events, putting large numbers at risk of getting infected very quickly"".  She added: ""Limiting these events helps reduce the risk of widespread transmission. It also cuts down the transmission risks associated with travel to and from such events  ""And these large events put an additional burden on emergency services, especially the police and ambulance services. ""At a time when these services are already under severe pressure and also dealing with high staff absences, limiting large scale events will help them focus on delivering essential services to the public."" Ms Sturgeon stressed that the priority for the government was to ensure that schools re-open as normal after the Christmas holidays. And she again urged people to cut their contacts with people in other households as much as possible ahead of Christmas, and to stay at home as much as possible.  The Federation of Small Business said the new measures would make trading ""drastically more difficult for huge numbers of small businesses in Scotland"".  Its policy chair, Andrew McRae, said: ""The social distancing restrictions will mean shops and hospitality firms can serve fewer customers.  ""And the changes to events, such as sports matches and Hogmanay celebrations, will have a knock-on impact on local economies."" The Scottish Licensed Traders Association said the restrictions would be a ""knockout blow""  to many businesses that were already struggling because of the pandemic. The Scottish government will now double the £100m it had already pledged to businesses hit by new Omicron restrictions.  And Ms Sturgeon said recent announcements by the UK Treasury ""give us additional spending power now of £175m"" - bringing the total to £375m, all of which will be allocated to business support. While there are no changes to the rules and advice for Christmas gatherings, significant new restrictions will take effect as we head towards the new year. Edinburgh's Hogmanay is off for the second year in a row and big football matches can only be played before the smallest of crowds. The return of one metre distancing indoors will reduce the capacity of pubs and restaurants, theatres and cinemas - reducing their potential turnover too. There is fresh financial help worth £275m from the Scottish government which draws on additional funding announced by the UK Treasury at the weekend. Even though that's on top of an initial £100m earmarked by Holyrood ministers last week - it is unlikely to be nearly enough to offset the economic damage restrictions will cause. The first minister has renewed calls for the Chancellor to re-introduce a furlough scheme - something the Treasury has not included in the support package it announced today. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said he understood the ""frustration and anger"" that many people would have over the new restrictions, but urged people to come forward for vaccination as the ""best way out of this"". He also called for household contacts of Covid cases to be allowed to end their self-isolation if they test negative, saying the current rules were well-intentioned but could ""grind our transport network, our economy and public services to a halt"". ScotRail cancelled more than 100 trains on Monday, largely because of crew members being affected by Covid.  Ms Sturgeon said the government was ""actively considering"" changing household isolation rules once the booster campaign is complete, but said it would be ""counter-productive"" to do so while case numbers are rising. Meanwhile Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar said there should be ""much more significant financial support"" for businesses and a ""furlough-type scheme"" for sectors which are effectively shut down."
Spread to US Treasury,The tax that hits struggling High Streets hardest,2024-09-25,2020-03-09,By Emma Simpson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51676242,"Finding a new retailer for a prime spot in Blackpool town centre used to be easy. In the 1980s and 1990s, firms would have been fighting over the keys to 18-22 Victoria Street, a large, modern two-storey unit directly opposite the shopping centre. Not any more. Until last month, the property had been rented to Topshop and Topman. But their owner, Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group, walked away when the lease came up for renewal. His shops have been struggling to keep up with the competition, and dozens, up and down the country, are being closed. ""We are having difficulty attracting any interest, never mind a national retailer,"" says Paul Moran, a ratings surveyor whose company, Mason Owen, is tasked with finding a new tenant. Business rates, he says, were a factor in Arcadia's decision to pull out, and they're now a big barrier to someone else moving in. ""The first thing tenants look at are their outgoings. And when they see the rates bill, they will be put off by that. Normally you'd expect to be paying 50% of your rent in rates, but the rates bill in this shop is dramatically higher than that."" With retail in turmoil, pressure is growing for change. So what are business rates and why are they a problem? Business rates are a kind of council tax for commercial property. All sorts of premises have to pay them, from offices, warehouses and pubs, to power plants, train stations and shops. Bills are worked out based on the government's estimate of how much the property would cost to rent on the open market. Businesses have to pay the tax regardless of whether the space makes any profit or not. As a rule of thumb, your business rates bill is now typically half of your rent. That's a big financial burden in itself for retailers with lots of shops. But many of our national chains aren't even being charged the right amount to begin with. They're paying millions of pounds more in rates than their rents would imply. Properties get revalued every few years by the government to make sure the occupiers are paying the correct sums. Some bills go up and some go down. The last revaluation was in 2017.  For towns like Blackpool, this should have been good news because retail rents had collapsed. Their business rates bills should have dived as a result, bringing some relief to a town grappling with too many empty shops and years of government austerity.   But here's the problem. Changes in bills, both up and down, are phased in gradually over several years to help businesses adjust. It's like a shock absorber, and it's called ""transitional relief"".  The system is good news if your bills are going up, but not so good if you're in a property due a big reduction. It's a bit like being told you're due a tax cut, but your bill will only be cut incrementally over five years, and you may never get the full reduction. It works like this because the government wants to make sure it receives the same amount in business rates in real terms, or adjusting for inflation, each year. So rate rises and decreases must balance. This is an England-only policy. And it's the largest stores occupied by big chains that are the most affected. Blackpool's 18-22 Victoria Street is a good example. Back in 2010, this property was valued at £246,000. Remember, this is the equivalent of what it could be rented for. By 2017, this had dropped to £146,000. This fall should have produced a business rates bill that year of £69,934. The actual bill was £118,364. ""The annual business rates bill for this property today is still £112,000,"" says Mason Owen's Paul Moran.  ""I've been involved in ratings valuations for 40 years. But I've not seen a situation where the actual liability for a shop is so out of line with the… rental value in locations like Blackpool. It's unsustainable."" Down the road is Poundland, and its business rates numbers are even more striking. Its business rates bill should have dropped by 46% between 2010 and 2017. Instead it will only have gone down in real terms by 13% by the next revaluation next year. According to Altus Group, a ratings advisory company, this one store is effectively paying £167,121 more in rates than it should. Poundland isn't struggling - far from it. Unlike a lot of other retailers, it's still managing to grow sales in its physical stores. It has 850 shops in the UK and Ireland and is interested in opening more. Still, its UK and Ireland boss, Barry Williams, says transitional relief is costing his business millions of pounds. ""Transitional relief? I call it comic relief. It needs to be scrapped,"" he says. ""I could open more shops. I could employ more colleagues. I could create better products. It just holds the business back from investing and from driving growth. It makes us question certain sites that we'd move into and for many of our competitors it means they are actually closing stores,"" he says. The crisis on our High Streets was a big issue on the doorstep during December's general election. The new government, which is on a mission to ""level up"" regional inequalities, is spending about £3.6bn to revitalise struggling town centres. But at the same time, many of these places are the hardest hit by transitional relief. ""The phasing in of very large tax rises is a good thing when there are big upward shifts in property values. The big question is how you pay for that,"" says Robert Hayton, head of UK business rates at Altus Group. ""A very small supplement on all bills would spread the burden. But taking from those local economies that have struggled isn't the answer. It affords them no respite to recover and rebuild and certainly doesn't aid the levelling up of prosperity.""  The leader of Blackpool Council says rates bills just need to match current rents. ""There is some £7m which isn't in our pockets because it's going elsewhere, and that is always the complexity of a tariff and top-up system. There is an unfairness inherent in the whole system. It's outdated,"" says Councillor Simon Blackburn.  There are always individual winners and losers with business rates. It's the way this tax works - the burden is redistributed when one area becomes better off relative to another. But if you take a deep dive into the numbers, there are also winners and losers in different parts of our economy. The chart below is based on the government's own numbers, which show how much each sector has been granted in relief to phase in large increases, as well as the amount of tax reductions that have been held back. The biggest winner is the Central List, which includes some of Britain's biggest private infrastructure companies, such as utility firms and telecommunication providers. ""Other"" is basically everything else that isn't office, industrial or retail businesses. It covers public sector buildings like schools and hospitals (which are required to pay business rates), as well as leisure and hospitality. The losers are those sectors on the left, and the biggest one is retail. Over the past three years this sector has paid an extra £543m because of transitional relief. ""Retailers are paying a disproportionate slice of the UK's business rates bills, and this burden is based purely on the size and value of their properties, no matter how well their businesses are doing,"" says John Webber, head of ratings at Colliers International. ""Not only that, they are being clobbered by transitional relief."" You can understand why the government has been reluctant to meddle with this system of taxation. Business rates generated £25bn for HM Treasury in England alone this financial year, according to Altus. The tax is also easy to collect and difficult to avoid. The government has promised a fundamental review of business rates and will halve rates for small shops from April. ""Since 2016 we've cut business rates across the board, with reforms that will reduce their cost by £13bn over the next five years,"" says a Treasury spokesperson. It's worth pointing out that a lot of smaller, independent retailers don't pay any rates. That's because if a business's property is deemed to be worth less than £12,000, it is eligible for 100% relief. It's bigger stores that have a rateable value of more than £51,000, and get no government help, that pay 70% of the sector's overall rates bill. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, it isn't business rates which are hurting the High Street, but competition from online. It says abolishing rates, for instance, would largely lead to higher shop rents.   But one experienced retail property investor argues this view misses the point.  ""Yes, some rents would potentially go up if you reduce rates… but this isn't a normal market any more,"" says Mark Williams of RivingtonHark, which invests in and manages a range of town centre properties. ""There's a huge structural change going on, and there are many examples where landlords are subsidising the rates payable by the occupier simply to try and let space."" In Nuneaton, for example, the local council charges Poundland just £1 each year to rent a store in a shopping centre it owns because it is desperate to attract tenants. The business rates bill is £117,000. Reforming business rates won't stop the huge shift to online shopping and the need for fewer shops, which are the big challenges for UK retailers. In other words, there's too much retail space and not enough demand. While business rates are never the sole reason for a retailer shutting up shop, it does feel like the tax is out of kilter with the seismic changes taking place on the High Street. More frequent revaluations would help. And this is something the government is introducing from April next year when revaluations will move to every three years from the standard five-year period. The clock is ticking. The next period for bills is set to begin in April 2021. If transitional relief isn't sorted by then, John Webber of Colliers says the problem is going to get even worse. ""We will see an increasing number of empty shops because retailers will no longer be able to afford to stay in the same number of physical units,"" he says."
Spread to US Treasury,Government position on teacher pay 'shameful',2024-09-25,2020-07-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-53408375,"The Isle of Man government's position on pay increases for teachers is ""nothing less than shameful"", teaching unions have said. A joint statement from four unions said the government had refused ""any negotiations other than to discuss cuts"" during a meeting earlier.  It follows a long-running dispute over pay conditions with the Department of Education, Sport and Culture (DESC). The DESC said Covid-19 had placed ""unprecedented demands"" on finances.  The National Education Union (NEU), Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) and the National Association of Schoolmasters, Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) called on the government to negotiate in ""good faith"" and avoid making cuts to education to facilitate any raises.  The dispute began in 2018 after the School Teachers' Review Body's recommendation of an across-the-board 3.5% pay rise was not fully implemented. A deal that would see newly qualified teachers paid almost £30,000 and the lowest pay bands scrapped was accepted by the NEU on 17 January but rejected its by members.  Meanwhile, members of ASCL and NAHT began action short of strike in January, with NASUWT members following suit in February. Talks between unions and the government were halted in March due to the coronavirus outbreak. In the joint statement, the unions said representatives had been left ""deeply disappointed"" by the meeting earlier in which they said the DESC had ""cited clear instructions from the treasury, allegedly received 15 minutes prior to the commencement of the meeting, that no additional funds were available"". ""The joint trade unions were shocked and frustrated that despite agreeing to the meeting, the government refused to enter into any negotiations other than to discuss cuts,"" the statement said, adding that they were ""further appalled that there seemed to be no immediate appetite... to request any additional funding"". ""The government's position is nothing less than shameful, and will come as a tremendous disappointment to all teachers who continue to go the extra mile,"" it added. Speaking after the meeting, the NAHT's Rob Kelsall said it ""could lead to a resumption of industrial action"", while the ASCL's Sara Ford said the union was ""committed to trying to find a resolution to this dispute"". DESC Minister Dr Alex Allinson said having made ""numerous offers"", all of which had been ""turned down by the trade unions side"", the government had made it clear that ""circumstances had now changed following the health emergency"". ""It had been hoped that new resources might be available to support a pay offer... budgetary constraints caused by the pandemic have meant that no such commitment can be given."" He said teachers had ""already received a pay increase of 2.75% for 2019-20"" and the unions had wanted ""an additional 9% spread over three years in addition to unconsolidated lump sums [worth] £1.75m for those on the upper and leadership pay scales"".  He added that the unions had ""appeared unable to appreciate the unprecedented demands on government's finances as a result of the pandemic"", but said he was ""still optimistic"" that a ""positive resolution"" could be reached.

Spread to US Treasury,Coronavirus: Now it's serious for No 10,2024-09-25,2020-03-02,By Laura Kuenssberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-51709641,"Now it's serious.  Handling the coronavirus is plainly at the top of the government's to-do list. Boris Johnson came under attack in recent days for not being visible enough at a time of a potential health emergency.  No 10 clearly now wants to show they are trying hard to contain the outbreak. But the government will be tested on many different fronts. First off, they want to appear to be taking the disease as seriously as it ought to be.  With some cities around the world in lockdown and the rate of the spread picking up here too, the prime minister's words today don't leave you in much doubt about how serious a situation the country could face.  But managing the outbreak is a balancing act with lots of factors. The government wants the public to take the virus seriously, but it doesn't want panic. Ministers want the option of closing schools, or cancelling big events, or changing the numbers of teachers schools have to have on duty per child.  But they do not, at this stage, want to use those kinds of measures straight away and cause widespread disruption to people's daily lives.  The government wants, of course, to protect as many people's health as possible but also to protect the economy, the prime minister acknowledging that there may well be an ""economic downside"", here at home as well as in the countries that have already been much more affected.  The Treasury is publishing a Budget next week too, which not so long ago government aides were vowing ""had to be big, and had to be bold"". But in this context - and of course with a different politician in charge - No 11's big day next week might be rather different.  They are already making some extra taxpayers' cash available for the health service. Boris Johnson promised he would allocate the NHS whatever it asked for which, with the scale of the outbreak as yet impossible to predict, could be rather a large blank cheque.   Behind closed doors in government there is a realisation that an outbreak of coronavirus could go on for many months and cause a lot of disruption to many people's lives.  Many of us might be asked to work at home. There are questions too about how self-employed people or those on zero hours contracts can make a living. What happens to the local elections in May? Can the NHS, already under a lot of pressure, really cope?  There is a lot that neither the public, nor our politicians, can be sure of. The science will guide the approach that ministers take, but that is understandably changing by the day.   Boris Johnson's government is certainly no longer in the position of surveying the new political landscape and wondering which of its priorities it can choose to deal with first. Instead, it faces an immediate and highly complicated question it needs to answer.  Get it wrong and there could be serious political damage too. "
Spread to US Treasury,Russia and Turkey risk turning Libya into another Syria,2024-09-25,2020-05-31,By Jeremy Bowen,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52846879,"Libya looks to be at the end of one bleak chapter, but there is no guarantee that the next will be any better for a country that has been torn to pieces by civil war and foreign intervention since Col Muammar Gaddafi met his grisly death in 2011.  Since last year Gen Khalifa Haftar, the strongman of eastern Libya, has been trying to capture the capital, Tripoli, in the far west of the vast country. Intervention by Turkey in support of the Tripoli government, recognised by the United Nations, looks to be decisive. Gen Haftar's men, along with a force of several thousand Russian mercenaries, are in retreat.  But that does not mean that Libyan civilians can expect the peace they crave. Once again they are the biggest losers.  Their country, richly endowed with oil and gas, should be able to guarantee them rights of which they can only dream: education; healthcare and a decent standard of living. They don't have any of them, or safety.  Libyans who have not lost their homes have been locking down to prevent the spread of Covid-19, hoping they do not also become the target of artillery, drones or warplanes. The war has destroyed most of Libya's clinics and hospitals.  Around 200,000 civilians in western Libya have already been displaced from their homes, according to Hanan Saleh of Human Rights Watch.  In a recent webinar organised by the think-tank, Chatham House, Ms Saleh said that ""you have to look at Libya currently as an accountability-free zone and it has been that way unfortunately since 2011"".  All parties in the war have been reckless in their treatment of civilians, though Gen Haftar's side, she said, has committed more documented abuses that could potentially be crimes of war.  It is hard to believe now, but after Col Gaddafi was overthrown it looked for a while as if Libya might have a decent future.  Back in 2011 I walked with the British ambassador through the ruins of his embassy in Tripoli; it had been attacked and torched by a mob after Nato started bombing the Gaddafi regime's forces.  Next to the charred frame of what had been a 1920s billiard table, we talked about the pride that Libyans had in their revolution, their luck in not being cursed with significant sectarian differences like Syria or Iraq, and about the treasure house of oil and gas under the vast Libyan desert.  Perhaps even tourism would be possible. Libya has 2,000 kilometres of Mediterranean beaches, and Roman archaeological sites that are the equal of anything in Italy. But Libya was broken, and in almost a decade since that conversation it has continued to fragment. You may be interested in:  The militias that took on the Gaddafi regime never disbanded, and came to like their power.  Once the colonel, his sons and the family's cronies were gone, no kind of functioning state was left. The men who acquired the important job titles found that if there were any levers of government to pull, they came away in their hands.  Libyans who saw themselves as revolutionaries were in no mood to ask for much help from the powerful countries which had provided weapons and most importantly an air force to help them win.  In turn, the outsiders were relieved to be able to turn away, declaring the job was well done. Removing Gaddafi was one thing. Helping to build a country was something very different.  It did not take long for the remains of Libya to fall into even smaller pieces. The bigger towns became city-states.  The militias had their own agendas and would not lay down their weapons. A series of diplomats, mostly under the auspices of the United Nations tried, unsuccessfully, to promote dialogue and reconciliation.  By 2014 Gen Haftar had emerged as a power in the broken land, expelling radical Islamists from Benghazi, Libya's second city and the capital of Eastern Libya.  Gen Haftar was well known in Libya, as a general who had fallen out with Gaddafi. In exile he had spent years plotting Gaddafi's downfall from a new base in Langley, Virginia - the American town that is also the headquarters of the CIA.  Libya, in reality already in pieces, eventually found itself with two rival governments.  Gen Haftar controlled the east from Benghazi, and set about unifying the country by marching west to attack Tripoli, the capital, aiming to unseat the internationally recognised Government of National Accord led by Fayez al Sarraj.  Supporting Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj (l) Supporting Gen Khalifa Haftar (r) It was certain that foreign powers would get involved in the civil war. Libya is a desirable prize. It has the biggest reserves of oil and gas in Africa, with a population of less than seven million.  Strategically, it is opposite Europe and its hydrocarbons can be exported direct to markets in the west through the Mediterranean. Rival producers in the Gulf need to ship their exports through potentially dangerous sea lanes.  Gen Haftar's most important backers are Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.  Turkey is the key ally of the Sarraj government in Tripoli.  The US has sent a variety of signals out about Libya under President Donald Trump, offering encouragement at different times to Mr Sarraj and Gen Haftar, and bombing jihadist extremists when they can find them.  Now their biggest concern is that Russia's President Putin might be establishing himself in Libya in the same way that he has dug into Syria.  Libya's war has developed disturbing similarities with Syria's. The arbiters of the fate and future of both are the same foreigners.  The proxy wars in Libya have become, in many ways, a continuation of the proxy wars in Syria. Both sides have flown in Syrian militias to apply the skills they have gained in almost a decade of war in their homeland.   It is possible that Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Russia's President Vladimir Putin have applied in Libya a version of the deals they have made in Syria.  The Russian mercenaries who have fought with Gen Haftar are from an organisation known as the Wagner Group, run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close associate of President Putin. The Wagner fighters have also been used in Syria.  It is significant that the Russian pullback from Tripoli has not been harassed by Turkey's highly efficient military drones. The Russians have also moved advanced warplanes into Libya.  President Putin and President Erdogan could have agreed to end Gen Haftar's offensive against Tripoli so they can split the spoils between them, according to Wolfram Lacher, a German academic who has just published a book about the fragmentation of Libya.  In the Chatham House webinar he said: ""We are talking about two foreign powers trying to carve up spheres of influence in Libya and their ambition may well be for this arrangement to be long term.""  He doubted whether the other powers involved in Libya, and the Libyans themselves, would quietly accept the arrangement.  The next big battle could be for Tarhuna, a town that lies around 90km (55 miles) south-east of the capital.  It is Gen Haftar's western stronghold, controlled by a militia known as al-Qaniyat, mainly made up of men previously loyal to the Gaddafi regime.  Troops loyal to the Tripoli government, former opponents of Gaddafi, are advancing on Tarhuna.  The fight against the old regime is still a factor in Libya's never-ending war. "
Spread to US Treasury,Fleeing Dunkirk: A 1940 holiday in hell,2024-09-25,2017-07-15,By Nadia Ragozhina,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40428015,"Christopher Nolan's World War Two thriller Dunkirk hits the screens in the US and the UK this month, dramatising the daring rescue of 300,000 Allied troops from the approaching German army.  But as they escaped across the English Channel, thousands of civilians were left to fend for themselves. This is the story of one family. It was May 1940 and Eva Zusman, her husband Stanislas and four-year-old daughter Anita had arrived in the Belgian beach resort of De Panne from their home in Antwerp. They were joined by Stanislas's father and close family. It was a holiday arranged at the last minute to celebrate Eva's return from her hometown of Geneva, where she was visiting her family.  De Panne was ideal for a family summer holiday. White sandy beaches stretched as far as the eye could see.  But the day after their arrival on 10 May, Germany invaded Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. For Anita - who is now 80 and living in Geneva - the news came from a local police warden carrying a drum.  Belgium's resistance did not last long. Thousands of Nazi troops were marching across the Low Countries towards northern France and the coast.  Eva and Stanislas hesitated, aware that as Jews they would be among the first to be targeted in occupied Belgium. After several days they joined others making their way on foot towards France. The pace was slow. Born with a deformed hip, Eva limped heavily while her father-in-law, Abraham, needed a wheelchair. Anita and her cousins, at first terrified of what was happening, were soon distracted by views of the sea and ran ahead.  Stanislas bought a car and hired a young local man to drive the Zusman family towards the border. Once in France, they stopped at a guesthouse to rest.  They left their suitcases in the car and paid for their driver to spend the night at the guesthouse with them. In the morning they were to continue their journey south. Eva would not be separated from the fur coat that she had bought in Geneva the previous winter. It was to accompany her every step of her journey.  In the morning both car and driver had disappeared. Their only means of transport and their belongings had gone.  By 15 May the Netherlands had surrendered to Germany and the Zusman family were on their way to Dunkirk. When they arrived days later, the city felt unnaturally quiet. Bomb explosions could be heard in the distance and smoke was visible to the north. Eva searched for provisions and a place to stay, and found both in a farmhouse on the outskirts of the city.  What happened in Dunkirk was to haunt Eva for many years after the war and she wrote down her memories in her diary.  ""We didn't know that the entire British army was back in Dunkirk as they were trying to escape back by the sea. We spent a terrible night under bombardment in Dunkirk, we didn't know what awaited the soldiers on the beach. Stanis thought we should board one of the boats heading to England too."" By 21 May, British, French and Belgian troops were in effect trapped along the French coast.  A French division had held the Germans near Lille and given the Allies time to gather in Dunkirk, but time was running out. Prime Minister Winston Churchill had called for small private boats and ships to gather along the coast to take part in the evacuation. Stanis and his family joined other civilians fleeing the bombardment. They headed south-east, hoping for a train to take them away from the fighting. Bikes, carts, horse-drawn carriages, trucks, prams, young and old, women and children fled south in whatever way they could.  Nobody knew how long the journey would last or where they would spend the night. More than 20,000 civilians were to lose their lives in France in May and June 1940.  Anita still remembers the warmth of her mother's fur coat. She slept on it and covered herself with it when it was cold at night. It became more of a treasure than Eva could have ever imagined. Then came the separation. Stanis decided to buy a motorcycle with a sidecar.  A young man was found to drive it and Eva was to go in the sidecar with her daughter, while Stanis would follow with his father and his brother's family. Their aim was to head south to Lyon, from where they thought they would take a train. The journey was slow because of the crowds of refugees. Eventually the petrol ran out and mother and daughter continued on foot.  Even now Anita remembers the hunger. They went for days with little or nothing to eat, sometimes buying bread and vegetables from locals. Eva wrote in her diary: ""I will never forget a farmer who gave me an egg for Anita and a lady who wanted to snatch it from me to give it to her elderly husband. I kept it for Anita, I was able to boil it, she ate it very happily and she vomited it straight away."" Most people on the roads slept under trees and in the bushes, but Eva hoped for a safer place.  One night she knocked on the door of a farm, asking for food and a place to sleep. But the farmer was overwhelmed by the number of refugees on his doorstep. Turned away, they sheltered in nearby fields and awoke to the siren of an approaching German Stuka dive-bomber.  Stuka bombers terrified the local population at this time, their sirens a warning of imminent attack. Eva watched the plane dive as it approached its target, its machine-gun spraying bullets everywhere. Then it dropped a bomb and the farm went up in flames.  Eva and Anita ran as far as they could, to escape the heat of the flames, and the danger that the fire would spread to the dry fields nearby.  Eva threw herself on the ground, trying to cover Anita with her own body. What would happen to her child if she died, she thought. It would be better if they died together.  The German checkpoint was barely visible, as so many people were attempting to get through.  Long lines of trucks, carriages and those on foot had found their journey brought to an unexpected stop. Eva had heard rumours that the Germans were coming. But no-one realised that the occupying army was already everywhere.  At the checkpoint Eva came face to face with the first Nazi soldier she had ever seen. Unsure how to address him, she decided on German, to do everything in her power to get herself and her daughter out of the French fields and back to the Belgian capital, Brussels. While Eva had been talking, Anita had been picking daisies and came to her mother's rescue. She handed him the bunch of flowers she had picked and remembers the scene to this day. ""He took me in his arms with the flowers, and told my mother that he had a daughter my age at home. He asked us where we came from and what he could do to help. When my mother said Switzerland, he laughed."" There were no open roads into neutral Switzerland, but he did help get them to Brussels.  As the rest of the queue looked on in envy, Eva and Anita got into a chauffeur-driven German Volkswagen and were taken to Brussels. After six weeks on the road they were finally reunited with Stanis. The Zusmans returned to their lives in Belgium, but as anti-Semitic laws intensified in Brussels, Anita was put on a Red Cross train to Switzerland, and was followed by her mother.  Stanis tried to join them but was caught and eventually murdered by the Nazis at Auschwitz in February 1943.  Nadia Ragozhina is a distant cousin of Eva Zusman and is working on a book on her family's past through the 20th Century. "
Spread to US Treasury,New Covid rescue scheme to pay up to half of wages,2024-09-25,2020-10-22,By Robert Plummer,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54644241,"The chancellor has unveiled increased support for jobs and workers hit by Covid restrictions after growing clamour from firms in tier two areas. Rishi Sunak announced big changes to the Job Support Scheme (JSS) - set to replace furlough in November. He told the Commons that even businesses not forced to shut were facing ""profound economic uncertainty"". Under the revised scheme, employers will pay less and staff can work fewer hours before they qualify. At the same time, the taxpayer subsidy has been doubled. At an afternoon news conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked the chancellor for introducing measures that ""will protect people's livelihoods"". But he warned that the UK would face ""many thousands more deaths"" if it put the economy before health. Businesses in tier two areas, particularly in the hospitality sector, had complained that they would be better off if they were under tier three restrictions.  They argued that although they would be forced to close, they would benefit from greater government support. One prominent chef, Yotam Ottolenghi, had said conditions for his restaurants were ""terrible"" since tier two restrictions were applied to London, adding: ""We are on our knees now."" In response to such arguments, Mr Sunak has now changed the terms of the JSS. Referring to those businesses, he said: ""It is clear that they require further economic support."" Instead of a minimum requirement of paying 55% of wages for a third of hours, as announced last month at the launch of the Winter Economic Plan, employers will have to pay for a minimum of 20% of usual hours worked, and 5% of hours not worked.  The government will now fund 62% of the wages for hours not worked. This more than doubles the maximum payment to £1,541.75 a month. In the most generous case, the taxpayer will now go from funding 22% of wages to just under half. The scheme will, as before, be open to all small businesses and larger businesses that can show an impact on revenues.  It is aimed at addressing the gap in support for businesses in tier two restrictions, such as London and Birmingham, but is not explicitly tied to that status, and is available across the UK. Noel Hutchinson, director of Poole-based powerboat experience firm Get Lost Sailing, is one small businessman who is feeling overlooked by the new measures. His firm is in a tier one area and so is not receiving any support, but he is seeing far fewer customers as a result of the virus. ""Whether or not businesses are in tier one, two or three, they are all being massively affected by the virus,"" he says. ""A hospitality and tourism business such as ours depends on out-of-town visitors and these people are no longer travelling. Our bookings have slowed massively."" Mr Hutchinson feels that a national lockdown would serve him better, since any government support would then be distributed across the country. ""It would be better for our industry if the whole country was locked down at once and every business in receipt of a fair proportion of the support packages."" The scheme is UK-wide. However, the system of tiered restrictions in England, which gave rise to the government's newly increased economic support, is not. While England has a three-tier system, Scotland is due to bring in a five-tier system of virus alert levels from 2 November. The middle three will be ""broadly equivalent"" to the English three, but the Scottish system will add an extra tier at the bottom and one at the top. Wales is about to enter a two-week national lockdown from 18:00 BST on Friday, while Northern Ireland began a four-week lockdown last Friday. All the devolved nations have been promised extra central government funding so they can award grants at a local level. Almost as soon as the heads of the CBI and the TUC appeared on the steps of Number 11 Downing Street to endorse last month's Winter Economic Plan, there were some doubts about its effectiveness.  Business and union leaders were happy that some support for part-time working had been announced - itself a revolution for the UK - but the levels of support fell well short of German-style schemes. In particular, employers faced a hurdle of having to pay at least half of workers' wages.  This was not a bug in the system - it was the strategy. The Treasury wanted the scheme to lean into a process of economic restructuring to a post-Covid ""new normal"" and not seek to prevent those changes. But all that was predicated on the pandemic being on the wane and the recovery assured. That has not proven to be the case, and indeed some had spotted that, even at the time of the original plan. This is an acknowledgement of gaps in that scheme and that large swathes of the economy are in survival, not restructure mode. For the chancellor, this is a sign that he will offer the right support at the right time. Others will say that the data was going in this direction a month ago, and that some jobs have unnecessarily been lost. Hospitality businesses gathered at a south London pizza restaurant also told the chancellor of their need for help with rents from landlords - something the Treasury thinks is far more tricky than, for example, mortgage holidays.  In Greater Manchester, they will wonder why this wasn't offered to areas that were under strong social restrictions earlier. But this is a significant package worth several billion pounds, recognising the economy clearly needs support now before some inevitable fundamental changes. ""I've always said that we must be ready to adapt our financial support as the situation evolves, and that is what we are doing today. These changes mean that our support will reach many more people and protect many more jobs,"" Mr Sunak said. ""I know that the introduction of further restrictions has left many people worried for themselves, their families and communities. I hope the government's stepped-up support can be part of the country pulling together in the coming months.""  Responding to his statement, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds criticised the government for what she said was a ""patchwork of poor ideas, rushed out at the last minute"". She said its approach to support for areas entering tier three had been ""nothing short of shambolic"". In other political reaction, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham tweeted that the new measures had not been ""put on the table"" during negotiations with the government this week that failed to agree a £65m package of support. ""Honestly, can barely believe what I'm reading here,"" he said. The chancellor also announced specific help for hospitality and leisure businesses in tier two areas.  English councils will be funded to give monthly grants of up to £2,100 to 150,000 hotels, restaurants and B&Bs. Devolved nations will be given the equivalent funding for other nations, under the Barnett Formula. The generosity of the self-employment scheme has also been doubled from 20% to 40% of profits, with a maximum grant now of £3,750 over a three-month period. Furlough and redundancy are cutting incomes - and millions of people's finances are not in a position to cope. Some 12 million people in UK have low financial resilience - meaning they find it hard to pay bills or make loan repayments, according to research by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. It found that those from a black and minority ethnic background have been more likely than most to be affected by Covid-related falls in income, with 37% of those surveyed taking a hit. Also, people aged between 25 and 34 were the most likely, by far, to have had a change in employment as a result of the pandemic. That has led thousands of people to take payment ""holidays"" - deferrals on household bills such as rent or energy bills. From 31 October, anyone who arranges a break on repayments of mortgages, loans and credit cards will see their credit record marked - potentially making it harder to borrow more from then on. Business leaders welcomed the changes, with the CBI employers' group calling it a ""big step towards a more standardised approach"". UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls described it as ""a hugely generous package of support and very welcome news just when we needed it"".  She said the changes to the scheme would ""help to safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs"" and give firms ""a much-enhanced chance of being able to overcome the challenges and survive into 2021"". Adam Marshall from the British Chambers of Commerce said it was a ""significant improvement"" for many struggling businesses. But he added: ""The true test of these reforms will be whether they help businesses on the ground get through the difficult months ahead."" Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation think tank, which works to improve the standard of living of low-paid workers, said Mr Sunak had done the right thing by expanding help for companies. ""Doing it earlier, given the obvious flaws, would have saved more jobs, but at least we've got to the right place 10 days ahead of the Job Support Scheme coming into effect,"" he said."

Reigning champion Alistair Chisholm, of Dorchester, Dorset, won with his virtual cry about the mental toll of the pandemic. The contest, which was cancelled last year due to Covid, was held in silence for the first time in its history. Instead of using their voices, criers had to submit 140 words on the topic of ""nature and the environment"". Organiser and Bishops Stortford crier Carole Williams said it was ""a real skill to write a cry that sticks to the theme, that enlightens people, and doesn't bore the audience"". Rawden Kerr, town crier of Great Harwood, Lancashire, came second with Les Cutts, crier for Halifax and Hebden Royd, in West Yorkshire, winning third place. The Loyal Company of Town Criers, which hosts the competition, received hundreds of entries from across the country. Mr Chisolm said he was ""surprised, flattered and delighted"" to win.  ""Clearly the cry that I wrote was judged appropriate for that subject,"" he said. The contest raised more than £1,000 for mental health charity Shout. The last championships to be held in public were in Darlington in 2019. This year's winners were announced on Thursday. OYEZ! OYEZ! OYEZ! Sunshine almost always makes me happy, but sometimes I'm depressed; And I am not the only one, it happens to the best.

Spread to US Treasury,How much of Trump's wall has been built?,2024-09-25,2019-01-05,By Christopher Giles,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46748492,"President Donald Trump is visiting the southern border in Texas to claim success in the construction of a border fence with Mexico. The White House said his visit would ""mark the completion of more than 400 miles of border wall - a promise made, promise kept"". So how much of the border wall has Mr Trump managed to build during his term in office? Various types of fencing totalling 654 miles (just over 1,000 km) were already in place before Mr Trump became president in 2017.  These ran through the states of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The Trump administration say they've completed more than 400 miles of border wall since then.  It's 452 miles (727 km) in total, according to the latest US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) information (4 January 2021).  However, only 80 miles of new barriers have been built where there were none before - that includes 47 miles of primary wall, and 33 miles of secondary wall built to reinforce the initial barrier.  The vast majority of the 452 miles is replacing existing structures at the border that had been built by previous US administrations. President Trump has argued that this should be regarded as new wall, because it's replacing what he called ""old and worthless barriers."" In 2016, President Trump repeatedly claimed Mexico would pay for the wall. This didn't happen.   The US government has paid for the wall, and there've been arguments over how to fund it between the Trump administration and Congress.  In January 2018, Mr Trump asked Congress to pay $18bn (£13.6bn) over the next decade for an initial phase of construction, but the bill ultimately failed. Some money was allocated by Congress in 2018 for projects at the border. However, in 2019 Mr Trump used national emergency powers to divert funds from the Department of Defense after Congress rejected more money for the wall. There has been around $15bn spent for the construction of the barrier coming from various US government departments, including the Department of Homeland Security, and the Defense and Treasury Departments. It was originally estimated a cross-border wall could cost anything from $12bn to $40bn. Despite this, in the run-up to the 3 November 2020 election, President Trump continued to say that ""Mexico is paying for it"". In the past, he's implied that a new trade agreement (signed last year) involving Mexico and Canada would indirectly save the US money, which could be spent on the wall. However, it's not clear how exactly this would work. President Trump also pledged to reduce illegal movement across the border.  The number of people detained at the border increased significantly between 2018 and 2019, but dropped off in 2020. ""The decrease in apprehensions comes as the movement of migrants in the Americas and worldwide has slowed during the Covid-19 outbreak, with governments fully or partially closing their borders to stem its spread,"" according to Ana Gonzalez-Barrera, a senior researcher at Pew Research, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington DC.  President-elect Joe Biden has said that he will not continue further construction of the wall.  He said he would not build ""another foot"" and made clear he opposed taking funds from the Department of Defense.  Instead, the Democratic president-elect plans to focus on using technology along the border to detect illegal activity. Joe Biden's official website says: ""Biden will direct federal resources to smart border enforcement efforts, like investments in improving screening infrastructure at our ports of entry.""  However, it is unclear what the new administration will do with contracts for wall construction which have already been awarded under Mr Trump - but are as yet not finished.

Spread to US Treasury,Nightclubs in NI to close from 26 December,2024-09-25,2021-12-22,By Jayne McCormack,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-59756633,"Nightclubs will have to close from 06:00 on 26 December and indoor standing events will be prohibited.  From then, dancing will also be prohibited in hospitality venues, but this will not apply to weddings. Stormont ministers met for more than four hours this afternoon to agree measures to tackle rising Covid cases. From 27 December, hospitality venues will return to table-service only, with limits of no more than six people allowed to sit together at a table. Again, this measure will not apply to weddings or civil partnership celebrations.  Northern Ireland today recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases - 3,231 - since the pandemic began.  It's understood that Omicron is now the dominant strain of Covid in Northern Ireland and makes up almost 60% of cases. Also from 27 December, people will also be urged to limit meetings inside private homes to no more than three households, but this will be guidance and students returning home will be part of their original household. Sporting events can continue with no limit on capacity but this will be reviewed on 30 December - but there will be guidance to those travelling to and from games not to car share.  The work from home message is to be bolstered, with legislation to require 2m social distancing in the workplace or provide alternative mitigations.  The rules on face coverings will also be strengthened, with some exemptions removed and a statutory duty placed on businesses to promote compliance. Ministers said they will keep the measures under review.  From 06:00 on 26 December: From 06:00 on 27 December: First Minister Paul Givan said the new restrictions were ""balanced and proportionate and based on where we are today"". He added: ""The message is the same, whether it is in regulation or guidance, we appeal to public to follow us and to put into practice those public health messages."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said ministers are working on a financial package to support affected businesses affected and said they would continue to press Westminster for more support. She added: ""This intervention is informed by the medical and scientific advice and it takes account of the wider economic and societal impacts."" She said it was an ""evolving situation"" and that the data will be reviewed ""night and day"". Health Minister Robin Swann said the Omicron surge ""is deeply concerning for us in the health service"". He hinted that limits on funding have prevented Stormont from imposing tougher restrictions. Last week, health officials warned that a ""significant intervention"" could be needed after Christmas. The vaccination and booster programme have been stepped up in a bid to tackle the rise in cases.  Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has tweeted criticism of the executive's decision to close businesses without providing financial support. He said ""it is very disappointing to see Northern Ireland hospitality businesses closing without support in place"".  ""The NI Executive must urgently offer clarity on the financial support available to those affected,"" he added. However, the Department of Finance has previously said that extra Covid-19 funding announced by the Treasury last week was mostly not new money and that much of it already featured in Stormont's spending plans. Stephen Boyd from Thompsons nightclub in Belfast said he ""doesn't feel great"" following the announcement but that it was ""expected"". Speaking on BBC's Evening Extra programme he said: ""I am disappointed because we did put a lot of mitigations in place.  ""We would have been happy enough if they had of said - to get into nightclubs you need a Covid pass and a negative lateral flow - but that is obviously not going to happen now. ""We are going to have to remodel ourselves as a lounge now with table service and that is something we can deal with. ""However, it will be interesting to see if a curfew will be introduced later."" The chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill, said the industry was ""crying out for support"". ""Business owners and staff have been left high and dry about their future over Christmas,"" said Mr Neill. ""Announcing business closure without financial support is contemptable and shows no consideration for staff and business owners."" Fiona Davey, who owns Brunel's restaurant in Newcastle in County Down, said the hospitality industry is ""effectively closed"".  Speaking on Evening Extra, Ms Davey said: ""The amount of cancellations we are seeing is staggering. ""For an industry that is already in a critical state and the lack of staff we have - these restrictions are just creating more problems. ""We're asking the executive for some sort of package to help staff."" Belfast Chamber chief executive Simon Hamilton said the measures were ""unacceptable and unforgivable"". He added: ""As well as having to deal with the impact of additional measures, businesses haven't been offered a single penny in financial support."" Northern Ireland Hotels Federation (NIHF) said the uncertainty of the last month, including ""lack of clarity"" around Covid passports, had taken a ""real toll"". Chief executive Janice Gault said the industry would continue to work with government to ensure support, adding: ""A scheme is being developed, but without intervention from the Treasury, anything of a meaningful nature may not be possible."" Earlier, Wales' first minister announced that groups of no more than six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants from 26 December.  Scotland has also announced new measures to come into force from 26 December and Edinburgh's Hogmanay events have been cancelled. Tighter restrictions are already in place in the Republic of Ireland, where hospitality and cultural venues including pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres have been required to close by 20:00 since Monday. On Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson ruled out introducing new Covid restrictions in England before Christmas.

Spread to US Treasury,Sunak to announce help for shut down businesses,2024-09-25,2020-10-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54475243,"The chancellor will set out on Friday more support for businesses forced to close by law, with tighter virus rules expected in England next week. Rishi Sunak will outline the next stage of the Job Support Scheme to help firms that ""may have to close in the coming weeks or months"", the Treasury says. An update on restrictions, which could see pubs and restaurants shut in the worst-affected areas, is due on Monday. Regional leaders have called for more help for struggling firms. The chancellor is expected to announce the new financial support scheme will be a six-month plan, with a three-month review point. But Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said Mr Sunak's Job Support Scheme was ""forcing businesses to flip a coin over who stays and who goes"" because it was cheaper to employ one worker than two to do the same hours.  The Job Support Scheme, which will replace the furlough scheme from 1 November, will see eligible workers get three quarters of their normal salaries for six months. To be eligible, employees must be in a ''viable job'' where they can work for at least one-third of their normal hours. For the hours not worked, the government and employer will each pay one-third of the remaining wages. This means the employee would get at least 77% of their pay. Nearly three million workers - or 12% of the UK's workforce - are currently on partial or full furlough leave, according to official figures. The current furlough scheme ends on 31 October. But Labour's shadow chancellor Ms Dodds tweeted that the Job Support Scheme ""makes it more expensive to bring staff back than many other international schemes"". She said the cost to an employer of bringing back two workers in the arts sector for half of the week versus one for the whole week was £163 in the UK, compared with £98 in the Netherlands, £69 in France and nothing in Germany. ""Once again it seems like the chancellor has waited to the last possible minute to start listening to Labour and bring in targeted support for those parts of the country under local restrictions,"" she said. ""The chancellor's constant flip-flopping on furlough is putting 900,000 jobs at risk, leaving workers in limbo and creating chaos in the midst of a pandemic."" In other developments:  A tiered system of measures for England is set to be announced by Monday, in an effort to stall rising infection rates, to replace the patchwork of existing rules across the country. Under the new system, different parts of the country would be placed in different categories - although ministers are still discussing the precise details. Pubs and restaurants could be closed in the worst-affected areas, while a ban on overnight stays is also being considered.  Conservative chief whip Mark Spencer has said MPs will be given a vote on the proposed new framework, saying the tiered system was ""being worked on at the moment"". He told BBC Radio Nottingham that ministers and scientific advisers were striving to come up with a ""very clear and easily understood system…so we all know what the aim is"". On Thursday, England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty presented evidence to MPs in a video call that a ""significant proportion"" of exposure to coronavirus was happening in the hospitality sector - but nothing more was shown on the scope, severity, timing or precise location of any new restrictions. But there has been growing anger among MPs and local leaders about the way the government has communicated the proposed changes with them. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham accused the government of treating the north of England with ""contempt"" after he learned ministers were considering shutting hospitality venues in the worst-affected areas in a newspaper report. Mr Burnham said he would challenge the closure of pubs, bars and restaurants if the measure did not come with financial support. He told BBC's Question Time: ""The message I've given to the government is a pretty clear one - there can be no restrictions without support.  ""And if it's going to be the tier three restrictions - effectively a national lockdown - we have to go back to a full furlough scheme for those staff, support for those businesses, otherwise the north of England is going to be levelled down this winter and I won't accept it."" In response, junior minister Gillian Keegan said the government had to act to stem the rise in cases.  ""This is serious - it is getting out of control, and we have to do something to bring it back under control,"" she said.  But she acknowledged that communication with the worst-hit areas needed to improve. There were 17,540 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the UK on Thursday, up from the 14,162 reported the day before, government data showed. A further 77 people died after testing positive for the virus within 28 days. NHS England data published on Thursday showed the number of people waiting more than a year to start hospital treatment is at its highest level since 2008 - with some 111,026 people waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment in August.

Spread to US Treasury,Sturgeon calls for stronger UK Covid restrictions,2024-09-25,2020-09-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-54274055,"Nicola Sturgeon has written to Boris Johnson calling for urgent four-nation talks to tighten lockdown restrictions further. The Scottish first minister cited scientific opinion that stronger action was needed to control coronavirus. Ms Sturgeon also said more financial support was necessary to cushion the impact on businesses.  It comes as the chancellor prepares to unveil plans to minimise job losses as new Covid restrictions come into force. Rishi Sunak is expected to replace the furlough scheme, which is set to expire next month.. In July, about 700,000 workers in Scotland, many in the hospitality sector, were still receiving some or all of their income through the scheme. The Scottish government has already gone further than the Westminster government in introducing restrictions to limit the spread of the virus, by banning different households from meeting inside their homes. As in other parts of the UK, a 22:00 ""curfew"" for bars and restaurants will be introduced in Scotland later this week  - but at her daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday, Ms Sturgeon hinted she believed this did not go far enough. She said if more money had been available to help the hospitality sector it was ""likely"" she would have come to a ""different decision"". In her letter to the prime minister, she said the collective agreement to drive down Covid to the lowest possible level was ""particularly welcome"". But she continued: ""While all four governments announced new restrictions yesterday, there is clearly a significant strand of scientific opinion to the effect that bringing R back below one and the virus back under control will require measures beyond those which any of us have so far announced. ""In my view, there is considerable force in that opinion."" Ms Sturgeon said experience from earlier this year had shown how essential acting ""quickly and decisively"" against the virus had been. ""In other words, if we believe further action will be required there is nothing to be gained - and potentially much to be lost, including lives - from delay."" Ms Sturgeon said the four nations should discuss what further actions might be necessary, what support was required for affected sectors and what arrangements could be put in place to ensure that devolved administrations were not constrained when making what they judge to be essential public health decisions.  The Scottish government has repeatedly called for greater borrowing powers as it seeks to alleviate the impact of the pandemic.  In response to Ms Sturgeon's letter, the UK government highlighted the support being given through the Treasury to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. A spokeswoman said: ""The prime minister held a Cobra meeting on Tuesday which was attended by the leaders of the devolved administrations.  ""This crisis has shown clearly the value of Scotland being part of a strong United Kingdom, with the UK government providing the bulk of Covid testing in Scotland, the UK's armed forces playing a key role in providing support for Scottish communities, and the UK Treasury playing an absolutely critical role in supporting jobs and business across Scotland.  ""We will continue to tackle this pandemic as one United Kingdom."""
Spread to US Treasury,UK to set out plans to tackle coronavirus,2024-09-25,2020-03-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51714703,"Plans to contain coronavirus if it spreads, involving possible school closures, cancelling events and bringing NHS staff out of retirement, are to be set out by the UK government. Unnecessary travel could be curbed and people urged to work from home.  Legislation will be introduced to ensure ministers have the powers to prepare for a widespread outbreak. The chancellor says this month's budget will see help for the health services and economy in the face of the threat. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government was not currently recommending the cancelling of large events such as the London Marathon or school closures, unless this was advised by Public Health England.  However, he said there was a ""significant risk"" of the virus becoming more widespread, meaning further measures might be necessary.  ""There may be things that we have to do down the line that we may not want to, but we will need the powers to do that, hence proposing emergency legislation,"" he told BBC Breakfast. It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday warned there could be ""significant expansion"" in UK cases as the number rose to 39. Should the virus spread further, the government could seek to reduce contact between people as part of a so-called ""social-distancing"" strategy, which would aim to delay the peak of the outbreak until later in the year when the weather is warmer. Ministers will re-iterate that existing powers allow them to limit the use of public transport and ban mass gatherings. But they are expected to stress that, given the social and economic impact of such a move, such measures are more likely to be used to curb local outbreaks than imposed nationwide. A bill that would allow the government to use extra powers to help control the virus is expected to go through Parliament by the end of the month. Rules around staff-to-pupil ratios in education and childcare settings could be relaxed in case of staff sickness caused by the spread of the virus. The plans, to be announced at Downing Street, also include the emergency registration of retired doctors and nurses. Thirty hospitals across the UK could set up designated wards to treat coronavirus patients, with routine treatments cancelled in the worst-case scenario of widespread transmission in the UK. Behind closed doors in government there is a realisation that an outbreak of coronavirus could go on for many months and cause a lot of disruption to many people's lives. Many of us might be asked to work at home. There are questions too about how self-employed people or those on zero hours contracts can make a living. What happens to the local elections in May? Can the NHS, already under a lot of pressure, really cope? There is a lot that neither the public, nor our politicians, can be sure of. The science will guide the approach that ministers take, but that is understandably changing by the day. Boris Johnson's government is certainly no longer in the position of surveying the new political landscape and wondering which of its priorities it can choose to deal with first. Instead, it faces an immediate and highly complicated question it needs to answer. Get it wrong and there could be serious political damage too. Read more from Laura here. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has ordered Treasury officials to work up plans to support the public health response, businesses and the economy in his Budget on 11 March. He said: ""We are well prepared for this global threat and, as the wider economic picture becomes clearer, we stand ready to announce further support where needed."" The prime minister, who will launch the plan alongside England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, said the government was making ""every possible preparation"".  Other measures in the government plan would see:  A public information campaign will be launched later this week outlining how the public can help to limit the spread of the virus, including by washing hands regularly with soap and water. There were four new UK cases announced on Monday, all of whom had travelled to Italy - which has seen the largest outbreak in Europe. They are from Hertfordshire, Devon and Kent and tracing their contacts has started, Prof Whitty said. The latest cases came as the EU raised the coronavirus risk level in member states to ""moderate to high"". The government's plan to tackle the virus, agreed by all four parts of the UK, was finalised at an emergency Cobra meeting on Monday.  As of 09:00 GMT on Monday, the Department of Health said a total of 13,525 people had been tested in the UK, of which 40 were positive. Out of the positive cases, 12 people have recovered.  Globally, about 86,000 people have been infected, with cases in more than 50 countries. More than 3,000 people have died - the vast majority in China's Hubei province, where the outbreak originated in December. "
Spread to US Treasury,Why do truffles taste so weird?,2024-09-25,2015-11-27,Veronique Greenwood,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151125-why-do-truffles-taste-so-weird,"The subterranean fungi can transform pasta, French fries and even honey. But what’s behind its famously funky flavour? Let's face it, truffles are a little bit mysterious. Far more people have heard food writers sing the praises of the knobby subterranean mushrooms than have actually tasted them. And not even all the people who've tasted them feel a rhapsody coming on afterwards. Truffles, as M F K  Fisher writes in Serve It Forth, “may or may not be as good as they are rare and dear”. With the white variety, one of the more rare and dear, going for thousands of dollars a pound at auction, and their charms apparently fading quickly in the hours and days after harvest, is it any wonder that disappointment might rear its head? But the reports from people who have managed to obtain a taste of a fresh, authentic truffle note a very particular flavour and scent. The words “musky,” “garlick-y,” “sulphurous,” and “funky” come up a lot. It's believed that some of the distinctive aroma comes from a molecule called androstenone, a hormone that is also produced by male pigs and whose presence in truffles is said to be the reason that pigs make fine truffle hunters. Not all humans can smell adrostenone, thanks to naturally occurring genetic variety in smell receptors; those who can report it smelling like sandalwood, vanilla, or a bit like urine, perhaps adding to the potential for dissatisfaction with your tagliatelles aux truffes.  Some of the odour may come from a source that you're more intimately familiar with, though – microbes. Bacteria, yeast, and other microscopic creatures are behind a number of scents, including that of sweat, which is odourless until armpit-living bacteria digest a precursor molecule to turn it into one that stinks. And while the origins of truffle smell are still being uncovered, research investigating the microbes that live in and on them suggests that at least one set of truffle odour molecules is actually made by bacteria. So far, what we know about truffle scents comes from sampling the air around the mushrooms, identifying the odour molecules present, and trying to deduce how they were made. The molecules have names like 3-methylbutanal and 2-methyl-4,5-dihydrothiophene, which smell like straw or toast and like onion, respectively. Different truffle species have different assortments of scent molecules at each stage in their lives, and a recent review article examines 35 truffle odorants whose smells range from meaty and dusty to buttery and creamy. Laying out the classes of mushrooms, yeast, and bacteria known to produce these molecules, the researchers note some interesting things. Dimethyl sulphide, for instance, smells sulphurous and is emitted by 85% of truffle species. The mushrooms can generate it themselves, but it can also be produced by Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria, two groups of bacteria that heavily colonize truffles. Other common truffle scents, like 3-methyl-1-butanol, which smells of chocolate and whiskey, and hexanal, which smells grassy, also could be coming from both the colonisers and the colonised. Rarer truffle scents, though, are more likely to be linked to bacteria. In fact, last year researchers reported that the thiophene derivatives, a group of sulphur-containing molecules that contribute to the scent of white truffles, could not be made by the mushrooms themselves. Instead, the molecules were traced to bacteria, which digested odorless molecules to produce them. Treating the truffles with antibiotics eliminated the scent molecules, and the researchers reported that the ability to make them appears to be common to all the truffle bacteria they discovered, suggesting that the molecules may be a by-product of some important biological process. The pungency of truffles isn't just for our entertainment – for the truffles themselves, it may be a matter of life or death. Scientists think that the fact that animals can smell the mushrooms underground and will dig them up suggests that being eaten is a way for the truffles to ensure that their spores are spread far and wide, in the faeces of their devourers. Could it be that some of what animals smell is actually from the microbes, not from the truffles themselves? It's already been shown that fruit flies are drawn to fruit not because of the fruit's own smell, but rather because of scents made by yeast living on its surface. It's a fascinating idea. The authors of the review end by saying that to really understand which molecules come from where, however, researchers will need to obtain truffles completely free of microbes. That is a tall order: No wild-harvested mushrooms will do, and culturing truffles in the lab is, sadly, still beyond us.  Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn and Instagram."
Spread to US Treasury,He picked it up and his heart leapt,2024-09-25,2015-10-17,Lanie Goodman,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20151015-digging-for-treasure-flea-market-finds-worth-a-fortune,"It seemed too good to be true. During their ritual Friday morning jaunt to London’s weekly Portobello Flea Market, Mike Bradwell, a British theatrical director, and Helen Cooper, a playwright and librettist, turned over an unframed watercolour to find the Balthus signature. The asking price? Just £5 ($7.58). In some ways, it was too good to be true. In other ways, it was a particular kind of treasure. “It was a very pretty still life of some fruit on the table,” Bradwell said, recalling that moment. “And when we turned it over, we saw that it was actually a copy ‘in the style of Balthus’ by the famous British art forger, Tom Keating. It turns out his forgeries are also worth a fortune these days, so for next to nothing, we basically bought a very expensive forgery of a great artist.” Keating’s forgeries have been known to command as much as £12,000 ($18,526). You may not always be so lucky, but you can become more skilled in the art of flea market bargains if you know what to look for and how to buy it. The early bird catches the worm Arriving before the crowds is crucial, explained Dutch artist Leo Wesel, who is based in the south of France. Every Monday at 5:30, he heads to Nice’s Marché Brocante, the flea market held in the Old Town on a pretty square behind the seafront. “It’s the best time to scout, while the vendors are still unpacking,” he said. “There are always surprises, particularly if your knowledge happens to be better than theirs.” Wesel, who collects graphics, old paintings, frames and furniture as a hobby, has even found original works by major artists. “A few weeks ago, I saw a tiny signed pochoir by Chagall. I recognised his style immediately and got it for 10 euros ($11.25). It sells for 330 euros ($371) if you buy it online,” Wesel said. Like many avid flea market art or furniture shoppers, extensive reading and documentation have sharpened Wessel’s keen instinct. “I like researching where and when the work was done and what it’s actually worth,” he said “It’s like piecing together a giant puzzle and you learn a lot.” What to look for  If you’re seeking quality bargains in quality vintage clothes or designer cast-offs, “the first thing you need is time and patience,” said Elisabeth Koch, an American millinery designer in Beijing, who regularly shop flea markets for finds. “In China there are lots of markets, mostly indoors, like the six-level YaXiu on Gongrentiyuchang Beilu,” (the Workers’ Stadium North Road), Koch explained. “There’s a lot of rubbish and most of it is new. My best find was a tiny silk embroidered baby hat from the 19th century.” For shoes, Koch always makes sure the sole is leather. “If you see ‘made in Italy’ that’s always a good sign,” she said. Finding treasures While digging through a carton, Dutch artist Leo Wesel found a small, signed lithograph of a vase of flowers by Van Dongen, and snapped it up for 20 euros ($22.50). The same litho, printed on a finer quality of Japanese paper, sells for 1,500 euros ($1,686) at art galleries, he said. Koch also looks inside the lining for designer labels or a stamped logo. “I found a fantastic ’80s D&G yellow belt at the Waterlooplein market in Amsterdam under a pile of grungy clothes,” she said. Shirts and jackets should have all buttons (sometimes there’s a missing button hidden away in a pocket) and they should have working zippers. How to scout the best find To navigate the sprawl of a large market such as London’s Portobello, know the lay of the land in advance. Bargain-hunters should keep an eye out for house clearances, in which vans unload furniture and clothing onto sheets spread on the ground. “I once picked up a grey wool and cashmere Kenzo suit that came out of a heap and had never been worn for £50 ($77),” said Helen Cooper. Trusting your intuition when you see something unusual often pays off.  “I’m always looking for something that is one-of-a-kind and unique,” said Benjamin Wilson, an American who owns an antique store in Hudson, New York. “I love outsider craftsmen who take a particular material and create something isn’t mass produced.” In his early days of collecting, Wilson discovered an innovative New York furniture designer, George Hunzinger (1835–1898), while at the Brimfleld Antique Flea Market in central Massachusetts, the largest show in New England which showcases more than 5,000 dealers. “My first Hunzinger piece was a weird red chair that I bought at very reasonable price. Once I got home, I realised that it was stamped, signed and pressed. I later found out that the Brooklyn Museum of Art has a large collection of his works.” Wilson paid about $900 for it at the time. Today it would fetch $8,000.   “There are no rules. The essence of bargain-hunting in flea markets is that you don’t necessarily know what you’ll end up buying until you see it,” said French hotelier Jocelyne Sibuet, of Maisons & Hôtels Sibuet. How to haggle Once you’ve expressed interest in an item, the protocol on bargaining may vary from country to country, but the price tag is generally 20% higher than what the vendor is actually willing to accept. “If a piece is $200, I might ask: ‘how much room do you have in that?’ If he says, $150, I’ll say, ‘I’ll give you $130 cash,’” Wilson said. “You usually meet in the middle,” said Bradwell. “You say, ‘what’s your best price on this?’ and he’ll say, ‘what’s yours?’”   Customers often start walk away and are called back. If not, you may amble by the stand 15 minutes later. If the piece is still there, you can often renegotiate or settle on the lowest offer, these savvy flea-market shoppers say. “In China, bargaining is a game and not considered rude,” said Koch. The price can go back and from five to 10 times. But the seller will most likely end with the phrase: ‘and don’t forget to come back to my stand.’ And you do.”  What makes a good flea market? Those who get hooked on the thrill of finding affordable treasures often say they enjoy the entire experience. Flea markets are also about exercise, fresh air, and sampling the local street food as you wander from stall to stall. “One reason we love Portobello is because it’s not a poker-faced antique market,” said Bradwell.  “You’ve got the posh end with art and silver, fruit and vegetables in the middle, people selling paella and German sausage, then a first-edition book stand, vintage clothes, and a guy who sells stuffed birds or gramophones with big horns.” Added Koch: “You can get lost in some places like the Waterlooplein Flea Market but that’s obviously part of the fun.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over toour Facebookpage or message us onTwitter."
Spread to US Treasury,The irrationality of panic buying,2024-09-25,2020-03-04,Bryan Lufkin,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200304-coronavirus-covid-19-update-why-people-are-stockpiling,"Amid the coronavirus outbreak, people are flocking to supermarkets worldwide – but are they simply preparing, or irrationally panicking? Last Saturday afternoon, Kristina Moy decided to swing by her local supermarket in the US city of Seattle to pick up some weekly groceries and supplies for her son’s upcoming baseball tournament. What started as a quick errand turned into a three-hour ordeal, navigating checkout lanes packed with hundreds of shoppers stocking up amid the outbreak of coronavirus.  Moy, a resident of Washington state, was well aware Governor Jay Inslee had that day declared a state of emergency following the announcement of the first US death related to Covid-19. “For the most part, people were understanding and relatively calm. But patience was definitely starting to grow thin,” says Moy, who tweeted images of long queues and people with trolleys loaded with bottled water. “Toilet paper and milk were flying off the shelves faster than I could count, and carbonated water was just about empty.” Moy isn’t the only one to experience long queues and empty shelves. Mass demand for rice and instant noodles in Singapore prompted Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to assure the public there was enough to go around. In Auckland, New Zealand, supermarket spending shot up 40% last Saturday compared to the same day a year ago. And shoppers in Malaysia wanting to pad “pandemic pantries” – grocery hoards to fill people’s kitchens until the crisis dies down – have driven an 800% increase in weekly hand sanitiser sales. (All of those places have confirmed cases of Covid-19.) These are the real-world consequences of panic buying – a phenomenon that happens in the face of a crisis that can drive up prices and take essential goods out of the hands of people who need them most (such as face masks for health workers). So why do people do it? Experts say the answer lies in a fear of the unknown, and believing that a dramatic event warrants a dramatic response – even though, in this case, the best response is something as mundane as washing your hands.  The downsides of panic buying With events like looming natural disasters, such as a hurricane or flood, people frequently stock up with emergency supplies. “It is rational to prepare for something bad that looks like it is likely to occur,” says David Savage, associate professor of behavioural and microeconomics at the University of Newcastle in Australia, who’s written about the rationality behind stocking up in a crisis. However: “It is not rational to buy 500 cans of baked beans for what would likely be a two-week isolation period.” This type of behaviour can make shortages worse – like, for example, when Hurricane Harvey hit oil-rich Houston, Texas in 2017. Precautions taken by refineries, as well as eventual flooding, temporarily stalled the supply of petrol and diesel in the US. That was expected, but the problem got worse when people flocked to petrol stations and panic-filled their cars, contributing to a two-year high in petrol prices. Irrational stockpiling can also lead to price gouging, says Steven Taylor, a professor and clinical psychologist at the University of British Columbia, and the author of The Psychology of Pandemics. “If the price of a roll of toilet paper is tripled, that’s seen as a scarcer commodity to acquire, which can lead to anxiety,” he says.   There have been plenty of examples of price gouging in response to Covid-19 – reports have found a 20-pack of face masks costing more than $100 on ecommerce sites such as eBay and Etsy. These high prices have caused companies to put measures in place to stop speculators taking advantage of a spike in demand. On Tuesday, for example, Amazon announced it removed over a million basic-needs products for misleading claims and price gouging. British pharmacy chains Boots and LloydsPharmacy both announced on Tuesday that they would restrict sales of hand sanitiser to just two bottles per customer. The supply of face masks has also been strained. The US government has recommended people stop buying them – not only because surgical masks aren’t sufficient protection from Covid-19, but because there may not be enough for healthcare professionals who need them to do their jobs. The fact that supply-chain juggernaut China is at the centre of the spread of coronavirus has exacerbated panic buying, says Ben Oppenheim, senior director at San Francisco-based infectious disease research firm Metabiota. “A lot of the narrative has focused on the disruption of global production and supply chains. There's uncertainty about whether we'll see shortages in medicines, masks and other consumables, and that uncertainty needs to get clarified and addressed,” he says. The psychology of panic buying There’s a clear difference between disaster preparation and panic buying, says Taylor. In the case of a hurricane or flood, most people have a fair idea of the items they may need in the event of a blackout or a water shortage. But since it’s unclear at this stage just what effects Covid-19 will have, there’s a lot of uncertainty driving this spending. Panic buying, Taylor says, is fuelled by anxiety, and a willingness to go to lengths to quell those fears: like queueing for hours or buying way more than you need. We’ve seen this before throughout history. Back in 1962 during the Cuban missile crisis, when nuclear war seemed imminent, American families filled their basements with enough canned goods and bottled water to survive an atomic blast. Then there was Y2K at the turn of the millennium. Amid fears that a catastrophic glitch when computers’ internal clocks reset to “00” for the year 2000 could crash global markets or send missiles flying, people didn’t just hoard lots of nonperishables and bottled water, but money, too – in 1999, the US Treasury was ordered to print an extra $50bn in the expectation that people would withdraw and stockpile cash. Panic buying helps people feel in control of the situation, experts say. “Under circumstances like these, people feel the need to do something that’s proportionate to what they perceive is the level of the crisis,” Taylor says. “We know that washing your hands and practicing coughing hygiene is all you need to do at this point. “But for many people, hand-washing seems to be too ordinary. This is a dramatic event, therefore a dramatic response is required, so that leads to people throwing money at things in hopes of protecting themselves.” Oppenheim agrees. “It's probably true that panic buying is ultimately a psychological mechanism to deal with our fear and uncertainty; a way to assert some control over the situation by taking an action.” Savage also points to another principle at play: loss aversion. It’s the idea that you don’t want to miss out. “Losing $100 feels worse than winning $100,” he says. “If we later realise that we needed the toilet paper and we didn’t get it when we had the chance, we will really feel bad.” Finally, herd mentality also adds to this behaviour. The experts say the fact that panic buying is happening at all can prompt people to participate. “[Panic buying is] getting excessive play in social media and news media, and that amplifies the sense of scarcity, which worsens the panic buying,” Taylor says. “There’s these snowball effects of a further increased sense of urgency.” “If everyone else on the Titanic is running for the lifeboats, you’re going to run too, regardless if the ship’s sinking or not,” he says. A natural reaction? Some researchers think the “panic” label used can be a bit misleading, however, and that true “panic” is rare, reserved for situations where death is imminent. “Panic is a subjective, emotional state, and mostly what we can observe is the behaviour,” says Oppenheim. “Maybe someone reads articles or a couple of tweets about supply chain disruptions in China and mask shortages in Hong Kong, and then makes a very reasoned decision to stock up on masks just in case. All we can infer from the purchasing is the timing, so it could look panicky even if it's well thought through.” In a 2010 study, Owen Kulemeka of the University of Illinois wrote that panic and antisocial behaviours don’t characterise pre-disaster shopping. Instead, most of these shoppers are simply organised, and “those who delay purchasing cite conflicting information from forecasters and a lack of resources (they fear buying supplies that will be wasted if a storm does not occur) as reasons for waiting until the last minute”. In Hong Kong, some experts posit that panic buying could be what happens when public trust in the government to handle such a crisis hits an all-time low. In addition, there is continuity to how people react to mass crises, says Helene Joffe, a professor of psychology at University College London. “In order to face the threatening unknown, people draw on what they already know about seemingly similar threats,” she says. She mentions how some have linked Covid-19 to Sars, a different coronavirus which generated global headlines of its own back in 2003. She points out that there were fewer cases, but more fatalities proportionately. “So, links to Sars would attenuate [or] dampen one’s sense of risk. Others have linked it to the Black Death, which, of course, would amplify the sense of risk.” The critical ingredient is good information, Oppenheim says. “If we can address public fears and uncertainty, we can potentially reduce panic and last-minute buying.” The alternatives to panic buying A better plan than panic buying would be to be prepared all year round for possible emergencies or crises. It’s also worth keeping everyone else’s needs in mind as these types of events unfold: stock up on what you and your family need, but avoid the urge to hoard enough supplies to fill a doomsday bunker. Because when individual panic buying plays out collectively, that’s what can lead to price gouging, or low supplies for high-risk individuals who need things like face masks more than the general population does. It’s also worth noting that quality sources of information are always vital for avoiding rumours and falsities. In Japan, social media rumours erroneously claimed toilet and tissue paper supplies were running low as China would no longer export these products. To stop panic buying, local officials and industry associations had to make statements reminding people that almost all toilet and tissue paper was locally manufactured and there were plenty of supplies. “Anxiety needs to be acknowledged and managed,” Joffe says. “We do not want complacency, but high levels of anxiety are not useful to prepare [or] prevent catching it.” Perhaps, if you’re feeling compelled to panic buy, it might be worth asking what it is you’re really afraid of. “If people are really getting distressed and anxious about this, then perhaps they should seek out help from a mental health professional,” Taylor says. As for the shoppers on the ground who are just trying to do their weekly family grocery run, Kristina Moy in Seattle says she learned the hard way how to deal with the throngs of panic-shoppers in her community. “Next time, I would definitely wait for the crowds to die down or simply order my supplies from Amazon,” she says. “It was a three-hour experience I really don’t ever want to do again.”"
Spread to US Treasury,England's rare meat-eating plants,2024-09-25,2021-07-26,Jon Dunn,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20210725-the-return-of-britains-meat-eating-plants,"Once common around Britain, carnivorous plants have suffered a dramatic decline over the last century. However, a young ecologist is on a mission to bring these dramatic species back. When I arrived at what's left of the Manchester mosses, fragments of the vast expanses of saturated, lowland peatlands that once formed much of the countryside around Manchester, I found I wasn't alone. I was there to meet Joshua Styles, one of the most inspiring young naturalists of his generation, but instead found two teenage boys smoking weed in a battered VW Polo. We acknowledged one another cagily before they headed back towards town. Few people bother coming out here – at first glance, there's little to see. {""image"":{""pid"":""""}}   Where to see them: Visitors to the Highlands and islands of Scotland may be fortunate to stumble across great sundews, as these remote, wild corners of Britain remain a stronghold for carnivorous plants. In southern England, damp areas of the New Forest support the more commonplace round-leaved sundew. Styles, however, knows better. He's got an eye for the overlooked. Even as a young boy growing up in north-west England, Styles was obsessed with plants. Other kids might have focused on football, but Styles simply had to know the name and habits of every wildflower he could find. In 2017, then a 22-year-old ecology graduate, he founded the North West Rare Plants Initiative (NWRPI), an organisation devoted to halting the decline of the rarest plant species in north-west England. He's a man on a mission, determined to singlehandedly restore the lost plants of this austere, flat landscape, one by one. Chief among these are some of the most dramatic species to be found anywhere in Britain: carnivorous plants. The Manchester mosses were once home to an array of meat-eating plants that turned the tables on the animal kingdom, spurned a vegetarian lifestyle, and preferred their food freshly served, alive and kicking. Styles arrived and wasted little time in donning a pair of rubber boots. Where we were heading on foot wasn't for the ill-prepared – Styles has been reintroducing sundews and bladderworts into a waterlogged wonderland, a recovering landscape of peat bogs and marshes. I understood his caution. To the untrained eye, bladderworts are easily overlooked except when they raise their glorious lemon-yellow flowers above the water's surface. Sundews, on the other hand, glisten and quiver on the surface of the mosses and are as arrestingly beautiful as they are strange. For this reason, the precise location of the reintroduction of these plants by Styles is a closely guarded secret. Plant collectors, like the collectors of rare bird eggs, remain a threat to endangered species to this day. Green-winged orchids became extinct in Cheshire when thieves dug up all the plants at their last remaining site in 1980. Solemnly sworn to secrecy, I followed Styles onto the squelching mosses. ""It's a sad story,"" he told me, ""Great sundews became locally extinct here 150 years ago, and they're endangered across England as a whole."" You may also be interested in:  • England's disputed national treasure  • Australia's remarkable animal discovery  • The UK's forgotten 'fifth' nation The mosses are almost but a memory. Where once there were hundreds of acres of bogs and marshes around Manchester, there's largely now a uniform patchwork of agricultural fields. It may look bucolic, but the loss of biodiversity that came with the draining of the mosses was colossal. Lowland peatlands have acidic, wet soil that's deficient in nutrients, but that's not to say they're sterile. A host of specialised plants and insects can thrive in these conditions and, where plants and insects abound, other wildlife does too. ""Plants are the fundamental basis of all life on Earth,"" Styles said. ""We lose them at our peril. One in five indigenous plant species in the UK are under threat of extinction. Every year, on average, one plant species becomes extinct in each county throughout England."" In the Manchester mosses, chief among those lost plants were a glittering host of sundews, with ruby-red and emerald-green leaves that glistened with tiny, sticky pearls of mucilage, a translucent, sweet substance the plants create at the tips of fine hairs that cover the surface of their leaves. Lured to settle on the leaves, an insect would find itself stuck, unable to fly away from the vegetable glue that entrapped it. The sundews' leaves slowly curl around their unfortunate prey, releasing enzymes that dissolve the insect, releasing the nutrients within. The ground in which the sundews grow may be nutrient-deficient, but there's more than one way to feed if you're a plant who's evolved a taste for animal prey. Charles Darwin, the great naturalist who unlocked the secrets of evolution in the 19th Century, was obsessed with sundews. He grew them for years, conducting experiments involving them and a succession of unfortunate insects. In 1860, he wrote, ""At the present moment, I care more about Drosera [sundews] than the origin of all the species in the world"", a bold statement coming from the author of the seminal On the Origin of Species. However, the story of the sundews, and other carnivorous plants besides that shared the damp surroundings of their north-westerly home, begins some 10,000 years before they caught Darwin's eye, at the time when the bogs of north-west England began to form. On the surface of those early mosses, a tapestry of sphagnum moss and other acid-loving plants abounded and, year by year, added just a little bit more fallen organic matter to the heavy black mass of saturated peat upon which they grew – an incremental accretion of plant material that, thanks to the wet and acidic ground conditions, didn't rot, and instead compressed to form peat, locking millennia of carbon safely in the ground. Peat bogs cover just 3% of the Earth's surface, but they store more carbon than all the planet's forests combined. Yet what took millennia to form was the work of short decades to undo. As Manchester grew as a city, drainage channels cut by man began to bisect the mosses, slowly but surely drying the elevated peat around them. Peat was extracted and sent into Manchester and, in return, Manchester's inhabitants fertilised the drying, nutrient-poor soil. By the 1880s, the city was producing 200,000 tons of refuse annually, 75% of which was coyly known as ""night soil"". Much of this was transported into the mosses and spread as fertiliser on what was perceived to be an unproductive wasteland. In time, much of the former peat bog became fertile, workable agricultural land. Peat extraction, for fuel and compost, continued there well into the 20th Century, by which time 98% of the Manchester mosses had been destroyed. It's only in recent decades that the scale of the loss of habitat and biodiversity has become recognised, let alone steps taken to address it. Lancashire Wildlife Trust (LWT) has spearheaded the drive to save what's left, working with landowners to improve the condition of the fragments of peatlands they own, campaigning for protection of peatland sites and, critically, purchasing key peatlands to protect them from destruction, restore them to their former glory and conserve them for future generations. Thanks to LWT practicing conservation at a landscape scale, Styles has found a stage on which to perform the vital work of returning the small plants that decades of exploitation have destroyed. My arrival there coincided with a monitoring visit during which Styles could see how his precious carnivorous charges were faring after a winter alone in the bog. It's clear he feels personally responsible for their survival – as well he might, having cultivated each introduced plant with the loving care a parent shows their child. But he also has a practical, professional botanist's view of what he's doing here. ""There's a pressing need to conserve individual species and habitats at not only a national, but also a regional level,"" he told me. ""This is an outlook often lacking in the conservation world, where there's a generally strong focus on animals."" The NWRPI champions the overlooked plants that make up the building blocks of the environment. Crucially, Styles is at pains to stress that the plants he reintroduces are part of a considered process, with strong justification of why a reintroduction is necessary, forethought towards the continued management of the area of introduction, and the consent of relevant landowners and statutory authorities. After just a few years, his hard work is already paying off. An early success came with lesser bladderwort, a carnivorous plant that is, despite being a gravely endangered species in England, a frankly unassuming character. It's fully aquatic, forming long straggly strands in bodies of open water. It does, however, have hidden depths. Along those submerged stems are tiny, bladder-like traps that, triggered by a small invertebrate entering them, snap closed in 1/10,000th of a second. Digestion then commences. Working with the Wildlife Trusts and Natural England, in 2018 Styles took five strands from one of the few remaining local populations of lesser bladderwort. He cultivated these and, later that year, the resulting plants were reintroduced into areas of the Manchester mosses managed by LWT. From those five initial plants, in 2019 Styles found the lesser bladderwort forming dense carpets at the initial release site, estimating there to be 29,000 plants. These formed the nucleus for further introductions on the same site and, in 2020, there were more than 200,000 plants thriving there. ""A healthy ecosystem is full of biodiversity and Josh's work really supports that,"" said Jo Kennedy, partnership co-ordinator at Great Manchester Wetlands Nature Improvement Area. ""Who'd have thought that just a few miles from Manchester city centre there would be a whole world of carnivorous plants making a comeback?!"" To Styles' obvious delight, his great and oblong-leaved sundews were doing well, too. It had been a long, cold spring, so the plants were still small and had not yet fully formed the fatally attractive lush clumps of glistening, deadly leaves that will lure insects to a sticky end, but Styles knows each plant individually and was pleased to find they had not only survived since he planted them, but had started to reproduce. ""In 2019, I reintroduced the first 10 plants to the mosses – they've increased fourfold at that one site alone. In total, this year, there are now at least 85 great sundews in the mosses."" And what of the lesser bladderwort, I asked. How's that doing? ""I suspect that we may be over 1,000,000 plants this year, which is grand news. We may need a canoe to investigate all pools properly at this rate… Forget tree planting – peat bogs are where it's at!"" His enthusiasm was infectious and it was easy to be swept along with him. The meat-eating plants of the north-west's peat bogs have found their champion – the revolution will be botanised.

Spread to US Treasury,The clam as large as a human hand,2024-09-25,2023-03-22,Norman Miller,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20230322-toheroa-a-fabled-shellfish-that-nearly-vanished,"Mainly found on New Zealand's North Island, this large clam treasured by Māori coastal communities nearly became extinct due to exploitation. But now, it might be on the way back. As food obsessions go, how about the American who allegedly tried to buy New Zealand in order to gain exclusive rights to a special soup? To be fair, this soup was made from a unique shellfish called toheroa, which had also dazzled royalty and even inspired a jaunty 1980s children's song called Toheroa Twist. ""Everyone in the 1950s lived on toheroa,"" recalled Dargaville Museum committee member Ron Halliday in a 2019 YouTube documentary. ""They were lovely, sweet food – and it gives you a lot of energy."" He spoke of manual workers taking toheroa soup in a thermos to their jobs. ""You could work all day on that."" Toheroa are a clam that grow as large as a human hand and burrow in intertidal sands on just a handful of epic surf-swept beaches – mainly on the west coast of New Zealand's North Island, but also in isolated colonies at places like Oreti, a beach at the nation's southern tip. Succulent and sustaining, toheroa were a legendary delicacy for Māori coastal communities for centuries. ""The toheroa was considered a taonga (treasure),"" said Victoria University (Wellington) researcher Dr Ocean Mercier when she fronted a Project Mātauranga episode, hosted on the New Zealand educational site, the Science Learning Hub. ""[The taste of] raw toheroa is like a really creamy sweetcorn chowder,"" said University of Waikato marine ecologist Phil Ross, when I asked if he had combined his years of scientific study of toheroa numbers and how to bring them back with actually eating them when opportunity arose. Others talk of a gamey taste to a meat that combines pale green body flesh with a long, creamy-white muscly ""tongue"" the animal uses to burrow – and which inspired its name (toheroa means ""long tongue"" in Māori). As well as eating them raw on the beach, Māori also traditionally cooked toheroa in a hāngī (an underground oven) or preserved them on strings of flax to dry in the sun. Dried toheroa were used for trade and as prestige food to serve guests visiting a Māori marae (community meeting house). As the passion for toheroa spread into New Zealand's pakeha (white settler) community, other ways to eat them became popular, with devotees arguing over whether they were best minced up into fritters for frying – with additions like cinnamon or parsley – or turned into a soup celebrating what legendary 1960s TV chef  Graham Kerr called ""the rarest food item in the world"" in a recipe. Māori Robyn Boulter shared her toheroa memories in an evocative 2015 film. ""My first recollection was going down the beach and seeing all these thousands of holes! We used to go down on our horses, jump off, dig them up and eat them just like that. Raw is beautiful."" She was happy to cook toheroa fritters too. ""I have only one recipe. Just toheroa, onion, egg, flour – that's it."" Ross reveals the impact of his own debut tasting. ""The first one I ate was when I went to the beach with a Māori expert who was showing me how to find them. He cracked one open then and there, and we ate it raw. I was a bit nervous but couldn't appear squeamish!"" he said. ""But it was so delicious. And that was first time I really understood why these were so special and so popular."" Though Māori tribes were known to battle each other for access to particularly abundant toheroa beds – the term for sections of beach where large numbers of toheroa gather together in the sand – the key event in toheroa's culinary history came when the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) had his first taste of luscious green toheroa broth on a 1921 visit to New Zealand. So smitten was he by its distinctive taste that he shattered royal protocol to ask, Oliver Twist-style, if he could have some more. This hearty expression of royal approval sparked media coverage across the British Empire, and the dish ""fit for a king"" quickly became a key fixture on New Zealand menus, before spreading across Britain's globe-spanning dominions. Toheroa soup – exported in gaudily labelled cans – was served at both high-end restaurants and humble diners in Britain, considered a favourite comfort food to combat the winter chill. The first toheroa cannery was established in the 1890s at Mahuta Gap by Ripiro Beach – New Zealand's longest stretch of sand – and the 1920s royal thumbs up saw others spring up across the country. From the 1920s to the 1960s, an average of 20 tonnes of toheroa was canned a year. There were dramatic spikes, though – 77 tonnes were put into tins in 1940, for example, partly to supply New Zealand troops heading abroad to fight in World War Two. There was also an explosion in the number of people heading for New Zealand beaches to dig toheroa for themselves. In the 1920s, the daily limit on toheroa was 50 per person, and the shellfish could be taken for 10 months of the year. From the 1950s, as toheroa numbers dwindled, authorities still allowed an open season of two months, but reduced the individual limit to 20 per day. On one weekend in 1966, an estimated 50,000 people poured onto Ripiro Beach like a hungry whirlwind, pulling an estimated one million toheroa from its sands. Toheroa stocks began to collapse – something that still angers Māori rights activists like Paturiri Toautu. ""For us Māori this kai (food) was very precious. They were an integral part of our food source,"" he said. ""But then the pakeha realised that serious money could be made from canning the toheroa and selling it overseas. So they built canneries, and within 20 years, our precious taonga was nearly extinct."" Commercial harvesting was finally banned 50 years ago, and the last ""open day"", when people could plunge into the shallow surf to dig for their own taste of seafood heaven, was back in 1993. Now anyone caught harvesting toheroa illegally faces fines up to NZ$20,000 (about £10,300) or community service sentences – though that still doesn't deter everyone, with the NZ Herald reporting a prosecution as recently as September 2022. Only local Māori can still legally harvest this treasured form of kai moana (seafood) – and only then for special occasions such as tribal meetings or funerals. Serving toheroa also serves as a savoury manifestation of the key Māori principle of manaakitanga: generosity and hospitality that reflects the host's status and mana (prestige). Māori have teamed up with marine biologists to try and restore toheroa numbers. ""Māori have always been scientists,"" explained Mercier in one of her Science Learning Hub broadcasts. ""Our science has allowed us to live, work and thrive in the world for hundreds of years."" This Māori knowledge of the environment and its myriad forms of life is called mātauranga, and its ancient insights have been appreciated by contemporary scientists for shedding light on some of the mysteries of toheroa life. ""Modern science has a surprising lack of knowledge around toheroa biology and ecology,"" said Ross. According to Māori mātauranga, microscopic baby toheroa roam in the water for up to 21 days after birth, before riding the surf foam and onshore winds to get blown into the sand dunes, where they nestle inside a dune grass called pingao (also known as golden sand sedge). After growing inside pingao, when ready to return to the ocean, the toheroa hitch a ride on flowerheads that sea breezes send tumbling from the dunes back down to the water's edge. Today, Māori coastal communities share their ecological insights with scientists who, in turn, show them how to carry out precise data gathering to monitor changing amounts of toheroa on different beaches. A key complement to this research involves educating children about toheroa and the need to change harmful human behaviours. For example, the pakeha love of driving cars on vast beaches like Ripiro may lead to young toheroa being crushed in the sand.  Māori author Betsy Young has combined toheroa conservation work with a children's book due to be published later this year. Written with fellow conservationist James Te Tuhi, The Journey of the Little Toheroa will weave together Māori and modern scientific knowledge. Young told me about joining her first project to enhance toheroa numbers, run by the Māori Women's Welfare League. ""That was the best environment project anyone could have done on the amazing life cycle of the toheroa,"" she said. ""We started a trust after that in 2005, winning many awards and going to schools to share stories about the pingao and its connection with toheroa."" While toheroa numbers remain in a state of flux, there are signs this legendary shellfish may be on the way back. ""I am always optimistic about the future of the toheroa,"" said Young.  She is echoed by Ross. ""They are as abundant as I've seen them in 10 years. And there is a huge amount of young,"" he said. ""So, I'm optimistic that if the environmental conditions are right, the capacity is there for toheroa to recover. The issue is the human element – the need to make big decisions on how we use land.""

Spread to US Treasury,"Pakistan's lost city of 40,000 people",2024-09-25,2022-11-15,Samantha Shea,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20221114-pakistans-lost-city-of-40000-people,"In the dusty plains of present-day Sindh in southern Pakistan lie the remains of one of the world's most impressive ancient cities that most people have never heard of. A slight breeze cut through the balmy heat as I surveyed the ancient city around me. Millions of red bricks formed walkways and wells, with entire neighbourhoods sprawled out in a grid-like fashion. An ancient Buddhist stupa towered over the time-worn streets, with a large communal pool complete with a wide staircase below. Somehow, only a handful of other people were here – I practically had the place all to myself.   I was about an hour outside of the dusty town of Larkana in southern Pakistan at the historical site of Mohenjo-daro. While today only ruins remain, 4,500 years ago this was not only one of the world's earliest cities, but a thriving metropolis featuring highly advanced infrastructures.   Mohenjo-daro – which means ""mound of the dead men"" in Sindhi – was the largest city of the once-flourishing Indus Valley (also known as Harappan) Civilisation that ruled from north-east Afghanistan to north-west India during the Bronze Age. Believed to have been inhabited by at least 40,000 people, Mohenjo-daro prospered from 2500 to 1700 BCE.   ""It was an urban centre that had social, cultural, economic and religious linkages with Mesopotamia and Egypt,"" explained Irshad Ali Solangi, a local guide who is the third generation of his family to work at Mohenjo-daro.   But compared to the cities of Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, which thrived around the same time, few have heard of Mohenjo-daro. By 1700 BCE, it was abandoned, and to this day, no-one is sure exactly why the inhabitants left or where they went.   Archaeologists first came across the ancient city in 1911 after hearing reports of some brickwork in the area. However, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) dismissed the bricks as not having any kind of antiquity and the site remained undisturbed for several more years. It wasn't until 1922 that R D Banerji, an ASI officer, believed he saw a buried stupa, a mound-like structure where Buddhists typically meditate. This led to large-scale excavations – most notably by British archaeologist Sir John Marshall – and the eventual naming of Mohenjo-daro as a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1980. The remains they uncovered revealed a level of urbanisation not previously seen in history, with Unesco lauding Mohenjo-daro as the ""best preserved"" ruin of the Indus Valley.   Perhaps the city's most surprising feature was a sanitation system that was far beyond its contemporaries. While drainage and private toilets were seen in Egypt and Mesopotamia, they were luxuries of the rich. In Mohenjo-daro, concealed toilets and covered drains were everywhere. Since excavations began, more than 700 wells have been recovered, in addition to a system of private baths, including a 12m x 7m ""Great Bath"" for communal use. Incredibly, toilets were found in many private residences, and waste was covertly disposed of through a sophisticated, city-wide sewage system. ""It's a complexity at a level of a city that we would want to live in today,"" said Uzma Z Rizvi, an archaeologist and associate professor at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, who authored the 2011 essay Mohenjo-daro, The Body, and the Domestication of Waste.    The inhabitants of Mohenjo-daro also understood their environment. Since the city was located just west of the Indus River, they built impressive flooding defence platforms and drainage systems to protect themselves from annual floods. Moreover, they were key players in a sea-trade network that extended from Central Asia to the Middle East. For centuries, they produced intricately carved pieces of pottery, jewellery, figurines and other items that ended up everywhere from Mesopotamia to present-day Oman.     Today, the historical site has been turned into a local park, complete with picnic tables and shady, lush gardens. However, travellers from other parts of Pakistan rarely venture to this remote location, and foreign tourism is rare. I meandered about the ancient grid-like streets, taking in the many wells, the high walls that provided much-needed shade, and the covered drains – astounded that this was all engineered many millennia ago.   Mohenjo-daro's ability to master the arts of sanitation and sewage disposal were not the only advanced features that set the inhabitants apart from other early civilisations. Archaeologists have noted the use of standardised building materials, despite a dearth of machines.   ""All the bricks have a ratio of 4:2:1, even if they are not of the same shape,"" Rizvi explained. ""It's important to recognise that all these bricks are following a sensibility of sorts. There's a sense of what they want their city to look like. If you make everything to a ratio, even the spaces that you are walking through then inherently follow a certain sensibility of a ratio as well.""   The bricks – made from sun-drying and eventually kiln firing – have survived the elements for thousands of years. And while ostentatious architecture such as mansions, temples and other indicators of status are notably absent from Mohenjo-daro's design, Rizvi explained that this does not mean that monumental architecture was non-existent.   ""Here the monumentality is really a monumentality of infrastructure,"" she said. Crossing a brick-laden sidewalk that led away from the Upper City, I found myself in the Lower Town, which makes up the majority of Mohenjo-daro's 300-plus hectares and housed the city's thriving neighbourhoods. Organisation was the name of the game here. The dozens of relatively narrow streets spread out in a planned grid with perfect 90-degree angles. The doorways of local homes – including those in bathrooms – utilised thresholds not unlike what you'd find in any house or building today.   ""When you see a threshold, you know that someone has thought about what it means to be inside and outside,"" said Rizvi.   At the Mohenjo-daro Museum, a small building set in a grassy area of the complex, I got further insight into these inhabitants. Hundreds of decorative seals – often featuring a single animal – as well as figurines, jewellery, tools, toys and pieces of pottery have been successfully excavated from the site. Displayed on rows of glass shelves, the relics were remarkably well preserved. Among the artefacts were two sculptures: one a young woman wearing jewellery and an intricate hairstyle; and the other a well-groomed man who appeared to be of high status.   ""This elite gentleman – we don't know if he was a priest or a king – shows us an attention to detail when it comes to physical adornment and physical care,"" Rizvi explained. ""This gives us insight into how [the inhabitants] were treating themselves, their bodies. Clearly, there is an understanding of mathematics. Clearly, there is an understanding of geometry. Clearly, there is an understanding of fashion.""   However, a major detail that could unlock far more about the lives and times of the inhabitants remains just out of reach.   While ancient writings often reveal the secrets of civilisations, this has not been the case with Mohenjo-daro, whose inhabitants used what's known as the Indus Valley Script. ""It was a pictographic language with more than 400 signs. It is still not decoded,"" said my guide Solangi.   What exactly happened to Mohenjo-daro is another mystery yet to be solved.   Collectively, researchers are unsure why exactly the city came to be abandoned sometime around 1700 BCE, though it is widely believed that climate factors played a part. Even so, Rizvi explained, the disappearance of Mohenjo-daro was not an instantaneous one.    ""The city itself did not suddenly evacuate. Around 1900 BCE, you see a shift happen, fewer traces of people living in the city start to emerge in the material record. It's not that everyone is gone, but there are certain neighbourhoods that you begin to see in disrepair. These later time periods do not have the same density of population as earlier time periods. You see the slow movement of folks leaving the city,"" she said.   Now, several thousand years later, the city is once again in danger after devastating super floods hit Pakistan in August 2022. Dr Asma Ibrahim, an archaeologist and museologist who's been involved in preservation work all over the country, confirmed that while Mohenjo-daro had been damaged, the flooding to the site was less than archaeologists had originally feared.   When asked about how Mohenjo-daro can be protected going forward, Ibrahim recommended the use of channels to divert excess water away from the site but stressed that ""a long-term strategy"" is needed.    A lasting plan for the area will not only benefit the archaeological site, but the many locals, like Solangi, who live in its vicinity. From Solangi's home in Dandh village, the stupa is in clear view. ""For me, Mohenjo-daro is a treasure of ancient civilisation. We must protect it for future generations,"" he emphasised.   As I walked along the pathways, I agreed with Solangi's description. I thought of the orderly streets and perfectly cut bricks. The in-ground pool known as the Great Bath. A wide-spread sanitation system that could outperform some of the infrastructures seen in Pakistan today.   As Solangi astutely said, ""Public wealth was spent on public welfare.""   And at least for a while, their investment paid off. Mohenjo-daro thrived, and the inhabitants were able to enjoy living standards far beyond the norms of their time.   Sitting in a clanky autorickshaw on the way back to Larkana some hours later, I couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude. For thousands of years, Mohenjo-daro was buried in dirt and sand, seemingly lost for good in the plains of Interior Sindh.   Yet, thanks to the tireless efforts over the past century of dedicated guides like Solangi and archaeologists, one of the most advanced cities of the ancient world can be walked through once more. And more often than not, you'll get to have the neat, drain-lined streets all to yourself.   BBC Travel's Lost Civilisations delves into little-known facts about past worlds, dispelling any false myths and narratives that have previously surrounded them.   -- Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

Spread to US Treasury,England's criminal mastermind of £650m,2024-09-25,2022-05-11,Jack Needham,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20220510-the-uk-landscape-that-hid-a-criminal-enterprise,"The story of ""King"" David Hartley, whose forgery empire brought the UK economy to its knees in the 18th Century, will soon spread far beyond West Yorkshire. February is as unpredictable as it is breath-taking in Cragg Vale, a village of cobbled streets and immense natural beauty in the sprawling West Yorkshire countryside. A week before I'd planned to trek a five-mile trail known locally as the Coiners route, Cragg Vale was battered by two storms that left flooded rivers and uprooted trees in its wake.   When I finally made it, however, the skies were clear blue and the hills glistened in burnt yellows and rich greens. This is an imposing landscape largely untouched by time, where a handful of wind turbines dotted along the horizon are the only obvious markers of modern life.   I'd come to Cragg Vale to walk in the footsteps of ""King"" David Hartley, who once forged a criminal empire in this part of Yorkshire, a county affectionately nicknamed ""God's own country"". I strolled up steep, forest-covered hills and meandered along bridlepaths lined with wildflowers. Hillside cottages were nestled within the valleys, cocooned from the outside world. Birds sang, brooks babbled and sheep grazed in frost-dusted fields.   These were the same views that inspired Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights and where the only Brontë brother, Branwell, worked the railways. On first sight, there was little to suggest that this expansive patch of countryside once harboured a gang known as the Cragg Vale Coiners, whose counterfeiting enterprise in the 18th Century took on the establishment and brought the Bank of England to its knees.   At the time, ongoing trade between England, Spain and Portugal meant both English and foreign coins were accepted as legal tender in England. In this, the Coiners found an opportunity, albeit an illicit one.   These coins were made from valuable metals, more or less worth their weight in silver and gold. The Coiners, led by Hartley, clipped edges from these coins, shillings and moidores usually bought from local traders who would get a cut of the profits, and melted the clippings with metal scraps to forge counterfeit coins. Portuguese moidores were commonly forged because they were the most valuable, worth around 27 shillings a piece, roughly a week's wages.   This enterprise wasn't a small fry operation. It was once the biggest fraud in British history, with some estimates saying that £3.5m of fake coins were paid back into circulation, reducing the currency's value by 9%. Today, that sum would be around £650 million. While the gang were known to murder those who crossed them, they also enriched – and were protected by – their community, robbing from the rich to feed the poor locals, who would gift David his ""King"" moniker. Hartley's brothers and fellow gang members, Isaac and William, were duly known as the Duke of York and Duke of Edinburgh.   Today, Hartley's story has become local legend and is almost folklorish in its infamy. But this northern England enclave is rife with strange history and tall tales.   Standing tall atop a 1,300ft hill in the Upper Calder Valley – made up of small towns and villages such as Hebden Bridge, Todmorden and Mytholmroyd, as well as Cragg Vale – is Stoodley Pike, a 121ft spiked monument originally completed after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 as a tribute to peace. By calamitous chance, the pike toppled just before the Crimean war was declared against Russia in 1854.   Placed outside farmhouses and churches are centuries-old human heads carved out of stone, once thought to ward off magical spirits. Todmorden, meanwhile, is a hotbed of alien conspiracies and purported UFO sightings, mainly fuelled by the 1980 death of coal worker Zigmund Adamski, who was discovered 20 miles away from his home covered in a non-identifiable, slimy goo. His case remains unsolved.    ""The perfect conditions for folklore is an area where there are separate communities in good communication with each other, economic interdependence and a distinct landscape,"" said John Billingsley, an author and folklore historian.   ""Everybody here is close enough to be drinking in the pubs with each other,"" he continued. ""That keeps stories circulating and gives a sense of identity. The Coiners came very strongly with that sense of local community, the people who they were doing a 'Robin Hood' job for.""   Opinion is divided when remembering the Coiners. Some believe they were simply products of their time, hard men for hard times. Others believe they were nothing more than criminals.   ""All societies have their outlaws,"" added Steve Tilston, a folk musician and Hebden Bridge local who chronicled the story of the Coiners in the song The King of the Coiners. ""It's the stuff of folk legend, a desire to have someone who will put one over on 'the man'. [Outlaws] are not just total villains, they manage to cock a snook at the people in charge. And in Hartley's days, corruption ran rife. As, dare I say it, it does now.""   The scenery of the Calder Valley, much like some of its attitudes, has largely remained untouched since Hartley was alive. ""This area has not changed an awful lot since those days,"" said Tilston. ""This is where Hartley and his cohorts would have trudged. They would have looked out at the same views as we do today.""   To guide me through where Hartley ""trudged"", I met up with local cartographer Chris Goddard. In 2018, Goddard devised the Coiners route, which spans many of the locales frequented by the gang, some based on historical fact, others mythologised by Goddard on his many walks through the Calder landscape.   Our walk began in Mytholmroyd, where the gang regularly plotted their moves over pints of ale. From there, we weaved our way through dense, ancient forest, dredging up steep slopes and wading through fallen leaves. We wandered through a small lagoon unofficially known as ""David's Pool"", where the gang leader may have once bathed; and, around a mile later, reached the sprawling moorland of Broadhead Clough. Alone, at the apex of the hill, stood Bell House, Hartley's original home and very much the gang's illegal hub. Placing a hive of treasonous activity in plain sight seems somewhat counterintuitive. But the landscape protected him, said Goddard. ""Being here, Hartley could see everything.""   A stone's throw from Bell House was Lumb Hole Falls, where, from a giant boulder overlooking the valley below, it's rumoured Hartley would stand to regale his cronies . As we continued, we met a woman sitting on a bench looking at an expanse of green where, in the spring, bluebells will appear.   ""They did a really good job around here,"" she said, after we mentioned the Coiners. ""It brought the treasury down in London… something needs to bring them down,"" she said, her tone suggesting that a north-south divide still exists in this part of England.   ""People around here could eat meat, they could get proper clothing,"" she added. ""People say they were rough, but it was a rough time. Good on him. If I'd have been there in those days, I'd have done the same. It was survival.""   And survive the gang did, but it was on borrowed time.   As the gang's riches grew too big for higher powers to ignore, the Houses of Parliament were drawn into a debate over their affairs. The final straw came on 8 November 1769, when several members of the Coiners murdered an excise officer, William Deighton, who was sent to investigate them.   Five days after the murder, a royal proclamation issued a £100 reward to anyone who could name the perpetrators. Dozens of arrests were made, and the once tight-knit group began to implode. Members turned on each other to save themselves. Some escaped justice, like David's brother Isaac, who died in his 70s or 80s. By the end of the year, however, Hartley was arrested. And on 28 April 1770, he was hanged at the Knavesmire Tyburn near the city of York.   For reasons that remain unknown, Hartley was afforded a burial not befitting of a person sentenced to death in the 18th Century, a time when criminals could be hung, drawn and quartered. After execution, his body was released from York and hauled 60 miles to the St Thomas à Becket Church in Heptonstall, West Yorkshire, where he was buried in the church's consecrated grounds.   And that is where the King remains.   The church today is a roofless ruin, built between 1256 and 1260 and mostly destroyed through time. The poet Sylvia Plath is buried in the same churchyard; when I visited, her grave was adorned with flowers and the soil pierced with pens and pencils left in tribute. Hartley's was little more than a stone in the ground, laid flat amongst a mosaic of other weathered places of rest.   But Hartley's name lives on, both etched in stone and in his descendants.   ""Legendary is probably a good word to use for him,"" said Steve Hartley, the five-time great-grandson of David Hartley.   Steve's family history was controversial growing up, and he remembers how his great-grandad rarely spoke of Hartley's escapades. ""The older generations were ashamed of it,"" he said.   Some still echo those sentiments. Tilston remembers how a Heptonstall museum curator once told him that Hartley's crimes made him unworthy of burial at the church.   Nevertheless, the Hartley tale is soon set to spread far and wide. A TV adaptation of the Benjamin Myers novel The Gallows Pole, a part-fictionalised telling of the Coiners story, is currently in production. Tourism to the Calder Valley will likely follow. ""It will be like Peaky Blinders. Everyone will want to know about the real Yorkshire Coiners,"" Steve said, referencing the Birmingham tourism boom sparked by the crime drama series.   It seems that there are two sides to the coin when remembering David Hartley: revered or reviled. But there's also something intrinsically human in why his story continues to be told, according to Billingsley.   ""Folklore has this ability to bring people in, to embrace people without them really knowing it,"" he said. ""It's a search for origin, and a validation of one's own place. There's a strong element of that in the community here today. People who are looking for meaning and connection.""   -- Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

Spread to US Treasury,A Central Asian alternative to parmesan,2024-09-25,2021-04-27,Aliya Uteuova,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20210426-qurt-a-kazakh-cheese-of-resilience,"A Central Asian dry cheese made of fermented milk, qurt is a versatile treasure of nomadic people's ingenuity. As a child in newly independent Kazakhstan, I yearned to snack on candy bars, soft drinks and anything foreign and packaged. Instead, my mother would buy salty, sour snacks that resembled white chocolate truffles, but were in fact hardened balls of sour cheese. At local bazaars, I'd see aunties cheerfully selling small batches of these homemade goods packed in cellophane. A Central Asian dry cheese made of fermented milk, qurt is a versatile treasure of nomadic people's ingenuity. There are variations of names for this food, including kashk in Iran, chortan in Armenia, and aaruul in Mongolia, as this calcium-rich, protein-packed snack accompanied travellers along the Silk Road and beyond. But the origin of qurt is the road itself. Born out of necessity, the nomadic people of Central Asia carried horse, sheep or camel milk in animal-skin saddle bags called torsyk. Journeys across the vast steppe provided a perfect setting for fermentation to take place inside this vessel, and the galloping motion of the horse gave a churning effect that separated the milk into curds. These curds, drained, dried and lightly salted, packed all the nutrients of the liquid dairy product into a solid, portable food. This by-product of milk born on the Silk Road has been a staple of strength and resilience to Kazakhs and others ever since. You may also be interested in:  • A wild ride across Central Asia  • The Swedish cheese that can't be moved  • Is Uzbek cuisine actually to die for? While Kazakhstan's nomadic way of life mostly dissipated after it joined the Soviet Union in 1920, its ancestral recipes remain. Today, along with kumys (a cold fermented dairy drink), qurt is eaten either as a snack or dissolved in water or broth, adding a rich and creamy sourness to drinks, soups and stews. Its milk protein content of choline and methionine along with calcium makes the nutritious snack popular among young children and the elderly. Some people shave qurt over salads and pastas as a cheaper, locally sourced alternative to parmesan, and parents give sweet, dried-fruit versions to their kids instead of candy. The demand for qurt spikes around 21-23 March, when people celebrate Nauryz (spring New Year). But whether qurt is eaten as a snack or for a special occasion, ultimately the reason Kazakhs buy it is to get a taste of home. Qurt is traditionally prepared by combining a yoghurt-like fermenting agent with freshly boiled milk. Up until the early 20th Century, when the majority of Kazakhs lived in yurts spread over pastoral lands, people would gather together to make large batches of the cheese, wishing for prosperity and hoping that their families would persevere through the harsh winter. Though some Kazakhs continue to maintain a semi-nomadic lifestyle, today homemade qurt is usually prepared in modern-day kitchens during spring and summer when livestock are grazing and milk is abundant. The boiling process starts in the morning, and by the afternoon, the reduced milk by-product is rolled into small balls that are placed in woven reed baskets to dry in the sun and wind. The end result is lightweight and thus easy to transport, and can last for years without refrigeration. When eaten fresh, up to a week from making it, qurt has a soft consistency and a subtle flavour. The longer it dries, the harder it gets. According to Kazakh ethnographer Aigerim Musagazhinova, properly prepared qurt shouldn't be so dry that it's impossible to bite. ""It should be dry on the outside but when you bite into it, it's soft, tender and fresh,"" she said. Perhaps the most commonly described taste of qurt is associated with salt and acidity. ""When we even talk about [qurt] we get a similar sensation in our mouth as you might when thinking of lemons,"" Musagazhinova added. Musagazhinova recently published a book that features more than 50 lost recipes and traditions of Kazakh cuisine. Her extensive, 13-year research included two years of field trips to every corner of Kazakhstan, where she interviewed the custodians of culture and tradition in their homes. Musagazhinova distinctly remembers that nearly every family would lay qurt at the table as an accompaniment to the meal. ""I'd grab two or three pieces of it for the road, and to this day I carry qurt in my bag even when I'm not travelling,"" she said. Indeed an 1872 historical account of Kazakhs by the Russian Empire's ethnographer and translator Shagimardan Ibragimov notes how Kazakh riders would tie a pouch filled with qurt to their saddles. ""It is such a unique product that saved Kazakhs from the famine [1919-1922 and 1930-1933] which is why I believe it's in our genetic code,"" Musagazhinova said. ""During the early days of the pandemic, and still, the demand for qurt rises,"" she added. ""People searched for qurt and kumys, which is telling of their beneficial properties."" Beloved across the nation, qurt is often prepared with camel's milk in western Kazakhstan, where camel breeding is prevalent. In northern Kazakhstan it is common to find qurt with added berries, dried fruit and nuts, which are common to the region. In the south, due to the hot climate, plenty of salt is added to preserve it. And qurt's size and shape vary depending on the hand preparing it. ""My grandmother would make it in a way that her fingerprint would leave a mark on each one,"" said Zhanslu Zhienbayeva, a large-scale qurt producer from northern Kazakhstan. She remembers being 10 years old and asking her grandmother to be neater when rolling the cheese. As she grew up and got a knack for making qurt herself, she realised that the dents left on them aided the drying process. Zhienbayeva's memories of making qurt with her grandmother are imbued with nostalgia. The youngest of five children, she would climb onto the roof of her home with trays of rolled-out qurt under a cheesecloth. After a few hours of drying in the sun, she'd pass the qurt to her grandmother to determine if it was ready. ""For me this cheese is a link to my ancestors,"" Zhienbayeva says. ""When I make qurt I can feel my grandmother's presence. As qurt became my livelihood, its value to me is priceless."" Qurt's legacy goes far beyond beloved family traditions. One of the best-known stories about qurt took place in a WWII labour camp – today a museum named ALZHIR – in northern Kazakhstan's Akmolinsk region for the wives and children of Russian and German prisoners of war. According to a story told by one of the camp's German prisoners, Gertrude Plaitas, whose memories were later written into a poem by Raisa Golubeva, locals would see these women and children working in the fields and, saddened by their plight, they would throw pebble-shaped pieces of qurt at them. At first the prisoners thought that locals were throwing rocks out of malice. But later they realised that these rocks were edible, helping the prisoners survive another day. ""When I first read the poem, I had tears in my eyes,"" said Zhienbayeva. It inspired her to travel to the camp museum, where she heard the story once again, picturing the women who would go to work hungry during a harsh winter. ""Women had to lay and hide in the stems of sage, and one woman sensed the dairy smell,"" Zhienbayeva told me. Today, new takes on the salty snack are bringing it onto supermarket shelves in vacuum-sealed packages. One of the people doing that is Nagima Zharylkasymova. A former primary school teacher, she took her fourth-grade students to a farm in Shymkent that produced dairy products, among which was qurt. ""They got to see the animals, the process of preparing it, and their curiosity rubbed off on me,"" Zharylkasymova said. Now retired from teaching, she runs a small qurt business with her four daughters-in-law, putting a spin on the traditional product by producing the balls in green, orange and purple hues, derived from sorrel, pumpkin and beetroot extracts that add extra nutritional value to the snack. ""My unique and colourful qurt immediately stands out at weddings and celebrations,"" she told me with great pride. The matriarch of the family, Zharylkasymova knows the importance of connecting over traditional foods. Each day, she rolls out qurt with her 14 grandchildren, who nibble on the crumbled pieces. They talk about their days, her grandchildren asking their grandmother about the cheese. ""I get so happy because my grandchildren are understanding the hard work their grandma does, and they're forming a connection with me,"" Zharylkasymova said. This sense of connection has become more important to me as I, too, have got older. So many times, at dinner tables and celebrations, I declined this small, sour token of tenderness. My childhood desire for everything foreign led me to New York City, the land of gastronomic exploration. But every so often, as I yearn for home, I get a familiar sour taste in my mouth. I think of my grandmother who'd sneak it in my meals, of my classmates who brought it to share during recess and of my ancestors who journeyed across the steppe carrying this ingenious, versatile cheese.

Spread to US Treasury,"A 2,200-year-old secret inside a tart",2024-09-25,2023-06-09,Anna Bressanin,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20230608-the-italian-tart-that-tricked-the-pope,"Some say Rome's ""Crostata di ricotta e visciole"" (ricotta and sour cherry tart) symbolises Jewish ingenuity and resilience in the face of oppression. But there's more to the story. In Rome, even something as proverbially simple as a ""piece of cake"" – or tart – can have hidden layers of history, resilience and even mischief tucked away between the crust and the cream. The iconic Crostata di ricotta e visciole (ricotta and sour cherry tart) is the perfect example – with a creamy layer of sweet whey cheese, generous coating of jam and thick shortcrust concealing a secret. ""It is a stratagem, a work of trickery,"" said Ruben Bondì, a Roman Jewish chef, who became famous for his TikTok and Instagram videos in which he leans out of a balcony and asks his neighbours, ""What do you want to eat?"" He then prepares anything from salt cod roll sandwiches to zucchini risotto in a makeshift kitchen set up on top of an air-conditioning unit, often with the help of his little nephew, cousin or sister. The art of doing a lot with a little is at the heart of most Roman-Jewish recipes. But the case of the Crostata di ricotta e visciole goes one step further in ingenuity. Ruben, whose recipe for the tart is featured in his new book, Cucina Con Ruben, believes that it was designed to bypass an absurd ban on selling cheese and dairy products imposed on Jews by the Vatican in the 18th Century as outlined in Chapter XXIV of Pope Pius VI's Edict Concerning the Jews (1775). ""Why cheese?"" one might wonder. ""It's just another item in a long list of humiliations,"" explained Vatican expert Iacopo Scaramuzzi. The Church believed that Christianity had to replace Hebraism, and they did all they could to make Jewish people's lives impossible. Silversmiths were not permitted to forge menorah, the nine-branched candelabra used for religious rituals; Jewish men and women had to wear a piece of yellow cloth stitched to their hat similarly to when Jews were forced to wear the Star of David during World War Two; they couldn't talk to Christians; and they couldn't light the traditional torches used to honour their dead on the way from the synagogue to the cemetery during funerary rites. They were also banned from many business pursuits, including the selling of cheese. That's when Jewish bakers supposedly came up with a Trojan horse strategy for their Crostata di ricotta e visciole. As Bondì explained, they covered the normally open tart with a top layer of dough, so that no one could see the ricotta from the outside, and they could sell it without fear. And its story has come to symbolise Jewish ingenuity and resilience in the face of centuries of oppression. Except that this might not be true. ""It's absolutely not true! It's a cake that my grandmother invented about 65 or maybe 75 years ago. That pope thing has nothing to do with it,"" said Sandra Calò, one of the six women who run Pasticceria Boccione, the only Roman pastry shop where you can buy the original Crostata di ricotta e visciole. The shop faces the main piazza of the Ghetto, once an insalubrious enclosed area where Jewish people were forced to live, and now an elegant neighbourhood in the heart of the city, between the Tiber River, the Pantheon and Campo de' Fiori. Boccione's ochre walls are peeling and there is no shop sign above its two arched windows, but it is so popular that people line up well into the middle of the piazza to buy their pastries. The online reviews of the shop are virtually unanimous: Romans and tourists alike love the tarts, though some are slightly intimidated by the ladies' hasty customer service. ""Boccione is the symbol of confident and casual Roman Jewish pride: the beauty of being who you are and being respected for what you do,"" said my friend Karen Di Porto, a film director who grew up eating crostata in the main square. ""Maybe the chefs are not the most obsequious, and they have always worked in that same little shop, but they carry on a grand tradition of exceptional desserts."" For over 200 years, Boccione has been run by women, and it's much more than just a history of pastry. ""They deported all of my grandmother's family,"" she said, referring to the Nazis during the Holocaust. ""Seventeen people – her brothers, her sister with her husband and their five children… everyone."" During World War Two, her grandmother, Graziella Limentani, was hiding, pregnant and with a four-year-old daughter, in the house of a Catholic woman in the Roman neighbourhood of Primavalle. She was told to leave because it was becoming too dangerous, but her host fell sick and became dependent on her. So Limentani stayed hidden there and survived. Her husband, who kept his market stall in Piazza Vittorio, was deported in April 1944 on his way to work. ""Before the war, there were many pastry shops like ours in the Jewish quarter, you know?"", said Calò. ""After the war, between those who were deported, those who closed their shops and who didn't reopen, we were the only ones left"". Graziella asked a young cousin to mind her newborn baby and daughter during the day, and she took over the pastry shop, with the help of her brother Settimio. She worked there until the age of 92. According to Calò, her grandmother came up with the recipe right after the war, when Italy was trying to get back on its feet. When I mentioned that their tarts are considered the best in Rome, she replied: ""Tesoro [literally ""treasure"" but is used similarly to ""honey"" or ""sweetie"" in English], it's not that we do it better. We were the first ones to do it. The others can copy it, but obviously it will never be the same"".  Calò has two pro tips, one for baking and one for tasting: the more you brush the top layer with egg, the more it darkens; and remember to eat the tart while cold to taste the true flavour, the perfect mix of mild creaminess and fruity zing. But she also told me that she, her sister, her three cousins and aunt don't have a written recipe. ""We have everything in our head,"" she said. Calò's story about the tart's origins is inspiring, except for the fact that it may not be completely true either. ""There are no records, only clues,"" said Claudio Procaccia, historian and Director of the Culture Department of the Jewish Community of Rome. He believes that sour cherries came from South-Eastern Europe and Asia and most likely were brought to Rome by the first Jews who settled in the capital between the 2nd Century BC and the 1st Century AD – first as ambassadors, merchants and freed slaves, and later as prisoners during the first Jewish-Roman war (66-73 CE). He believes that the tart was created sometime afterwards as a result. ""It's a long story that begins with an alliance, an occupation, and finally, a war and the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem"", he explained. According to Claudio, this tart – with its union of ricotta, the most typical of Roman cheeses, and cherries from the East – is a metaphor for the ancient relationship between the city of Rome and its oldest religious group, where each layer remains distinct while enriching the other. The idea of Jewish bakers making this tart as a response to an 18th-Century ban also doesn't make sense to him. ""What [the papal edict] truly says is, 'look, don't try to be smart'. It's not that you can buy milk for fillings and cakes and then resell it,"" he said. He believes that the edict addressed a custom that must have already been widespread: the practice of hiding cheese or other goods in order to sell them. ""Certainly, [these tarts] are something the Jews were already doing, probably like many other things they would do under the table in defiance of bans and restrictions. You don't ban something unless someone is already doing it."" Nevertheless, without documents or records we'll never know for certain how the Crostata di ricotta e visciole came to be. Whatever the truth, these tales of resilience and survival in times of struggle all share the wish to marry two cultures, like sour cherries and ricotta, in a tasty promise of life. As we were walking to the market, Karen told me that she didn't know much about the complicated history of the Crostata di ricotta e visciole, but that she grew up feeling that she was a part of a special world owned by her people. ""Only later I understood the discriminations that the Jews of Rome had suffered over the centuries,"" she said. ""But even in difficult times, we were together in the piazza. And it's that air of community that I have always breathed."" Crostata di ricotta e visciole (Ricotta and sour cherry tart) recipe By Ruben Bondì Makes one 26cm-round tart Ingredients For the shortcrust pastry: 150g (10½ tbsp) cold unsalted butter 130g (⅔ cup) sugar 1 lemon, zested 1 whole egg 2 egg yolks salt to taste 400g (3¼ cups) plain, or all-purpose flour  For the filling: 800g (28oz) sheep's milk ricotta 170g (¾ cup) sugar 1 lemon, zested (optional) 400g (14 oz) sour cherries jam To brush: 1 egg, beaten milk to taste Method  Step 1 Start by preparing the shortcrust pastry: in a standing mixer, the cold butter into small pieces with the sugar and grated lemon zest. When you've obtained a creamy texture, add the whole egg and the yolks and continue working the dough. Add a pinch of salt and the flour and mix well, until you get a smooth mass. Step 2 Divide the dough into two equal parts. Using a rolling pin, roll each piece of dough between two sheets of baking paper, until you obtain two discs with a diameter of about 30cm (12in), 5mm (¼in) thick. Leave them in the refrigerator for 30-40 minutes to firm up the pastry. Step 3 Now prepare the filling: put the ricotta in a bowl and mix it with the sugar. If you like, you can add flavour to the filling with grated lemon zest. Step 4 Preheat the oven to 165C/325F. Line a 26cm (10in) diameter and 4cm (1½in) high cake tin with a sheet of baking paper and place one of the two discs of shortcrust pastry inside, trimming the excess pastry along the edges. Prick the bottom and sides of the dough with a fork, then pour the cherry jam inside and spread it well. Pour the ricotta and sugar mixture over it and cover it with the second pastry disc, sealing the edges well. Step 5 Brush the surface of the tart with the beaten egg and a bit of milk and bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes until the tart is golden. Before serving, let the tart cool completely.

Spread to US Treasury,A radical plan to tackle obesity,2024-09-25,2018-11-19,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20181113-bittersweet---whos-benefitting-from-the-sugar-tax,"Has a radical plan to help this country kick its sugar habit finally paid off?    Ryan Allen put one foot on his accomplice’s shoulder and hoisted himself onto a bronze horse statue in the centre of Royal Exchange Square in Glasgow in Scotland. Passers-by filmed the spectacle on their phones as he saddled up behind the bronze of the first Duke of Wellington. “There was adrenaline. It was technically illegal,” he later said. “It was just a sense of relief and accomplishment when I got up there.” For more than 30 years, local pranksters had decorated the monument with traffic cones. Now in July 2017, from his seat behind the ‘Iron Duke’, Allen triumphantly crowned it with one of his own. He considered his act righteous and necessary, emulating the Duke’s own fighting spirit. But Allen’s cause wasn’t land or liberty. It was fizzy drinks. Painted in the orange and blue style of his favourite Scottish beverage, the cone was inscribed with one simple demand: “Bring Back Real Irn-Bru.” Three months earlier, the UK government brought in a so-called ‘fat tax’, a multi-tiered levy on sugary soft drinks - the latest effort to curb dangerous levels of obesity. Public Health England (PHE) hoped to push companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Red Bull to reformulate their products in ways that encouraged lower and less frequent sugar consumption. If they failed to change their recipes before 6 April 2018, the tax would go into effect and retailers would be forced to raise prices. Most opted to change the recipes of their popular drinks. The Soft Drinks Industry Levy, also dubbed the ‘sugar tax’, seems to many in the UK like a sensible idea. But for lifelong lovers of fizzy drinks like Allen, it’s a direct assault on his culture. To him, less sugar in the iconic Scottish drink means less flavour. In July, the message on his traffic cone was clear. How does a place like the UK respond to going cold turkey? To understand the scale of its sugar addiction you need to look at the next generation - 20% of Year 6 children (aged 10-11) are obese. Some 26% of adults are classified as obese in England. Can a tax really be used to promote cultural evolution? And if it can, what’s the best way to measure its success? Click or pinch to zoom on mobile. A dire prognosis The UK government debuted ‘Childhood obesity: A plan for action’ in August 2016, a comprehensive report produced by the PHE outlining the obesity epidemic and several paths toward a healthier future. PHE found that nearly a third of children age two to 15 were overweight or obese, and that people were becoming obese earlier in life and staying obese for longer. “The economic costs are great, too,” the report cited. “We spend more each year on the treatment of obesity and diabetes than we do on the police, fire service and judicial system combined.” PHE found that the National Health Service (and therefore every UK tax payer) spends £5.1bn ($6.6bn) on weight-related medical services a year. In 2018, the estimate climbed to £6.1bn ($8bn). Among its long list of solutions was the levy on sugary drinks. Teenagers in England, the biggest consumers of such drinks in Europe, could max out their recommended daily intake of sugar with a single 330 millilitre (ml) can. The time had come to tackle one of the underlying sources of the problem. Then-Chancellor George Osborne announced the tax during the 2016 Budget Statement. The government would wait two years before implementing it to give manufacturers time to adjust their formulas. Companies that refused to reduce sugar would be taxed in two bands. Drinks with more than 5 grams (g) of sugar per 100ml would face a tax equivalent to 18p per litre ($0.23). More than 8g would add a 24p tax per litre ($0.31). The expected yearly revenue was about £500m ($650m), which PHE said would be invested in obesity-reduction programmes for children. Click or pinch to zoom on mobile. People might have expected drinks companies to erupt in outrage at the announcement and for the Treasury to sit in eager anticipation of a funding boost. But it was just the opposite. It was almost as if they had seen it coming. Soft drink manufacturers rapidly began looking at ways to reformulate their products around the new guidelines, often swapping sugar for artificial sweeteners. Supermarkets Tesco, Asda and drinks companies Fanta, Ribena, Britvic and Lucozade slashed the sugar content in their drinks, some by half or more. Irn-Bru reduced its own recipe from 10.3g of sugar to 4.7g per 100ml, stoking the ire of loyalists like Allen. The new formulas began rolling out long before the April 2018 deadline with minimal exceptions. Coca-Cola and Pepsi, opted to shoulder the tax hike and maintain their sugar content. While Pepsi declined to comment on this to BBC Capital, a spokesperson for Coca-Cola says that although Coca-Cola Original Taste is the only product not reformulated in recent years, the company's decision was made with its customers in mind. ""We decided not to change the recipe because people love it and have asked us not to change it. We believe people should have choice."" The number of new soft drink launches with less than 5g of sugar per 100ml since the 2016 report has risen from 32 to 45. Inversely, new beverages above the recommended threshold are down from 60 to 49 in 2018. Of course, as more companies met PHE’s sugar standards, anticipated tax revenue fell from £500m to £385m by mid-2017, then again to £275m in November. Today, more than seven months since the tax was formally applied, it’s generated a measly £62m ($80m). But Treasury officials are nonetheless hailing the tax a success. Lower revenue for the government implies a greater willingness by companies to hit healthier benchmarks. In this case, paradoxically, less really is more. Kicking an ingrained habit  In the midst of this entente cordiale some can’t help but reflect on the days before obesity was considered an epidemic. Naveed Sattar, professor of Cardiology and Medical Sciences at the University of Glasgow, remembers growing up without fear of overdoing the sugar. UK obesity levels were 4%-7% in the 1980s when Sattar was a kid helping in his father’s corner shop. He often watched customers stock up on four litres of Irn-Bru a day. “There’s many people who have grown up on Irn-Bru,” Sattar says. “I drank lots of Irn-Bru from a young age because I didn’t know any better. It was there.” Sattar’s biggest reality check came in medical school. In a test of 300 people, Sattar was found to have one of the highest risks of diabetes based on his insulin levels. When his weight jumped three stone, he knew he needed to ditch the sugar. “I religiously had two sugars in my tea, but I cut it,” he says. The transition, while difficult, was rather quick. Soon, his taste buds adjusted. “Now if you put it back in my tea, it’s vile.” But quitting a soft drink addiction isn’t always that simple. One Irn-Bru addict at the cardiovascular clinic Sattar runs was referred due to high blood fat levels and a recent heart attack. He regularly drank six litres a day, Sattar says, and even got up in the night for a sip. He lost eight kilos after Sattar treated him, and began enjoying proper food for the first time in years. “If people really give themselves a chance, you can adapt your taste buds,” Sattar says. “Just because they like something doesn’t mean they couldn’t change with a little time and a little perseverance.” Sattar represents the majority of those in the medical community and wider public willing to accept the tax for the overall betterment of health. But he thinks it’s much too early to celebrate. Cutting out fizzy drinks is a great start, but experts believe they account for only 5% of the larger obesity issue. Even with thousands of other sugary foods at their disposal, the more outspoken Irn-Bru fans think the tax has gone too far. Irn-Bru declined to comment when approached by BBC Capital. Allen followed up his cone stunt with a petition aimed at parent company AG Barr that received more than 50,000 signatures. Another man came up with his own Irn-Bru-flavoured concoction that he claims tastes just like the original. Others stockpiled the full-sugar version and now sell it illegally online. Allen says he drinks four cans a week, which would cost him about £124 ($161) annually if he purchased each 300ml can individually. Had the makers refused to alter their recipe and passed the tax to Allen, his annual spend would have risen to about £140 ($182). “I would have rather paid the tax,” he says. “It’s brand-suicide and it’s a betrayal of the customers who have made it what it is.” Few can match Allen’s passion, but he’s not alone. According to Kiti Soininen, head of food, drink and foodservice research at Mintel, 64% of people say they drink the same amount they did a year ago and 10% say they drink more. The extra-hot summer weather likely affected consumption a bit, Soininen says, but it’s an indicator that the UK has a long way to go. Click or pinch to zoom on mobile. Global action  The UK is a latecomer to action on sugary drinks. Beginning mostly in the Pacific Islands, levies have slowly spread through cities and countries across every continent since the early ‘80s. Mexico’s 10% tax accelerated the movement in 2014. After just one year, Mexicans were consuming 12% less sugary drinks, the most significant reductions in the poorest households. Five other areas followed suit the same year with a tax of their own, six each in 2015 and 2016, and a whopping 13 in 2017. Hungary witnessed a 40% decrease in soft drink sugar content in the wake of its tax. In Berkeley, California, a minimal tax decreased overall consumption by 21%. According to the World Cancer Research Fund, a total of 48 cities, nations and territories have now imposed taxes of some type on their soft drinks.   But it’s not all plain sailing. Chicago authorities repealed their 1-cent-per-ounce tax in 2017 just two months after it was applied. The measure was pitched primarily as a way of plugging the city’s $1.8bn budget gap (£1.4bn). Health concerns and obesity prevention were secondary priorities, according to the Washington Post. A media battle between the drinks companies and public health groups ended in defeat for the tax’s supporters. The UK’s cooperation with health officials and commitment to school programmes has, so far, allowed its tax to succeed where Chicago’s failed. Looking long-term, one Cambridge University study uses a different yardstick to measure success. It estimates that the tax raised liable soft drink prices by approximately 38%, leading to a 26% decrease in consumption in England. Researchers say this decrease would prevent approximately 370 coronary heart disease deaths, effectively generating about 4,490 life years by 2021. Comparing the 617,000 hospital admissions in 2016 in which obesity was a factor, the projection becomes all the more realistic. As Sattar cautioned, the war on obesity has only just started. Although the Department of Health and Social Care’s plan to cut 20% of sugar in foods most commonly eaten by children is well on its way, the UK has not met the overall 5% reduction goal for its first year. Whether a new wave of levies is picking up speed is anyone’s guess, but given the soft drink tax’s early success, Sattar believes it to be the best way forward. “We need some clever people to make these companies aware of the changes they need to make,” he says. “Pricing taxation does work if you do it properly.” -- To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook  page or message us on Twitter.

Spread to US Treasury,'We weren't prepared for the media',2024-09-25,2020-03-20,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51920966,No content available
Spread to US Treasury,What a single sound says about you,2024-09-25,2019-03-18,James Harbeck,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20190315-what-a-single-sound-says-about-you,"Do you growl, roll or trill?  The letter ‘r’ – and how we pronounce it – reveals a surprising amount about identity, fashion and history, writes James Harbeck. The ‘r’ sound is the Doctor Who of speech sounds: it’s really several, obviously different sounds that we treat as the same because they play the same role. But which ‘r’ you use says a lot about who you are, where you’re from, and who you want to sound like.  More like this: –        The rebirth of Britain’s ‘lost’ languages –        Seven Japanese words to live by –        Fourteen words that define the present Three-quarters of the world’s languages have at least one ‘r’ sound – what linguists call a rhotic. The problem is that the rhotics seem to have very little in common: they’re said anywhere from the far back of the mouth to the lips, and the tongue may be trilling, tightly constricting the airflow, loosely constricting it, or doing very little indeed. And yet we generally recognize them as versions of the same sound. The French uvular ‘r’, for instance, is what we consider the classic French ‘r’– think of how Hercule Poirot says his own name. The German version of the uvular ‘r’ is a little different because it drops off completely after vowels – think of how Arnold Schwarzenegger says his own name or the classic line from Kindergarten Cop, “It’s not a tumour!” (“It’s not a tumah!”) Linguists argue about what all the ‘r’ sounds have in common; recent ultrasound-imaging research at the University of Cincinnati has suggested that, whatever the front or top of your tongue is doing with a rhotic, the very back root of it is always tightening your throat. Most rhotics require more effort to say than the average speech sound, and they’re among the last sounds children master… if they ever do. The tongue-tip trill is particularly difficult, so it’s no surprise that speakers might slip over to something slightly easier – economy of effort is an important factor in sound shifts, though we’re also willing to exert effort to make ourselves understood. But ease of saying and hearing aren’t the main reasons for the difference between the ‘r’ sounds you hear as you travel through Europe. Fashion and identity are. Roll with it Long ago, Latin speakers said ‘r’ with the tips of their tongues, just as most Italian speakers do now. For a long time, French speakers did too. But in Paris in the late 1600s, some of the smart set started saying a back-of-the-throat ‘r’ – what linguists call ‘uvular’ – perhaps to save effort, perhaps as a fashion. People such as the noted physician Nicolas Andry de Bois-Regard counselled everyone to use the sound, because many people had been converting ‘r’ to other sounds such as ‘l’ or ‘z’ or – gasp – dropping it altogether. And so the uvular ‘r’ started spreading gradually through France and the tongue-tip trill came to be seen as ‘vulgar’ or ‘provincial’. And then it spread from there, city by city, among the fashionable set, into Germany and the Netherlands and up to Denmark… or so the old story goes. But it’s not quite that simple. There’s evidence that the back-of-the-throat ‘r’ had already shown up in some dialects of German by that time, and not even among the fashionable city set. Nonetheless, the main spread of the uvular ‘r’ through Germany and neighbouring countries did follow the fashionable city folks and travelling merchants. Berlin had it by 1700; it took hold in Copenhagen in the late 1700s and spread from there back through Denmark; it moved into southern Sweden by the late 1800s and stopped. It spread too into Norwegian around Bergen, which has a long history of trade with Germany. It also moved into the Netherlands, but in any given place in the Netherlands you can hear some speakers who say ‘r’ with the tongue tip, some who say it uvular, and some who say it mid-mouth like Americans, and what’s preferred by young women (who are typically the bellwethers of language change) varies from city to city. Next door in Belgium, though, Flemish (another name for Dutch) avoids the uvular ‘r’. It may have something to do with Belgium also having French speakers: your ‘r’ declares your language group. Uvular ‘r’ also travelled west. Spanish resisted it (except for a few places), but it took Portuguese by storm. Portuguese, like Spanish, has two kinds of ‘r,’ a heavy one (as in carro) and a light one (as in caro). In the late 1800s, some influential speakers in Portugal’s larger cities started saying the heavy one like the French ‘r’; it may or may not have been by direct influence from France. Within a few decades it had taken over almost completely. It went to the next level in Brazil: depending on where you are and who you’re talking to, you might hear ‘r’ as something like a Dutch ‘ch,’ or a ‘h,’ or – in some contexts – no sound at all. So the Brazilian version of the heavy ‘r’ means that ‘carro’ sounds to us like ‘ca-hoo’, and ‘Rio’ sounds like ‘hee-oo.’ Meanwhile, that other ‘r,’ the light one, stayed more or less the same… until recently. Now some urban speakers in Portugal are starting to say it the American way after vowels. Rural speakers near São Paulo, Brazil, have been doing that for years, but it hasn’t spread because they’re not fashionable – people call their accent fala caipira, ‘hillbilly talk.’ We English speakers have insisted on going our own way. By a thousand years ago, English probably had several versions of ‘r’ across the country; historical linguists are still arguing about the details. What we know for sure (thanks to variant spellings) is that by the time of Shakespeare, people in some parts of England were starting to drop it after vowels for economy of effort. But ‘r’-dropping didn’t get the endorsement of the ‘right’ sort of people until the late 1700s, at which point it caught on so briskly that colonials returning to England after the American Revolution expressed surprise at the change. The ‘right’ sort of people? Well, the ‘upper-right’ sort of people, if you look at a map. R-dropping came to dominate the part of England roughly north and east of the A5 motorway –plus London of course – excepting areas of Lancashire and Northumbria (and stopping at Scotland, where, as in Ireland, there is pride in not sounding English). The Irish don’t drop ‘r’; think of the word ‘Ireland’ – the English pronunciation sounds like ‘island’, whereas the Irish enunciate the ‘r’, so it sounds more like ‘oirrland’. And the Scots not only don’t drop it, they trill it, so ‘Fergus from Aberdeen’ really sounds like ‘Ferrgus from Aberrdeen.’ The southwest English ‘r’ is internationally associated with pirates, thanks to actor Robert Newton, a native of Dorset, who played Blackbeard and Long John Silver in Disney movies in the 1950s. He’s famous for ‘Arrrr, matey,’ but you’ll hear every ‘r in ‘There be treasure’ too. Then there is the farmer stereotype (‘Get orrf my land’.) Now the ‘r’-dropping is spreading into the southwest as well. And then there are the Geordies. Already by the 1700s the ‘Northumbrian burr’ – an uvular ‘r’ – was a point of pride. It remained one until the mid-20th Century, when, in the space of about one generation, under the pressure of popular culture, education and fashion, it almost completely disappeared. The American way Americans have not been immune to trends, either. Rich and well-educated people in port cities – most notably Boston and New York – soon picked up the British ‘r’-dropping fashion. So did plantation owners in the South, and – from them – others in their area. Poorer people in the South who lived in the mountains away from the plantations did not. Their reward for keeping all their ‘r’s? Their accent is now – as in Brazil – stereotyped as ‘hillbilly.’ But don’t assume a strong mid-mouth ‘r’ always goes with rural; heavy use of the same sound is also a distinctive mark of the Beijing dialect of Mandarin. The prestige of ‘r’-dropping lasted a long time in America, but it started slipping after the Civil War, and slid right downhill in the 20th Century. Nancy Elliott, of Southern Oregon University, studied the speech of leading men and women in US films from 1932 through to 1980, and found a steady decline in the rate of ‘r’-dropping, even by the same actors: Fred Astaire went from 80% ‘r’-dropping in the 1930s to 28% in the 1970s; Myrna Loy, from 96% to 7%. At first, more ‘r’-dropping was associated with higher social status and more polite speech; leading men dropped their ‘r’s more when talking to leading ladies and less when getting into fights, and richer people dropped their ‘r’s more than poorer ones. But by the 1960s the prestige associations had switched: a few rich people (villains, for example) still dropped their ‘r’s, but it was increasingly a mark of lower class. The ‘r’-dropping of New York can be heard in a New Yorker accent saying ‘New York,’ which has often been rendered in print as ‘New Yawk.’ The common joke phrase for the Boston accent is ‘Ya cahn’t pahk ya cah in Hahvad Yahd’ (‘You can’t park your car in Harvard yard’). A well-known American actor who could be counted on to drop his’ r’s was Humphrey Bogart. In “Here’s looking at you, kid” you don’t hear an ‘r’ in “here’s”. In the word ‘world’ sometimes he would say the ‘r’ but sometimes it would sound more like ‘woild.’ A more recent counterpart to Bogart is Harrison Ford, but he always says his r’s – in Star Wars lines like “He’s the brains, sweetheart"" or “Never tell me the odds,” you hear the ‘r’ in “sweetheart” and “never,” which Bogart would have dropped (“sweet-haht,” “nevah”). It’s not ovah, though. The prestige of different ‘r’ sounds in different places is just going to keep shifting. It’s about not just fashion but identity. We could call it the Doctor Who-Are-You of speech sounds.

Spread to US Treasury,‘The mother of modern China’,2024-09-25,2015-12-23,Clarissa Sebag Montefiore,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20151223-soon-qingling-the-mother-of-modern-china,"She married Sun Yatsen, became a Communist and died as China’s honorary chairperson. Clarissa Sebag-Montefiore takes a look at the life of Soong Qingling. “Once upon a time in distant China, there were three sisters,” opens the 1997 historical drama The Soong Sisters. “One loved money, one loved power and one loved her country.” Directed by Hong Kong film-maker Mabel Cheung, The Soong Sisters tracks the lives of three real-life siblings, powerful women who lived through – and largely influenced – major upheavals in China in the last century. Soong Ailing – the lover of money – married Kung Hsiang-hsi, a director of the Bank of China. Soong Meiling – the lover of power – married Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the Kuomintang or Nationalist Party. And Soong Qingling – the lover of the Chinese nation – married the revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, founding father of the Republic of China. Together Ailing, Meiling, and Qingling represent China’s major ideological forces: capitalism, nationalism and communism, respectively. But of the three sisters, it is Soong Qingling (depicted in the movie by the iconic actress Maggie Cheung) who captured the public’s imagination, becoming in the process a political It Girl, national treasure and historical heroine. The “mother of modern China”, as she is known, wed Sun Yat-sen in 1915, the man heralded with overthrowing the feudalistic, old-fashioned and elitist Manchu dynasty just four years earlier. As a widow, following her husband’s death from liver disease a decade later in 1925, Madame Sun Yat-sen became an important champion for Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party. To some Soong was China’s ‘conscience’, having broken ties with the Nationalist Party that her husband had founded, proclaiming it had strayed from his original ideals and intentions. To others, she was a politically naive traitor and ‘bird in a lacquered cage’, who was used and exploited by the Communists as a crucial link to the past and a route to legitimacy. One thing is certain. As the Communist Party apologist Israel Epstein – a great friend of Soong’s – once stated: “Soong Qingling personifies modern China… [She] personally participated in all stages of the Chinese revolution.”  In his 1993 biography Woman in World History: Soong Qingling, Epstein describes her as possessing a rare “internationalist and bicultural thinking” combined with patriotism. The latter was her “strong and eternal root… not only reflected in her political stance and actions but also suffused her entire mind and body.” Chinese dream The daughter of a Bible salesman and missionary, Soong was born in 1893 in Shanghai. Charlie Soong, her father, had spent years in the United States being trained as a missionary before returning to spread Christianity. In 1890 he started a Shanghai publishing house, printing cheap bibles in colloquial Chinese – and became rich. His business empire soon expanded to include food and textiles. As the second eldest of six children, Soong was educated, like her siblings, in both China and the US. Fluent in English, she attended Wesleyan College in Georgia and took up the Christian name Rosamond. When the Republic of China was proclaimed, ending more than 2,000 years of imperial rule, Soong was still at school in the States. As her friends watched, she took down the emperor’s banner from the walls of her room; in its place went Sun Yatsen’s flag of the Republic. Education abroad had its impact: above all, Soong was a champion of women. Finding arranged marriages abhorrent (they would later be banned by Mao in the 1950s) she was adamant that she must marry a man of her own choice. Moving back to Asia, she became Sun Yatsen’s secretary. When she announced she would also become his wife her parents were appalled. Not only was Sun nearly three decades her senior, he already had a wife and three children. By taking up the mantle of “second wife” Soong's match would be at odds with the family’s Christian values. Showing the determination, stubbornness and will that would define her long life, Soong ignored their concerns and married Sun in 1915. Although younger, richer, and at times offended by his lack of cleanliness, Soong became a much-loved companion and confidant to Sun, a revolutionary born into a peasant family. In an era when many respectable Chinese women were still kept behind shuttered doors, she also became a highly visible political figure. In her biography Madame Sun Yatsen, Jung Chang and Jon Halliday state that Soong became the earliest example in the world of a woman behaving like a “First Lady”. In the early 1920, Soong’s initiatives included conducting studies of the squalid conditions of female factory workers, the founding of women’s clubs and heading up the Women’s Institute of Political Training. As well as providing a refuge for women fleeing arranged marriages, the Institute promoted the idea that women, like men, were equal benefactors of China’s political future and must be educated as such. Chinese women, she wrote in later life, must be unshackled from the three traditional obediences: to their fathers, their husbands, and their sons. But while Soong campaigned strongly in women’s rights, she also believed that they must come under a transformation of society as a whole, stating in 1942: “From the very start, our women fought not under the banner of a Western feminism but as part and parcel of the democratic whole.” One reflection of social reform was dress. In feudal China men wore their heads shaved, with a long plait, or queue, draped down their backs, as a physical incarnation of their humility. Sun Yatsen, however, popularised a modern new suit, a mixture of traditional Chinese and Western dress, known as the Sun-Yatsen – and later the Mao -– suit. Soong, likewise, shifted between European and Chinese styles, showcasing a new, forward-thinking China, one that could hold its head up high to the West. A strange sisterhood With power, however, came costs. Forced to flee a military coup in 1922, Soong miscarried her baby with Sun (later in life she adopted two daughters). The Soong family also suffered a vast split: during the Chinese Civil War, the Communist-sympathising Qingling became estranged from her sister Meiling, wife of the enemy Chiang Kai-Shek. In 1927 – the same year of Meiling’s wedding – Chiang Kai-Shek led a brutal massacre of Communists across the country. Although Chiang had once been a close ally to Sun Yatsen, and had taken over as the leader of the Republic after his passing, Soong was horrified. She condemned the attacks, turned her back on the Nationalists, and led an incessant political campaign against her brother-in-law. Soong’s sister Meiling – known for her beauty and sex appeal – had different ideas about how China should be shaped. In 1934 Meiling, alongside her husband, launched the New Life Movement, which sought to stop the spread of communism by harking back to traditional Chinese values. According to the Encyclopedia of Women Social Reformers, Meiling adopted “a conventional attitude toward women’s emancipation as a moral crusade confined to emphasising traditional virtues of modesty, chastity, and domesticity”. Qingling, by contrast, saw “precisely these traditional patriarchal attitudes as being at the root of the continuing subjection of Chinese women, even into the communist era.”   Meiling, however, successfully won over the American public, becoming only the second woman to address a joint session of Congress. There she asked for support in the Sino-Japanese war, leading to her inclusion in a list of the 10 most admired women in the US. It was during World War Two that the sisters were briefly reunited – running field hospitals and literary campaigns together – as the Nationalists and Communists dropped their differences to fight against a common enemy, the Japanese. Following Mao Zedong’s victory in 1949, however, Meiling fled with her husband to Taiwan where he set up a new government. The sisters were estranged for good. In 1938, following the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Soong founded the China Defense League, later renamed the Chinese Welfare Institute, with the aim of funding children’s well-being and health, particularly in Communist controlled areas. When the Communists emerged triumphant in 1949, establishing the People’s Republic of China, Soong was rewarded for her loyalty with the role of vice chair in the newly formed nation. Other accolades followed. In 1951 Soong was awarded the Stalin Peace Prize. And in 1959, in a largely symbolic role, she became one of just two deputy chairmen of the Chinese Communist Party, under Mao Zedong. Just as Meiling courted the States from Taiwan, Soong Qingling also sought to shape the West’s perception of China. In 1952 she founded the magazine China Reconstructions (now China Today), broadcasting news of her homeland in English, as well as other languages. A collection of her writings was published in the 1950s under the apt title, Struggle for New China. When Soong died in 1981 aged 90, the Chinese government lauded her as “a great patriotic, democratic, internationalist and Communist fighter and outstanding state leader of China.” Just weeks before she was granted the title of Honorary Chairman of the PRC and, for the first time, became a member of the Communist Party. In death, as in life, Meiling took a different path. While Qingling had suffered and been publicly criticised during the brutal 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, Madame Chiang Kai-shek was widowed in 1975. She moved to New York where she lived in relative seclusion in a plush Manhattan apartment, before passing away aged 105 in 2003. At news of her death George W Bush commended her “intelligence” and “strength of character”, calling her a close friend of the US. For Qingling, it was China, not the States, who sung praises. After her death three days of national mourning were announced in China, a state funeral was staged and flags were lowered at Chinese embassies across the world. As Frommers aptly writes in a guide to one of Soong’s former residences in Beijing, this is a woman who “is as close as you'll get to a modern Chinese Communist saint.” If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
Spread to US Treasury,How Covid-19 might change the world,2024-09-25,2020-03-31,Simon Mair,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200331-covid-19-how-will-the-coronavirus-change-the-world,"Could the huge shifts in our way of life being introduced as part of the fight against Covid-19 pave the way for a more humane economy? Where will we be in six months, a year, 10 years from now? I lie awake at night wondering what the future holds for my loved ones. My vulnerable friends and relatives. I wonder what will happen to my job, even though I’m one of the lucky ones: I get good sick pay and can work remotely. I am writing this from the UK, where I still have self-employed friends who are staring down the barrel of months without pay, friends who have already lost jobs. The contract that pays 80% of my salary runs out in December. Coronavirus is hitting the economy bad. Will anyone be hiring when I need work? There are a number of possible futures, all dependent on how governments and society respond to coronavirus and its economic aftermath. Hopefully we will use this crisis to rebuild, produce something better and more humane. But we may slide into something worse. I think we can understand our situation – and what might lie in our future – by looking at other crises. My research focuses on the fundamentals of the modern economy: global supply chains, wages, and productivity. I look at the way that economic dynamics contribute to challenges like climate change and low levels of mental and physical health among workers. I have argued that we need a very different kind of economics if we are to build socially just and ecologically sound futures. In the face of Covid-19, this has never been more obvious. You might also like: • Will Covid-19 have a lasting impact on the environment? • Covid-19: the history of pandemics • Why social distancing might last for some time The responses to the Covid-19 pandemic are simply the amplification of the dynamic that drives other social and ecological crises: the prioritisation of one type of value over others. This dynamic has played a large part in driving global responses to Covid-19. So as responses to the virus evolve, how might our economic futures develop? From an economic perspective, there are four possible futures: a descent into barbarism, a robust state capitalism, a radical state socialism, and a transformation into a big society built on mutual aid. Versions of all of these futures are perfectly possible, if not equally desirable. Small changes don't cut it Coronavirus, like climate change, is partly a problem of our economic structure. Although both appear to be “environmental” or “natural” problems, they are socially driven. Yes, climate change is caused by certain gases absorbing heat. But that’s a very shallow explanation. To really understand climate change, we need to understand the social reasons that keep us emitting greenhouse gases. Likewise with Covid-19. Yes, the direct cause is the virus. But managing its effects requires us to understand human behaviour and its wider economic context. Tackling both Covid-19 and climate change is much easier if you reduce non-essential economic activity. For climate change this is because if you produce less stuff, you use less energy, and emit fewer greenhouse gases. The epidemiology of Covid-19 is rapidly evolving. But the core logic is similarly simple. People mix together and spread infections. This happens in households, and in workplaces, and on the journeys people make. Reducing this mixing is likely to reduce person-to-person transmission and lead to fewer cases overall. Reducing contact between people probably also helps with other control strategies. One common control strategy for infectious disease outbreaks is contact tracing and isolation, where an infected person's contacts are identified, then isolated to prevent further disease spread. This is most effective when you trace a high percentage of contacts. The fewer contacts a person has, the fewer you have to trace to get to that higher percentage. We can see from Wuhan that social distancing and lockdown measures like this are effective. Political economy is useful in helping us understand why they weren't introduced earlier in European countries (most notably the UK and the US). A fragile economy Lockdown is placing pressure on the global economy. We face a serious recession. This pressure has led some world leaders to call for an easing of lockdown measures.   The economics of collapse are fairly straight forward. Businesses exist to make a profit. If they can’t produce, they can’t sell things. This means they won’t make profits, which means they are less able to employ you. Businesses can and do (over short time periods) hold on to workers that they don’t need immediately: they want to be able to meet demand when the economy picks back up again. But, if things start to look really bad, then they won’t. So, more people lose their jobs or fear losing their jobs. So they buy less. And the whole cycle starts again, and we spiral into an economic depression. In a normal crisis the prescription for solving this is simple – the government spends, and it spends until people start consuming and working again. But normal interventions won’t work here because we don’t want the economy to recover (at least, not immediately). The whole point of the lockdown is to stop people going to work, where they spread the disease. One recent study suggested that lifting lockdown measures in Wuhan (including workplace closures) too soon could see China experience a second peak of cases later in 2020. As the economist James Meadway wrote, the correct Covid-19 response isn’t a wartime economy – with massive upscaling of production. Rather, we need an “anti-wartime” economy and a massive scaling back of production. And if we want to be more resilient to pandemics in the future (and to avoid the worst of climate change) we need a system capable of scaling back production in a way that doesn't mean loss of livelihood. So what we need is a different economic mindset. We tend to think of the economy as the way we buy and sell things, mainly consumer goods. But this is not what an economy is or needs to be. At its core, the economy is the way we take our resources and turn them into the things we need to live. Looked at this way, we can start to see more opportunities for living differently that allow us to produce less stuff without increasing misery. I and other ecological economists have long been concerned with the question of how you produce less in a socially just way, because the challenge of producing less is also central to tackling climate change. All else equal, the more we produce, the more greenhouse gases we emit. So how do you reduce the amount of stuff you make while keeping people in work? Proposals include reducing the length of the working week, or, as some of my recent work has examined, you could allow people to work more slowly and with less pressure. Neither of these is directly applicable to Covid-19, where the aim is reducing contact rather than output, but the core of the proposals is the same. You have to reduce people's dependence on a wage to be able to live. What is the economy for? The key to understanding responses to Covid-19 is the question of what the economy is for. Currently, the primary aim of the global economy is to facilitate exchanges of money. This is what economists call “exchange value”. The dominant idea of the current system we live in is that “exchange value” is the same thing as “use value”. Basically, people will spend money on the things that they want or need, and this act of spending money tells us something about how much they value its “use”. This is why markets are seen as the best way to run society. They allow you to adapt, and are flexible enough to match up productivity capacity with use value. What Covid-19 is throwing into sharp relief is just how false our beliefs about markets are. Around the world, governments fear that critical systems will be disrupted or overloaded: supply chains, social care, but principally healthcare. There are lots of contributing factors to this. But let's take two. First, it is quite hard to make money from many of the most essential societal services. This is in part because a major driver of profits is labour productivity growth: doing more with fewer people. People are a big cost factor in many businesses, especially those that rely on personal interactions, like healthcare. Consequently, productivity growth in the healthcare sector tends to be lower than the rest of the economy, so its costs go up faster than average. Second, jobs in many critical services aren’t those that tend to be highest valued in society. Many of the best paid jobs only exist to facilitate exchanges: to make money. They serve no wider purpose to society. Yet because they make lots of money we have lots of consultants, a huge advertising industry and a massive financial sector. Meanwhile, we have a crisis in health and social care, where people are often forced out of useful jobs they enjoy because these jobs don’t pay them enough to live. Pointless jobs The fact that so many people work pointless jobs is partly why we are so ill prepared to respond to Covid-19. The pandemic is highlighting that many jobs are not essential, yet we lack sufficient key workers to respond when things go bad. People are compelled to work pointless jobs because in a society where exchange value is the guiding principle of the economy, the basic goods of life are mainly available through markets. This means you have to buy them, and to buy them you need an income, which comes from a job. The other side of this coin is that the most radical (and effective) responses that we are seeing to the Covid-19 outbreak challenge the dominance of markets and exchange value. Around the world governments are taking actions that three months ago looked impossible. In Spain, private hospitals have been nationalised. In the UK, the prospect of nationalising various modes of transport has become very real. And France has stated its readiness to nationalise large businesses. Likewise, we are seeing the breakdown of labour markets. Countries like Denmark and the UK are providing people with an income in order to stop them from going to work. This is an essential part of a successful lockdown. These measures are far from perfect. Nonetheless, it is a shift from the principle that people have to work in order to earn their income, and a move towards the idea that people deserve to be able to live even if they cannot work. This reverses the dominant trends of the last 40 years. Over this time, markets and exchange values have been seen as the best way of running an economy. Consequently, public systems have come under increasing pressure to marketise, to be run as though they were businesses who had to make money. Likewise, workers have become more and more exposed to the market – zero-hours contracts and the gig economy have removed the layer of protection from market fluctuations that long term, stable, employment used to offer. Covid-19 appears to be reversing this trend, taking healthcare and labour goods out of the market and putting it into the hands of the state. States produce for many reasons. Some good and some bad. But unlike markets, they do not have to produce for exchange value alone. These changes give me hope. They give us the chance to save many lives. They even hint at the possibility of longer term change that makes us happier and helps us tackle climate change. But why did it take us so long to get here? Why were many countries so ill-prepared to slow down production? The answer lies in a recent World Health Organisation (WHO) report: they did not have the right “mindset”. Our economic imaginations There has been a broad economic consensus for 40 years. This has limited the ability of politicians and their advisers to see cracks in the system, or imagine alternatives. This mindset is driven by two linked beliefs: These views are common to many Western countries. But they are strongest in the UK and the US, both of which have appeared to be badly prepared to respond to Covid-19. In the UK, attendees at a private engagement reportedly summarised the Prime Minister's most senior aide's approach to Covid-19 as ""herd immunity, protect the economy, and if that means some pensioners die, too bad"". The government has denied this, but if real, it’s not surprising. At a government event early in the pandemic, a senior civil servant said to me: ""Is it worth the economic disruption? If you look at the treasury valuation of a life, probably not."" This kind of view is endemic in a particular elite class. It is well represented by a Texas official who argued that many elderly people would gladly die rather than see the US sink into economic depression. This view endangers many vulnerable people (and not all vulnerable people are elderly), and, as I have tried to lay out here, it is a false choice. One of the things the Covid-19 crisis could be doing, is expanding that economic imagination. As governments and citizens take steps that three months ago seemed impossible, our ideas about how the world works could change rapidly. Let us look at where this re-imagining could take us. Four futures To help us visit the future, I’m going to use an old technique from the field of futures studies. You take two factors you think will be important in driving the future, and you imagine what will happen under different combinations of those factors. The factors I want to take are value and centralisation. Value refers to whatever is the guiding principle of our economy. Do we use our resources to maximise exchanges and money, or do we use them to maximise life? Centralisation refers to the ways that things are organised, either by of lots of small units or by one big commanding force. We can organise these factors into a grid, which can then be populated with scenarios. So we can think about what might happen if we try to respond to the coronavirus with the following four extreme combinations: State capitalism State capitalism is the dominant response we are seeing across the world right now. Typical examples are the UK, Spain and Denmark. The state capitalist society continues to pursue exchange value as the guiding light of the economy. But it recognises that markets in crisis require support from the state. Given that many workers cannot work because they are ill, and fear for their lives, the state steps in with extended welfare. It also enacts massive Keynesian stimulus by extending credit and making direct payments to businesses. The expectation here is that this is will be for a short period. The primary function of the steps being taken is to allow as many businesses as possible to keep on trading. In the UK, for example, food is still distributed by markets (though the government has relaxed competition laws). Where workers are supported directly, this is done in ways that seek to minimise disruption to normal labour market functioning. So, for example, as in the UK, payments to workers have to be applied for and distributed by employers. And the size of payments is made on the basis of the exchange value a worker usually creates in the market, rather than the usefulness of their work. Could this be a successful scenario? Possibly, but only if Covid-19 proves controllable over a short period. As full lockdown is avoided to maintain market functioning, transmission of infection is still likely to continue. In the UK, for instance, non-essential construction is still continuing, leaving workers mixing on building sites. But limited state intervention will become increasingly hard to maintain if death tolls rise. Increased illness and death will provoke unrest and deepen economic impacts, forcing the state to take more and more radical actions to try to maintain market functioning. Barbarism This is the bleakest scenario. Barbarism is the future if we continue to rely on exchange value as our guiding principle and yet refuse to extend support to those who get locked out of markets by illness or unemployment. It describes a situation that we have not yet seen. Businesses fail and workers starve because there are no mechanisms in place to protect them from the harsh realities of the market. Hospitals are not supported by extraordinary measures, and so become overwhelmed. People die. Barbarism is ultimately an unstable state that ends in ruin or a transition to one of the other grid sections after a period of political and social devastation. Could this happen? The concern is that either it could happen by mistake during the pandemic, or by intention after the pandemic peaks. The mistake is if a government fails to step in in a big enough way during the worst of the pandemic. Support might be offered to businesses and households, but if this isn't enough to prevent market collapse in the face of widespread illness, chaos would ensue. Hospitals might be sent extra funds and people, but if it’s not enough, those who need treatment will be turned away in large numbers. Potentially just as consequential is the possibility of massive austerity after the pandemic has peaked and governments seek to return to “normal”. This has been threatened in Germany. This would be disastrous. Not least because the defunding of critical services during austerity has impacted the ability of countries to respond to this pandemic. The subsequent failure of the economy and society would trigger political and stable unrest, leading to a failed state and the collapse of both state and community welfare systems. State socialism State socialism describes the first of the futures we could see with a cultural shift that places a different kind of value at the heart of the economy. This is the future we arrive at with an extension of the measures we are currently seeing in the UK, Spain and Denmark. The key here is that measures like the nationalisation of hospitals and payments to workers are seen not as tools to protect markets, but a way to protect life itself. In such a scenario, the state steps in to protect the parts of the economy that are essential to life: the production of food, energy and shelter for instance, so that the basic provisions of life are no longer subject to the whims of the market. The state nationalises hospitals, and makes housing freely available. Finally, it provides all citizens with a means of accessing various goods – both basics and any consumer goods that we are able to produce with a reduced workforce. Citizens no longer rely on employers as intermediaries between them and the basic materials of life. Payments are made to everyone directly and are not related to the exchange value they create. Instead, payments are the same to all (on the basis that we deserve to be able to live, simply because we are alive), or they are based on the usefulness of the work. Supermarket workers, delivery drivers, warehouse stackers, nurses, teachers, and doctors are the new CEOs. It’s possible that state socialism emerges as a consequence of attempts at state capitalism and the effects of a prolonged pandemic. If deep recessions happen and there is disruption in supply chains such that demand cannot be rescued by the kind of standard Keynesian policies we are seeing now (printing money, making loans easier to get and so on), the state may take over production. There are risks to this approach – we must be careful to avoid authoritarianism. But done well, this may be our best hope against an extreme Covid-19 outbreak. A strong state able to marshal the resources to protect the core functions of economy and society. Mutual aid Mutual aid is the second future in which we adopt the protection of life as the guiding principle of our economy. However, in this scenario, the state does not take a defining role. Rather, individuals and small groups begin to organise support and care within their communities. The risk with this future is that small groups are unable to rapidly mobilise the kind of resources needed to effectively increase healthcare capacity, for instance. But mutual aid could enable more effective transmission prevention, by building community support networks that protect the vulnerable and police isolation rules. The most ambitious form of this future sees new democratic structures arise. Groupings of communities that are able to mobilise substantial resources with relative speed. People coming together to plan regional responses to stop the spread of the disease and (if they have the skills) to treat patients. This kind of scenario could emerge from any of the others. It is a possible way out of barbarism, or state capitalism, and could support state socialism. We know that community responses were central to tackling the West African Ebloa outbreak. And we already see the roots of this future today in the groups organising care packages and community support. We can see this as a failure of state responses. Or we can see it as a pragmatic, compassionate societal response to an unfolding crisis. Hope and fear These visions are extreme scenarios, caricatures, and likely to bleed into one another. My fear is the descent from state capitalism into barbarism. My hope is a blend of state socialism and mutual aid: a strong, democratic state that mobilises resources to build a stronger health system, prioritises protecting the vulnerable from the whims of the market and responds to and enables citizens to form mutual aid groups rather than working meaningless jobs. What is hopefully clear is that all these scenarios leave some grounds for fear, but also some for hope. Covid-19 is highlighting serious deficiencies in our existing system. An effective response to this is likely to require radical social change. I have argued that it requires a drastic move away from markets and the use of profits as the primary way of organising an economy. The upside of this is the possibility that we build a more humane system that leaves us more resilient in the face of future pandemics and other impending crises like climate change. Social change can come from many places and with many influences. A key task for us all is demanding that emerging social forms come from an ethic that values care, life, and democracy. The central political task in this time of crisis is living and (virtually) organising around those values. * Simon Mair is a Research Fellow in Ecological Economics at the University of Surrey This article is adapted from a piece that originally appeared on The Conversation, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence.  -- As an award-winning science site, BBC Future is committed to bringing you evidence-based analysis and myth-busting stories around the new coronavirus.

Spread to US Treasury,The language that couldn’t be stopped,2024-09-25,2016-09-19,James Harbeck,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160919-the-language-the-government-tried-to-suppress,"Most of Singapore’s population speak the unofficial language or dialect known as Singlish. But why would the government rather it went away? James Harbeck takes a look. Jerlyne Ong, a Singaporean now living in Canada, sends a message to a friend back home: “Cannot imagine sia. In Singapore, you strike, you lose your job. But ya, the postal service stopped liao. Cannot agree, buay song, so liddat lor. No postal service for now. Also dunno how long some more. So pek chek.” Is that English or not? Most of Singapore’s 6 million people speak it, but they don’t agree either. What they do agree is that it’s Singlish. Singlish is the unofficial language – or dialect? or slang? – of Singapore, born out of the contact between the several cultures that make up the city state. It’s a living example of how languages can change and develop. It is also an expression of the Singaporean character and culture, a national treasure – or a detriment and danger to the country, depending on whom you ask. Singapore is a small island at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, and it was originally populated by Malays. After a British trading post was established there in 1819, many of the traders who arrived were from different Chinese ethnicities: Hokkien, Cantonese, Teochew, Hakka, Hainanese. Some also came from India and Sri Lanka, especially Tamils. By the early 20th Century, there was a pidgin used in trading, but it wasn’t based on English or Chinese – it was called Bazaar Malay. Education was not universal; the better-off families paid to send their children to English-speaking schools to advance their career prospects, and it was in this context that the seeds of Singlish were sown. Singlish didn’t show up first as a pidgin, a lingua franca used in trade. It came about as an adapted version of English used by students in English-language schools who spoke other languages at home. Which means that from the beginning, it had the air of ‘not-quite-right’ English, a version that the students knew wasn’t ‘proper’ – but was functional and had more cultural connection for them. Lah lah land After World War Two, universal free education was instituted in Singapore, and starting in the 1960s it was provided on an ‘English plus mother tongue’ basis: the students would take their classes in English, plus a class in one of the three mother tongues of Singapore – Malay, Tamil, and Chinese (‘Chinese’ in this case meaning not Hokkien or Cantonese but Mandarin: the most prestigious kind, and the most useful for business). The schools were the soil in which Singlish sprouted, and it has now spread through all of everyday life. The population of Singapore today is more than 75% Chinese, about 15% Malay, about 8% ‘Indian’ (mainly Tamil), and roughly 2% other origins, but about half of the population now speak English (or Singlish) at home. And Singlish is the neutral language between members of different ethnic groups. It is undeniably a central expression of Singaporean culture, vibrant, loaded with references from the cultural backgrounds of Singaporeans. And it is still thought of by many Singaporeans as ‘bad English’ even as they use it themselves. You don’t really get a full sense of Singlish from the page. The intonation and pronunciation make it sound even less familiar. Anne Dellos is an American who has lived in Singapore for 19 years; her mother, visiting her, heard her speak Singlish and said she didn’t realise Anne spoke Chinese. Have a listen to this marvellous rendition of a scene from Frozen in Singlish.  All syllables have approximately equal length and stress. It sounds almost like a tone language in places. Some sounds are changed, and consonants at the ends of words are often dropped or reduced – “like that” becomes liddat. Conjugational and plural endings often disappear. There are quite a few loanwords, such as kena, ‘get something bad’; kiasu, ‘fear of losing out’; shiok, ‘very good’; sian, ‘boring’; buay song, ‘not happy’; pek chek, ‘annoyed, frustrated’; and sia, which is used as an emphatic rather as we might use ‘man’. Singlish may seem like heavily accented, grammatically sloppy English, but it has its own coherent, systematic grammar with strong influence from Chinese. Word order is often based more on Mandarin than on English. Anne Dellos says she might say to a taxi driver, “Uncle, you go stun ah. Street too small, tun-roun can not.” (“Go stun”? Go astern; back up.) Words are often left out where they can be assumed, especially pronouns; on the other hand, words may be repeated for emphasis. “Can help me do dis?” “Can, can, confirm can.” The net effect can sound hurried, impatient, or even rude to British ears, but, as Jerlyne Ong points out, “Some people can argue that Singlish is better than English because it’s more efficient.” If someone suggests an activity to which you are not inclined, just say “Don’t want lah.” This won’t, however, endear you to them if they are expecting “Yes, well, we could do that; there are a few other things that might be of interest…” Lah is surely the most famous word in Singlish, and is emblematic of a whole class of words that set Singlish apart: pragmatic particles – a kind of verbal equivalent of an emoji. These words inserted at the ends of sentences are mostly borrowed from other languages (especially Chinese dialects), and they have to be said with the right tone, as if in Chinese. Lor (mid-level tone) expresses resignation (So liddat lor, “It’s just like that, what can you do?”); meh (high tone) expresses a proposition in need of confirmation (Cannot meh, “You really can’t?”); liao (low falling-rising) indicates a completed action (The postal service stopped liao). Even wut – which is to say, what – when said with a low falling tone at the end of a sentence expresses objection (if you are asked to buy something you have already bought, you might say Got already wut). And lah? It can be said with different tones to express different things; quite a bit of linguistic analysis has been done of just what it means – Jock Wong of the Australian National University has done a study teasing apart its different uses, which he boils down to “impositional”, “propositional”, and “persuasive”. Singlish or English? This all may make Singlish sound like a unified and consistent thing, however, and it is not. Although a lighthearted dictionary has been put together for it – the Coxford Singlish Dictionary, by the website TalkingCock.com (there is also a web dictionary of Singlish) – it is not standardised. Even the spelling is not agreed on. It is used differently at different times according to the context and who’s in the conversation. At its most fully realised, it is effectively a different language that uses a lot of English words. At its closest to standard English, it may differ just in pronunciation, use of the pragmatic particles, and a few loan words. And this is part of the problem: Singlish speakers, rather than switching to and from standard English, glide towards and away from it, stylistically. Many people are concerned that Singlish speakers may not be aware that they’re not speaking an English other people can understand. They want the schools to do a better job of inculcating ‘good’ English – the irony being that it’s in the schools that Singlish arose. In 2007, Rani Rubdy of Singapore’s National Institute of Education found that although most primary school students spoke Singlish in informal contexts, nearly all of them agreed that it was best to learn ‘good English’. They also said they always wrote in ‘good English’ – but it turned out that while they did not use Singlish turns of phrase and pragmatic particles, many of them did drop conjugational endings, plural markers, and prepositions. Like primary students elsewhere, they value ‘good English’ a bit more than they use it, it seems. But in Singapore, this will not do: it is bad for business, they say, and for the country’s image. Nonetheless, Singaporeans have a strong connection to Singlish. One of Singapore’s most popular TV sitcoms of the 1990s and 2000s was popular in large part because its main character, Phua Chu Kang, was a Singaporean everyman who spoke in Singlish. The Singaporean government did not like this. In 1999, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said “The more the media makes Singlish socially acceptable, by popularising it in TV shows, the more we make people believe that they can get by with Singlish. This will be a disadvantage to the less educated half of the population.” Following on from that, in 2000, the government instituted a program called the Speak Good English Movement. It at first seemed to aim to eradicate Singlish – Goh Chok Tong, prime minister at the time, said “If they [the younger generation] speak Singlish when they can speak good English, they are doing a disservice to Singapore” – but it now seems to have backed off slightly. Its website, declares, “The Speak Good English Movement recognises the existence of Singlish as a cultural marker for many Singaporeans. We aim to help those who speak only Singlish, and those who think Singlish is English, to speak Standard English.” Must Singlish ultimately die for Singapore to thrive? Some have said so. In 1999, Jaime Ee, in a column in The Straits Times, wrote that Singlish “became an identity thing for us, something that we created ourselves and gave us a sense of rootedness even if nobody else could understand it except us. Unfortunately, if we want to become a global economy, we have to give this up, and in a way, give up a bit of our identity.” But is it necessarily so? Or is that conflict itself central to Singaporean culture? Four national languages and one national linguistic tension? As Wendy Bokhorst-Heng of the National Institute of Education wrote in 2005, “the tensions and the debates around Singlish do not necessarily seek resolution; rather, they themselves have become embedded in Singaporean identity and the imagining of the nation.” Or, to quote Jerlyne Ong, “Because liddat lor.” If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

Spread to US Treasury,The mystery of the lost Roman herb,2024-09-25,2017-09-07,Zaria Gorvett,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170907-the-mystery-of-the-lost-roman-herb,"Julius Caesar kept a cache of it in the government treasury and the Greeks even put it on their money. It was worth its weight in gold – but no one knows if it still exists. Long ago, in the ancient city of Cyrene, there was a herb called silphium. It didn’t look like much – with stout roots, stumpy leaves and bunches of small yellow flowers – but it oozed with an odiferous sap that was so delicious and useful, the plant was eventually worth its weight in gold. To list its uses would be an endless task. Its crunchable stalks were roasted, sauteed or boiled and eaten as a vegetable. Its roots were eaten fresh, dipped in vinegar. It was an excellent preservative for lentils and when it was fed to sheep, their flesh became delectably tender. Perfume was coaxed from its delicate blooms, while its sap was dried and grated liberally over dishes from brains to braised flamingo. Known as “laser”, the condiment was as fundamental to Roman haute cuisine as eating your food horizontally in a toga.  Then there were the medical applications. Silphium was a veritable wonder herb, a panacea for all manner of ailments, including growths of the anus (the Roman author Pliny the Elder recommends repeated fumigations with the root) and the bites of feral dogs (simply rub into the affected area, though Pliny warns his readers never, ever to try this with a tooth cavity, after a man who did so threw himself off a house). Finally, silphium was required in the bedroom, where its juice was drunk as an aphrodisiac or applied “to purge the uterus”. It may have been the first genuinely effective birth control; its heart-shaped seeds are thought to be the reason we associate the symbol with romance to this day. Indeed, the Romans loved it so much, they referenced their darling herb in poems and songs, and wrote it into great works of literature. For centuries, local kings held a monopoly on the plant, which made the city of Cyrene, at modern Shahhat, Libya, the richest in Africa. Before they gave it away to the Romans, the Greek inhabitants even put it on their money. Julius Caesar went so far as to store a cache (1,500lbs or 680kg) in the official treasury. But today, silphium has vanished – possibly just from the region, possibly from our planet altogether. Pliny wrote that within his lifetime, only a single stalk was discovered. It was plucked and sent to the emperor Nero as a curiosity sometime around 54-68AD. With just a handful of stylised images and the accounts of ancient naturalists to go on, the true identity of the Romans’ favourite herb is a mystery. Some think it was driven to extinction, others that it’s still hiding in plain sight as a Mediterranean weed. How did this happen? And could we bring it back? Legend has it that silphium was first discovered after a “black” rain swept across the east coast of Libya over two and a half millennia ago. From then onwards, the herb spread its broad roots ever further, growing luxuriantly on lush hillsides and forest meadows. It might sound strange – after all, North Africa is hardly famed for its greenery, but this was Cyrenaica, a land of tiered highlands with an abundant water supply. Today parts are known to receive up to 850mm of rain (34in) per year, which is nearly as wet as Britain. The region was originally settled by the Greeks and annexed by the Romans in 96BC, followed by Cyrene a couple of decades later. Almost immediately, silphium stocks began to decline at an alarming rate. Within 100 years, it had disappeared altogether.  The thing is, the fussy plant only grew in this region. Its entire range consisted of a narrow strip of land about 125 miles (201km) by 35 miles (40km). Try as they might, neither the Greeks or the Romans could work out how to farm it in captivity. Instead silphium was collected from the wild, and though there were strict rules about how much could be harvested, there was a thriving black market. The dried sap was sold on the streets by unscrupulous “laser dealers” for sky-high prices. They’d say pretty much anything to get you to buy their product, including pawning customers off with the notoriously stinky asafoetida. The spice is popular in India and Central Asia today, where it lends its garlicky notes to dahls, meatballs and roasted vegetables. But now, as in classical times, it is known primarily for its powerful sulphurous smell, like a mixture of dung and overcooked cabbage. Its Latin name means “fetid gum”.  The Romans considered asafetida a reasonable substitute, but some swaps were harder to swallow. It was regularly adulterated with rubber or ground beans, while other spices such as black pepper were bulked out with cheap mustard from Alexandria or even juniper berries; bitter, astringent, best known as the principal flavor in gin, they’re hardly a perfect match, but “…well, they’re a similar size,” says Erica Rowan, a classical historian from the University of Exeter. Central to this botanical riddle is the fact that silphium couldn’t be farmed. But why? The herb stumped even the most enthusiastic plant geek of the day, Theophrastus. Widely known as the father of botany, this Greek author was best friends with another giant – Aristotle, the father of biology – and wrote extensively about the characteristics of plants. Though he didn’t understand why it couldn’t be cultivated either, he observed that they tended to grow best on land which had been dug up the previous year. There are several possible reasons for this. “Often the issue is the seeds,” says Monique Simmonds, deputy director of science at Kew Gardens, London. Take poppies. A single plant can produce up to 60,000 seeds, which means that, assuming 90,000 plants, a single field may contain around 5.4 billion. But they must be exposed to light to grow. Without it, they’ll just sit there until they’re eaten or begin to rot. For this reason, poppies thrive on disturbed land where light can creep into gaps in the soil, such as the battlefields of World War One. But there are other explanations – and perhaps the best place to look for clues is a plant that has eluded farmers to this day.  Every year, hundreds of thousands of people descend on America’s National Parks, from the Pacific Northwest to the mountains of Montana and Idaho. Instead of hiking gear, they’re armed with baskets, pots and pans, ready to brave grizzly bears and territorial gunfights in pursuit of one of the most coveted fruits on the planet: the huckleberry. The tart red berries are added to jams, sauces, pies, ice creams, snow cones, daiquiris, and even curries – and every year, demand exceeds supply. But there isn’t a single commercial huckleberry farm on the continent. After early colonial settlers failed to bring the berry to Europe, serious efforts to cultivate the plant began in 1906. More than a century later, the stubborn shrub still hasn’t yielded to captivity. When they’re grown from seed, they are mysteriously devoid of fruit. The huckleberry is native to the mountain slopes, forests and lake basins of North America. The plant has wide, sprawling roots topped by a bush which grows out of an underground stem. Lacking a dense, centralised root system makes them especially difficult to replant. Early huckleberry farmers made an easy mistake, digging up their long underground stems instead of the roots. Replanting them would be like trying to grow a pile of leaves. But now that they’ve defied the best efforts of modern botany, it looks like there really is no secret trick to growing them. Instead the answer is thought to lie in their natural habitat. “The plants growing in an area can have a big impact on its soil chemistry,” says Simmonds. Farming inevitably alters the balance of elements such as magnesium in the soil, so some plants will never grow well on cultivated land. As of 2017, the only way to grow more huckleberries is to clear some woodland and leave them well alone. According to Kenneth Parejko, emeritus professor of biology at the University of Wisconsin-Stout who has studied the silphium enigma, wildflowers are particularly sensitive to this. “Here in the northern US there are many growing in the prairies, but if you try to take them to plant in your garden – as I have – they don’t survive at all.” On some level, the ancient Greeks may have known this. After attempting to grow silphium in Europe, they wondered if their land might be missing a “humour” necessary to nourish it. But there is another possibility: silphium was a hybrid. Crossing two separate species can have delicious or handy results. When you mix a male camel with a female llama, their cama babies have all the wool-producing talents of their mother and the size and strength of their father. It’s the same story for garden strawberries, which are a cross between North American and Chilean varieties; they’re bigger and juicier than either of their parents. Meanwhile, the oddly-named Toast of Botswana, a one-of-a-kind hybrid of a male goat and female sheep, was an exceptionally fast grower and extraordinarily resilient to disease (it was also unexpectedly lustful, and had to be castrated).  The trick is well known today. One of the most widespread hybrids is corn, which is produced to the tune of around 14 billion bushels (360 million metric tonnes) every year. But while the first generation produced by such unions can be highly desirable, their offspring usually aren’t in the same league. Second-generation hybrids are extremely unpredictable, as the dominant genes from either parent begin to take over and tip the balance of their features. In the end, you might end up with an animal with the temperament of a llama and the wool-making abilities of a camel.  In wild plants, this isn’t a problem. In fact, the hybridisation only needs to happen once – from then on, the plants don’t grow from seed, but asexually, by spreading their roots. This is the case with the cemetery iris, Iris albicans, which produces fragrant white flowers traditionally planted on graves in Muslim regions. It has double the usual number of chromosomes and is completely sterile – yet it has been going strong since its parents met in the Middle Eastern desert thousands of years ago. If silphium were a mongrel, when the Greeks tried to grow some from seed the result could have been barely recognisable. Intriguingly, this fits with ancient reports of silphium from Media (northwest Iran), Syria and Parthia (northeast Iran), which was much less valuable than the stuff from Cyrene. Given the liberal substitutions in ancient markets, it’s possible that these products weren’t silphium at all – but maybe, just maybe, they were the weedy descendants of a hybrid. Either way, the ancient lust for true silphium proved too much. Pliny the Elder wrote that Roman landlords had been forced to fence off the herb’s meadow habitat to stop local sheep from devouring the whole lot. “They might have grazed it right down to the roots and killed it,” says Parejko. Eventually the locals rebelled, tearing the fences down to increase the value of their flock; silphium-fed sheep were the ancient equivalent of Wagyu beef. Amid rising tensions, sometimes they’d break in just to sabotage them. The herb was being attacked from all sides – overharvested and overgrazed. And throughout it all, it may also have been undermined by its own biology. The Greeks had strict rules about how much of the root could be harvested at one time, which suggests that if enough was left in the ground, it would bounce back. But inevitably the economics of supply and demand kicked in. As the plant’s value increased, unscrupulous smugglers may have taken the whole lot. “If you’re going to take the roots, you really need a plant that grows well from seed,” says Simmonds. The story of silphium’s decline is depressingly familiar today. Medicinal herbs are a multi-billion-dollar industry and growing. Many are under threat from climate change and development – and to add insult to injury, the vast majority are collected from the wild. In South Africa alone, 82 medicinal herbs are threatened with extinction and two have already vanished. Meanwhile the bluefin tuna, which swims in the waters off the coast of Libya has still, after decades of trying, never been raised successfully from egg to adult. Like silphium, the latter is becoming ever more profitable as it edges closer to extinction. In early 2017, a single fish was auctioned for £517,000 (US $668,000). But there is a glimmer of hope. There have only been a handful of studies on the plant diversity in Libya – if even a few plants escaped the clutches of the Romans, it may still be found. “It could absolutely still be there. It’s not an easy country to survey,” says Simmonds. Of course, this is made slightly trickier by the fact that no one knows what they’re looking for. “We tend to find the seeds of other plants, such as coriander and dill, at ancient sites. But no one has ever found silphium,” says Rowan. Theophrastus described the plants as having thick roots covered in black bark. They were extravagantly long; if you were to hold one up against the human body, it would be around the distance from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger (an ancient unit of measurement known as a cubit). Though the plant was “most peculiar”, he said it had a hollow stalk a bit like fennel and golden leaves which resembled those of celery.  The ancient coins which bear its image show a plant with flowers arranged in what botanists call a “large apical umbel”, which Parejko describes as a disc like the end of a watering can. “It would have looked quite conspicuous,” says Simmonds. Theophrastus compared it to another herb, Magydaris pastinacea, which grew in Syria and on the slopes of Mount Parnassus near the Greek city of Delphi. He believed both were “spineless under shrubs” related to fennel. He may have been onto something. Scientists now think that, like asafoetida, silphium may have belonged to a group of fennel-like plants, the Ferula. They are actually related to carrots and grow wild as weeds across North Africa and the Mediterranean. Incredibly, two of these plants – giant Tangier fennel and giant fennel – still exist in Libya today. It’s possible that one of these is silphium. So could silphium make a comeback? According to Rowan, even if the herb isn’t extinct, it probably wouldn’t be to modern tastes – in the Western world at least. “There’s a whole bunch of seasonings that the Romans used to use, like lovage, that today most people haven’t even heard of,” says Rowan. Back in the day, lovage was a staple of the Roman dinner table. Today it’s virtually impossible to buy, consigned to niche online shops and obscure corners of garden centres. In fact, Roman cuisine wasn’t at all like Italian food. It was all about contrasting sweet with salty and sour foods (they liked to eat fishgut sauce, garum, with melon). Instead Rowan compares it to modern Chinese food. “If it was edible, they were eating it – nothing was off the table,” she says. If you’d like to see for yourself, why not try this Roman recipe for braised flamingo and parrot, substituting asafoetida for laser. Scald the flamingo, wash and dress it, put it in a pot, add water, salt, dill, and a little vinegar, to be parboiled. Finish cooking with a bunch of leeks and coriander, and add some reduced must [condensed grape mush] to give it color. In the mortar crush pepper, cumin, coriander, laser root, mint, rue, moisten with vinegar, add dates, and the fond [drippings] of the braised bird, thicken, strain, cover the bird with the sauce and serve. Parrot is prepared in the same manner. Apicus 6.231 We may never learn the true identity of silphium, but we can learn from its decline. The last survey of Cyrene showed that many species are rapidly disappearing, as land is given over to deserts and once again, it’s overgrazed. The Roman Empire may be long gone – but it seems we’re repeating the same mistakes. -- Join 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.

Spread to US Treasury,The kingdom of the crystal skull,2024-09-25,2012-01-30,Alex von Tunzelmann,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20120123-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull,"An English explorer, in search of a crystal skull in the jungles of Belize, may well be the inspiration for Indiana Jones. Follow his legendary adventure. The jungle is cold at night. By the light of a crescent moon, we trek through pines and palms, pushing stray foliage aside, lifting our feet high over the treacherous knotted roots of strangler figs. The air smells of wet earth. It is still, and quiet, but we humans are not the only ones awake. A pair of eyes shines from the darkness, glimpses us, and is gone. Through gaps in the trees above, the black
sky looks like a jeweller’s display, studded with millions of glittering stars.
Ancient Mayans believed their sun god turned into a jaguar at dusk, and the
constellations were his spots. Branches crack underfoot, but it is wise to
tread carefully. Real jaguars roam these forests.  Through the gloom, the edges of a colossal
pyramid rise up above the jungle canopy. It is one edge of a city, vanished for
a millennium: Caracol, once the centre of a mighty Mayan empire.  More than 80 years ago, another adventurer
came to these jungles, looking for lost cities, buried treasure and mystical
ancient objects with strange powers. He was a dashing archaeologist between the
two World Wars, instantly recognisable by his trademark hat. But his name was
not Indiana Jones. It was FA Mitchell-Hedges.  George Lucas and Steven Spielberg have
always denied that there was one specific inspiration for Indiana Jones, but
Mitchell- Hedges – who gets name-checked in the fourth movie – is a
well-qualified candidate. Like Indy, Mitchell-Hedges’s version of a career in
archaeology involved blowing things up, fighting villains and being callous to
the scores of women who fell hopelessly in love with him.  We scramble through the mists up the side
of one acropolis, clinging to the creepers and allspice trees that have
overgrown it. What remains of the stairway belize on foot is slicked with moss
and dew. It is easy to lose your footing, and tumble back down, bouncing off
the steps like the sacrificial victims of a thousand years ago.  As the sky lightens to delicate shades of
pale blue and tangerine, we reach the peak. A blood-curdling roar splits the
silence. ‘Have you seen Jurassic Park?’ asks Calbert, our guide, a Mayan from a
nearby village. ‘Just kidding. That’s a howler monkey.’ A whole family of them,
swinging through the trees on long black tails, babies clinging to the backs of
adults. The noise is unbelievable: like something from the fires of hell. No
wonder the Mayans worshipped howler monkey gods.  Just then, the sun glimmers over the
horizon, and the ruined city is flooded with warm rose gold. This is the sight
ancient priests awaited every morning: their god returning from his jaguar
form, and illuminating the observatory with his blessing. The pink light picks
out mysterious carvings in the stone, telling of ancient victories against the
rival kingdom of Tikal, of captured slaves, of the blood sacrifice of a
princess. But of the most mysterious artefact of all, there is no trace. For
this is the kingdom of the crystal skull.  The
legend of the crystal skull  
Indiana Jones may have looked for crystal skulls in Peru, but he was way off
track. The legend of the skulls comes from Belize, which is where
Mitchell-Hedges came to look for mysteries back in 1926. Mitchell-Hedges
claimed that he never sought fame, but this was not strictly true: he had his
own radio show in New York, and wrote memoirs with titles such as Danger, My
Ally and Battles With Giant Fish. He claimed to have fought with Pancho Villa
in the Mexican Revolution, to have been asked by the British secret service to
spy on Trotsky, and to have found the lost empire of Atlantis. Along the way,
he stopped to hunt crocodiles, wrestle tiger sharks and engage in steamy romps
with bar wenches. But his most famous feat was the discovery of the Skull of
Doom, a lump of rock crystal fashioned into the shape of a human skull,
glittering among the rubble in the ruined Mayan city of Lubaantun, Belize.
Ancient priests, he said, could focus their energies through it, and will the
death of their enemies. ‘Several people who have cynically laughed at it have
died,’ he warned.  Even at risk of incurring death by Mayan
curse, it is tempting to laugh cynically. The Skull of Doom was a fraud. It was
almost certainly one of several that a dubious antiques dealer, Eugene Boban,
secretly commissioned from German craftsmen in the 19th century. Boban sold a
number of these skulls, on the pretence that they were of ancient Mayan or
Aztec origin: one ended up in the Smithsonian Museum, Washington DC, and one in
the British Museum. These days, both museums have their skulls labelled as
fakes. Mitchell-Hedges, the old charlatan, did not find his skull at Lubaantun.
He still had the receipt from when he bought it at Sotheby’s.  How many of Mitchell-Hedges’s adventures
were real, and how many only existed in his imagination, is unknown. But he did
come to Belize, hacking through jungles, meeting Mayan villagers and exploring
deserted, tropical archipelagos, and he did excavate the ruins at Lubaantun.
Clutching a dusty copy of his Belizean travelogue, Land of Wonder and Fear, I
set out on the Hummingbird Highway to follow the route of his real-life
adventure.  Meeting
Captain Buck  
Belize, formerly British Honduras, is a small country crammed with diversity.
Ecosystems range from mountainous pine forests to reefs, savannahs to jungles.
These support a plethora of flora and fauna, including 540 species of bird and
124 species of mammal. The human population is diverse too. Mayan teenagers in
hoodies shop in the Ah Fang Taiwanese supermarket. Bearded Amish and Mennonite
men drive their horse-carts past the Bismilla Lebanese café. South Asian youths
play pool in a roadside shack. Creoles and Canadians dance the night away to
Garifuna music, the unique blend of African and Amerindian cultures created
when, in 1635, escaped African slaves from a Spanish ship allied with the
native Caribs on St Vincent, and later spread to Belize. Even in remote
villages, most people will happily chat away to you in perfect English. Belize
is the only Anglophone country in Central America, making it easy and
pleasurable to explore, and to meet new friends along the way.  It is not long before we reach the
colourful seaside town of Dangriga. My plan, scribbled on a scrap of paper,
sounds more like Moby-Dick than Raiders of the Lost Ark: I should go to the
Riverside Café and look for one Captain Buck. No disappointment is in store
for, aside from having both legs and being Creole, Captain Buck looks the part
of Captain Ahab. He is a grizzled old seadog in a booth near the bar, tucking
into the local delicacy of crispy pastries – known as fry jack, and served with
everything. The Captain isn’t much of a talker. He nods towards his motorboat,
moored just outside.  It is a searingly bright Caribbean day, and
the sea glitters as if filled with sequins. Ten minutes out of the harbour, a
shiny grey fin breaks the surface. Captain Buck veers the boat over towards it.
For a fleeting second, four or five bottlenose dolphins curve out of the surf
by the bow, before plunging back into the depths.  Buck fires the motor again to Man-O’- War
Caye, a tiny island that seems from the distance to have some sort of
pestilence buzzing above it. But the specks in the air are not flies. They are
hundreds of magnificent frigatebirds, swooping and gliding over their nesting
spot. Captain Buck takes the boat so close that we are enveloped in their
flock: the males puffing up scarlet throats, the females circling the trees. An
inquisitive pelican paddles up to the boat to see if we have fish to spare.  Past Man-O’-War Caye, we cross a mangrove
lagoon enclosed between two sandy crescents. It is filled with manatees, giant
sea mammals that were supposedly mistaken for mermaids by the sailors of yore.
The manatee is a noble beast but, with its sunken eyes, bloated cigar-shaped
body and lumpy face, it is not the prettiest. Those sailors had not seen a
woman for a very long time. Finally, we reach Tobacco Caye, the same tiny
sandstrip where Mitchell-Hedges broke his journey south from Belize City to
Punta Gorda. These days, it is home to a cluster of cabanas for snorkelers,
divers and kayakers.  Belize is famous for its dive sites,
particularly the Great Blue Hole – a perfectly circular sinkhole, as wide as
the Eiffel Tower is tall, set in the middle of Lighthouse Reef. Plunging to 120
metres, the hole is a favourite lurking ground of sharks, and was made famous
by Jacques Cousteau. Even for the casual snorkeler, there are plenty of thrills
to be had, and Tobacco Caye is an ideal spot to start having them: the reef
starts just a few yards offshore. If you can persuade Captain Buck to take you
out to a channel, you can jump in amid eagle rays, turtles, tarpon, barracudas
and even whale sharks.  The
temptation of the exotic  
Mitchell-Hedges was more into battling giant fish than appreciating them, and
he spent his time on Tobacco Caye alternately big-game fishing and scouring the
islands for Mayan ruins. He found lots of fish, but no Mayans. As the sun
begins to dip and the sky fades from azure to violet, my inquiries about
crystal skulls don’t get very far either. Kirk, the barman at Tobacco Caye
Lodge, looks confused: ‘Crystal who?’ I explain. He gives me a pitying look and
a piña colada.  The piña colada – rum, coconut milk, and
fresh pineapple – brings to mind a very different aspect of Mitchell-Hedges’s
adventures. Once, he claimed to have been presented with exotic fruit by an
admiring tribe of female Amerindians, who hoped he might be the answer to their
acute shortage of husbands. Manfully, he resisted, with the immortal words:
‘Personally, I refuse to be seduced by pineapples.’ If pineapples test your
fortitude, you could be in trouble. Piña coladas made fresh on the beach, with
authentic Belizean fruit, are shamefully seductive at the end of a hot
Caribbean day.  Back on the mainland, we head south,
through the eerie primeval swamps of the Cockscomb Basin. Trekking along muddy
jungle paths, we follow a trail of fresh jaguar paw prints. The cat does not
want to be found. Instead, it leads us to a ghostly sight: the rusting chassis
of a high-wing aircraft, crashed into the trees many years ago by some
zoologists. They survived, but left the wreck to be eaten up by the jungle.  Few tourists make it further south than
Placencia, a glitzy peninsula inhabited by Belize’s celebrities, but that is a
huge mistake. Southern Belize’s little-known Toledo district is outstandingly
beautiful, and a true wilderness: 1,700 square miles, 26,000 people and only
three petrol stations. No big resorts befoul the coastline, and the only
airport is a landing strip, accepting nothing much larger than a 16-seater
plane. With a local expert, such as guide Bruno Kuppinger, you can have a true
travel adventure.  After a few years playing the stock market
in New York, Mitchell-Hedges complained that he had been ‘sidetracked into a
counterfeit jungle of counterfeit excitement when I should have been rollicking
down the trail of adventure in the primitive, unspoiled wilds’. Similarly,
Bruno was a successful businessman in Germany before he got fed up with the rat
race, and moved to Belize to live in a tent.  But there the similarity between the two
men ends, for Bruno is an unassuming man of extensive cultural knowledge and
unimpeachable honesty. ‘Oh, ja, the famous crystal skull,’ he says, eyeing me
nervously to check my sanity. ‘It’s not mentioned in the excavation reports.
But I can take you to meet someone who knows all about it.’  Alien
intervention?  
Daryl Capps lives in the pretty seaside town of Punta Gorda. This white-haired,
congenial American was a member of the Society of the Crystal Skulls, founded
in 1945 in California to investigate the paranormal and archaeological claims
made for these objects. Daryl has chosen to make his home here, just 26 miles
from Lubaantun – but he doesn’t believe the Skull of Doom is genuine. ‘It’s too
perfect,’ he says, with a laugh. ‘Some people think crystal skulls are of
alien origin,’ he continues, pointing to a photograph taken through the Skull
of Doom, which appears to show a shadow of a 1950s-style flying saucer through
the middle of it. ‘But look at the uncropped photo.’ In the full version, the
origin of the flying saucer is revealed: it’s a 1950s-style ceiling fan,
refracted through the skull.  Sceptic though he may be, Daryl does
believe that several of the other crystal skulls purportedly discovered all
over the Americas are authentic – and raises the question of whether they may
emit mysterious psychometric energies. The British Museum is circumspect,
pointing out that no crystal skull has ever been found at a well-documented,
official excavation. As for me, I couldn’t say it better than Indiana Jones: ‘I
don’t believe in magic, a lot of superstitious hocuspocus. I’m going after a
find of incredible historical significance.’ Lubaantun itself is that find, and
it’s within a few hours’ reach, up the river and through thick forests.  From Punta Gorda, Mitchell-Hedges took
canoes up the Rio Grande (not to be confused with the river of the same name
that’s part of the US-Mexico border). Now, the journey is made by motorboat. As
saltwater turns to freshwater, the mangroves are replaced by huge cohune palms,
their quills of green leaves held high in the warm air, and by sturdy cotton
trees, with pale, gnarled roots stretching down to the shore. Creepers trail
into the crocodile-infested river. In a feathery thicket of bamboo, gigantic
orange and grey iguanas hang heavy, like living Christmas decorations. Three
Mayan children crawl on their bellies along an overhanging trunk, hoping to catch
one of these monsters for dinner.  Around Lubaantun, most of the Mayan
population lives in villages of pimento sticks and palm thatch. When we arrive,
the women come to greet us, wearing puffsleeved dresses in shades of flax,
grape and lime. The Mayans here stood firm against imperial rule until the 17th
century. Neither army nor church could conquer them: they were finished off by
European diseases. The current population migrated from Guatemala a century
ago, and has re-established a traditional way of life.  The
city’s mysteries  
Lubaantun is neither the largest nor the most elaborate of pre-conquest Mayan
sites, but it is one of the most atmospheric. After you have navigated dirt
tracks in an all-terrain vehicle, you scramble down a perilous grassy slope cut
into the trees, cross a bridge, then climb a hillside to a high plateau. It is
late afternoon when we reach the edge of the city: piles of sandstone slabs,
heaped higgledy-piggledy, amid dense palms and swirls of mist.  These stones were cut so precisely that
they once fitted together without cement. Now, they lie scattered around, like building
blocks in a messy child’s room. The reason is not just the passage of
centuries. Mitchell-Hedges’s partner in crime, Thomas Gann, ‘excavated’ this
city using dynamite.  By blasting huge holes in the sides of
ancient monuments, he hoped to find tombs filled with gold. But Gann, like the
conquistador Hernán Cortés before him, found no gold in the Mayan lands. Mayans
didn’t value the stuff; their most prized substance was jade. And, like Cortés,
Gann caused irreparable damage in his obsessive pursuit of riches.  The good news is that the ruined ruins at
Lubaantun comprise a tiny part of the entire site. ‘Ninety per cent of
Lubaantun has never been excavated,’ Bruno tells me. So there are mysteries
still lying here, undiscovered? ‘Oh ja, all around these hills.’ Maybe a
crystal skull? ‘No, I don’t think so.’ Bruno does not want anyone turning up
with a case of dynamite, but there is a better option. ‘We are hoping to start
archaeology tours at Uxbenka, southwest of Lubaantun. Visitors will be able to
dig on the ruins, but it will all be done under proper academic supervision.’  As it sinks down into the mists, the sun
turns blood orange. The city is quiet, except for the chirping of cicadas. A
millennium ago, priests and nobles in feathered headdresses strode the avenues.
Merchants traded obsidian in the busy markets. Young men played for cheering
crowds in the ballcourts. Now, it has all been swallowed up by the jungle, many
of its secrets lost forever. ‘In the setting sun the immensity of the ruins we
had uncovered came home to us with overwhelming force,’ wrote Mitchell-Hedges
at this very spot. ‘Slowly the sky crimsoned, a red glow tinged the jungle and
the desolate courtyards, the terraces, the pyramids of this great city which we
had called Lubaantun – the Maya word for “The City of Fallen Stones.”’  And the crystal skull? Lubaantun is full of
mysteries, but that isn’t one of them. The Old Belize Bar in Belize City has a
plastic copy you can have your photograph taken with. It’s only slightly less
authentic than the Skull of Doom. Should you wish to be seduced by pineapples,
they’ll even serve you another piña colada while you, like Mitchell-Hedges,
watch the sun set over the horizon. Unlike him, you won’t need to invent your
adventures.

Spread to US Treasury,The true story of Jaws,2024-09-25,2016-07-13,Michael Capuzzo,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160713-the-true-story-of-jaws,"In July 1916 a terrifying series of shark attacks changed popular culture forever. Michael Capuzzo looks back at the events that shaped an enduring obsession. One hundred years ago this month, as the Battle of the Somme raged, US President Woodrow Wilson was ensconced in his summer residence in Asbury Park, New Jersey, on the lovely Edwardian coast where the power elite strolled the boardwalk. Although he promised to keep the United States from entering World War One, Wilson proved as powerless as the man who “kept us out of war,” his campaign slogan, as he was at keeping Americans out of the water. Swimming offshore was a sea creature, then largely unknown to science and a mere infant, a ‘Sea Monster’ some 9ft (2.7m) long with jagged baby teeth, that would briefly displace the war and Mr Wilson in the headlines, and in time make a bigger splash than either in the peculiar annals of US popular culture, becoming the first blockbuster movie star, and ensuring the Great White Shark would be remembered when the Great War was forgotten. In July 1916, five Americans out for a swim were attacked and four were killed by the juvenile great white shark on the Jersey shore. In the rogue series of attacks from 1-12 July, unprecedented in history to this day, the shark enacted a reign of terror as he cruised 70 miles (112.6km) along Atlantic beaches during the height of the season, from a beach town north of Atlantic City to a farm town on an inland creek that fed New York Harbour, plucking victims out of their summer reverie. The first death in Beach Haven, New Jersey was the mauling of recent University of Pennsylvania graduate Charles Vansant, a doctor’s son from Philadelphia. It went largely unnoticed. People on the beach who heard his screams thought he was joking. Scientists of the day said sharks lacked the ‘jaw power’ to bite through human bone. It was the first recorded fatal shark attack in US history, but nobody knew it then. There was no Discovery Channel, or Shark Week, though the juvenile shark was about to change that. After death number two, beach-goers found a bloodied body recovered from the deep and laid on the sands, bitten in half. They went running from the beach, screaming in mortal terror. Suddenly the real-life monster made the front page of The New York Times. Another horribly mauled swimmer was pulled to his death in an estuary; a would-be hero wrestled with the shark and was also killed. Town mayors tried to deny it was happening, fearful of losing seaside resort dollars, until the horror forced those resorts to close, and politicians called in scientists for help. An expert at the American Museum of Natural History struggled to identify the species of the killer before honing in on the legendary man-eater Carcharodon carcharias, the great white shark. In a wave of panic, enraged men grabbed rifles and pitchforks and led shark hunts, vowing to kill the monster. The shark was finally killed by a hero as it attacked his boat. Stranger than fiction Sound familiar? It’s the true story of Jaws, a lost treasure of history literally buried beneath the waves. I retrieved it in 2001, while living in New Jersey, and told the story in my non-fiction book Close To Shore. In 1974, Peter Benchley moved the story from New Jersey resorts to the fictional Long Island resort of Amity in his best-selling novel, Jaws. Benchley’s shark kills four people, including a victim in an estuary. A would-be hero wrestles with the shark and dies. The mayor denies it’s happening and protects the tourist dollar until the horror forces him to turn to a scientist. The fictional ichthyologist at the New York Aquarium on Coney Island struggles to identify the species of the killer before zeroing in on the legendary man-eater, Carcharodon carcharias, the great white shark, and warns people that it happened in 1916 and could happen again.  Crazed men lead a shark hunt. The shark is killed by a hero as it attacks his boat. I interviewed Benchley, who said the novel grew out of his lifelong interest in shark attacks, including the exploits of Frank Mundus, the Montauk, Long Island sport fisherman who landed a record 3,427-pound (1554kg) great white. But in a later introduction to Jaws he wrote of his research: “Did sharks…stay in one area, killing and killing again? Darn right.  Remember the shark that went up a New Jersey river in 1916 and killed four people? Time and again, I confidently assured interviewers that every single incident described in Jaws...had actually happened.” Benchley’s novel was a cultural sensation that swept across the globe. Fidel Castro said Tiburon, the title in Spanish, was a metaphor for predatory capitalism. Others said it was about Richard Nixon and Watergate. It stayed near the top of the New York Times hardback bestseller list for 44 weeks – curiously never able to dislodge a rabbit tale, Watership Down, from number one – but would not likely have changed history on its own. A bigger splash The next summer, 1975, Steven Spielberg released Jaws, the movie. New Jersey’s Edwardian-era baby shark was recast as a giant fictional 1970s mechanical monster, and swimming was never the same. Jaws took the lazy out of summer. It gave us Hollywood’s first summer blockbuster, providing the business model for everything from Star Wars to Jurassic Park and Titanic as well as this summer’s shark thriller, The Shallows. It also provided the template for some horrible horror films, including, some critics said, the three Jaws sequels. The film truly horrified prominent shark scientists like George Burgess at the University of Florida: by falsely portraying the great white as vengeful hunter of humans – in fact, sharks don’t target people except by rare mistake – it inspired dozens of shark-fishing tournaments on the east coast of the US that killed “without remorse,” he says. In recent decades, shark hunts had a role in decimating nearly every shark species. But Jaws also provoked the rise of a shark and ocean conservation movement, inspired shark biologists to do more and better research, research funding increased, and scientists spread the more enlightened view that sharks are part of the environment, Burgess says, not to be demonised but “respected as you would anything else in the wilderness.” Burgess listed the 1916 attacker in the official International Shark Attack file as a great white, but other scientists say the creek attacker was a bull shark. That mystery will never be solved. Meanwhile tens of thousands of people around the world, new phobics created with each viewing of the film, “won’t put their foot in the water because of Jaws,” Burgess says. Some things you can’t forget, like Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss, the biologist, begging the mayor to close the beaches for 4 July because two dead was just the start. “It's gonna happen again, it happened before! The Jersey beach! ... 1916! Five people chewed up on the surf!"" One can only wonder if Wilson had successfully run on the slogan, “He kept us out of the water,” how history might have been different.

Spread to US Treasury,Uncovering caves full of treasure,2024-09-25,2015-02-23,Jonathan Glancey,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150223-uncovering-caves-full-of-treasure,"The Ajanta Caves were a sanctuary for Buddhist monks that was forgotten, along with its stunning riches, for nearly 1,500 years. Jonathan Glancey investigates. The Ajanta Caves, 30 spellbinding Buddhist prayer halls and monasteries carved, as if by sorcery, into a horseshoe-shaped rock face in a mountainous region of India’s Maharashtra state, 450km (280 miles) east of Mumbai, were ‘discovered’ by accident in 1819. Unknown for more than 1,000 years except to wild animals, insects, flood waters, prodigious foliage and perhaps the local Bhil people, this magnificent work of art, architecture and contemplation, was abandoned by those who created it as long ago as AD 500. In 1983 it was designated a Unesco World Heritage Site. John Smith, a young British cavalry officer, was on a tiger hunt when he spotted the mouth of a cave high above the Waghora (Tiger) River that could only have been man made. Scrambling up with his party, Smith entered the cave and, branding a flaming grass torch, encountered a great vaulted and colonnaded hall, its walls covered in faded paintings. Beneath a dome, a timeless praying Buddha fronted a mound-like shrine, or stupa. Smith carved his name on a statue of a Bodhisattva, a figure representing one of the past lives of the Buddha before he achieved Nirvana, or union with the divine spirit. Since then, thousands of people have added their names as the Ajanta caves – a gallery of the oldest and some of the finest of all Buddhist art – has gained fame and become a compelling tourist attraction. News of Smith’s find spread quickly. In 1844, Major Robert Gill was commissioned by the Royal Asiatic Society to create reproductions on canvas of the wall paintings. This was the beginning of measures to reveal and document the prayer halls (chaityagrihas) and monasteries (viharas) that had, it seems, been hewn from solid rock in two phases, the first – five prayer halls – between the 1st  and 2nd  centuries BC and, the second – 25 monasteries, or monks’ lodgings – in the 5th Century AD. Gill worked in truly difficult conditions. Not only was it often unbearably hot, but this was still tiger country, and the fierce Bhil people had never come to terms with invaders, whether Hindu or Moghul emperors or 19th Century British military. Lost to time What Gill and other visitors saw, having climbed ropes and ladders, to reach the caves – the original stone stairs had long gone – was architecture of a very high order and sculpture and paintings that took the breath away. Here, Buddhist monks had gazed on thousands of lustrous images of the lives the Buddha – Siddhartha Gautama – had lived before this 6th Century Indian prince took up teaching and inspired a way of thinking and being practiced by hundreds of millions around the world today. Between images of the Buddha, were sensuous representations of glamorous princes and princesses, of animals, palaces, silks, jewellery, of lovemaking and life in all its mortal richness. Some of the images shocked Victorian sensibilities and are still condemned by religious zealots unable to comprehend that what these Indian artists saw was a joyous vision of natural fecundity and divine beauty. Along with the1st Century AD architecture, these paintings showed remarkable affinities to classical Greek art. This was not coincidence, but evidence of a Greco-Indian culture that had spread from the 4th Century BC expeditions of Alexander the Great. It stretched through Hellenistic kingdoms and trade routes from the Mediterranean to Persia, Afghanistan and India – with Ajanta along the way – to distant China and Japan. Twenty-seven of Gill’s canvases were displayed in the Indian Court of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, south London; in 1866, 23 were destroyed by fire. Newly armed with a camera as well as brushes, Gill set to work again. Meanwhile, the Royal Cave Temple Commission founded by the Royal Asiatic Society in 1848 had led to the foundation in 1861 of the Archaeological Survey of India. Concern for the treasures of Ajanta grew, as did the number of intrepid experts and treasure hunters, some of whom did more than carve their names on statues: they scraped paintings from walls which crumbled into dust. One of the few known surviving paintings to have left Ajanta intact is in the care of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts today. It had been sold in 1924 for £1,000 at Sotheby’s in London. The Government of Bombay commissioned new copies of the Ajanta cave paintings in 1872 from John Griffiths, principal of the Bombay School of Art. Griffiths and his students produced 300 paintings, only for a third to go up in flames at London’s Imperial Institute in 1885. In 1909, Lady Herringham, suffragette and art patron, began further copies with help from the Calcutta School of Art, and from the late 1920s the Indian art historian Ghulam Yazdani made a comprehensive photographic survey of the art of Ajanta, published in four volumes between 1930 and 1955. That was the year the surviving Griffiths paintings were put in store by the Victoria & Albert Museum. Inaccessible and forgotten for half a century, in 2005 81 were uncovered and restored. Searching for understanding Since 1999, a team led by Rajdeo Singh of the Archaeological Survey of India, using new methods developed in Japan, have revealed the intense colours and sheer beauty of many of the 1st Century AD portraits along with the subtlety of their artists’ use of perspective, shading and other three-dimensional techniques including the use of bright stones, notably lapis lazuli from Afghanistan. Their meticulous restoration raised anew questions asked many times over the past 200 years. How did the artists paint so well, with such precise use of colour, in the dark recesses of these rock-carved prayer halls and monasteries? Just how many architects, masons, sculptors and painters would have been at work between from circa AD 460-500 when so much of this glorious place, paid for by merchants and courtiers during the reign of the Vakataka dynasty emperor Harisena, was created? And, in those brief years before the fall of the Vakataka empire and its patronage of Buddhist art, could this really have been a place of quiet contemplation when it must have been one vast building site? The many archaeological ventures over the past two centuries seeking to answer these questions, as well as to uncover, document and conserve this feast of Buddhist creativity have added immeasurably to Ajanta’s fame, along with the tramp of ever increasing tourists. In 2013, four replica caves, created by the Mumbai-based designer Rakesh Rathod, were opened at the visitor centre 4km (2.5 miles) from the rock face. The idea was to reduce numbers heading to the precious chaityagrihas and viharas. The fake caves, however, have not been a success: evidently, visitors want the real thing even though many clearly revel in the shopping bazaar and food stalls greeting anyone making pilgrimages to Ajanta today. And, yet the serenity of the sleeping Buddha lying in one of the caves, the summer and winter solstice sunlight illuminating statues of the praying Buddha, the spellbinding architecture and the compelling beauty of the wall paintings lift Ajanta above such worldly concerns. This might be a tourist magnet, yet thanks to generations of conservationists, Ajanta remains a gateway to Nirvana.

Spread to US Treasury,TV and films to binge in lockdown,2024-09-25,2020-05-01,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200501-tv-films-and-books-to-binge-in-lockdown-this-weekend,"The latest arts and culture to comfort and inspire at home – including new film releases, a teen comedy series from Mindy Kaling and a novel about a pandemic. New film – Jojo Rabbit Taika Waititi’s Oscar-nominated World War Two comedy stars Roman Griffin Davis as Johannes, a 10-year-old German boy who is so taken in by Nazi propaganda that his imaginary friend is none other than Adolf Hitler (Waititi at his silliest). But Johannes’ conviction is chipped away when he discovers that his mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a Jewish refugee (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic. Jojo Rabbit is a one-off: both a sweet-natured, feelgood family farce, and a drama about the degradation of war, the cruel absurdity of extremist dogma, and the possibility of redemption. Available on Prime Video and SkyStore (NB) New TV – Never Have I Ever While it might not get points for originality in terms of theme, Netflix’s newest teen comedy, Never Have I Ever, is still a refreshing look at the genre. Despite containing many of the tropes of adolescence on screen – the protagonist betrays her lifelong friends in pursuit of a pretty boy whom she won’t eventually end up with, as she learns the value of deep human connections – this series by Mindy Kaling gets points for finally nailing what diversity should look like. Protagonist Devi is of Indian descent and while being all-American, her heritage is still very much part of her life without taking centre-stage or making her a caricature. She’s an insolent teen of her own accord and because she is struggling with the loss of her father, not because she is trying to break out of a repressive culture – and the same treatment is given to the East Asian, black and disabled supporting characters. Narrated by John McEnroe for no obvious reason, it’s a heartwarming show perfect for a weekend watch. (LW) Art – The Line While projects like the Isolation Art School on Instagram or Art UK’s Home School offer tips and activities for those stuck at home, images created in response to coronavirus have appeared outside all over the world. They include street art thanking health workers as well as artist-designed public safety announcements and messages of hope and solidarity – like those featuring in a citywide campaign recently launched in New York. And now an outdoors initiative can be viewed online for the first time: London’s first dedicated public art walk, The Line, has just launched an interactive map allowing browsers to take a virtual stroll along the three-mile-long sculpture trail. With works by artists like Anish Kapoor, Antony Gormley and Alex Chinneck (A Bullet from a Shooting Star, pictured), it offers a guided tour through a range of striking installations – as well as the history and wildlife of London’s docklands. (FM) Classic TV – Detectorists  Take in the sights and sounds of glorious summers in the beautiful English countryside in this warm-hearted but very droll comedy from 2014. Two friends – Andy (Mackenzie Crook) and Lance (Toby Jones) – try to balance their hobby of metal-detecting with their sometimes messy personal lives. Over three series and a Christmas special, the pair dream of finding Saxon gold while bantering with each other in the corner of an Essex field – but the real treasure to be found here is in following their relationship ups-and-downs, which feel truly genuine. That’s largely due to Crook’s beautifully-crafted script of subtle comedy, which is a rare find indeed. Available on Britbox, BBC iPlayer and Amazon Prime Video. (EM) Classic film – My Neighbour Totoro (1988) This is the cartoon that introduced Studio Ghibli’s hand-painted enchantment to the world beyond Japan. Directed by Hiyao Miyazaki, it’s a bucolic, 1950s-set fairy tale about two young girls who are befriended by some magical woodland creatures, including the enormous, cuddly, rabbit-eared Totoro. The girls have moved to the countryside because their mother is sick, so My Neighbour Totoro captures how worrying sickness can be for children. But it also reassures them of the joy to be had from playing and dreaming... and riding in a bus that happens to be a giant cat. Available on Netflix and HBO Max (NB) Isolation book – The End of October A staff writer for The New Yorker, Lawrence Wright has published 10 books of non-fiction, including Going Clear, a fascinating insight into the relationship between Scientology and Hollywood, which was made into a film by Alex Gibney in 2015. You’d be forgiven for thinking that Wright’s latest is non-fiction too, but in fact it’s a thriller, whose protagonist is Henry Parsons, an epidemiologist for the World Health Organisation. Sent to investigate the breakout of a deadly disease at an internment camp in Indonesia, Parsons leads a team in a race against time to stop the virus as it spreads across the US. The New York Times describes the novel as “a real if solemn entertainment, a stay against boredom and a kind of offered prayer for the best in us to rise to the surface”, while the New York Post calls it a “page-turner that has the earmarks of an instant bestseller”. (RL) Design – Fashion and Textile Museum Fashion fans keen to keep up sartorial standards during the lockdown can be inspired by the Fashion and Textile Museum’s blog, which features some fascinating articles and images. A highlight is a history of the pyjama, which originated during the Ottoman Empire, the word deriving from the Hindi word ‘pae jama’. The garments were adopted as sleepwear in Britain in the late 19th Century, then worn as glamorous beachwear and daywear in the roaring ‘20s. Silk Pyjamas were later favoured by chic stars such as Marlene Dietrich. In the late 1960s, Halston debuted ‘pyjama dressing’, and the pyjama as sleek eveningwear was born. For those wanting to remain elegant at home – while also keeping comfortable – it makes for an inspiring read. (LB) Podcast – Homo Sapiens Set up as an LGBTQ+ answer to the BBC radio programme Woman’s Hour, this podcast exploring queer lives and issues amid lots of amusing chit-chat now returns for a fourth series with a new co-presenter in the form of puckish actor Alan Cumming, alongside original host Chris Sweeney. And they’ve got a particularly stellar line-up of guests for this run: upcoming episodes will feature rock legend Patti Smith, comedian Hannah Gadsby, and Sex and the City star turned political contender Cynthia Nixon, while this week they’ve kicked off with a conversation with Britain’s favourite polymath Stephen Fry. (HM) If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

Spread to US Treasury,Plastic bag use plunges and Army fights fake news,2024-09-25,2019-07-31,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-49186845,"Many papers examine Chancellor Sajid Javid's attempt to ""turbo-charge"" - as the Daily Telegraph calls it - no-deal Brexit plans with an extra £2.1bn. A Treasury source tells the Telegraph it marks a ""cultural change"" and that its speed is testament to the chancellor's determination to get things done.  Meanwhile, a Whitehall source tells the Daily Mail that the government wants the Treasury to act as a motor for Brexit, not a brake, adding: ""And that is what is happening."" But the Labour chairwoman of the public accounts committee, Meg Hillier, accuses the prime minister of waging ""an expensive form of megaphone politics aimed at Brussels"".  Writing in the Daily Mirror, the head of the GMB union, Tim Roache, says the extra cash is ""based on Tory divisions not the needs of working people"". Analysis in the Times questions whether all the money can be spent in 91 days.  The Mirror says the huge sum needs to be spent elsewhere, and likens preparing for a no-deal to fastening your seat belt before driving over a cliff.  Writing in the Guardian, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, says Brussels is expecting Britain to ramp up its no-deal planning to intimidate other EU countries.  But, he warns ""there isn't time to limit the damage of a sudden severance"". The Guardian also reports that US congressional leaders have warned they will almost certainly block any future American-UK trade deal if Brexit affects the Irish border and jeopardises peace in Northern Ireland. The Republican co-chairman of the Friends of Ireland group, Pete King, says the threat to abandon the backstop and endanger the open border is ""a needless provocation"". He makes clear he would defy his president over the issue. Both the Times and the Sun pick up on a report on the news website BuzzFeed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has appointed two supporters of legalising cannabis to his team. Blair Gibbs has joined Downing Street from the Centre for Medicinal Cannabis campaign group, while a second aide, Danny Kruger, has also called for decriminalisation of the drug.  BuzzFeed says Boris Johnson has distanced himself from their views. But the Times suggests the revelations support a prediction that the UK will legalise cannabis within a decade. The devastation wreaked by the floods in the north of England is illustrated by most papers.  Many show a bridge near Grinton in North Yorkshire which has been destroyed; the Mirror shows the dramatic chasm left as the road is sliced in two. The Mail looks back five years ago when the bridge was lined during the Tour de France.  The Daily Star speaks to a pub landlady who says she almost drowned when a 5ft tidal wave of floodwater hit her home. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The Telegraph reports that the Army is to create a new division dedicated to fighting cyber threats. Specialists will be deployed to counter the spread of misinformation through social media. Meanwhile, the Times says new Justice Secretary Robert Buckland is backing a call to allow suspects in serious cases, including sex offences and fraud, to remain anonymous.

Reigning champion Alistair Chisholm, of Dorchester, Dorset, won with his virtual cry about the mental toll of the pandemic. The contest, which was cancelled last year due to Covid, was held in silence for the first time in its history. Instead of using their voices, criers had to submit 140 words on the topic of ""nature and the environment"". Organiser and Bishops Stortford crier Carole Williams said it was ""a real skill to write a cry that sticks to the theme, that enlightens people, and doesn't bore the audience"". Rawden Kerr, town crier of Great Harwood, Lancashire, came second with Les Cutts, crier for Halifax and Hebden Royd, in West Yorkshire, winning third place. The Loyal Company of Town Criers, which hosts the competition, received hundreds of entries from across the country. Mr Chisolm said he was ""surprised, flattered and delighted"" to win.  ""Clearly the cry that I wrote was judged appropriate for that subject,"" he said. The contest raised more than £1,000 for mental health charity Shout. The last championships to be held in public were in Darlington in 2019. This year's winners were announced on Thursday. OYEZ! OYEZ! OYEZ! Sunshine almost always makes me happy, but sometimes I'm depressed; And I am not the only one, it happens to the best. The natural world is wonderful - its beauty unsurpassed, It lifts you up when you are down and better thoughts it casts. The time has come to re-connect with flora and with fauna, To sense our place in nature and restore its special aura. To walk in fields and forests, by lakes and running streams, Improves our mental health and revives our hopes and dreams.

Spread to US Treasury,How much of Trump's wall has been built?,2024-09-25,2019-01-05,By Christopher Giles,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46748492,"President Donald Trump is visiting the southern border in Texas to claim success in the construction of a border fence with Mexico. The White House said his visit would ""mark the completion of more than 400 miles of border wall - a promise made, promise kept"". So how much of the border wall has Mr Trump managed to build during his term in office? Various types of fencing totalling 654 miles (just over 1,000 km) were already in place before Mr Trump became president in 2017.  These ran through the states of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The Trump administration say they've completed more than 400 miles of border wall since then.  It's 452 miles (727 km) in total, according to the latest US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) information (4 January 2021).  However, only 80 miles of new barriers have been built where there were none before - that includes 47 miles of primary wall, and 33 miles of secondary wall built to reinforce the initial barrier.  The vast majority of the 452 miles is replacing existing structures at the border that had been built by previous US administrations. President Trump has argued that this should be regarded as new wall, because it's replacing what he called ""old and worthless barriers."" In 2016, President Trump repeatedly claimed Mexico would pay for the wall. This didn't happen.   The US government has paid for the wall, and there've been arguments over how to fund it between the Trump administration and Congress.  In January 2018, Mr Trump asked Congress to pay $18bn (£13.6bn) over the next decade for an initial phase of construction, but the bill ultimately failed. Some money was allocated by Congress in 2018 for projects at the border. However, in 2019 Mr Trump used national emergency powers to divert funds from the Department of Defense after Congress rejected more money for the wall. There has been around $15bn spent for the construction of the barrier coming from various US government departments, including the Department of Homeland Security, and the Defense and Treasury Departments. It was originally estimated a cross-border wall could cost anything from $12bn to $40bn. Despite this, in the run-up to the 3 November 2020 election, President Trump continued to say that ""Mexico is paying for it"". In the past, he's implied that a new trade agreement (signed last year) involving Mexico and Canada would indirectly save the US money, which could be spent on the wall. However, it's not clear how exactly this would work. President Trump also pledged to reduce illegal movement across the border.  The number of people detained at the border increased significantly between 2018 and 2019, but dropped off in 2020. ""The decrease in apprehensions comes as the movement of migrants in the Americas and worldwide has slowed during the Covid-19 outbreak, with governments fully or partially closing their borders to stem its spread,"" according to Ana Gonzalez-Barrera, a senior researcher at Pew Research, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington DC.  President-elect Joe Biden has said that he will not continue further construction of the wall.  He said he would not build ""another foot"" and made clear he opposed taking funds from the Department of Defense.  Instead, the Democratic president-elect plans to focus on using technology along the border to detect illegal activity. Joe Biden's official website says: ""Biden will direct federal resources to smart border enforcement efforts, like investments in improving screening infrastructure at our ports of entry.""  However, it is unclear what the new administration will do with contracts for wall construction which have already been awarded under Mr Trump - but are as yet not finished.

Spread to US Treasury,"If McGregor wins, does he owe Man City?",2024-09-25,2017-08-25,Luke Reddy,https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/41046772,"McGregor is often accompanied to training by his closest friends and images of him are dotted around the Institute Floyd Mayweather v Conor McGregor  Date: Saturday, 26 August (local) Venue: T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas Coverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live, BBC Sport website and app from 04:00 BST; text updates online from 22:00 BST Fight replay: 06:00-10:00 BST on Sunday on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra If Conor McGregor beats Floyd Mayweather on Saturday night in Las Vegas, the boyhood Manchester United fan will perhaps owe a small debt of gratitude to Manchester City. For the past six weeks or so, he has driven his green Lamborghini to the UFC's new performance institute, external on a daily basis. At this hub, located about four miles from the city's famous strip, you can mimic conditions at 10,000ft of altitude, clock miles on an underwater treadmill, or analyse the density of specific muscles. If an athlete is to be built rather than born, this is the place. The attention to detail is stunningly intricate and it was Manchester City's own training complex which offered key elements of the blueprint. Schedule, BBC coverage and undercard Who is the real Conor McGregor? Podcast: Big fight preview with Costello and Bunce Fight is a circus - Crolla Amir Khan says Mayweather will knock McGregor out A group of journalists are led through the $14m development by Forrest Griffin, a retired UFC light-heavyweight champion and now a vice-president with focus on athlete development. He paints details around what we see at the 30,000 square feet facility, which opened in May. Some 23 years have passed since UFC was formed but this building is seen as a game changer which will take the welfare and performance of athletes to new levels. It is far removed from the spit and sawdust gyms which shaped some of boxing's greatest names. Some 24 hours earlier, I visited the Mayweather Boxing Gym, a world-renowned facility which inside is straightforward, humble and brilliantly effective. But the UFC institute cuts with tradition in pursuit of gains. Measurability, science and mapped progress shape the mantra. Griffin explains how recovery is meticulously plotted. He points to one of his own injuries and a subsequent substantial difference in mass between his two quad muscles, detected after his retirement. A UFC fighter at the Institute would be scanned during rehabilitation to highlight which muscles have suffered during their lay-off so targeted rebuilding can be done. The underwater treadmill allows the runner to watch a TV displaying their foot strike Any fighter competing under the UFC banner can train here at no cost. Tailored workout programmes appear on screens next to weight stations. If an athlete is only here for a short spell, their data and subsequent training plan will be sent to an app to use at their traditional base. Whatever the goal - recovery, strength, mobility, technique - there is a desire to offer a menu of ways to work on it. As Griffin stresses, what works for one individual will do nothing for another. In the recovery area, for example, athletes can opt for use of a cryotherapy chamber or laser-light therapy. Both will stimulate circulation, flushing away lactic acid and easing aches and pains. Facilities are purposely placed one room apart to ease access. We pass through a door and Griffin fires up the underwater treadmill McGregor has been filmed using in recent weeks. ""Conor has had a knee injury in the past so he doesn't like to do roadwork,"" says Griffin, 38.  ""So he does a lot of bike work and he uses this as it has no impact on your body and you can work hard."" Two pools next to the underwater treadmill offer temperatures of 105F and 50F respectively to again offer variety in recovery.  Griffin explains why McGregor's typical routine of sleeping in until midday makes perfect sense. ""He's been here once or twice a day for six weeks,"" adds Griffin. ""Training at the time you fight is under appreciated. When do you work out the best, after being up for 12 hours or three or four hours? He primes his body to do that, which is intelligent."" Behind the doors of the Mayweather gym 'Orgy of excess could further sully boxing' Podcast: Is McGregor feeling the pressure?  We are taken to meet UFC flyweight Joe Benevidez, who is receiving treatment from director of physical therapy Heather Linden. Linden left a role at the USA's Olympic Training Centre in Colorado Springs to be here. She jokes when explaining how even the toughest UFC fighters can struggle on a pilates ball when she isolates their weakest muscles in order to highlight where work is needed. ""What's been a shock is how little access to services these athletes have had in the past,"" she says. ""It's amazing how some of them have never had medical guidance for preventative measures.  ""I've had to build trust. I had a guy come in here and tell me he couldn't feel his left arm but he was going to fight. He was scared of telling people in the event he was pulled from competing but with work we restored him to full functionality in two weeks."" Former UFC welterweight Dan Hardy is part of the tour. The Nottingham-born 35-year-old describes the facilities as ""night and day"" to what he used. ""My life would be different now,"" he tells the group. ""I used to work with friends for treatment, driving around for different things I needed."" The upper tier of the gym is specific to MMA, while downstairs focuses on strength and recovery Despite all the technology in what feels like the slickest of finishing schools, MMA critics still exist. Perhaps blighted by images of the ground and pound or blood-stained faces they question the morality of the sport. But UFC's growth shows no sign of relenting. The company was sold for $4.2bn in 2016 and listening to Griffin it is obvious this is a sport with vision.  Mapping the layout of the Institute saw the UFC research facilities at the likes of Man City, the Phoenix Suns basketball team and the USA Olympic team base. Habits were observed, such as an athlete's occasional tendency to neglect post-workout nutrition if access to it was not made easy. Consequently, UFC athletes can only exit the building by passing a nutritional team. ""We learned from mistakes people had made in the past,"" adds Griffin. ""A facility and its staff may be too spread out. Manchester City have a great layout. The locker room is the centre of the building. The athletes start and end in the locker room so you build every service around that. ""Every sport taxes the human body a certain way. The needs and demands change but the impact on the body and the recovery needed is very similar."" This video can not be played How did my body look? I can eat burgers - Mayweather Elsewhere on the ground floor we see anti-gravity treadmills which take away impact, a 50m outdoor track and walls with numbered targets for medicine balls to be thrown at.  The altitude chamber McGregor sometimes cycled in is in use. This transparent box lets people look in at the world of pain it can serve up. Griffin proudly states UFC stars can now create conditions to prime them to fight anywhere on earth. In a gym packed with contraptions, he points to pressure plates in the floor. Squatting and lifting weights while planted on these will deliver data on which limbs are offering the greater power. Once more, it offers a way to drill down and improve weaknesses. We are led up stairs boasting the slogan ""contenders become champions and champions become legends"". These take us away from a ground floor focused on welfare and strength and to an upper tier which measures 17,000 square ft and is MMA specific.  Bags of varying shape and size hang there, an octagon dominates the room and of course, there is McGregor's boxing ring, home of those now infamous spars with Paulie Malignaggi. He is of course a fighter obsessed with detail. This desert treasure chest caters for that intricacy in abundance. And if all of the facilities have somehow polished him to a point where he can shock Mayweather at the T-Mobile Arena, UFC's main draw will achieve a status which will shine new focus on the company. Its Performance Institute tells us the organisation is nothing but ready to thrive and what is more, it now boasts a factory primed to build the next McGregor.

Spread to US Treasury,Berlin's stunning indoor public pools,2024-09-25,2023-11-17,Joe Baur,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20231116-the-hidden-beauty-of-berlins-indoor-pools,"The German capital is dotted with more than 60 public indoor swimming pools, and many of them are so stunning and tranquil they feel like you're swimming in an ornate library. On a recent November day in Berlin's upscale Prenzlauer Berg neighbourhood, locals in long jackets pushed strollers through the crisp autumn air. Others wrapped themselves in blankets and lingered at outdoor cafes. And down the street, a handful of people gripping swimsuits headed under the stone Neo-Renaissance facade at the Hotel Oderberger Berlin to partake in a beloved, centuries-old local tradition: whiling away the hours at one of Berlin's many eye-catching public indoor swimming pools (Hallenbäder). Boasting 60 indoor public swimming pools that attract six million visitors each year, Berlin is one of the world's great indoor swimming destinations. And unlike elsewhere, where public pools are more functional than fancy, Berlin's Hallenbäder are veritable cathedrals of late 19th- and early 20th-Century design. As I followed the crowd inside the Stadtbad Oderberger Strasse, for instance, I noticed the 20m pool was surrounded by decorative tiles, arched windows and ornate detailing on the stone railings that felt more like a Moroccan riad than a public pool. Berlin's indoor pools are also known for being places of relaxation rather than racket. Aside from the occasional splash or sandals tapping against tiles, all was quiet here. As others were quietly doing laps, it felt like I was in a library-turned-swimming pool (without the constant fear of getting shushed). ""It would be impossible not to be fond of swimming and also live in a place like Berlin,"" said local resident Beata Gontarczyk-Krampe. ""It's something that you do very much and very often in Berlin."" For the past 15 years, Gontarczyk-Krampe, who calls herself ""a very eager amateur historian"" has been researching and writing about Berlin's lesser-known history, publishing two editions of her Berlin Companion books in the process. The history of Berlin's many indoor swimming pools is a topic that's piqued her interest since moving to here from Poland in 2003. And after spending the past 20 years discovering dozens of ornate Hallenbäder hiding in plain sight, she learned that they have a curious history. Hallenbäder first became popular in Berlin among the wealthier classes in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries as a means to develop higher standards of personal hygiene at a time when few people had baths at home. But as it became clear that poor hygiene spread diseases, the city realised that there were civic and sanitary benefits to broadening the pools' accessibility and granted access to lower classes as well, which is why they are also called Volksbäder, or the ""people's pools"". Remarkably, many of the city's Hallenbäder survived the bombing of World War Two. Stadtbad Charlottenburg – the city's oldest indoor pool built between 1896 and 1898 – and Stadtbad Oderberger Strasse are two such examples. But those that were hit, like Stadtbad Moabit, were swiftly restored to their original glory. ""The city did everything it could to re-open them as quickly as possible,"" Gontarczyk-Krampe explained. ""But not so much for swimming as for washing and bathing."" After World War Two, a trip to the pool became less about hygiene and more as an escape from the rubble of an occupied city. These ornate reminders of a better time were the backdrop for many Berliner childhoods. For those children of post-war Germany, spending the afternoon at the pool simply became a matter of tradition, if not obsession. ""Berliners are really among the most swimming-pool crazy people I know,"" Gontarczyk-Krampe laughed. Just as hordes of Berliners flock to the city's many nearby lakes to swim whenever the weather warms, they also retreat to their local pool as soon as temperatures drop. ""Most of the Hallenbäder are surprisingly full very early in the morning,"" she said. ""All lanes will be taken by the 'Frühschwimmer' or early swimmers."" Then there are the weekends, when parents carry massive bags full of snacks and swim gear. ""If you really wanted to hurt Berliners, you would take the swimming pools away,"" Gontarczyk-Krampe joked. ""Whenever anyone says anything about a swimming pool being renovated or closed for three years, there's such an outcry. It's almost touching."" Whether you're a history buff, architecture buff or are simply looking for a place to escape the city's dark winter days, here's our list of Berlin's most stunning indoor pools. Stadtbad Charlottenburg Following the demolition of the Moabit Volksbad in 1985, Stadtbad Charlottenburg became the city's oldest surviving indoor swimming pool. Nestled along a quiet side street off Bismarckstrasse, this majestic Gothic-style red-brick building is adorned with captivating water-themed gargoyles. Built during Berlin's population boom in 1898, it served a crucial role in public health, offering bathing facilities at a time when most homes lacked bathrooms. Despite surviving damage in the final days of World War Two and facing demolition threats in 1974, public outcry forced the decision to restore and preserve the facility. In 1982 it received historic preservation protection and remains the first and only Hallenbad in Berlin to have a stainless-steel swimming pool. Today, Stadtbad Charlottenburg welcomes visitors with an elaborate wrought-iron door leading to the Art Nouveau-style old hall. The facility showcases a neo-Gothic cross vault interior, mesmerising ironwork and murals depicting a pastoral lakeside scene of a naked man and woman relaxing in their natural surroundings. Stadtbad Neukölln Nestled in Berlin's dynamic and diverse Neukölln neighbourhood, Stadtbad Neukölln is a time-honoured Neoclassical treasure that seamlessly combines architectural splendour with a rich bathing tradition. Originally opened in 1914, this grand bathhouse was built for up to 10,000 daily visitors and quickly became one of the most celebrated pools in Europe. Architect Reinhold Kiehl designed it in the style of an ancient spa, taking inspiration from Russian-Roman baths that included a domed building with a round plunge pool and a skylight that draws in natural light. A bonus for the ladies: it's reserved exclusively for women on Mondays. Stadtbad Berlin-Mitte Also known as Stadtbad Gartenstrase, this pool is anchored in the heart of Berlin's central Mitte (literally: ""Middle"") district and is a captivating testament to the city's architectural and bathing heritage. The historical Bauhaus bathhouse first opened its doors in 1930, designed under the motto ""light, air and sun"", and its mullioned ceiling windows offer fantastic views of the winter sky. Two bombs hit the building on 2 January 1945, but immediate action was taken to prevent more significant damage and the pool reopened that June – just a month after the surrender of Nazi Germany. By the end of 1945, Stadtbad Mitte averaged 5,000 daily visitors – perhaps in search of distraction from the reality of post-war Germany. Float on your back in the 50m-long pool and take in the fleeting light of winter in Berlin. Liquidrom Located in the massive Brutalism crown-meets-tent Tempodrom on the western-edge of Kreuzberg, Liquidrom is essentially a Berlin club-turned spa. The sleek, modern interior and soft illumination matches a soundtrack that ranges from classical to techno. Unlike the more historical swimming pools, the emphasis here is on saunas and the impressive saltwater floating pool. Perhaps more than anywhere else, this is where travellers can experience Germany's ""textile-free"" culture head on. Stadtbad Oderberger Strasse Tucked into Berlin's well-heeled Prenzlauer Berg neighbourhood, Stadtbad Oderberg Strasse (also known as Stadtbad Prenzlauer Berg) is a captivating fusion of history and modernity. Originally inaugurated in 1902 as a public bathhouse to improve the hygiene of the growing neighbourhood brimming with breweries and factories, this architectural treat underwent extensive renovations after closing in 1986. It reopened in 2016 inside the boutique Hotel Oderberger Berlin with guaranteed public access to the pool. Visitors just have to book a two-hour ticket for €9 and can do so in advance online. Hotel guests can visit for free. Schwimmhalle Finckensteinallee Schwimmhalle Finckensteinallee has witnessed many chapters of Berlin's complex history. It's one of the city's few remaining relics of Third Reich Brutalist architecture. Originally constructed in 1938 as an exclusive training facility for the SS, its imposing red-brick exterior and pseudo-Neoclassical style showcase the imagined grandeur of Nazi Germany. Two stone statues of a naked woman and a man holding a disc are on either side of the entrance as if standing guard. After years of serving different purposes – including being under American control post-World War Two – the pool opened its doors to the public in 2014. The vast hall, adorned with floor-to-ceiling windows, preserves its original scale and aesthetics, with pastel blue and white ceilings adding a touch of vibrancy. Despite its challenging past, the pool now offers a unique blend of history and modern amenities, including a free book exchange, inviting visitors to reflect on its transformative journey. Either way, come prepared to swim, as it's known as a place for sporty swimmers.

Spread to US Treasury,Brazil’s mysterious tunnels made by giant sloths,2024-09-25,2023-11-27,Sarah Brown,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20231127-brazils-mysterious-tunnels-made-by-giant-sloths,"These tunnels were once believed to hide religious fortunes deep in their chambers, but the real treasure is found in who – or what – created them. In 2009, a farmer was driving through his corn field in the south of Brazil when he suddenly felt his tractor sink and lurch to one side, making the vehicle shudder to a halt. He jumped out and saw the wheel had sunk deep into the dry soil. Much to the farmer's shock, the tractor had broken through what looked like top of an underground cavity. Hearing about this unusual find, researchers came to investigate and were surprised to find a tunnel nearly 2m high by almost 2m wide and about 15m long running across the field and right under the farmer's house. Deep claw marks embedded into the walls indicated its past occupant was not human. The farmer had stumbled upon a puzzling subject in palaeontology that is still unfolding today. He'd uncovered a megafauna paleoburrow, a prehistoric tunnel dug through rock by what Luiz Carlos Weinschutz, a geologist and one of the scientists who visited the farmer's property, concluded was the work of a giant ground sloth or giant armadillo from at least 10,000 years ago. These giant ground sloths, described in one paper as ""a hamster the size of an elephant"", were far removed from today's unhurried, tree-dwelling ones. They grew up to 4m long and walked on all fours, although research suggests some could stand and move bipedally. Almost 100 different species of sloths roamed the Americas between 15 million to 10,000 years ago alongside car-sized giant armadillos that also dug long tunnels through rocks in Brazil. I had first heard about paleoburrows when I saw a report in 2015 about the discovery of a 100m-long tunnel dug by giant sloths in the northern state of Rondônia, the first to be found in the Amazon rainforest. Yet it was during a holiday in the opposite end of Brazil a few years later that I had the chance to visit one in real life. How to visit Brazilian paleoburrows The Southern Canyons Paths Geopark has several paleoburrows that are open to the public. They are accessible via hiking and are sign-posted: - The Engenho Velho paleoburrow complex is found in the Jacinto Machado municipality (1.5 hour return hike). - The Toca do Tatu paleoburrow, where visitors can see rock art, is found in the Timbé do Sul municipality along the Portal do Palmiro hike. Along the same route are the Três Barras paleoburrows in the Morro Grande municipality. (4-hour return hike) Tip: It's advisable to hire an experienced guide who can provide safety equipment such as helmets, protective clothing, masks and gloves. Contact the park directly for further information. During this trip, I visited the Southern Canyons Path Geopark that spreads across the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, home to several paleoburrows. After an hour trek through a forest-clad canyon in the state of Santa Catarina, I reached my destination: a 2m-high tunnel carved into a large, weathered rock. Inside it was dark and cool, the curved surfaces buffed smooth from many millennia of coarse sloth hair rubbing against it. Distinctive long claw marks criss-crossed the walls. It felt like walking into an oversized rabbit warren. Heinrich Theodor Frank, a geologist by profession and paleoburrow expert at heart, told me that upon entering any one of these tunnels, ""you find an open book. You see, you feel that this was not made by humans."" He was right. Most paleoburrows nowadays are filled with sediments, although some remain completely or partially clear, such as the one I had visited and the one the farmer had uncovered. The farmer's 2009 discovery came at the beginning of a surge of interest in paleoburrows, after hundreds were identified in southern and south-eastern Brazil. In the last 15 years, more than 1,500 have been recorded in this region, clinching it the title of having the highest concentration of megafauna paleoburrows in the world. Nobody knows for sure why the south of Brazil has so many. Most are in the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, but Minas Gerais, another southern state, boasts some remarkable examples, including a 340m-long paleoburrow and a collection of six 40m-long tunnels that lead to 10m-wide by 4m-high chambers. In June this year, this site – the largest paleoburrow in the state – was brought under official protection to safeguard it from human activity. A handful of paleoburrows can be found across South America, although none have been recorded in North America. ""It's something that has no logical explanation because the megafauna roamed across the continent. You should have tunnels in other places,"" said Frank. Some experts say that the concentration of paleoburrows in Brazil's south is simply because the region is a hub for palaeontology research. Others disagree, pointing to geographical evolution influencing different behaviours among species across the Americas, which at the time of megafauna was up to 10C colder than now and much drier.   For many years, locals and researchers believed the tunnels had been constructed by past civilisations and the claw marks were assumed to be the work of a pickaxe. Some paleoburrows contain rock art, such as the Toca do Tatu (""Armadillo Burrow"") in the state of Santa Catarina, which appears to have a sun with rays radiating out and groups of triangles representing mountains engraved on its walls. But because the art is carved into the rocks and not painted, dating it is almost impossible, said archaeologist Lizete Dias de Oliveira. No-one knows for sure who made the rock carvings and what they mean. Regional Indigenous communities likely knew of the paleoburrows' existence before they were scientifically identified, evidenced by the tunnels featured in their oral stories. The Kaingang people, who come from Rio Grande do Sul, tell of a legend that a giant flood forced their ancestral fathers to swim to the hilly peaks where they eventually dug their way through the mountains for shelter. Other tales from the Kaingang suggest they knew the burrows were made by megafauna. A folktale for children involves the story of a family that descended into a hole made by an armadillo to enjoy the abundance of food there, only to have their rope cut by a ""white man"" (a native name for a non-Indigenous person) who took over the land while they remained underground. The exact storyline of the myths varies, but for the Kaingang people, the accuracy is less important than the story itself. ""For the Kaingang people, there are no myths because everything that is told by the older Indigenous people is considered true,"" wrote Cláudia Aresi in a research paper for the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul about the cultural and territory transformations of the Kaingang people. Another theory linked to the paleoburrows was that the tunnels held hidden riches left there by the Jesuits. It led to treasure-seekers ransacking caves for this supposed wealth, never finding anything more than dust and sediments. ""Treasure hunters are a horror for archaeology. They disturb the soil and reverse it, so what is newer becomes older and what is older becomes more recent,"" Oliveira said, adding that this complicates studying sediments for additional clues that could reveal more about these tunnels. In the end, it was the claw marks that helped scientists conclude that these tunnels were made by megafauna, in particular ground sloths and giant armadillos. ""We analysed the bones of the animals that lived in this region in the last two million years. Animals such as horses, sabretooth tigers, elephants, they did not dig. You have to look for animals that have claws, then you only have two options: the giant sloths and the giant armadillos,"" said Frank. Weinschutz is currently 3D-mapping paleoburrows in Santa Catarina to try to spot patterns in the tunnels that could reveal the biomechanisms of digging such large constructions, as well as searching for traces of ancient fur to help identify the species that made them. ""It's still a new study, there are years and years of research ahead in this area,"" he enthused. The results may shed some light onto why these animals made such large tunnels. Most scientists propose that it was for nursing young, regulating body temperatures or even hibernation, although the exact reason remains a mystery. Experts suspect that each tunnel was made over the course of centuries or even thousands of years, suggesting that the sloths and armadillos lived in social family groups. ""Each generation did a little more, so after all those years, they created one big cave,"" Frank said. The megafauna, both the giant armadillos and giant sloths, must have ""developed an absurd strength in their arms"" to be able to cut through rock and tough sediments that even a pickaxe would struggle to pierce, said Weinschutz. Intrigued, I visited the Museum of Earth Sciences in Rio de Janeiro to see the skeleton of a fossilised sloth and get a sense of its size. Its elongated skull was the size of horse and its curved claw covered my outstretched hand. As I held the claw, my thoughts went back to the paleoburrow I'd visited with the deep scratches in the wall, the true treasures of these ancient homes. Even though the ground sloths and giant armadillos of the past have long gone, their stories remain forever marked in the south of Brazil, bringing to life a world so mysterious to us today. ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

Spread to US Treasury,Napoleon's plan to retire in the US,2024-09-25,2023-11-22,Robin Catalano,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20231122-the-new-orleans-landmark-that-almost-became-napoleons-retirement-home,"It doesn't appear in textbooks and isn't included in the much-anticipated movie Napoleon – but the French politician had bold plans to start a new life in the US. In the interior garden courtyard of Napoleon House, a warm breeze murmured over wrought-iron bistro tables. It swelled, turning the hum of conversation and clinking of silverware into a quiet symphony. Bow-tied waiters glided between tables at the New Orleans restaurant, depositing the signature Pimm's cup cocktail, Creole classics like jambalaya and red beans and rice, and Italian muffalettas stacked high with sliced meat, cheese and piquant giardiniera. This beacon of casual yet high-style dining is visited by thousands of people each year both for its food and history. Built in 1815, the Creole ""cottage"" is one of the city's nine original structures, and still retains many of its 19th-Century hallmarks, from the uneven floors to old-growth pine plank ceilings. If you closed your eyes, you might be swept back in time to when the city, settled by the French in 1718 and still celebrating its greatest land victory against the British in the War of 1812, was populated by Francophone expats enamoured with the brilliant politician Napoleon Bonaparte, who revolutionised government and social programmes in France. You might even hear hushed conversations about secreting the banished dictator to American shores, to a hero's welcome, where he would live out his retirement – a bit of history that doesn't appear in textbooks and isn't included in the action opus Napoleon by BAFTA-winning spectacle specialist Ridley Scott that rides into cinemas on 22 November 2023. And although Napoleon never ended up making it to the US, travellers to New Orleans can still see glimpses of infamous dictator's fascinating connection to the city and learn more about his thwarted desire to start a new life Stateside. The end of a dictator  After skyrocketing through French military ranks during the decade-long French Revolution, which began in 1789, Napoleon rose to First Consul of France in 1799 and emperor in 1804 by ""pursuing a policy that we might find familiar today: making France great again"", said Alexander Mikaberidze, history professor at Louisiana State University‒Shreveport and author of The Napoleonic Wars: A Global History. Napoleon was crowned emperor in 1804. Subsequent victories at Austerlitz in 1805, Jena and Auerstedt in 1806 and Eylau and Friedland in 1807 granted France power over most of Europe. But the dictator's plans didn't stop on the eastern side of the Atlantic. Mikaberidze explained, ""North America featured prominently in Napoleon's plans from early on as he sought to revive the colonial empire France lost during the Seven Years War."" Learn more about Louisiana's history France had ceded Louisiana to Spain in 1762, but Napoleon negotiated with King Carlos IV in 1801 to regain it. Head to the Historic New Orleans Collection in the French Quarter to see original correspondence on the retrocession of Louisiana from Spain to France. A piece of the New World was key: the Louisiana Territory, an 828,000-square-mile tract of land that included not just Louisiana itself, but the modern-day states of Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North and South Dakota and Oklahoma, as well as parts of Colorado, Minnesota and Wyoming. The territory was a vital area for resupplying and sheltering troops deployed in the valuable ""sugar islands"" of the Caribbean, especially Saint-Domingue (modern-day Haiti). In 1801, an uprising of the enslaved people on Saint-Domingue resulted in an embarrassing loss for France. Having ceded control of the island, Napoleon opted to sell the Louisiana Territory to America – a solution he found more palatable than allowing the land to fall into the hands of his sworn enemy, the British. For their part, the Americans had planned on acquiring only New Orleans, a crucial gateway to the seas. During negotiations, Napoleon offered them the entire territory – almost all of it still owned and occupied by Indigenous tribes – for $11,250,000, or less than 3 cents per acre. America assumed control of the land in May 1803, doubling the area of the nascent country and strengthening its strategic position practically overnight. Global wars converge   By the early 1800s, New Orleans had thousands of French immigrants – and Bonaparte loyalists. ""There was basically a cult of Napoleon at this time,"" said Karen Leathem, historian at the Louisiana State Museum. Among them was Nicolas Girod. Born in the Duchy of Savoy, a portion of north-western Italy annexed by France, Girod arrived in New Orleans while it was under Spanish colonial rule (1763-1803). A tavern keeper and smuggler before eventually working his way up to become a successful commission merchant, Girod was elected mayor of New Orleans in 1812. Newly wealthy, Girod purchased several properties in what is now known as the French Quarter. In 1814, on Chartres Street, he commissioned a grand home – the place now known as Napoleon House. The bottom floor, which opened directly onto the street via casement doors, was used for business. Living spaces were located on the second and third floors. At the top, Girod built an octagonal cupola from which he could observe the comings and goings in the port of New Orleans.  By then, Napoleon's fortunes had turned. Following the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812, Napoleon was defeated in 1813 by a coalition of Britain, Russia, Austria, Prussia and Sweden. He abdicated a year later and was exiled to the Italian island of Elba ­only to escape nine months later and reclaim his title. Napoleon's return galvanised old enemies. They clashed again in Belgium, where Napoleon was eventually defeated in the brutal Battle of Waterloo. According to Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne's Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte, in 1815 Napoleon confided in friend Antoine Marie Chamans, the Comte de Lavallette, ""If they do not like me to remain in France, where am I to go? To England? My abode there would be ridiculous or disquieting… America would be more suitable; I could live there with dignity."" Correspondence between Napoleon's younger brother Lucien Bonaparte and Emmanuel-Augustin-Dieudonné-Joseph, Comte de Las Cases, shows that Napoleon's initial plan was to retire on the shores of the Mississippi or Ohio rivers. Upon learning his brother Joseph had beaten him to American shores, he said, ""If I were in his place, within a year I would create a great empire in the Spanish Americas."" Lavallette dissuaded the dictator, citing the example of General Jean-Victor Moreau, a French revolutionary-turned-Napoleon detractor who had retired in the United States, only to join the Allied cause against France. Napoleon still dreamed of emigrating to America, however, and instructed his staff to start packing books from his vast library for shipment. According to Mikhaberidze, he was spotted reading books about the Americas, and, during a conversation with famed botanist and traveller Aime Bonpland, invited the author to visit him Stateside. Napoleon requested that France's Provisional Government prepare a frigate on which he could embark for his retirement in America. The written order to the ship's captain never arrived, and Napoleon made it only as far as the central western coast of France. After several days spent trying to commission various captains to convey him to the United States, he was captured by the English and exiled a second time, to the heavily guarded island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic. In America, whispers began to spread. ""There were Bonapartist exiles in New Orleans, most of them diehard supporters of Napoleon,"" explained Mikaberidze. ""They believed that if given an opportunity, they should rescue him."" Likewise, Napoleon believed the Bonapartist enclave in the Spanish colonies of America would attract talented and ambitious people from across the world, who would help rise against Spain and found a ""new homeland"". ""I would have loved to realise this dream,"" he noted, ""It would have brought me new glory.""  Among the grand schemes were building a submarine or sending a flotilla of pirates to liberate the former emperor. Dominique You, a New Orleans‒based privateer and frequent collaborator of famed pirate Jean Lafitte, was said to have organised a group that would cross the ocean on the yacht Seraphine – an expedition financed by Girod, who was believed to have offered his third-floor apartments to the exiled dictator. Before You could make the trip, Napoleon died in 1821 from stomach cancer. The Napoleonic legacy in The Big Easy  Remnants of the Napoleonic past exist all around New Orleans. Leathem explained, ""Pierre-Benjamin Buisson, a French surveyor who fought as an artillery captain under Napoleon, laid out the neighbourhood around a central street he called Napoleon Avenue. There are streets named Marengo, Milan, Jena, Austerlitz, after some of Napoleon's great victories."" The Historic New Orleans Collection has a number of objects related to Napoleon; as well as correspondence on the retrocession of Louisiana from Spain to France, you can also see miniature portraits of the emperor and his beloved wife, Josephine. The Louisiana State Museum has an embroidered bee from Napoleon's coronation gown, as well as a bronze death mask – one of nine cast from the original plaster – made by the dictator's physician, Dr Francesco Antommarchi, and gifted to the city in 1834. Louisiana State University‒Shreveport's collection contains hundreds of volumes on Napoleon and a large number of caricatures, including an almost complete portfolio by British political commentator George Cruikshank. And there's Napoleon House, a National Historic Landmark. Within its patinaed walls it preserves 200 years of history, from its French Creole beginnings to its early-1900s transformation into an Italian grocery and modern iteration as a restaurant and bar. General manager and executive chef Chris Montero, an avowed history buff, delights in visitors' discovery of the building. ""Professors bring architectural students from all over the world,"" he said. ""Most of the historic architecture in New Orleans is post-Civil War. Very little of this original French Creole style exists intact."" He frequently leads tours of the property, including the suspected slave quarters tucked under the top-floor dormers, and the cupola, which provides some of the best views over the city. As the restaurant – and the upcoming movie – demonstrate, our fascination with Napoleon endures. According to Mikaberidze, this is because of his many progressive reforms on which modern France is based: administrative, judicial and educational systems; the Bank of France; national archives; public treasury; and stock exchange, to name a few.  But there's the darker side. ""What do we do with a man who, on one hand, accepted revolutionary principles of civil equality and equality of opportunity, but also sought to restore slavery? A man who presided over a prototype of a police state? For over a decade, he was an unstoppable force of change. Now it's up to us to decide whether that change was necessarily good or bad,"" Mikaberidze said.  ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

Spread to US Treasury,Essen: Germany’s ‘ugly duckling’ city success,2024-09-25,2023-11-07,Norman Miller,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20231106-essen-germanys-ugly-duckling-city-success,"Thanks to an innovative approach, the German city has catapulted from an industrial wasteland to one of Europe's greenest cities. Located in the heart of western Germany's long-time industrial Ruhr region, the city of Essen spent much of the past 150 years marred by pollution, tainted by filthy mines and belching factories and lined by poisoned waterways. In just one year in the 1960s, a study noted that some 1.5 million tons of toxic dust, ashes and soot rained down on Essen's inhabitants, along with four million tons of sulphur dioxide. But a remarkable transformation has seen Essen go from being Germany's ugly duckling to one of Europe's greenest cities. ""Green urban development has acted as a driving force in Essen over the last decade,"" explained Simone Raskob, who helped oversee Essen's transformation through a mix of so-called Blue Green solutions: ""Blue"" for water-focused initiatives, and ""Green"" for land-based projects. This two-pronged approach helped catapult Essen to be declared the European Green Capital for 2017. Essen's most high-profile ""Green"" project is the transformation of the Zollverein industrial complex – once the world's largest coal and coke production facility – from toxin-spewing industrial blackspot to an inspiring eco-park granted Unesco World Heritage status. Inside its giant former coal washing building, the impressive Ruhr Museum enthrals visitors with displays on the site's history and transformation between towering old machinery. A short walk away, the Red Dot Design Museum showcases examples of innovative global design in a former boiler house building repurposed by renowned architect Norman Foster.  Ever since mining at Zollverein and the surrounding region ended in the late 1980s, woodland has spread across the vast site, and its trail-laced expanses are now home to more than 800 animal and plant species. ""The slag heaps are so cool now, too!"" added Florian Hecker, a green expert from Essen's city council. ""You've got biking trails on them, concerts on them and art on them."" Another of the Zollverein slag heaps, meanwhile, now provides a 60m-tall winter ski piste, as well as an ice skating rink. How to visit Getting around: Use MetropolRadruhr to rent a bike at pickup at points across the city and explore Essen using designated bike lanes. The 22km Essen Stadtbahn tram network is another excellent way to navigate the city.  Where to stay: The Atlantic Congress hotel utilises sustainability practices to minimise its use of energy, water and plastic. Its restaurant uses local produce to cut food miles, too. Where to eat: Elsewhere, grab a table at Gärtnerei (meaning ""market garden"") for a changing menu of creative vegetarian and vegan dishes using produce grown in the restaurant's own garden. What to do: The Folkwang art museum and Grugapark botanical gardens are within easy walking distance of the Atlantic Congress hotel. Other key sites include the 9th-Century Essen Domschatz cathedral treasury, home to one of Germany's most significant collections of religious artwork, and the grandiose Villa Hugel mansion. When to go: Between May and September for the best weather. ""Zollverein is a role model for structural transformation not only in Essen but in the entire Ruhr area,"" said Hanna Lohmann, press officer from the Zollverein Foundation. ""It vividly shows that everything is possible – going from mining coal to climate protection and culture."" Yet, Essen isn't resting on its green laurels and is continuing to add eco-friendly initiatives. A 100km cycling 'super-highway (dubbed the Ruhr RS1 and the more-colloquial ""Route 66 for cyclists"") is slowly taking shape atop old industrial railways. Since the highway's first 6km stage was completed 2015, linking Essen and Mulheim an der Ruhr, it's already estimated to have reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 16,600 tonnes per year. When finished in 2030, it will link the cities of Hamm and Duisburg with a series of paths traversing the wider Metropole Ruhr region. A string of nature-walking trails have also been created in and around the city to help boost local engagement with – and appreciation of – natural habitats. In 2022, the 26km ZollvereinSteig route in the north of Essen was completed, while the latest addition is the 33km DeilbachSteig which connects Essen with the neighbouring towns of Velbert and Hattingen. All the trails are easily accessible by public transport. More than 100 community-run urban farms have also sprung up across Essen, like the Bonnekamp Permaculture Farm, a beacon of biodiversity and food production that sells its organically grown products around the city. ""Some people used to be amazed by old containers filled with carrots, kohlrabi or pumpkins, [but] today more and more people now understand that in these projects ideas of sustainable development are flourishing,"" said urban planner Dr Juliane von Hagen. Among the city's many ""Blue"" transformations are the creation of lakes and ponds by harvesting rainwater. The lake at Krupp Park is fed by rainwater flowing down pipes from the roof of a building at the nearby steel and engineering giant ThyssenKrupp AG, while the Niederfeldsee lake pulls water from surrounding roofs to brighten another former industrial area. Duck-dotted rainwater ponds also frame student accommodation at Essen's new University Park. Perhaps the toughest of Essen's ""Blue"" solutions involved restoring the River Emscher, considered a biologically dead ""open sewer"" since the end of the 19th Century, thanks to the dumping of mining and factory slurry and waste water. After a two-decade clean-up programme, trout once again returned to the rejuvenated river in 2015. A recent count found more than 1,000 fish and animal species living along the Emscher, including previously endangered lapwings, kingfishers and beavers. The Emscher is also the focus of a 51km network of wastewater pumping stations that constitute the largest wastewater project in Europe. Carbon Count The travel emissions it took to report this story were 0.18 metric tons of CO2e. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. Though humans aren't yet encouraged to join the trout in the Emscher, an arena for swimming and boating hums with activity at Lake Baldeney, a broad expanse of water created behind a 9m weir on the similarly cleaned-up Ruhr river. When swimmers splashed here back in 2017, it was the first time bathing had been officially allowed on the Ruhr for 46 years. From German eyesore to proud green city, Essen's green-and-blue approach isn't just benefitting outdoor enthusiasts and the environment but is also providing a shining example of how other cities can look to  their industrial past to embrace a cleaner future.

Spread to US Treasury,How six colours update the iconic London Tube map,2024-09-25,2024-02-15,Jonathan Glancey,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150720-the-london-underground-map-the-design-that-shaped-a-city,"Changes to six lines of the London Overground mean an update to a 1931 design that went global and became a gold standard, even sparking an uproar in 2009 when the River Thames was taken off the map. New names for the six lines of the London Overground have been revealed, with each given its own colour – redesigning the city's iconic Tube map. The changes are intended to make it easier for passengers to navigate the network, by giving the routes distinct identities (the Overground was previously all one colour, orange). The six new names are the Lioness line, the Mildmay line, the Windrush line, the Weaver line, the Suffragette line and the Liberty line – each chosen because of particular local histories. It marks the most recent update to a map that arguably helped to shape the city itself. The first section of the London Underground opened in 1863. Over the following decades, a number of Tube maps – showing an uncoordinated network of lines owned by different companies – were published in increasing, unwieldy profusion. None looked like the iconic map so beloved by visitors and locals today. The fact that there were so many Underground maps before Harry Beck’s famous 'diagram' of 1931 – the blueprint of today’s maps – was proof of a problem that took many years and a great deal of ingenuity to solve. After all, how could a designer fully represent lines that criss-crossed a few squares miles of central London yet also stretched across what, until as late as 1900, had been farmlands, markets gardens and remarkably remote Middlesex villages? And how could it all fit onto a single map – one that could be folded neatly into a coat pocket? Size matters The sheer spread of the Underground network made mapping it problematic. Even in central London, there were stations like Covent Garden and Leicester Square just 200m from each other, while others like Kings Cross and Farringdon were 1.15 miles (1.85km) apart. Outside the centre, the Underground stretched as far as Verney Junction and Brill in Buckinghamshire, rural outposts 50 miles from Baker Street. As maps of the time took their cue from historical precedent, it was thought that these geographic distances had to be represented to scale. But by 1930, it was clear that any map trying to plot the entire Underground network geographically was going to be too big to handle – especially in the busy confines of a Tube station, where shoulder room was precious. So Underground maps of the time tended to concentrate on lines in central London. They allowed lines farther afield to drop off the edge of the city, as if they were ships sailing through the mermaid- and monster-populated seas of an unenlightened, flat world. Many of these early, artist-designed maps are utterly charming and, rightfully, collector’s items today. They were, however, neither comprehensive nor even particularly useful. Map or Mondrian? In 1931, Harry Beck, a young engineering draughtsman who had joined the Underground Group’s Signal Engineer’s Office in 1925, came up with a solution. It was to become not just a useful tool for Londoners and visitors to the capital, but a much-loved design in its own right. It remains the basis for the maps used today. And yet, when Beck first presented his 'diagram' to Underground management, they were unsure. Lines running horizontally, vertically or at 45-degree angles were plotted on a grid. Eschewing geography, it looked like a cross between an electric circuit diagram and a Mondrian painting. While it was no longer possible to tell the distance or precise geographic location of stations at a glance, Beck reasoned that this was unimportant. What passengers needed to know was how to get from one station to another as efficiently as possible and where to change between lines. In 1933, the Underground, city buses, trams, trolleybuses, river buses and Green Line coaches were brought together under the umbrella of a new public corporation: the London Passenger Transport Board. With a spirit of modernisation in the air, the time was right to see how the public would respond to Beck’s radical 'diagram'. After a test run of 500 copies were distributed from a select few stations in 1932, 700,000 copies of the map were printed in 1933. It proved an instant success – a reprint had to be ordered within a month. Yet the map wasn’t perfect. Beck had been unable to include the western extremities of the District Line (shown in green), or the rural adventures of the Metropolitan (magenta) beyond Rickmansworth. These design puzzles were solved over many years as Beck improved his map. His last version was printed in 1960 when he fell out with London Transport. Its publicity officer, Harold Hutchinson, took over the design task. Feeling a sense of ownership and averse to seeing his design changed by third parties, Beck fought a long legal battle with London Transport. He abandoned this in 1965 but worked on the map privately, along with designs for the Paris Metro he had begun decades earlier, until his death in 1974. Since 1986, the design has been a corporate task, with names of individual designers – aside from Beck, who remains credited as the originator – subsumed in this never-ending enterprise. The map has long gone global, too. Not only has it inspired countless Metro maps across continents, but it is also a staple of t-shirts, coffee mugs and countless other souvenirs. Cry me a river That means that, when big changes are made, everyone notices. Over the years, lines have been added including the Docklands Light Railway, the Overground network, Crossrail and the Emirates Air Line cable-car linking Greenwich Peninsula with Royal Docks. Then, in 2009, the River Thames was removed from the map. This had long been its one defining geographic element. When it went, there was a public outcry and negative media attention from around the world. The Thames was back on the map within months, although collectors of Underground maps – of whom there are many – will prize the Thames-less map, much as stamp collectors treasure Edward VIII postage stamps among other design rarities. In 2006, Beck’s map came second in BBC2’s Great British Design Quest, when more than 200,000 viewers chose between such compelling designs as the Mini, E-Type Jaguar and the album sleeve of Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Beck’s map came second, beaten to the number-one slot only by Concorde, perhaps the most beautiful aircraft of all time. Beck’s map and its successors have inspired artists, too. David Booth’s The Tate Gallery by Tube (1986), a poster for London Underground stations, showed Tube lines squeezed from tubes of paint; since 1992, the Tate Modern has displayed The Great Bear by Simon Patterson, with station names replaced by a plethora of artists, explorers, scientists, actors and writers. It isn’t only artists who have been inspired by the map. For generations, London schoolchildren, trying to relieve the monotony of their daily commute, have translated station names into foreign alternatives – with Kings Cross, for example, becoming 'Koenigkreutz'. And many have been able, thanks to the graphic clarity of the Underground map, its bright colours and peerless Johnston typeface, to memorise every station on the Underground network. From games and memory feats to artworks and souvenirs, Beck’s diagram imprinted a very particular map of London on the minds of millions. More than 80 years on, it remains the gold standard by which new Metro maps are judged.

Spread to US Treasury,Who was the real 'Prince Monolulu'?,2024-09-25,2020-10-30,Frank Keogh,https://www.bbc.com/sport/horse-racing/54695641,"Born in 1881, Monolulu - real name Peter Carl McKay - arrived in Britain at the turn of the 20th century ""I gotta horse, I gotta horse to beat the favourite..."" The booming unforgettable catchphrase of Ras Prince Monolulu. A maverick tipster, he was one of the first black people to appear on British television and became an international celebrity. Lion tamer, fire eater, street dentist, preacher, tribal chief, boxer, prisoner of war, entertainer. A CV like no other. This remarkable figure arrived in England at the turn of the 20th Century claiming to be from Ethiopia, and died in London in 1965, at the age of 84.  But what is fact and what fiction? How is he viewed decades after the end of his extraordinary life? And did he really suffer death by chocolate? As we will discover, all was not quite as it seemed. Standing tall with a headdress of ostrich feathers, lion paws swinging from his neck, in baggy pantaloons and holding a tartan umbrella, Monolulu held court before entranced crowds at racecourses across England.  ""I've gotta horse to beat the favourite, Spion Kop will win the Derby, put your shirt on it, put your pants on it. And when you win - roast beef, two veg, Yorkshire pudding, and God save the King."" Spion Kop won the 1920 Derby at odds of 100-6 (about 16-1) netting Monolulu a reputed £8,000 (worth around £400,000 in today's money).  And as a rare free tip, it also brought a big following for the man with quickfire patter worthy of Muhammad Ali and a flamboyant style later echoed by racing pundit John McCririck. From the 1920s to the 1960s, Monolulu appeared on newsreels from major racing fixtures like Derby Day at Epsom as regularly as the Royal Family. Punters paid for his racing tips, sealed in envelopes with the warning not to pass the selection on. He made and lost a fortune, clocked up a succession of court appearances, was married several times, and invariably left people with a smile on their face. ""When I was growing up, everybody in my family knew who he was because of his flamboyance and character,"" says historian and author Stephen Bourne. ""He shouldn't be bypassed. He should be part of British history because he was such a popular character."" Thanks to painstaking research from retired policeman John Pearson, the truth about Monolulu's life has taken shape. Monolulu pictured addressing large crowds at Aintree in 1931 Now 84, former inspector Pearson recalls how, in his rookie days as a bobby on the beat in the 1950s, he bumped into a larger-than-life character in Buckinghamshire market town Chesham. ""I turned around and thought 'who on earth is that?' I got the shock of my life. I was looking straight into the eyes of what I thought was an African chief,"" he remembers. Curious, he set about discovering more and his interest turned into a serious hobby after Monolulu's death and his own retirement. Having appealed for more information, he was contacted by an air hostess who remembered taking Monolulu on a flight to Paris, who said that he'd had a Danish passport. He remains keen to find out more. ""Eventually after a lot of research I managed to establish that he was originally from St Croix in the US Virgin Islands,"" says Pearson. ""His beginnings were very humble, but he obviously had a very sharp mind and spoke several languages."" Epsom racecourse, 1938. Monolulu was also said to have worked as an opera singer in Russia. Born Peter Carl McKay in 1881, Monolulu arrived in Britain from the United States around 20 years later, seeking a better life, having earlier claimed to have been shipwrecked. In London he joined the chorus line of In Dahomey, an all-black West End musical show, and appears to have developed his interest in racing after meeting an Irish tipster. Away from the track, he could be found in the capital's markets such as East Street and Petticoat Lane, selling lucky mascots and even medicines that claimed to cure anything from flat feet to baldness.  Pearson has visited St Croix, tracked down archive records and even helped open a new housing development called Monolulu Court in south London. ""There is some myth and legend. If he felt something was going down well, it probably got enhanced a bit. I think a lot of it is true,"" he says. ""He says he was married six times, but I've only found evidence of three. His claim to be from Ethiopia was a load of rubbish, but it gave him the chance to dress up as someone who would be recognised. ""A black man here in those days had to work twice as hard to make his presence felt in society and Monolulu somehow got right on top of it all."" Bourne says: ""He probably did encounter racism, like many black people would have done. ""There may have been some in the upper classes who laughed at him not with him. The lower classes loved him - he wasn't a figure of fun, he was a man of the people. If you look at the pictures, he's surrounded by smiling people.""  Monolulu's charismatic force made him a star - he even had a London pub named after him Monolulu appeared in newspapers and cartoons and on cigarette cards, and was used by the government for public information campaigns. As his fame spread, he visited the United States to watch famous boxers such as Joe Louis and Sugar Ray Robinson and appeared alongside the Marx Brothers on television.  He was well known to crime writer Edgar Wallace, racehorse owner Prince Aly Khan and Lord Lonsdale (of boxing belt fame). ""When the Second World War broke out he was one of the first public figures to appear in a newsreel encouraging the British public to carry gas masks,"" says Bourne. ""If you go to VE day, he's in the crowd jumping up and down at Buckingham Palace with a big grin on his face. He bookends the beginning and end of the war. He was a remarkable character."" Monolulu's grandson Peter lives and works in Sweden - Peter's son Cristoffer has a tattoo of Monolulu on his arm Peter Granwe remembers raising a glass to his grandfather when a pub named after him was open - the Prince Monolulu in London's Fitzrovia. His son Cristoffer was with him and has a permanent reminder of his great-grandfather. ""I'm very proud and my son, who's now 35, is very proud,"" says Peter from his home in Sweden. ""On his lower arm he has a tattoo of Monolulu, which is from a picture in the National Portrait Gallery., external ""I have a small boathouse north of Gothenburg and I have a sort of man cave where Monolulu stuff is all over the wall. ""He was a unique character, absolutely. He liked to make people laugh."" With Pearson's help, Peter has researched his grandfather and read his 1950 autobiography in which the list of unlikely jobs is covered. ""I'm not sure everything in the book is 100%. He made a history about himself,"" says Peter, who is a treatment assistant helping young immigrants and drug addicts. His uncle told him of being carried around the streets of Soho on the shoulders of Monolulu, who would look out for those down on their luck. ""He would give them a piece of paper with his address in Cleveland Street. You can go there, he would say - there is rice and eggs, but you have to do the washing as I have no butler,"" Peter says. ""After he died, the place was ransacked. The only thing left in the apartment was lion claws. I got one claw. I gave it to my son for his birthday."" Even Monolulu's death is wrapped up in legend - neither his grandson Peter nor Pearson know the truth Comedian and broadcaster Stephen K Amos knows more about Monolulu than most, having narrated a BBC Radio 4 documentary on his life. ""I'm sad his story is not better known,"" he says. ""I've had talks about doing a programme on forgotten black heroes in the UK. He might have to be a four-parter. Listen: The Prince Monolulu Quandary ""He could have just put his head down, worked in a factory or transport system, and lived a regular life. He chose not to do that in the same way I chose not to do that. If that means taking a risk and it pays off, great."" Bourne is pleased we are talking about Monolulu in Black History Month. ""He wasn't a minstrel. He's a national treasure, no question about it - he was a respected figure,"" he says. ""The problem is a younger generation in this country are not told about black Britons in history. It's the fault of the education system.""  Pearson, who has become friends with members of Monolulu's family, is still piecing together the puzzle.  ""I cannot believe that after so many years I'm still finding out bits and pieces. Things come in from all over the world,"" he says. ""It would be nice to have a trust where information could come in. He was such a unique character he would make a fine musical."" For Amos, he is someone who 'represented' - his success earning respect from peers, just as he has with high-profile TV performances such as the Royal Variety Performance. ""To me as a black man, a performer, an entertainer, his story is a part of mine,"" reflects the comic. ""He'd been through adversity, and made something of himself. Wow, that's someone to look up to."" Peter chuckles as he recounts the myriad tales: ""The story of my grandfather's life will never die.""  Pictured at Epsom in 1923. Monolulu's autobiography 'I Gotta Horse', published in 1950 and now out of print, details many of the myths he created. Monolulu's story may be a lesson in character and survival. He also leaves a greater legacy. ""It has taught me, if I needed teaching, a tolerance and respect for people, whatever background or colour they are, as long as they are good people,"" concludes Pearson. ""He probably cheered a lot of people up, particularly when they were down. He would be very useful in these particular times now."" Monolulu died on Valentine's Day, 1965. Legend says he choked in hospital on a chocolate given to him by journalist Jeffrey Bernard. Not even his grandson Peter or Pearson are sure whether it's true. A strawberry cream, it's said, from a box of Black Magic.  It seems too unlikely. But with Prince Monolulu, you just never knew.

Spread to US Treasury,Mortgage 'trap' group hopes for Post Office boost,2024-09-25,2024-01-25,By Simon Ward & Greig Watson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-68088315,"A group representing thousands of homeowners trapped in expensive mortgages hopes the Post Office TV series will boost its campaign. About 250,000 accounts were sold to investment firms when Northern Rock went bust in 2008. But these firms were not licensed to offer new deals and borrowers have struggled to find offers elsewhere. Leicestershire-based Rachel Neale, from the Mortgage Prisoners group, said the TV show echoed her experiences.  One of the major events of the 2008 financial crisis in the UK was the collapse of Northern Rock bank. The government sold off its mortgage portfolio to firms which did not operate in the same way.  Ms Neale, from Hinckley in Leicestershire, said: ""The government sold our mortgages to a company that was unregulated and had no lending licence. ""We tried to switch but when we searched the market we were told we did not meet the new affordability tests because the criteria had changed. ""And because we had been sold on to a company - though they had assured the government they would have a lending licence - they never obtained that lending licence and could not offer any products."" When those customers' original deal expired, most were caught in a trap of being unable to move to a new lender but with the company they were with only able to put them on an expensive standard variable interest rate. Ms Neale said: ""They are losing their homes, they are unable to move, they have been left on severely high interest rates. ""And they have kept up those payments but they are still told they are bad borrowers and been victimised by the government."" Joe Green, independent financial expert, said: ""Lately they have been told [their rate will be] 2, 3, 4 and 5% higher which means hundreds of pounds per month more. ""Many people can't afford that so they fall into arrears or they opt to go onto an interest-only mortgage, which means their balance never comes down."" Ms Neale's family only managed to secure a new deal with a different lender two years ago. She said the attention given to ITV's Mr Bates vs the Post Office had given her renewed focus. ""When I watched the Post Office Scandal and you see the meetings that he had to go through and the promises he had made, it is exactly the same as to what I and our team have to go through. ""We are told 'things are going to change, things are going to happen' and yet 15 years later we are still sat here with absolutely no action,"" she said. When the matter was raised at Prime Minister's Questions last week, Rishi Sunak promised action. He said: ""I am familiar with the situation for mortgage prisoners. ""It is something I worked on as chancellor and I know the Treasury and the current chancellor have been engaging with campaign groups and others to find ways to resolve it. ""It is not an easy situation to fix overnight but there are things that are being looked at as we speak."" A Treasury spokesman said: ""We have updated mortgage lending rules removing the barrier that prevented some mortgage prisoners from being able to switch and introduced significant financial and legal protections for those most in difficulty. ""We continue to work with the Financial Conduct Authority and the sector on this issue and will carefully consider practical and proportionate solutions put forward."" A legal case involving thousands of customers against some of the finance companies is due to start this summer. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

Spread to US Treasury,Trial of British hedge fund trader accused of £1.4bn fraud begins,2024-09-25,2024-03-11,Theo Leggett,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gmjdnn13vo,"The fraud trial of a British hedge fund trader renowned for throwing extravagant parties and hosting stars such as Prince at charity concerts has begun. Sanjay Shah is one of nine British and US nationals accused of defrauding Denmark out of $1.8bn (£1.4bn) through major tax evasion and avoidance schemes. The so-called cum-ex schemes were designed to exploit weaknesses in national tax laws and focused on huge share trades, which were carried out with the sole purpose of generating multiple refunds of a tax that had only been paid once. Mr Shah, the founder of London-based hedge fund Solo Capital Partners, denies any wrongdoing. He has been held in custody in Denmark since being extradited to the country following his arrest in Dubai in 2022. Prosecutors alleged that Mr Shah, the main suspect in the case, fraudulently obtained a dividend tax refund from the Danish treasury via the trading schemes that flourished following the 2008 financial crisis, Reuters reported. So-called cum-ex trades involved the sale of shares from one investor to another immediately before the payment of a dividend to shareholders (cum, or with, dividend), while they were delivered after the dividend date (ex-dividend). The practice enabled both parties to claim refunds of withholding tax - even though the tax itself, charged on the dividend at source, would only have been paid once. In order to maximise the potential gains, elaborate structures were built which allowed huge quantities of shares, often borrowed, to be passed in a circular manner between a number of different parties. The structures were designed to remove market risk and to disguise what was going on. The scam began to gather momentum in Germany in the early 2000s, until the authorities there clamped down on the practice. It later spread to other jurisdictions, notably Denmark. The UK was not a major target for the scam but many of the trades themselves were orchestrated from London. The Denmark government has said cum-ex schemes have cost it more than 12.7bn Danish crowns ($1.8bn) between 2012 and 2015. At the opening of Mr Shah's trial, prosecutor Marie Tullin asked the court to confiscate assets belonging to him worth 7.2bn Danish crowns, which included a list of properties mostly in the UK. He became renowned for throwing extravagant parties, while celebrities such as Prince and Ricky Martin agreed to perform at concerts for an autism charity he founded."
Spread to US Treasury,"Spirit of Thatcherism will help North, Gove says",2024-09-25,2023-01-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-64397775,"Michael Gove has told the North of England's political leaders he will harness the ""spirit"" of Thatcherism to raise living standards in the region. The levelling up secretary told a conference the former prime minister was an inspiration for the policy. His speech followed Northern leaders' call to enshrine levelling up in law. Shadow Levelling Up Secretary Lisa Nandy said Mr Gove's comments were ""extraordinary after the devastation of the Thatcher years on the North"". Mr Gove was speaking at the Convention of the North, a major gathering of political and business leaders in Manchester, which included the Labour mayors of Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Liverpool City Region and North of Tyne. He said the ""active"" government of Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her 1980s transformation of the London docklands was an inspiration for the levelling up plan to narrow economic and social disparities between the North and South of England. He said the ""spirit"" of Thatcherism would help close the gap on the social and economic disparities between the regions and that failure to deal with them would lead to more welfare dependency, social problems and pressure on the NHS and the public purse. ""When the Thatcher government took office in 1979, London's docklands were a derelict economic desert,"" he said. ""The original vision for regeneration of the area, from the Treasury of the time, was simple: just cut taxes and deregulate and a thousand flowers will bloom in the dusty and contaminated soil of the docklands."" Mr Gove said Mrs Thatcher helped set up deeper government intervention through the London Docklands Development Corporation, bringing jobs and housing and transforming that area of the capital. ""Government created the environment, the private sector created the jobs,"" he said. ""London Docklands today is an economic success story, one of the most signal successes we owe to Mrs Thatcher's government, and it is that spirit that animates our levelling up policies: active government."" His comments came after a report by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said the North of England receives some of the lowest levels of investment for an advanced economy. He added that his Levelling Up White Paper, which was released in 2022, aimed to meet the challenges ""head on"" and spread growth and prosperity across the whole of the UK. ""We are reforming the shape and nature of government in England itself, redistributing power and influence within England to strengthen cities and communities outside London, with the North benefiting most of all,"" he said. Margaret Thatcher is a divisive figure in the North of England, with many former mining communities blaming her policies for their demise, and few politicians have attracted such strength of feeling, both for and against. To her detractors, she was the politician who put the free market above all else and who was willing to allow others to pay the price for her policies in terms of rising unemployment and social unrest, but her supporters hail her for rolling back the frontiers of an overburdening state, reducing the influence of powerful trades union leaders and restoring Britain's standing in the world. Ms Nandy told the convention the UK was in a ""national malaise"" and had a ""broken"" political system which had to ""change or die"". She said the policy's ""begging bowl"" system of bidding needed to change and promised that under any future Labour government, there would be a significant expansion of devolution, with local authorities deciding how government money was spent and town halls having powers over housing, transport, energy, childcare, skills, employment support and training. Speaking afterwards, she told BBC North West Tonight that Mr Gove's comments were ""extraordinary, after the devastation of the Thatcher years on the North of England"". ""It felt like the government wasn't just not on our side, it was attacking the people of the North… that you would have a cabinet minister threatening to harness the spirit of Thatcherism,"" she said. Earlier, the Northern mayors joined together to call on the government to scrap the current competitive bidding system for levelling up funding. The government recently announced the latest tranche of levelling up funding, but some areas complained they had not received a fair share. Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham said hard-wiring levelling up into UK law ""would move us away from policy by press release and start to tackle the unequal living standards we have in our country"". ""Our own history has shown us that, too often, the north struggles to get to the top of the government's to-do list - whichever political party is in charge,"" he said. North of Tyne's Jamie Driscoll added that the government must ""bin the beauty pageant of competitive bidding between councils"".  ""We need to replace it with a new social settlement that finally proves to the apprentice in Blyth that they are just as important to the future of this country as the graduate in Kensington,"" he said. Oliver Coppard, who represents South Yorkshire, said the current disparities were unacceptable. ""If you live in Rotherham you're likely to die five years earlier than if you live in Richmond. If you live in Barnsley you're paid £600 less a month than if you live in Berkshire,"" he said. The West Midlands' Conservative mayor Andy Street has previously called for an end to Whitehall's ""broken begging bowl culture"", while Prime Minister Rishi Sunak defended the latest allocation of grants and said the North received the most in terms of funding per person.

Spread to US Treasury,TV licence fee consultation opens,2024-09-25,2020-02-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-51373372,"Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan has launched a public consultation on whether non-payment of the TV licence fee should remain a criminal offence. Currently, anyone who watches or records live TV or uses iPlayer without a TV licence is guilty of a criminal offence and could go to prison. Baroness Morgan said it was time to think about keeping the fee ""relevant"" in a ""changing media landscape"". The BBC said a 2015 review found the current system to be the fairest.  The consultation, which will last eight weeks with the government publishing its response this summer, will also look at the viability of an alternative enforcement scheme.  Decriminalisation would not mean payment would become voluntary. It could instead mean it would become a civil offence similar to non-payment of council tax or an electricity bill.  In a speech on Wednesday, Baroness Morgan said many people thought it wrong that ""you can be imprisoned for not paying the TV licence and its enforcement punishes the vulnerable"".   ""We are launching a public consultation to make sure we have a fair and proportionate approach to licence fee penalties and payments, that protects those most in need in society,"" she added. The culture secretary also announced a new flexible payment scheme, called the Simple Payment Plan, to help those struggling to pay, including the over-75s. It will allow people to spread the fee out into a number of manageable instalments.  ""This will help prepare the BBC and public service broadcasting for the future and make sure it continues to work for our society, our economy, and the public which funds it,"" said Baroness Morgan.  Last year, Treasury minister Rishi Sunak said the Prime Minister Boris Johnson had ordered a review of the sanction for non-payment of the £154.50 charge, which funds the BBC. Confirmation of the consultation comes two days after it was announced the fee is to increase by £3, from £154.50 to £157.50, from 1 April 2020. It also follows the controversy last year over the decision to scrap free licences for some over-75s, a decision which saw a number of celebrities joining the call for the decision to be overturned.  From June, only over-75s who are claiming pension credit will be eligible for a free TV licence. Former BBC chairman Lord Grade's urged the government not to ""impoverish and weaken"" the corporation, which he described as the ""corner stone"" of the creative industries in the UK.  He said the BBC had ""huge success in promoting the brand of Great Britain around the world"", adding that any plan to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee ""feels like another attempt to impoverish the BBC and weaken it"" and should be ""abandoned immediately"". Baroness Morgan said her plans should not be seen as ""any kind of attack on the BBC"". The broadcaster is an ""incredibly important organisation in the UK and around the world"", she said, but added it was the government's ""duty"" to look into the issue of funding. In a statement, the BBC said ""a detailed government-commissioned review (in 2015) found the current system to be the fairest and most effective"".  ""It did not recommend change - in part because the current system is effective in ensuring payment with very few people ever going to prison.  ""If there are changes, they must be fair to law abiding licence fee payers and delivered in a way that doesn't fundamentally undermine the BBC's ability to deliver the services they love."" In 2018, more than 121,000 people were convicted and sentenced for evasion and issued with an average fine of £176. There were around 26 million TV licences being used in the UK last year, generating £3.69bn in income for the BBC. If decriminalisation of the TV licence fee were to go through, it would have a considerable impact on BBC funding.  The DCMS (Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport) said the government would take into account the impact on the corporation in the context of the overall licence fee settlement, for which negotiations begin later this year.  A previous government review in 2015 looked into whether a fine for non-payment could be issued under civil law instead, similar to the fees for breaking parking, bus lane and congestion charge rules. The review also examined whether unpaid TV licence fees should be considered a civil debt in the same way as unpaid utility bills or council tax. However, it recommended against changing the criminal sanctions regime, saying decriminalisation could bring with it an increased risk of evasion.  A consultation is a process used by public bodies that invites the public to provide their views and feedback on a particular proposal. The members of the public who are asked are individuals and organisations that would be affected directly or indirectly by a project or a decision.  They include those who have the ability to influence the decision, both positively and negatively. They can also be people who simply have an interest in the project.

""The five of us are on the bare minimum, I don't know how we'll get by.""  Junior is one of the many now struggling because they do not qualify for emergency government support offered to workers affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Two weeks ago he lost his new sales job because he had not been there long enough to be furloughed or put on state-paid leave, having started after 28 February. As he was previously self-employed, he couldn't ask an old employer to furlough him. And he says there is no freelance work to go back to.  Making things tougher, Junior's wife had a baby boy in February and is only getting half her normal salary while on maternity leave. ""We won't have enough to pay for our gas and electric, our car repayments,"" he says. On top of those expenses, the couple also have three kids to feed. ""I thought about getting a job at a supermarket but don't want to bring the virus home,"" Junior explains. ""You have to put on a brave face for the kids, but it is a stressful time."" As large parts of the economy have been shut down to battle Covid-19, the government has provided a huge package of support for those who have lost their jobs or income. Millions should benefit but some have not been able to get help because they don't meet the strict eligibility criteria, or were laid off. Cheryl Carroll, 39, from South East London is self employed but cannot access the SEISS scheme, which would let her claim a taxable grant worth 80% of her trading profits, up to £2,500 per month for three months.  The events director has only worked for herself for 16 months, which means she does not have accounts going back further than 2019. This means she is unable to fulfil a government requirement for support.  ""All events have been stopped and I have no income coming in,"" she says. ""I applied for universal credit but it will take at least five weeks, and from what I can gather, it will only be £75 a week.""  Cheryl got a three month mortgage holiday from the bank and lives alone, with no dependents. But she is using her savings to pay her outgoings and fears she won't have enough left to pay her next tax bill when it's due. ""It's a worrying time and I feel a bit abandoned by the government,"" she says. Cheryl says she could sell her house if things got really bad, but she does not want to. There are five million self-employed people in the UK and the government says 95% will be eligible for emergency support. But research from the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed suggests 45% of self-employed workers think they won't have enough money to cover basic costs during the crisis, despite the help on offer.  That includes directors of small limited companies, who take their income fully or partially in dividends, which the government will not cover. Michelle Donald, 41, says turnover at the small recruitment company she runs with her husband in Norfolk ""dropped to virtually zero overnight"" when the crisis hit. ""Whilst we are lucky in the sense that our overheads are small, the lack of support from the government for our personal income is what will ruin us,"" the company director says.  Because she pays herself a small basic salary alongside her dividends, she will be able to furlough herself and claim 80% of that income - about £800 a month.  But her husband can't do the same, as he has to continue his duties to try to keep business afloat. ""We are not wealthy by any stretch. We have three kids in the house and our monthly outgoings will be about £1,500 a month if we get a mortgage holiday,"" says Michelle. ""We have a little bit of savings but it's all we have got. If we have to use those, we will come out of this with literally not a penny to our name."" She thinks company directors have been discriminated against because people think they don't pay as much tax and national insurance, when in fact ""the difference is minimal"". She and her husband also put lots of their own money into building the business ,which ""could very well go under"". A petition urging the government to cover dividend income through the coronavirus job retention scheme has been signed by 320,000 people. A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""The chancellor has outlined an unprecedented package of measures to protect millions of people's jobs and incomes as part of the national effort in response to coronavirus. ""Those who do not qualify for the support schemes will be able to access a range of other measures - including an increase in the universal credit allowance, income tax deferrals, £1bn more support for renters and access to three-month mortgage holidays."""

Spread to US Treasury,UK economy rebounds with fastest growth since WW2,2024-09-25,2022-02-11,Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60344573,"The UK economy rebounded last year with growth of 7.5% despite falling back in December due to Omicron restrictions, official figures show. It was the fastest pace of growth since 1941, although it came after a dramatic 9.4% collapse in 2020 as the pandemic forced parts of the economy to shut. In December, the economy shrank 0.2% as Omicron restrictions hit the hospitality and retail sectors. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the economy had been ""remarkably resilient"". The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed that in the last three months of 2021 growth was 1%, which ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said was ""pretty healthy"" given Omicron's spread and the introduction of some restrictions.  The figures were stronger than expected, and Mr Morgan told the BBC the expansion in 2021 showed the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of nations. However, he urged caution about making strict comparisons. ""The growth in 2021 comes from a low base in 2020, when the economy fell sharply,"" Mr Morgan said. ""And if you look at where the UK economy is now, compared to its pre-pandemic level... the UK is middle of the pack, compared with the G7."" He said using this comparison, the US, Canadian and French economies were above the UK's, while the UK was above Italy, Germany and Japan. The worst of the overall pandemic economic hit is now behind us but the aftershocks remain. Downing Street is unlikely to avoid the opportunity to boast about 2021. During its hosting of the G7, the UK is now confirmed as the fastest growing economy of these major nations.  But that comparison needs a great dollop of context. The 7.5% growth the UK economy recorded in 2021 is the highest of the G7 major economies and that does indicate a strong bounceback.  This, as the ONS points to, should be seen alongside the sharpest fall of 9.4% for the UK compared to those same economies in 2020. On the internationally comparable basis, the economy is still slightly smaller than it was at the end of December 2019, unlike the US, France and Canada. On the slightly more timely basis, using monthly data not available in other countries, the UK economy is larger than it was in February 2020. The UK economy grew by 1% in the final quarter of 2021, a little lower than expectations, as the spread of the Omicron variant weighed on the economy in December. But as ever during these extraordinary times, this already looks like a rear view mirror on events. Looking forward, the extraordinary cost of living squeeze, with energy and other prices leading to falls in average living standards, is the significant iceberg for the economy in 2022.  The ONS said that despite the fall in December, on a monthly basis GDP was in line with its pre-coronavirus level in February 2020.  However, GDP in the October-to-December quarter remains 0.4% below its pre-Covid levels in the final three months of 2019. Mr Sunak told the BBC: ""Today's figures show that despite Omicron the economy was remarkably resilient. We were the fastest growing economy in the G7 last year and are forecast to continue being the fastest growing economy this year. ""But I know that people are worried about rising prices, particularly energy bills... and that's why last week we announced a significant package of support to help millions of families meet the cost of bills."" Last year's growth was the strongest since ONS records began in 1948 and the fastest since 1941, during World War Two, using data collected by the Bank of England. The slump of 9.4% in 2020 was the biggest drop since 1919 when there was demobilisation after World War One. After 18 months of uncertainty, Ollie Vaulkhard's coffee shop and restaurant chain in north east England was seeing a strong end to 2021.  He told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme that October and November were great months for the Vaulkhard Group as the economy opened up, but then things started to slow when Omicron hit. ""We lost customers, we lost staff to isolation and we had people being cautious because they had plans for Christmas."" He doesn't regard December as a disaster, more a loss of momentum. ""We lost the fizz off the top of a glass of champagne,"" he said. A better December would have been a good launch into 2022, when Mr Vaulkhard expects some tough times. ""We have wage cost rises, we have supply cost rises, we've had some brewery costs going up by 7% - they are all large,"" he said. The pandemic and lockdown kept a lid on costs for two years, but suddenly it's changing. ""I would prefer not to have them [price rises], but given the challenges we had this seems like another bridge to cross that we'll have to find a way over."" The economy is expected to face headwinds in 2022. Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates, cut its economic growth forecast from 5% to 3.75% for this year and predicted that households were about to suffer the sharpest fall in living standards since records began three decades ago. This, said Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, would mean the economy will ""crawl"" this year and see the slowest growth of any G7 country. ""The reality is the way the government runs our economy is trapping us in a high tax, low growth cycle,"" he said. Inflation is forecast to hit 7% in April, the same month workers and firms will start to see a rise in their National Insurance (NI) contributions. Mr Sunak has been under pressure to scrap the NI increase, but vowed this month that it would go ahead. Thomas Pugh, an economist at RSM UK, said he expected output lost during December and January to be regained in February and March, ""meaning that Omicron should not have had a lasting impact on the economy"". But he warned that consumer spending power would take a big hit in 2002. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chamber of Commerce, said that ""crippling"" inflation, tax rises in April, and higher energy bills means ""the UK economy is facing a materially weaker 2022""."
Spread to US Treasury,"Spread energy costs over several years, says boss",2024-09-25,2022-01-25,Oliver Smith,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60127507,"Spreading the cost of high gas prices over a number of years is the best way to deal with price spikes, the  boss of one of the UK's biggest energy firms has said. Octopus Energy's Greg Jackson said it was the only option able to ""make a real difference to all customers"". Spreading the cost would mean consumers would avoid hefty increases to their energy bills, he said. Energy costs are expected to jump in April when the price cap is revised. In an email to customers, Mr Jackson said: ""Spreading the cost of this sudden spike over several years will allow us to make the imminent April rise much, much smaller - more like £12 per month - and adjust prices to gradually cover the cost over time."" The price cap, which sets the maximum rate suppliers can charge for a default tariff, means the typical household should pay no more than £1,277. The new level for the cap, which applies to England, Scotland and Wales, is due to be announced on 7 February. Industry trade body Energy UK has already warned that bills could jump by 50% this year unless the government intervenes. The government has been talking to the energy industry for a number of weeks to try to agree on a way forward to tackle soaring prices. Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, said problems currently impacting gas supplies in Europe could continue into 2025. ""The high energy prices seen in recent months are not necessarily a one-off,"" it said. A number of options have been discussed, including reducing the 5% VAT on bills, increasing the Warm Homes Discount offered to people in receipt of certain benefits and shifting green levies - which fund renewable energy projects - from bills into general taxation. Some form of financial mechanism to smooth prices, such as loans to energy companies to be paid back over a number of years, has also been discussed, though it is an option that doesn't have the full backing of the industry itself.  This month, the boss of Britain's biggest energy provider, Centrica, told the BBC he wasn't in favour of the move, and that it would amount to a ""bailout"" for the sector. Octopus Energy's Mr Jackson told customers there were a number of options to finance such a scheme. ""Private funding can be found for deferring these costs which means we may be able to do it without Treasury funding"", though he added: ""Of course, that may be an option too"". He warned that when the price cap is updated in April, the average bill is likely to rise by as much as 75% compared to the same time last year. ""That's another £60 a month: a huge burden for most homes,"" he said. He said a huge amount of effort was being made by energy companies, the regulator Ofgem, and the government ""to try and ensure there is decisive, collective action that best protects as many households as possible"". But he acknowledged the outcome of the discussions currently taking place was uncertain. ""Honestly, I don't know if we'll be successful. But if we aren't, it won't be from lack of trying."""
Spread to US Treasury,Oil prices rise following Hamas attack on Israel,2024-09-25,2023-10-09,Annabelle Liang,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67050612,"Oil prices have jumped on concerns that the situation in Israel and Gaza could disrupt output from the Middle East. Brent crude, the international benchmark, climbed by $2.25 a barrel to $86.83, while US prices also rose. Israel and Palestinian territories are not oil producers but the Middle Eastern region accounts for almost a third of global supply. Hamas's assault on Israel was the biggest escalation between the two sides for decades. Western nations condemned the attacks. A spokesperson for Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, told the BBC that the group had direct backing for the move from Iran - one of the world's largest oil producers.  Iran denied involvement in the assault at a UN Security Council meeting in New York on Sunday, Reuters reported. But Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has expressed support for the attack. On Monday, Israel ordered US oil giant Chevron to pause production at the Tamar natural gas field off the country's northern coast, which is within range of rocket fire from the Gaza Strip. The country's energy ministry, which has closed the field during previous periods of unrest, said there was enough fuel from other sources to meet Israel's energy needs.  Israel's largest offshore gas field, Leviathan, continues to operate as normal, Chevron said. Energy analyst Saul Kavonic told the BBC that global oil prices have risen ""due to the prospect of a wider conflagration that could spread to nearby major oil-producing nations such as Iran and Saudi Arabia"".  On Monday morning, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, was up $2.50 a barrel at $85.30. ""If the conflict envelops Iran, which has been accused of supporting the Hamas attacks, up to 3% of global oil supply is at risk,"" Mr Kavonic added. Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics, told the BBC's Today programme that Iran had been increasing oil production over the course of this year despite US sanctions. ""The US seems to have turned a blind eye to a steady increase in Iranian production, that... is going to be more difficult for the US to ignore going forward from here,"" she said. Overall, Ms Bain said Capital Economics expected demand for oil to exceed supply in the final three months of the year and ""that should support higher prices"". Mr Kavonic said that about a fifth of global supply would be ""held hostage"" if passage through the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil trading route is disrupted. The Strait of Hormuz is crucial for the main oil exporters in the Gulf region, whose economies are built around oil and gas production. Uncertainty over how events could develop in the coming days may also drive investments into US Treasury bonds and the dollar, which investors traditionally buy at times of crisis, said James Cheo from HSBC bank. On Monday, Israel's central bank said it would sell up to $30bn of foreign currency in a bid to calm markets and support the country's own currency, the shekel, which has fallen sharply.  ""At this stage, there is a bit of nervousness. [Investors] want to see a little more clarity, particularly on economic data and on developments associated with geopolitical uncertainty,"" added Mr Cheo. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, oil prices soared, hitting more than $120 a barrel in June last year.  They fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in May this year, but have steadily risen since then as producers have tried to restrict output to support the market. Saudi Arabia, a major oil producer, said it would make cuts of a million barrels per day in July. Other members of Opec+, a group of oil-producing countries, also agreed to continued cuts in production in an attempt to shore up flagging prices. Opec+ accounts for around 40% of the world's crude oil and its decisions can have a major impact on oil prices."
Spread to US Treasury,Sudan fighting: Why it matters to countries worldwide,2024-09-25,2023-04-20,By Andrew Harding,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-65338247,"If you want to know why Sudan matters to so many other countries, just take a look at a map. There's a reason why the fighting that has erupted there over the past week is ringing so many international alarm bells. Sudan is not only huge - the third largest country in Africa - it also stretches across an unstable and geopolitically vital region.  Whatever happens militarily or politically in the capital, Khartoum, ripples across some of the most fragile parts of the continent. The country straddles the Nile River, making the nation's fate of almost existential importance; downstream, to water-hungry Egypt, and upstream, to land-locked Ethiopia with its ambitious hydro-electric plans that now affect the river's flow. Sudan borders seven countries in all, each with security challenges that are intertwined with the politics of Khartoum.  Trouble in Sudan's western Darfur region almost inevitably spills over into neighbouring Chad, and vice versa. Weapons and fighters from coup-prone Chad, and from the war-torn Central African Republic, often flow freely across the region's porous borders. Much the same has proved true with Libya, to the north-west. Sudan borders the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia - only recently emerging from a gruelling conflict that involved another unpredictable neighbour, the isolated and highly militarised autocracy of Eritrea. There is also tension on other parts of Ethiopia and Sudan's shared - and in places, contested - border.                                                                                                                                                  To the south, Sudan faces a relatively new nation, South Sudan, which formally broke away from its northern neighbour in 2011 after one of Africa's longest and bloodiest civil wars. That border, too, remains unstable.  South Sudan quickly spiralled into the sort of broad scale civil war that some fear could now be Sudan's fate too. Upon independence, South Sudan took with it most of the region's precious oil fields, leaving Sudan far poorer, and contributing, indirectly, to the current crisis in Khartoum, as rival military groups now struggle for control of shrinking economic resources, like gold and agriculture. As part of that struggle, Sudan's generals - the military have always been big, allegedly corrupt players in the local economy - have gone in search of foreign partners. For agriculture, that has meant inviting Gulf states to invest in the huge, and relatively underused potential of the rich soil that borders the Nile River. When it comes to gold, far murkier deals appear to have been done with Russia's notorious Wagner group, which is accused of smuggling gold out of Sudan. The US Treasury has accused Wagner's head, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, of ""exploiting Sudan's natural resources for personal gain and spreading malign influence"" online through his ""troll farm"".  Russia's interests in the country, and region, go much further. Eastern Sudan's stark coastline looks out onto the Red Sea.  The Kremlin has, for years, been seeking to establish a military base in Port Sudan, giving its warships access to - and influence over - one of the world's busiest and most contested sea lanes. Moscow has come close to finalising a deal about the base with Sudan's military government - which seized power in 2021 in a coup. Not surprisingly, a vast range of governments are now seeking to influence events on the ground in Sudan.  For now, the focus appears to be on ending the battle between the army and the RSF paramilitary group before it spreads further, and threatens to evolve from a relatively straightforward power struggle into a more complex civil war.  Beyond that, some foreign governments are anxious to help guide Sudan towards the democracy that many had hoped might follow the overthrow, back in 2019, of the country's brutal ruler, Omar al-Bashir.  But other states may prefer to back another strongman, and to thwart the will of the Sudanese people, who have waited decades for one of Africa's struggling giants to fulfil its potential."
Spread to US Treasury,"Buy now, pay later: People using service for food, warn charities",2024-09-25,2023-06-20,By Zola Hargreaves & Anna Palmer,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-65962530,"More young people are getting into buy now pay later debt as some turn to schemes for essentials, charities say. Firms such as Clearpay, Zilch and Klarna let people pay their debt off over a short period, but many charge a fee if payments are missed. Molly Dixon went ""cold turkey"" after some of her friends ran up ""£500 worth of debt they can't pay"" and she ""never wants it to get to that point"". The UK government said it was ensuring schemes were ""safe and regulated"". Richard Lane, director of external affairs at Step Change, said the debt charity had seen ""more and more young people coming to us"" with buy now, pay later debt since the start of the cost of living crisis. He added: ""These products are being primarily marketed to young people. ""We are incredibly worried that people are taking out credit without necessarily understanding what they're committing to and what the repercussions are if they're unable to pay."" Mr Lane told Wales Live that buy now, pay later was ""a great product"" that worked well for many people to spread the costs of larger purchases. But the market is unregulated and debt charities have been demanding that the UK government brings it under the oversight of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Klarna said it had measures to help protect consumers and restricts the use of services after missed payments to stop debt from building up, with 99% of its lending getting repaid.  Citizens Advice Cymru said 8% of the people it helped in February had used this type of credit to pay for essentials such as food and toiletries. Director Simon Hatch said: ""We know that many people are staying at home, having to live with their parents, and they're working.  ""But that still doesn't mean that they're earning sufficient to contribute or pay all of their bills. And what we are seeing is that people are going into debt to support their buy now, pay later needs."" Cardiff University student Mia Herford, 21, used a lending scheme once and thought it was ""quite good"" at the time. ""But then I realised I wasn't a massive fan of it because then I was seeing the payments coming out of my account after the following months,"" she added. Not everyone has had problems and Evie Old said she would use it again.""I've used like Klarna and things like that when I'm buying quite a few items of clothing,"" she said. ""It's not saving money but it feels like you are because you're spreading the cost out over a few months.""It was pretty positive, I would do it [again], I didn't have any problems with it."" Molly Dixon said: ""You feel like 'oh great I'm getting a bunch of new clothes' or whatever it is - you're buying but then the payments come out every month and you're still thinking 'wait I actually couldn't afford this even then, why am I still paying for it'? ""I think it's marketed to - and I'm literally stood here in a Pretty Little Thing top - consumerism and fast fashion. It just makes it so much easier to buy into the trends."" Talia Lieberman, 22, said she tried to avoid buy now, pay later but had used it ""for one-off purchases"" for ""clothes or shoes"" in order to be able buy things she would not otherwise be able to afford. She said she had never been worried about repayments. ""For me it was positive because I think I've been quite responsible with it,"" she added. Cardiff Metropolitan University has brought in a specialist debt advisor to help students. Leanne Herberg, the university's money advice coordinator, said she believed short-term loans were spreading and people were now using them for takeaways.  She added: ""They have that option and the worry is if you are putting everything on to a [buy now, pay later] credit payment then that is really is hard to manage and keep a track of in terms of the repayments subsequently going out and making sure that you've got the budget to accommodate the repayments."" Philip Belamant is the founder of Zilch, which is regulated by the FCA.  He said some similar schemes were designed ""for retailers, not consumers"" with the aim of some companies being to keep shoppers on the website and ""hurry customers through the journey"". In 2021, the UK government said it would regulate buy now, pay later products. Proposed draft legislation is being consulted on, but there is no set timeframe for regulation. The Treasury said: ""While these products can help consumers manage their finances when used appropriately, we are making sure the product is safe and regulated - protecting borrowers from falling into problem debt."""
Spread to US Treasury,The future of tax: Adding value,2024-09-25,2020-07-26,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-53545987,"Tax: it's the only certainty other than death, according to Benjamin Franklin. But is it inevitable the tax system stays, at least roughly, the way it is? It's always in flux - a machine that nobody would have designed from scratch, and which requires endless tinkering to keep it operational. But it's now more challenged than ever. More tax revenue will be needed to fund the borrowing and enhanced public services we seem to want after the Covid-19 crisis, particularly for health and social care. Reform is long overdue, and this could be an opportune moment for a big reboot. This week, the Treasury began consulting on more digital collection and reviewing English business rates. The Commons finance committee has just launched a wide-ranging review of the tax system. The Institute of Fiscal Studies, and in Scotland, the David Hume Institute, have begun detailed discussions of wealth tax. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC), Westminster's spending watchdog, last week set out big, difficult questions about tax breaks. ""They're not freebies,"" said Meg Hillier, the PAC chair. ""They cost the public purse hundreds of billions of pounds in lost income."" That includes £38 billion of giveaways to pension savers. Does it change behaviour and draw in more savings, or merely add to funds that people would be saving anyway? If the latter, it's badly targeted. A further £15 billion is given away on VAT, charged at 5% on household fuel and zero on food, children's clothes, books and newspapers. At the IFS, they say that would be better targeted at people on low income if VAT were 20% on everything, with compensation through benefits. The complexity of reforming tax is partly because it's intended to achieve different outcomes. Much of it is to raise revenue, to fund public services. The big three elements are income tax, national insurance and Value Added Tax. Income tax is diverging between Scotland and England, and tax on employment is inconsistent across employed, self-employed and (typically high earners with) one-person service companies. But a lot of it, in piecemeal form, is to change behaviour: stop smoking, drink and gamble in moderation, reduce carbon emissions and landfill, shift to an electric car and get married. The risk with that is that it's too successful. Push people away from using diesel and petrol, towards electric battery cars, and the government creates a very large hole in its revenue. It introduced a sugary soft drinks tax, with a lead time for manufacturers to cut sugar content. They did so, it succeeded on health grounds, but brought in less revenue than expected. By tipping income tax away from low earners to high, by raising the starting threshold to £12,500, makes it fairer. But it also makes revenue highly dependent on small numbers of very high earners. They're internationally mobile, they have clever accountants, and the system is vulnerable to sudden moves of their income from one tax jurisdiction to another. That competitive element of tax at the upper end is also a feature of corporation tax. Ireland set the pace with a 12.5% tax rate, which was vital to transforming its economic performance. The UK has since fallen from 30% to 19%, as other countries have also cut to avoid loss of foreign investment. Capturing the internationally mobile tax base is also a big challenge with the digital economy. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google are huge players in the economy but pay very little tax in large countries, because they say their software and algorithms are to be found in low-tax jurisdictions. The UK is one of several European countries that wants to tax that activity. France is to the fore in doing so. But an attempt by the OECD richer country club to co-ordinate digital taxes has been fatally undermined by the Trump administration pulling out of the project. The taxes are seen as anti-American, and US trade tariffs are threatened against countries that introduce a tax unilaterally. As some sources of tax ebb away, such as fuel duty and digital commerce, the search is for a more reliable future tax base. Wealth is one obvious place to look. Much of the nation's wealth is held in pensions, yet - as the PAC noted - we give huge tax breaks to those who build up wealth to fund their retirement.  Property is another widely-spread form of wealth-holding. That's already taxed, with transaction tax, under similar systems in Scotland, Wales, and England with Northern Ireland. Apart from raising revenue, that makes no sense at all. It penalises those who have to move, for instance for a job, it's an extra charge on growing families who need a bigger home, and it's an incentive for older people with big houses not to downsize and make way for larger families. Homes are also subject to council tax. Lower-income households pay a larger share of that income on council tax than higher-income ones.  The Scottish system has tinkered with that, but only at the margins. It continues to share with England the increasingly absurd valuation base of 1991 prices. No government is willing to revalue, because losers complain loudly and winners take their gains for granted. If those who could gain by revaluation realised how much they're missing out, they'd be complaining loudly already. There is a case for abolishing both council tax and transactions tax, and rolling them into a annual property tax based directly on valuation. But that, too, would mean some people getting much bigger bills  For financial wealth, such as share-holdings, that is much more focussed in high net worth households, and the Treasury is looking at changes to Capital Gains Tax. Land could be taxed more efficiently. There are problems there: a lot of Scottish land doesn't generate much income, and the more productive land is heavily subsidised. Government could also put more of a burden on to inheritance tax, but it knows there is a fierce backlash awaiting them among traditional Tory voters and their cheerleading newspapers. One idea for exceptional times is for a one-off wealth tax, to pay the one-off costs of the current crisis and set government debt back to more manageable levels - say, 2% of everything you own, above a certain threshold. Theoretically, it makes some sense. Practically, it would be a nightmare - identifying wealth, ensuring it's not hidden, turning physical assets into cash for payment. Politically, that looks tougher still. Could Holyrood make much of this tax reform? It hasn't done the borrowing to tackle the health and economic crisis, but it will surely suffer the effect of cost cutting when the bills come in, so flexibility on tax raising would be handy. MSPs are limited on many fronts, particularly where reserved powers over benefits, national insurance and unearned income tax (on dividends) don't mesh with its newish income tax powers. But rather than focus on what it can't do, there are things it could tackle. Business rates are now a target for Whitehall reform. There's a risk that Scotland gets left behind with an out-dated system, punishing already traumatised retailers, and could be forced to adjust and match English reforms. Council tax and business rates could have been reformed since the Parliament first sat in 1999. But SNP, Labour and Liberal Democrats all failed to live up to their rhetoric on council tax, and on it goes. Holyrood can diverge on air passenger duty, but it's choosing not to do so. It has given powers to councils to introduce tourist taxes and workplace parking charges, but ministers don't sound keen on seeing those powers used. Next to require decisions could be tax on sugary, salty and fatty foods. The prime minister is a new convert to government ""nanny""-ism and in recent days, he seems to be setting the pace."
Spread to US Treasury,UK faces 1980s-levels of jobless - ex-chancellors,2024-09-25,2020-06-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52909859,"As the UK begins to ease lockdown restrictions, three former UK chancellors have been quizzed by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee about the effects of coronavirus on the UK economy. Alistair Darling, George Osborne and Philip Hammond were asked about the severity of the crisis versus the 2008-2009 financial crash; what measures could revive the economy; and whether taxes should increase to help pay the UK's mounting debts.  They also suggested that unemployment could reach levels not seen since the 1980s. Alistair Darling: ""They are very different and this one [coronavirus], in my view, is much more serious. ""The key difference between then and now is that from day one, the government wanted to get the economy going again, and therefore we introduced a range of measures, which enabled us to do that. ""The situation today is different, in that firstly, it is part of government policy right across the world, and rightly so, to actually suppress economic activity through the lockdown and other measures... Unless and until the government gets control of the virus itself and the spread of the virus, it's difficult to see how you can pull out the stops and get the economy going again."" George Osborne: ""I am more optimistic, I think, than Alistair. If you look at the history of pandemics and plagues and the like in our society, then the economic bounceback is going to be relatively rapid. ""If you look at the history of banking crises throughout our history, not just the one 10 years ago, but in the 1920s and 30s and in the 19th Century and before, recoveries are very slow and protracted and painful, because the credit channels of the economy are impaired, and despite all the work that Alistair did, and I did, to try and unclog those channels, it takes a long time for the allocation of capital to get to the efficiency it has before the banking crash."" Philip Hammond: ""In terms of which is the worst, I think it is too early to say yet, because a lot is going to depend on whether over the next months it becomes clear that we are heading towards either a vaccine... and that the future trajectory is one of returning the economy to something like normal, or whether, by contrast, we are not heading towards an early development of a vaccine or a treatment, and we have to plan in terms of restarting the economy living with Covid."" Lord Darling: ""The government will need to introduce measures, firstly to deal with a wave of unemployment which I think will come once the furlough system starts being phased out, and also to make sure that people who are displaced from the workplace, who lose their jobs, that we can get them back into work as quickly as possible. ""It will be necessary for the government to make sure that you don't end up with a recession becoming a depression."" Mr Osborne: ""The central challenge... is how do you withdraw some of the very necessary schemes to have kept people in work and businesses afloat during the crisis. The furlough scheme has been absolutely essential... many people on furlough are going to go back to their jobs.  ""But we have to be honest and say that quite a lot of those businesses will not come back... and trapping people on a scheme that is generous to them in the short term, but actually prevents them from re-entering the labour force to get the new job they need, is potentially very damaging.  ""So I think the withdrawal of the furlough is going to be important for employment in the short term, and at the same time some of these loans to businesses that are never coming back are going to become an issue."" Mr Osborne: ""There's a whole separate issue about what you do with these large stakes we're going to take in large companies like airlines, potentially, and aerospace manufacturers.  ""All of us have experience on this panel of pretending that you're managing these bank holdings that we had in the last decade at arm's length, and still when Treasury questions came up we were being asked about the bonuses being paid to chief executives, why branches were being closed in the constituencies of members. ""I can imagine an airline saying it wants to shut an uneconomic route to one of the further-flung parts of the UK... I think that's going to be more problematic than I think people have realised at the moment."" Lord Darling: ""We need to get ourselves into the frame of mind where we're thinking about 1980's levels of unemployment. ""If it doesn't happen, that's great, but I think we need to be ready for that, and if we're not ready for that, people will ask: 'Why didn't you start thinking abut these things?'"" ""If you take the aviation industry, you'll notice that France and Germany are not indifferent to whether or not their national airline is surviving. Our model here is slightly different, in that the idea of a flag-carrier isn't quite what it was, but I think most people would take the view that we've got to ensure that we've got a transport industry."" Lord Darling: ""If you want stimulate the economy, the most obvious thing to do is a time limited VAT reduction. ""When we get to the happy day when we're recovering... yes, we are going have very high debts, like we had at the end of the Second World War, but one of the things that a government like ours can do... you can actually carry that for some period. I would be very concerned if in the recovery phase you start clamping down on things prematurely, and you drive the country back into a recession."" Mr Hammond: ""I don't think there's any economic logic to increasing taxes in the short term. I think we all accept that the UK as a credit-worthy, mature, larger economy can carry more debt in the context of the short term crisis.  ""Of course, we have to remember that debt is cumulative by its nature. We increased debt very substantially during the course of dealing with the last crisis, and we'd only just got back to the point where we were starting to see debt very slightly decline as a share of GDP. Now we're going to see it increase significantly again as a share of GDP, so eventually we have to think about how we manage the challenge of debt in the long term."""
Spread to US Treasury,Covid: Firms urge PM for clarity on restrictions over Christmas,2024-09-25,2021-12-21,By Doug Faulkner & Dulcie Lee,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-59736716,"Hospitality and entertainment firms are calling for a clear decision from the government on whether there will be further Covid restrictions in England in the coming days. Boris Johnson did not announce any new measures on Monday, but said data was being reviewed ""hour by hour"". Labour's London mayor Sadiq Khan warned time was running out. The chancellor met business leaders who want financial support on Monday evening, minister Stephen Barclay said. He said the government would ""say more"" about these discussions later and also urged people to have a ""cautious"" Christmas. Meanwhile, the health secretary is understood to want people with Covid to isolate for seven days, instead of 10. Sajid Javid is thought to be in favour of doing this - if clinical advice supports the change - to help ease potential staff shortages across the NHS and other organisations. With just four days until Christmas, people are looking forward to spending time with loved ones after many missed out last year, when restrictions were brought in just before Christmas. BBC political correspondent Damian Grammaticas said it now seemed unlikely that new restrictions could be enacted in England before Christmas. But hospitality and entertainment businesses face critical decisions in the coming hours about whether to cancel events over the holiday period, he added. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a former member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this was the most ""difficult and uncertain time"" since March 2020. Omicron's transmission was ""eye-wateringly high"", he said, adding that the variant's rapid spread was driving its impact more than its severity. Amid ongoing uncertainty about the severity of Omicron, he said it was reasonable to pause for 24 to 36 hours until that data emerges. But he said if hospitalisations were rising at that stage, the government would have to act - perhaps with more draconian measures than if they had acted a few days ago. A government spokesperson said they would continue to support businesses into spring and in the meantime people were being advised to exercise caution, follow plan B guidance and get their booster jabs. The UK's sharp rise in UK cases is already affecting events across the country: Former government chief scientific adviser Sir Mark Walport warned that the true number of daily Covid infections was more likely to be between 300,000 and 400,000, as only about a third of cases were being identified. He told BBC Breakfast delaying any decision on restrictions was ""potentially very problematic"" as rising cases meant some hospitalisations and deaths were already ""baked into the system"". In London - which is ahead of the curve on Omicron cases - hospitalisations have risen by about a third in a week, he said. London hospital group Barts Health Trust has already written to doctors warning they may have to cancel ""some or much"" of their planned operations in January to cope with the incoming Covid surge. After a two-hour cabinet meeting on Monday, the prime minister said the government was ""looking at all kinds of things"" to curb Omicron and ""ruled nothing out"". There were still some things ""we need to be clearer about before we decide to go further"", he added. Ministers have argued that more information about the new variant is needed to justify the economic impact of any restrictions. Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said that instead of imposing restrictions, the government should trust people to make the right decisions to protect their families, reports the Times. Last Christmas, large parts of south-east England were banned from mixing with other households, while for the rest of England, Scotland and Wales, people were only allowed to mix indoors on Christmas Day. The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged people to cancel some of their holiday plans as the Omicron variant spreads globally. ""An event cancelled is better than a life cancelled,"" said WHO head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. On Monday, a further 91,743 Covid cases were reported across the UK - the second highest daily total on record. High cases mean many people are off work and self-isolating - while others have cancelled bookings or events to try to avoid becoming infected in the run-up to Christmas, hitting businesses hard. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality which represents more than 700 bars, hotels and leisure venues, said some had lost about half of their usual December trade. She said businesses were now ""in limbo"" and needed notice of any changes looked at next week ahead of the New Year. Labour has called for the government to publish its contingency plan to deal with Covid-related staff shortages in essential services. The party's deputy leader Angela Rayner said ""dithering and delay"" had caused disruption throughout the pandemic, and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the PM was giving chaos and confusion when clarity and reassurance was needed. Without early interventions the UK would see a wave of infections over the next few months, according to Sage scientist Prof Andrew Hayward, which could lead to staffing problems becoming ""much, much more severe"" and make essential services ""difficult to manage"". The UK's devolved nations have been setting their own Covid guidelines ahead of Christmas. Leaked notes from Sage suggest that, without intervention beyond current Plan B rules in England, hospital admissions could reach 3,000 a day. And the BBC has been told that civil servants have produced three options for future Covid measures, ranging in severity from low to medium and high.

Spread to US Treasury,Russians charged in Evil Corp hack investigation,2024-09-25,2019-12-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50677512,"US authorities have filed charges against two Russian nationals alleged to be running a global cyber crime organisation named Evil Corp. An indictment named Maksim Yakubets and Igor Turashev - who remain at large - as figures in a group which used malware to steal millions of dollars in more than 40 countries. Those affected by the hacks include schools and religious organisations. It is also alleged that Mr Yakubets worked for Russian intelligence. Speaking at a news conference, Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski said the attacks were among ""the worst computer hacking and bank fraud schemes of the past decade"". Mr Yakubets is accused of leading Moscow-based Evil Corp, while Mr Turashev allegedly acted as an administrator. The pair are thought to be in Russia. Thursday's indictment came after a multi-year investigation by the FBI, and by Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) and Cyber Security Centre. US authorities allege that the group stole at least $100m (£76m) using Bugat malware - known as Dridex. The malware was spread through so-called ""phishing"" campaigns, which encouraged victims to click on malicious links sent by email from supposedly trusted entities. Once a computer was infected, the group stole personal banking information which was used to transfer funds. A network of money launderers - targeted by the NCA and Britain's Metropolitan Police - were then utilised to funnel the criminal proceeds to members of Evil Corp. Eight members of this network have been sentenced to a total of over 40 years in prison. US authorities said Mr Yakubets was also involved in a similar scheme using another form of malware - known as Zeus - which stole $70m from victims' bank accounts. The NCA alleged that Maksim Yakubets spent more than £250,000 ($328,971) of criminal proceeds on his wedding. He is also said to drive a customised Lamborghini with a personalised number plate which reads ""Thief"" in Russian.  In a separate statement, the US Treasury alleged that, since 2017, Mr Yakubets had worked on projects for the Russian state, including the theft of confidential documents and ""cyber-enabled operations"". The department said it had rolled out sanctions against 17 individuals and seven ""entities,"" including businesses associated with a member of the group. A $5m reward has been offered for information leading to their arrest and prosecution. The US Department of Justice said the amount was the largest offered for a cyber criminal to date. "
Spread to US Treasury,Sunak to unveil emergency jobs scheme,2024-09-25,2020-09-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54272938,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak will later unveil a plan aimed at minimising further unemployment as stricter Covid-19 restrictions come into force. The new measures are expected to replace the furlough scheme, which is set to expire next month. In July, around five million workers were still receiving some or all of their income through the scheme, many in the hospitality sector. Pubs and restaurants have warned they will be hit hard by new restrictions. From Thursday, hospitality venues in England will have to shut at 22:00 BST as the government tries to control the spread of the coronavirus.  Scotland is introducing similar measures, with pubs and restaurants having to close at 22:00 BST from Friday, while in Wales restrictions are limited to stopping alcohol sales at 22:00 from Thursday. ""Lots of businesses will not survive this and we are going to see more and more people lose their jobs,"" said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UKHospitality. At around 11:45, the chancellor is expected to address the Commons to unveil plans that the government hopes will stem those job losses. The Treasury said the chancellor had been ""preparing contingency plans over the summer in case the pandemic required it"".  It is understood Mr Sunak has been considering different forms of wage subsidy and will announce more financial help. He is also thought to be looking at options including a salary top-up scheme, similar to those already operating in France and Germany. The prime minister said Mr Sunak was working on ""creative and imaginative"" solutions. Although the Treasury has declined to comment, possible ideas are thought to include allowing firms to reduce employees' hours while keeping them in a job, with the government paying part of the lost wages. Mr Sunak also announced on Wednesday that the Autumn Budget would be scrapped this year because of the pandemic. While latest government figures are yet to be released, the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank estimates almost three million - or 12% of the workforce - are currently furloughed.  Director Paul Johnson said he expected a ""big rise"" in unemployment when the existing furlough scheme expires at the end of next month. ""We've already seen something like a reduction of nearly three quarters of a million... in terms of the number of people on payroll and then we've got at least another two million or so on furlough not working,"" Mr Johnson told the BBC's Today programme.  ""Some of those will likely be supported by this new scheme but not all of them and that implies, I suspect, by the end of the year that we will have something like... two million fewer than we had at the beginning of the year, although oddly that doesn't seem to be translating at the moment into the official unemployment figures."" Cancelling the Budget is a big deal, because of what it shows about the big picture: a government still in crisis mode, having to put off medium-term tough decisions, on tax rises, that would have at least been signalled in the contents of a Budget Red Box. But we will get more spending, more support for jobs. As the chancellor told me last week, that does not mean extending the furlough scheme endlessly, but he has been thinking ""creatively"".  The discussions with business groups and unions have centred around supporting employers with cash flow constraints to keep viable jobs. The furlough scheme's initial purpose was to support people's wages, expressly for them to stay at home.  The new scheme is likely to take inspiration from continental Europe, by subsidising ""short time"" work, that is to say, helping top up pay for workers given fewer hours of work in the crisis.  The furlough scheme is regularly lauded by the prime minister, and has undoubtedly been one of the most competently executed policy responses of the Covid crisis. Throw in the fact that the Tory ""red wall"" is more comfortable with use of state spending, and some Tory thinkers advocate a permanent scheme of wage support, such as occurs in Germany. We also expect extensions by weeks or months of the various loan guarantee schemes offered by the Treasury. Already banks are fretting about having to call in some of these loans. Now significant swathes of the economy remain under the shadow of the pandemic and of ongoing social restrictions meant to defeat it. It is difficult to see how a full Spending Review over four years could occur. The Treasury can not calculate the size of the pie to be sliced up. Having a one year review, like last year, also avoids some corrosive internal politics over winners and losers. So more spending, and more jobs support, as infection rates rise, and restrictions look likely to be strengthened rather than loosened, but not yet accounting for how it is all to be paid for, at a time of high and rising public borrowing. The government has been under mounting pressure to extend or replace the furlough scheme, which will wind down next month. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was introduced in March and paid 80% of the wages of workers placed on leave, up to a maximum of £2,500 a month.  Since then, employers have been asked to pay 10% of the wages of those on furlough, plus their National Insurance and pension contributions.  Furloughed workers can also now return to work part-time with the government paying for any remaining hours not worked. During the weekly Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Boris Johnson faced calls from MPs from all sides to act quickly to help those businesses hit hardest by the new restrictions on economic and leisure activity.  Citing Whitbread's announcement that it planned to cut up to 6,000 jobs in the UK, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the threat to employment was ""not theoretical"". ""The CBI, the TUC, the Federation of Small Business, the British Chamber of Commerce and the Governor of the Bank of England are all calling on the PM to stop and rethink and don't withdraw furlough,"" he said. In a televised response to Tuesday's prime ministerial broadcast, Sir Keir called for a ""Plan B"" for the economy - ""because it makes no sense to bring in new restrictions at the same time as phasing out support for jobs and businesses.""

Spread to US Treasury,Trump: Syria strikes statement in full,2024-09-25,2018-04-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-43766967,"My fellow Americans, a short time ago I ordered the United States armed forces to launch precision strikes on targets associated with the chemical weapons capabilities of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A combined operation with the armed forces of France and the United Kingdom is now under way. We thank them both. Tonight, I want to speak with you about why we have taken this action. One year ago, Assad launched a savage chemical weapons attack against his own innocent people. The United States responded with 58 missile strikes that destroyed 20% of the Syrian air force. Last Saturday, the Assad regime again deployed chemical weapons to slaughter innocent civilians - this time, in the town of Douma, near the Syrian capital of Damascus. This massacre was a significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use by that very terrible regime. The evil and the despicable attack left mothers and fathers, infants and children, thrashing in pain and gasping for air. These are not the actions of a man; they are crimes of a monster instead. Following the horrors of World War One a century ago, civilized nations joined together to ban chemical warfare. Chemical weapons are uniquely dangerous not only because they inflict gruesome suffering, but because even small amounts can unleash widespread devastation. The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons. Establishing this deterrent is a vital national security interest of the United States. The combined American, British, and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power - military, economic, and diplomatic. We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents. I also have a message tonight for the two governments most responsible for supporting, equipping, and financing the criminal Assad regime. To Iran, and to Russia, I ask: what kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women, and children? The nations of the world can be judged by the friends they keep. No nation can succeed in the long run by promoting rogue states, brutal tyrants, and murderous dictators. In 2013, President Putin and his government promised the world that they would guarantee the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons. Assad's recent attack - and today's response - are the direct result of Russia's failure to keep that promise. Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path, or if it will join with civilized nations as a force for stability and peace. Hopefully, someday we'll get along with Russia, and maybe even Iran - but maybe not. I will say this: The United States has a lot to offer, with the greatest and most powerful economy in the history of the world. In Syria, the United States - with a small force being used to eliminate what is left of Isis (the Islamic State group) - is doing what is necessary to protect the American people. Over the last year, nearly 100% of the territory once controlled by the so-called Isis caliphate in Syria and Iraq has been liberated and eliminated. The United States has also rebuilt our friendships across the Middle East. We have asked our partners to take greater responsibility for securing their home region, including contributing large amounts of money for the resources, equipment, and all of the anti-Isis effort. Increased engagement from our friends, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, and others can ensure that Iran does not profit from the eradication of Isis. America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria, under no circumstances. As other nations step up their contributions, we look forward to the day when we can bring our warriors home. And great warriors they are. Looking around our very troubled world, Americans have no illusions. We cannot purge the world of evil, or act everywhere there is tyranny. No amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East. It's a troubled place. We will try to make it better, but it is a troubled place. The United States will be a partner and a friend, but the fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people. In the last century, we looked straight into the darkest places of the human soul. We saw the anguish that can be unleashed and the evil that can take hold. By the end of the World War One, more than one million people had been killed or injured by chemical weapons. We never want to see that ghastly spectre return. So today, the nations of Britain, France, and the United States of America have marshalled their righteous power against barbarism and brutality. Tonight, I ask all Americans to say a prayer for our noble warriors and our allies as they carry out their missions. We pray that God will bring comfort to those suffering in Syria. We pray that God will guide the whole region toward a future of dignity and of peace. And we pray that God will continue to watch over and bless the United States of America. Thank you, and goodnight. Thank you."
Spread to US Treasury,Russia has seized a fifth of Ukraine - Zelensky,2024-09-25,2022-06-02,By Matt Murphy,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61675915,"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says that Russian forces have seized 20% of his country's territory, as Moscow's invasion nears its 100th day.  Addressing lawmakers in Luxembourg, he added that the front line extended for more than 1,000km (621 miles). ""All combat-ready Russian military formations are involved in this aggression,"" he told MPs via videolink. Russian forces have been intensifying attacks on the city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region. UK defence officials say Russia has seized most of the city and are making ""steady local gains, enabled by a heavy concentration of artillery"".  Severodonetsk is the easternmost city under Ukrainian control and regional governor Serhiy Haidai said Russia was trying to break through defences in the city ""from all directions"".  However he said Ukrainian troops were carrying out counter-attacks, ""pushing back the enemy on some streets and taking several prisoners"".   Intense street-to-street fighting in the city had hampered evacuations, he said, describing such efforts as ""extremely dangerous"".   In a video address late on Thursday evening, Mr Zelensky said the situation in Donbas had not changed significantly that day but that Ukrainians had experienced ""some success"" in battles in Severodonetsk. Some 15,000 civilians remain trapped in the city, with many of them taking shelter at the massive Azot chemical plant.  On Wednesday, Mr Zelensky accused Russia of ""madness"" after its troops allegedly targeted the site during an artillery barrage.  Further south, the mayor of the occupied city of Mariupol has accused Russian forces of executing civil servants who have refused to collaborate with the new Moscow-backed city authority.  Vadym Boychenko, who was evacuated from Mariupol before it fell, said dozens of residents were being held at the Olenivka Prison and that he had received reports of locals being tortured by occupying forces. The BBC cannot verify these allegations. Last week an adviser to Mr Boychenko told CNN that at least 22,000 people had been killed during Russia's siege and bombardment of the city.  In the north-east, Russian shelling killed a woman and injured a man in Kharkiv, regional officials said. And in western Ukraine five civilians were hurt in missile strikes on Lviv, regional head Maksym Kozytskyi said.  Western leaders are also stepping up sanctions against key allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin.  US Treasury Department officials unveiled a new raft of sanctions on Thursday, with targets including several yachts allegedly linked to Mr Putin and a cellist who allegedly acts as a middleman for the Russian leader. US officials will seek to seize two vessels, the Russian-flagged Graceful and the Cayman islands-flagged Olympia, which were identified as personal assets of Mr Putin.  The cellist, Sergei Roldugin, is allegedly a custodian of the Russian president's offshore wealth. Five oligarchs with links to Mr Putin as well as Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova will also have any US assets frozen and are barred from doing business with US-based corporations.  EU diplomats are said to have finalised a sixth package of sanctions against Moscow.  The sanctions, which include a limited ban on Russian oil imports, were reportedly agreed after officials accepted a Hungarian request to remove the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, from the list of targets.  The president of the European Parliament also announced a ban on Russian lobbyists entering the chamber's campus.  Roberta Metsola wrote on Twitter that she was keen to deprive Moscow's representatives of the ability ""to spread their propaganda & false, toxic narratives about the invasion of Ukraine"".  On Wednesday President Joe Biden announced that the US would supply Ukraine with new long-range missiles capable of hitting targets at distances of up to 70km (45 miles).  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused the US and its allies of intentionally prolonging the war and of ""adding fuel to the fire"" with the deliveries. "
Spread to US Treasury,Tougher Welsh Covid rules at Christmas not ruled out,2024-09-25,2021-12-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-59652887,"Tougher restrictions cannot be ruled out over Christmas, Wales' health minister has said. At a government press conference, Eluned Morgan said she does not want to ""cancel"" Christmas. But she said nothing is being taken off the table. Ms Morgan's comments came as she laid out how the Welsh NHS will cope with a surge in booster jabs, with all available NHS staff to be redeployed to vaccination centres. The Tories say there is not enough information yet to demonstrate a need for further restrictions. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru raised concerns ministers had not clearly explained how the enhanced booster programme will be delivered. The Welsh NHS is offering all adults a booster before December in response to an expected wave of the Omicron variant that officials fear could overrun the NHS with new Covid cases. A further two cases of Omicron were announced in Wales on Tuesday, bringing the total to 32. On Tuesday, the number of deaths in Wales which involved Covid exceeded 9,000. Office of National Statistics figures show 9,051 Covid deaths have occurred up to 11 December.  Ms Morgan said it is likely there will be additional restrictions introduced at the next review of coronavirus rules - expected this Friday. ""The last thing we want to do is cancel Christmas,"" she said. ""I think it's important we make that absolutely clear. ""But we're certainly not taking anything off the table either."" ""So the best thing for people to do is to see if we can remain in a situation where we are able to see each over Christmas... to take precautions now, so we don't see the increase in rates we're expecting."" Asked whether she could rule out restrictions on Christmas Day, she added: ""I'm really sorry, I can't be clearer with you, because we genuinely have no idea how quickly this Omicron is going to spread. ""Certainly, I think people should plan because we don't know what the situation is going to be at Christmas time."" Under the plans to boost the vaccine rollout, the NHS will continue to provide essential services, emergency and urgent care, but will otherwise shift its focus to vaccines. The Welsh government says it will be running a hybrid model of appointments and some walk-in sessions, with the second aimed at specific age groups and people who may have not been contacted or cannot make an allot appointment. Opening times at mass vaccination centres - already open from 09:00 to 20:00 - will be extended further. Everyone who has received their first and second jabs will be texted or phoned and offered a booster in the coming days. The Welsh government urged people to check their local health board's website for details - and not to ring their GP or their health board. The health minister said people will continue to be called in order of the risk they face from Covid. She said there would be a ""three week burst of activity"" from which she said they would return to ""some kind of normality"". The Welsh health minister says she hopes that everybody will receive their booster vaccine ""before the peak of the Omicron wave hits us"". Dr Gill Richardson, deputy chief medical officer who leads the Welsh vaccine programme, said some NHS services may run ""slightly slower"" while the surge takes place. Eluned Morgan said NHS staff would be asked if they can cancel leave to help with the vaccine booster programme.  A consultant who works within the Cwm Taf Morgannwg Health Board said cancelling leave would be ""utter madness that will break many staff and increase sick leave"". Dr Dai Samuel tweeted: ""Yes we need to ramp up the vaccination effort and try to reduce the impact of any potential wave which could cause hospitalisations but cancelling leave of staff already on their knees is not the right way to do it."" Politicians don't say ""I don't know"" very often, but we heard that a lot from the health minister today. And every time she said it, it was in response to questions about what Christmas in Wales would look like this year. While the continuing uncertainty over the impact of Omicron keeps us all in limbo, the mood music suggests further restrictions (or as per Scotland ""strong guidance"") on social mixing could be on their way this Friday.  While Eluned Morgan couldn't be specific, she did say some sort of tightening was likely.  On Tuesday Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, advised people to limit socialising to three other households in the run-up to Christmas. Rather than changing coronavirus rules and changing the law, however, she issued the advice in the form of ""strong guidance"".  In the Senedd on Tuesday, Mr Drakeford said that approach would be considered by the Welsh government ministers when they review the current rules. Meanwhile Mr Drakeford said a South African study on the Omicron variant, which suggested it may be causing milder illness, was ""encouraging"" but ""not to be relied upon as a strong basis for policy decision making. He said if the transmissibility of Omicron is ""of the rate that we are currently seeing in Scotland and in London"", even if the virus is milder, a large number of people would fall ill and ""those large numbers will drive people into needing the help of the NHS"". Meanwhile the UK Treasury said it was providing extra funding to the governments of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, for the vaccine rollout. It said it would confirm figures in coming weeks. Welsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said he does not think there is enough information yet to demonstrate the need for further Covid restrictions.  ""We know that the moment we've got a lower rate of the new variant in Wales, we're yet to see that increase, as the projections have, perhaps, suggested,"" he said. ""So we're not yet in a position where we need to be talking about restrictions and I hope that, of course, remains the case."" Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said the Welsh government hasn't clearly explained how the enhanced booster programme will be delivered. ""There's sky high expectations from the public,"" he said, ""but I have not yet seen how that is going to be delivered in practice"". He also said it was ""disingenuous"" of the government to urge people to come forward for boosters: ""The problem I'm getting with my constituents is not with people coming forward but people frustrated in not knowing when they are going to get their vaccination."""
Spread to US Treasury,European Union seals borders amid virus fight,2024-09-25,2020-03-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51927790,"The EU is banning travellers from outside the bloc for 30 days in an unprecedented move to seal its borders amid the coronavirus crisis. The measure is expected to apply to 26 EU states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. UK citizens will be unaffected. The ban came as deaths continued to soar in Italy and Spain, and France began a strict lockdown. Europe has been badly hit by the virus, which has killed 7,500 globally. More than 185,000 people have been infected worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Meanwhile, the Euro 2020 football competition has been postponed by a year. The travel ban will affect all non-EU nationals from visiting the bloc, except long-term residents, family members of EU nationals and diplomats, cross-border and healthcare workers, and people transporting goods. Free travel is a cherished principle within the European border-free Schengen area. But in recent days many countries have unilaterally imposed full or partial border shutdowns in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus. This prompted the commission to propose that the bloc act in a more unified fashion and restrict entry to the union as a whole, at the urging of French President Emmanuel Macron. The measures were agreed in a video-summit between EU leaders on Tuesday afternoon and will now have to be implemented by member states. ""They said they will immediately do that,"" said EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at a press conference. ""This is good, so that we have a unanimous and united approach [where] the external borders are concerned."" The UK and the Republic of Ireland - which is part of the EU but not Schengen - will be invited to join the measure. It was also crucial that the EU ""unblocks the situation"" with regards to closed internal borders, Mrs Von der Leyen said, because ""too many people are stranded"". In France, citizens who leave home must now carry a document detailing the reasons why, with fines for transgressors to be set at €135 ($150; £123). It comes after President Macron put the country on a war-footing, ordering the population to stay at home and only go out for essential trips. The number of confirmed cases in France grew by more than 16% on Tuesday, reaching 7,730, The death toll rose to 175, with 7% of the dead aged under 65. More than 2,500 people are being treated in hospital, including 699 in intensive care. In Britain, where the death toll is 71, people have been told to avoid social contact, work from home if they can and avoid all non-essential foreign travel.  The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has unveiled a financial package worth £330bn ($400bn) to ease the burden caused by the virus, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday urged people to avoid pubs, clubs and cafes. Meanwhile, the government's chief scientific adviser said it would be a ""good outcome"" if 20,000 or fewer people died of the virus in the UK. The latest set of Brexit talks has also been delayed. The number of confirmed cases in Spain has soared by 2,000 to 11,178. Authorities there are maintaining a partial lockdown on 47 million people. It is now the European country worst-affected after Italy. At midnight Spain began stopping cars crossing its borders from France and Portugal. Only Spanish nationals, residents and cross-border workers were being allowed to enter the country. Italy, which has registered the most cases outside China at more than 31,500, announced another surge in deaths on Tuesday, from 2,150 to 2,503. The country remains in lockdown. The government, meanwhile, is set to renationalise flag carrier airline Alitalia with a rescue package worth $670m (£550m). Germany, which has had more than 8,000 confirmed cases and 13 deaths, banned religious services and told people to cancel any domestic or foreign holiday travel.  Venues including clubs, bars, leisure facilities, zoos and playgrounds will be closed. Schools are already shut. Ireland could have 15,000 cases of coronavirus before the end of March, said PM Leo Varadkar. In a St Patrick's Day address, he warned of ""significant and lasting"" economic damage, and said the emergency could last into the summer. The government has already closed pubs, schools and universities.  Elsewhere in Europe: Iran remains the world's third-worst-affected nation, after China and Italy. More than 16,000 people are confirmed as infected and 988 have died, although some analysts believe the figures are far higher than officially reported. A spokesman for the judiciary said on Tuesday that 85,000 prisoners, including political prisoners, had been temporarily released to try to combat the spread. Gholamhossein Esmaili did not say when or how those freed would be returned to prison, but stressed that only prisoners serving five years or less had been released. Most shops and restaurants remain open but the health ministry has urged people to stay at home. In the US, the White House is working on a economic stimulus package reported to be worth some $850bn, with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin saying the administration was ""looking at sending cheques to Americans immediately"". The total number of cases has risen to above 6,300, with 108 deaths. Most cases are in the states of New York (1,708), Washington (1,013) and California (718).

Spread to US Treasury,'We must act' to prevent second lockdown - PM,2024-09-25,2020-09-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54093465,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said ""we must act"" to avoid another lockdown as virus cases rise in England. He set out a new ""rule of six"", restricting gatherings to a maximum of six people, enforced by police able to issue fines or make arrests. Mr Johnson also outlined a ""moonshot"" plan to control the virus with mass testing, possibly by next spring.  It comes as the UK reported another 2,659 coronavirus cases, the fourth day running of over 2,000 reported cases. ""I want to be absolutely clear, these measures are not another national lockdown. The whole point of them is to avoid a second national lockdown,"" Mr Johnson said in the first Downing Street coronavirus briefing since July. He added ""it breaks my heart to have to insist on these restrictions"". In the last week, cases have risen from 12.5 infections per 100,000 people to 19.7 per 100,000 across the UK. Coronavirus was more prevalent among young people, with 54 cases per 100,000 people in the 19 to 21-year-old age group. Mr Johnson also announced that: Mr Johnson said the rules had ""become quite complicated and confusing"" and the government was ""simplifying and strengthening"" them after feedback from police and the public. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the new rules on gatherings were a reflection that ""poor communications were a large part of the problem"" with the spread of the virus. Sir Keir said the government also needed to improve testing, which was ""all over the place"", following reports that some people have been unable to book tests. The prime minister said the government was ""working hard"" to increase testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October, but urged people only to book a test if they had coronavirus symptoms. He said they also want to use new types of test ""in the near future"" to identify people who do not have coronavirus and are not infectious so they can live life ""in a more normal way"". He said these swab or saliva tests could be turned around in 90 or even 20 minutes, with millions processed each day.  However, BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said such tests were still at the piloting stage, and so were unlikely to be manufactured or distributed before the end of the year. Discussing the plans, the prime minister evoked the Apollo space programme, describing the ""giant collaborative effort"" of this testing programme as a ""moonshot"", which could restore a more normal way of life even if a vaccine or treatment is not available. A report in the BMJ said the UK has drawn up plans to carry out up to 10 million Covid-19 tests a day by early next year, at a cost of more than £100bn.  But Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the BMA, said it was unclear how the ""moonshot"" testing would work given the ""huge problems"" currently seen with lab capacity. The Department of Health declined to comment directly on the report, but said it wanted to boost the number of tests with a rapid turnaround time. For all the talk of vaccines and rapid testing, it was clear - certainly listening to UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty - that this winter will be hard. Respiratory viruses tend to do better in the autumn and winter because of the colder weather and the fact people mix indoors more. That is why we see flu cases and, sadly, deaths rise every winter. Many experts believe the same will happen in the coming months, despite the latest measures. That means the government faces some very difficult decisions. It has to balance the impact of further restrictions - which can harm health in other ways, as well as damage education and the economy - against the risk of letting the virus spread. The public has a huge role to play. But on its own that may not be enough. Behind the scenes there is lots of focus on how to protect the vulnerable - that could mean locking down care homes and asking people to shield again.  But the UK is in a stronger position than it was at the start of the pandemic. The lockdown bought us time.  Better treatments are available and, while many problems remain with testing and tracing, the systems in place are an advance on where we were when the virus first hit the UK. These new tests will be piloted with audiences attending indoor and outdoor venues in Salford from next month. But the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the technology needed to be ""tested carefully"" and it would be ""completely wrong to assume this is a slam dunk"". The measures that needed to be taken against coronavirus were ""damaging"" socially, economically and to people with other health conditions, chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty acknowledged. ""We have to do them because the alternative is worse,"" he said.  He added that ""the period between now and spring is going to be difficult"" and people shouldn't see the restrictions ""as a very short term thing"" because they were unlikely to be lifted after just two or three weeks. Mr Johnson said it was ""too early to say"" if big parties could be held over Christmas, but added that he was ""still hopeful"" some aspects of life could return to normal by the festive season. He said the restrictions would be in place only ""as long as necessary"".  ""I'm sorry about that. I wish we did not have to take this step, but as your prime minister I must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and save lives,"" he said. The new ""rule of six"" means: The chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, Ken Marsh, said the new rules were "" very flimsy"" and would be difficult to enforce. At present, the guidance says two households of any size are allowed to meet indoors or outdoors, or up to six people from different households outdoors. Until now the police have had no powers to stop gatherings unless they exceeded 30. The number of people allowed to meet inside or outside varies in the UK's four nations. If you are meeting indoors: up to eight people from three different households can meet in Scotland; up to six people from two households in Northern Ireland; up to four households can form an ""extended household"" in Wales.

Spread to US Treasury,'Guilty until proven innocent in Nigeria',2024-09-25,2018-12-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46584251,"In our series of letters from Africa, Nigerian writer and novelist Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani tackles the culture of naming, shaming and public parading of suspects in Nigeria before taking them to court.  A few years ago, the Nigerian police paraded a gang of male armed robbers headed by a woman in front of journalists, and photos of these seven alleged criminals who had terrorised a part of Lagos were published.  I was shocked to identify the petite, light-skinned woman allegedly leading this deadly gang as a former secondary school classmate, with whom I had maintained sporadic contact over the years.  The Federal Government Girls College, Owerri, has produced a number of outstanding Nigerian females, including  World Bank Vice-President Arunma Oteh and outspoken MP Nnenna Elendu-Ukeje. But the leader of a dreaded gang of robbers was a first for us, and the news quickly spread to our alumni across the world. On a whim, I dialled the alleged gang leader's phone number a few weeks later. She was pleased to hear from me, but was driving and would call back later, she said.  The din of the surrounding Lagos traffic was proof that she was indeed not locked up in a police cell.  When she did call back, she dismissed the police's accusations, insisting that she was innocent and had simply been ""set up"".  She has not been convicted of the alleged crimes and is still walking free, despite being paraded before the media and having her reputation irredeemably soiled. The proclivity to parade suspects by the Nigerian security services and declare them guilty before the media, without a lawyer present or trial by a competent court, came to the fore recently in a heartbreaking video that has been widely published.  Nigeria's spy agency, the DSS, said a woman who they identified as Amina Mohammed posed as the wife of a state governor to gain entry to the presidential villa in the capital, Abuja. The officers forced her to face the camera and confess her alleged crimes.  But, she refused. Instead, she covered her face with her veil, screaming: ""You will not do this to me!""  In the effort to get her to cooperate, security officials yanked her veil away from her. The woman knelt on the floor, weeping. Clearly, the woman was dreadfully aware of how many Nigerian citizens have had their reputations irreparably ruined by this process. Typically, the suspect makes a full confession before the cameras, the bruises on their faces and the presence of stern security personnel leading you to wonder exactly what might have inspired the so-called admission of guilt.  For years, Nigerians have been treated to one such show after another, but this is hardly ever followed up by news of actual convictions.  The security agents appear more keen to be perceived as having done a good job, even when they may have little evidence to convict. Similar dramas have been the major characteristic of President Muhammadu Buhari's much touted anti-corruption war.  Prominent Nigerians accused of incredible levels of corruption have been filmed in handcuffs, the case against them detailed in the media, with public opinion immediately declaring them guilty.  Yet, almost four years after President Buhari took power, the majority of these alleged treasury looters still roam free.  Only a few mostly insignificant convictions have been recorded. The same has been the case for high-profile Boko Haram members captured and paraded by the military. It is possible that these media parades are an attempt by the security personnel to squeeze water out of stone, to exact some punishment for offenders since the Nigerian judiciary is notoriously slow and riddled with corruption.  The reasoning seems to be ""let's ruin their reputation even if we can't get a conviction"".  President Buhari has complained publicly about our country's judiciary, which he appears to view as a stumbling block to his dealing with offenders.  In a keynote address at the annual conference of the Nigerian Bar Association in August, he said: ""Rule of law must be subject to the supremacy of the nation's security and national interest.  ""Where national security and public interest are threatened or there is a likelihood of their being threatened, the individual rights of those allegedly responsible must take second place, in favour of the greater good of society.""  This comment and others like it led to outrage from Nigerians, many of whom are only too aware that our democratically elected president once presided over a military government characterised by a number of notorious decrees that violated human rights. The most telling evidence that President Buhari's conversion from dictator to democrat may not yet be complete is the continued incarceration of Sambo Dasuki, a former national security adviser who is accused of squandering billions of dollars meant for the prosecution of the war against Boko Haram.  He pleaded not guilty and over and over again, the courts have granted Mr Dasuki bail.  Yet, he remains behind bars three years after he was arrested, and has still not been convicted of the alleged crimes.  Mr Dasuki played a role in President Buhari's arrest back in 1985 when he was removed as head of state during a military coup, and Nigerians cannot help wonder if that little fact may not be linked to this administration's continued defiance of court orders that the man be granted bail.

Spread to US Treasury,BBC 100 Women 2021: Who is on the list?,2024-09-25,2021-12-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-59514598,"The BBC has revealed its list of 100 inspiring and influential women from around the world for 2021. This year 100 Women is highlighting those who are hitting ""reset"" - women playing their part to reinvent our society, our culture and our world. Among them are Malala Yousafzai, the youngest ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Samoa's first female prime minister Fiamē Naomi Mata'afa, Professor Heidi J Larson, who heads The Vaccine Confidence Project, and acclaimed author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.  Women from Afghanistan make up half of this year's list, some of whom appear under pseudonyms and without photos for their own safety. The resurgence of the Taliban in August 2021 has changed the lives of millions of Afghans - with girls banned from receiving secondary education, the ministry for women's affairs being disbanded, and women in many cases told not to return to work. This year's list recognises the scope of their bravery and their achievements as they are forced to reset their lives. Click here, if you can't see the list of 100 women. The BBC's 100 Women team drew up a shortlist based on names gathered by them and suggested by the BBC's network of World Service languages teams. We were looking for candidates who had made the headlines or influenced important stories over the past 12 months, as well as those who have inspiring stories to tell, achieved something significant or influenced their societies in ways that wouldn't necessarily make the news. The pool of names was then assessed against this year's theme - women who are hitting ""reset"", playing their part to reinvent our world after the global pandemic has forced so many of us to reassess the way we live. It was also measured for regional representation and due impartiality, before the final names were chosen. This year BBC 100 Women made the unprecedented decision to devote half of the list to women from one country - Afghanistan.  Recent events in the country have made headlines and left millions of Afghans questioning their future, as rights groups have spoken up in fear that women's freedoms could be eroded for the foreseeable future under the Taliban. By dedicating half of the list to women who are from or work in the country, we wanted to highlight how many of them have been forced to disappear from areas of public life, as well as to share the voices of those who are being increasingly silenced or who are part of a new Afghan diaspora.  On 3 December, the Taliban did issue a decree in the name of their supreme leader instructing ministries ""to take serious action"" on women's rights. The decree sets out the rules governing marriage and property for women, stating that women should not be forced into marriage and should not be seen as ""property"". But this declaration has been criticised by human rights organisations and observers as it fails to mention girls' secondary education and women's curtailed rights to employment.  Some of the Afghan women on the list are anonymous to protect them and their families, with their consent and following all BBC Editorial Policy and safety guidelines.

Spread to US Treasury,Trump's plans for his UK visit revealed,2024-09-25,2018-07-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44741671,"Donald Trump will meet the Queen at Windsor and hold talks with the prime minister at Chequers on his four-day visit to the UK next week.  The itinerary for Thursday and Friday confirms the US president will stay at the US Ambassador's House in Regent's Park overnight.  But he will spend much of his time outside London at formal events.  Protests in the capital will go ahead as planned, organisers have said, with others set to demonstrate in Scotland. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said it would be ""the most controversial visit ever made by an American president to Britain"". Despite some pomp and ceremony, it will be ""far from the original state visit promised to President Trump"" and remains what is deemed a working trip, Robbins added. Robbins said it was also ""really noticeable that he will barely spend any time in London"" - perhaps to avoid the protests.  But US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, said there was no deliberate plan to keep Mr Trump out of the capital or away from protests, and he was ""focused on his objectives"".  He added that it was a ""short trip, packed with things he has to do"", but that President Trump ""will be spending a lot of time in central London"". Groups organising protests on Friday have vowed to ""be heard"" whether he is in the capital or not.  President Trump will fly in to the UK on Thursday afternoon with First Lady Melania Trump, following a Nato summit in Brussels. The couple will attend a black-tie dinner on Thursday hosted by Theresa May at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire - the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill.  The president will be greeted with a military ceremony in the Great Court, with the bands of the Scots, Irish and Welsh Guards playing the Liberty Fanfare, Amazing Grace and the National Emblem.  Invited guests, including a number of business leaders, will eat dinner to the sounds of the Countess of Wessex's Orchestra, which will play a ""series of classic British and American hits"", according to Mrs May's deputy spokeswoman.  Mr Trump, whose mother was Scottish, will then be piped out at the end by the Royal Regiment of Scotland. After spending the night at Winfield House in London, hosted by his ambassador Mr Johnson, the president will join the prime minister to watch a UK military exercise, before the pair travel to Chequers - the PM's country residence in Buckinghamshire - for bilateral talks.  The president and first lady will then travel to Windsor to meet the Queen on Friday afternoon.  On the final leg of the tour, the couple will fly to Scotland, where they plan to spend the weekend.  BBC diplomatic correspondent Robbins said while the government realises it is a controversial trip, President Trump is ""fully entitled"" to be welcomed into the UK in this way.  The government also stressed that previous presidents have met prime ministers at Chequers rather than at No 10, including Richard Nixon and both the Bushes. US ambassador Mr Johnson said the ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US was ""as strong as ever"", and that Mr Trump knows the UK ""better than any other modern president"". Mrs May announced President Trump would be coming for a state visit to the UK in January 2017 after she became the first foreign leader to meet with him in Washington following his inauguration.  But after a lot of backlash from MPs and more than one million people signing a petition against the trip, a date has still not been set for the state visit.  Thousands are expected to protest in London on Thursday and Friday against the president's working visit. Police forces from across the country have been asked to send officers to assist the Metropolitan Police, including 400 from the West Midlands force.  London Mayor Sadiq Khan has granted permission for a giant inflatable figure depicting Mr Trump as a baby to fly over Westminster for two hours on the second day of the president's visit. Daniel Jones, part of the group that organised the blow-up caricature, said he hoped Mr Trump would take note of their efforts online, even if he could not see it in person. He added that, ""like it or not"", the government would not be able to ""smuggle"" the president around the country ""without him seeing anything"". Others are holding marches through the city and in Scotland - where President Trump owns golf courses.  "

Spread to US Treasury,'We could end up with no business or savings',2024-09-25,2020-04-17,By Daniel Thomas and Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52308823,"Andy Shaw, 57, has built up a painting and decorating firm with his brother-in-law Jake, but has now seen work dry up owing to the coronavirus lockdown. ""We could come out of this with no business or savings, it would be absolutely devastating,"" he says. Why? Because the business is a limited company and the duo are company directors who pay themselves in dividends. Like hundreds of thousands of people running their businesses the same way, they will get little or no state support.  His firm has been able to furlough, or put on state-paid leave, its two full-time members of staff to take off some of the pressure. But he and Jake will personally be eligible for much less, as they pay themselves in dividends, which the government will not cover. ""We can furlough ourselves for the small basic salaries we take, but that will only leave us with £600 a month, which doesn't cover my outgoings at all,"" says Andy, from Uttoxeter, Staffordshire. By furloughing themselves, they would not be allowed to work on anything that brings in money for the business, only organisational work as a director. ""It means we won't be able to work at a time when our business is on the brink,"" he says. There is a real prospect he might have to shut up shop and lay off his staff. Turning from a sole trader into a limited company has been popular in the past, with small business owners - from marketing agents to milkmen - becoming company directors and using the professional-sounding title that comes with it. Historically, it saved on their tax bill, although that benefit has been considerably watered down in recent times. For many, the attraction was to separate personal finances from that of the business and to protect themselves as individuals if something went wrong with a supplier or customer.  Even that benefit can be reduced if, for example, banks still require the business owner's home as collateral for a loan. Like so many businesses, they are now facing difficulties in the light of the coronavirus restrictions, and the choice of becoming a limited company looks set to be an expensive one. The government has said it will pay 80% of employed and self-employed workers' incomes, up to £2,500 a month, for three months if they are furloughed. But it will not cover dividends, because it says there is no way of telling whether people have received them in lieu of wages or as a return on capital in their own company or an investment. This means people such as Andy and Jake, who pay themselves mostly in dividends, say that typically furlough pay - covering 80% of what they pay themselves as a salary - would typically give them about £585 per month, making it difficult to put food on the table after business and personal bills are paid. Campaigners point out that most company directors are not especially wealthy, with many running small firms or operating by themselves. ""These are real, hard-working people who have built up successful businesses and paid taxes all their lives, who now find themselves facing hardship with little of the current support available for them,"" says Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses. Some 327,000 people have signed a petition calling on the government to change course. One remedy, they argue, is for dividend income to be included in the calculations for furlough, rather than only a salary. Although the small business minister has offered some support, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he is open to ideas, there is no plan from the Treasury to change its policy as yet. ""Those who do not qualify for the support schemes will be able to access a range of other measures,"" a Treasury spokeswoman says, including income tax referrals and mortgage holidays. Nick Steele, 46, is one of many who say they set up as a limited company on the encouragement of one government, only now to be treated inferiorly by another. He and his partner have run a hospitality recruitment company in Gloucestershire since 2006, but since the epidemic hit, all of their work has evaporated. ""Back then, I think they thought it was more controllable and easier to tax limited companies. Now it seems this government wants to crush us,"" he says. ""I have no choice but to sell personal possessions and borrow money. For the record, I can't get a government grant because I have no premises; I might be able to get a loan, but I don't want to take that risk."" He thinks the government is uninterested in supporting limited company directors because of a perception they pay less tax. But the recruitment professional, who earns about £45,000 a year, mainly in dividends, says he pays ""no more or less tax than self-employed or employed people"". He also points out he is not entitled to government subsidised benefits such as statutory sick pay. ""I'm not some high net worth individual, I'm not squirrelling money away. I fill out a tax return every year, it's just that in one column I state my income from PAYE, and in another the income from dividends. ""The government's policy just doesn't stack up."" Sonali Joshi, 45, whose business provides access services to the film industry, such as subtitles and audio descriptions, says she is struggling to make ends meet. ""While we have plenty of ideas of how to reconfigure our business during this difficult time, we need investment to do this and right now we have nothing."" She says they cannot access a Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan, according to their bank, because their 2019 turnover was less than £100,000. They are also not eligible for a £10,000 government grant for small-to-medium sized enterprises that receive rates relief, as they do not have any premises. ""VAT deferral does little for us, since work tailed off weeks ago, as we work internationally and coronavirus began to impact our work much earlier this year. We also do not qualify for universal credit,"" she says. ""We feel let down by the government. We hear the chancellor saying, 'We are all in this together,' and that the UK is a great environment for small business, but it doesn't feel like that now, due to the lack of support."""
Spread to US Treasury,Small charities face 'slow death' due to pandemic,2024-09-25,2020-11-06,By Paul Lynch,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54754902,"Thousands of smaller charities across the UK could cease to exist in the new year, experts fear, following a shift in the nature of giving. Fundraising data and recent polls have shown a surge in donations to new NHS charities since March.  Causes such as animal shelters, disability support groups and homeless shelters have, however, seen a fall. The government issued a £750m bailout to the sector in April but there are now growing calls for more support. A new report by the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) said overall giving in the UK had increased by £800m in 2020, compared to the previous year. But it says that increase has not been felt by a swathe of the 110,000 smaller charities in the UK, many of which would normally rely on events such as abseils, skydives, village fetes and quiz nights to top up their funds. BBC analysis shows almost eight out of ten charities have an income of less than £100,000 a year and account for just 3% of the total income. The foundation's chief executive Neil Heslop said the ""Protect the NHS"" slogan and support for Captain Tom Moore's bid to walk 100 laps around his garden in April for NHS Charities Together had led to an outpouring of support for causes considered on the the frontline of the pandemic. But he said other causes were being left at risk as a result. ""NHS charities and hospitals themselves have seen a huge upsurge in support and that's been wonderful to see,"" he said. ""The challenge has really been for many other charities, especially the smaller ones that do not have much by way of reserves, that saw their normal fundraising drives completely shut down."" Polling by YouGov suggests animal shelters have seen the biggest year-on-year decline in donations.  A Yorkshire cat sanctuary said the pandemic's impact had put it ""back a decade"". Two of the biggest fundraising sites in the UK have also reported a similar trend. Between March and August, JustGiving saw donations to charities concerning education and disability drop by 46%. At Virgin Money Giving, sponsorship of charities formed before 2020 was down £25m compared to the previous year. BBC analysis of a sample of more than 1,600 fundraising pages on the site showed the average amount raised on each page dropped from a high of £657 a month in February to a low of £236 in June. Jo Barnett, its executive director, said: ""Lots of organisations have adapted and moved those large-scale events into the virtual space, however it's not filled the donation gap completely. ""As we move into the autumn, traditionally a busy period for fundraising events, charities aren't seeing any sign of donation levels returning to normal. And with more restrictions now in place, it may be some time before traditional fundraising levels return."" In March, 33% of the public polled by YouGov said they had donated to an animal charity within the past four weeks. By May, that had dropped to 21%. Similar declines were seen among homeless shelters, disability charities, organisations working with young people and medical research. The proportion of those that gave to hospitals and hospices, on the other hand, increased from 21% to 29%. ""The nature of the change to the charity sector is genuinely enormous,"" said Mr Heslop. ""Without all of us putting our shoulder to the wheel, there is a risk that, over the next year or two, our sector will be changed permanently and that would be a tragedy."" Yorkshire Cat Rescue takes in about 800 animals a year at its sanctuary in Keighley, North Yorkshire. But with its 10 staff still having to work from home and the centre unable to reopen safely, the 130 cats currently in its care are being looked after by dozens of foster carers spread around the county. It has had to cancel its usual fundraising activities including an abseil and a charity ball. Its four charity shops are shut again following the start of the month-long national lockdown. ""In the early days of lockdown we did quite well, we made some money,"" said Mrs Atkinson.  ""But we were making hundreds rather than thousands.  ""We used to make around £10,000 a month. ""If we have a successful virtual quiz, that's great - but it might be at the expense of a charity ball that raises £8,000. ""It's put us back a decade."" Mrs Atkinson said there were dedicated grants available for animal charities, but she said they were ""massively oversubscribed"". Many foundations were prioritising giving funds to causes that were ""directly Covid related"", she said. ""They maybe don't realise that we are taking cats from people that are ill, people that have lost relatives or that have lost jobs. ""We are running around picking up the pieces of people's lives."" In April, the government released a £750m support package for the not-for-profit sector. But a recent poll by the Small Charities Coalition (SCC) found only 50% of its member organisations had been successful in applying. Many of the grants awarded aim to cover six months of operational costs, according to the SCC's chief executive, Rita Chadha.  As many organisations are staffed entirely by volunteers or trustees, they have not been eligible for the government's job retention scheme either. Mrs Chadha says the true scale of impact to the sector will not be felt until early in 2021 when the funding runs out. ""It's a slow death,"" she said. ""Many of our charities are already having to decrease their operations already. They are telling us they are having to turn people away when demand for them is increasing. ""A domestic abuse charity I spoke to was having two referrals a day. They're now having 20."" The same poll found that, while 70% had experienced a drop in income as a result of the pandemic, 68% had experienced an increase in demand. The Can Mezzanine offices in central London would usually be home to around 120 charities.  But chief executive Clive Dove-Dixon, said around a fifth have had to cancel their lease in order to save funds and scale back their operations. Some are doing so on a temporary basis. But Mr Dove-Dixon said: ""I think there will be a large number of charities that won't have the financial resilience to weather this.""

Spread to US Treasury,Buy Now Pay Later: 'I'm stressed over debt',2024-09-25,2021-09-02,By Tom Espiner,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58423924,"Jordan has been chased by debt collection agencies after falling behind on payments for clothes. The 23-year-old bought a winter coat using Buy Now Pay Later when employed, but then lost his job. According to Citizens Advice, one in 10 shoppers who use this type of credit end up being pursued by debt collectors. The Treasury said it was ""stepping in and regulating"" the market so people ""are treated fairly"". Jordan started using Buy Now Pay Later after seeing it advertised on social media apps and on the iPhone app store. He decided to use it to buy a coat for £200. ""It was quite cold, it was the winter, and at that point I didn't have a lot of clothes,"" he said. ""I was in a job, and I was able to pay it, but I ended up being quite unfortunate and losing that job."" He bought some other items including a hat, but fell behind with the payments to firms including Laybuy and Klarna. ""It was quite difficult for me to keep on top of it. I went through a lot of anxiety and depression,"" he said, and began to be chased by debt collection agencies. ""They don't give any leeway or ease with it at all,"" he says. ""They call up quite a bit [and email]. It does make me stressed when I'm being constantly called and badgered about it."" ""I think [Buy Now Pay Later] is quite dangerous, to be honest,"" Jordan says. ""Especially on the advertising. They make it out to be such a good thing... but that's only condoning debt."" Jordan has recently moved to Bristol to start a new job, and will be in a position to pay off the debt. Laybuy said: ""Laybuy only refers a customer to a debt collector as a last resort, and only after other attempts to collect the outstanding payment have been exhausted. ""When a debt is referred to a debt collector, we only ever refer outstanding purchase price of the product. ""Late fees, which are limited to a maximum of £24 for a single order, are never passed to a debt collector. Laybuy also pays all the cost for debt collection."" Alex Marsh, head of Klarna UK, said: ""At Klarna we only ever use debt collection agencies to help us contact customers we are unable to reach and we do this on fewer than 1% of orders. ""The debt collection agencies we work with are all Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)-authorised and will only contact customers by telephone or email and do not use bailiffs. ""We encourage any of our customers whose circumstances have changed, to please get in touch so we can help you with a plan to get back on track."" Buy Now Pay Later options often appear at checkouts on retailers' websites, and can help spread the cost of purchases, interest-free, potentially avoiding expensive credit. But Citizens Advice said that for many people Buy Now Pay Later can be ""a slippery slope into debt"". It added that it ""fears shoppers have been left unprotected and ill-informed during the rapid expansion of the sector"". ""Not one of the BNPL checkouts on leading retailers' websites warned people they could be referred to debt collectors for missed payments,"" the advice service said. Shoppers were charged £39m in late fees in the past year, it estimated. Of those who were referred to a debt collector for missed payments, 96% said there had been negative consequences. Millions of online shoppers have being clicking the buttons to spread the payments, but as the number of users has grown, so have the criticisms.  Buy Now Pay Later arrangements aren't viewed as a normal loan by credit reference agencies and other lenders.  It becomes a kind of invisible debt to the safety net system, so people with lots of little Buy Now Pay Later debts can get in a mess trying to juggle those payments alongside other loans and interest at the same time. Fears are growing that younger people are being saddled with unnecessary debt, and that those who are already vulnerable are slipping further down the debt spiral.  Although the government said in February that they will regulate the sector, they haven't done so yet.  These included sleepless nights, ignoring texts, emails and letters in case they were about debts, avoiding answering the door, borrowing money to repay the debt, or deteriorating mental health. Citizens Advice said that a woman aged in her 60s was trying to buy plants online, but struggled to find the postage cost at the checkout and decided to abandon her purchase. The keen gardener was surprised to receive an email saying she had signed up to a buy now pay later agreement, and tried to cancel her order. She told Citizens Advice: ""I really don't understand how I ended up paying for my plants through buy now, pay later. ""I didn't understand what it was. Then I get these threatening emails saying they're going to contact debt collectors, and then I got a letter from a debt collector. ""I couldn't sleep, I lay awake worrying that someone was going to turn up to my house and start taking things. I have a number of health issues and I was worried this was going to make me ill again. It was eventually resolved, but at great stress to me."" Millie Harris, a debt adviser at Citizens Advice East Devon, said: ""My concern is that people aren't processing the fact that buy now pay later is credit. They don't realise there are going to be consequences if they don't pay - it gives them a false sense of security. ""I've seen people using it for their kids' clothes and shoes that they would otherwise never be able to afford. They are taking out what is effectively a loan, but they don't see it as one. ""For example, I helped someone who has tens of thousands of pounds of debt, but they don't see buy now pay later as part of that total. ""It's almost under-the-radar debt."" Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, agrees: ""A seamless buy now pay later checkout process should not mean shoppers have to dig around in the small print to find out they're taking out a credit agreement, and could be referred to debt collectors if they can't pay. The warnings should be unmissable."" Citizens Advice is urging anyone who has been contacted by debt collectors to get free, independent debt advice. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""Buy Now Pay Later can be a helpful way to manage your finances but it's important that consumers are protected as these agreements become more popular. ""By stepping in and regulating, we're making sure people are treated fairly and only offered agreements they can afford."" On 2 February, the government announced it would to bring unregulated interest-free Buy Now Pay Later products into regulation. "
Spread to US Treasury,Children 'let down' and holidays 'under threat',2024-09-25,2021-06-02,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-57338815,"Several of the papers lead with the resignation of the government's education recovery commissioner, Sir Kevan Collins.  The Times says he felt he had ""no option"" but to quit after his more expensive plans to help children in England catch up on learning missed due to the pandemic were rejected by the prime minister.  The paper says Sir Kevan's plans had received the backing of Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, only to be overruled.  The Daily Telegraph says the departure will pile pressure on Rishi Sunak, after friends of Sir Kevan accused the chancellor and Treasury officials of being ""completely in denial"" and refusing to agree to a more ambitious package.   Elsewhere, the i says some holidaymakers booking trips abroad could be ""caught out"" after the prime minister said the government would have ""no hesitation"" in changing the status of countries on the coronavirus traffic light system for international travel. Officials in England are due to review the list later.  The Guardian says Whitehall sources expect just a ""handful of new places"" to be allowed quarantine-free travel. The Daily Telegraph says Portugal could be moved from green to amber as experts are concerned about a rise in infections there.  Travel consultants have told the Daily Express that Malta and the Caribbean islands of Grenada and Antigua are among some of the destinations which ""deserve"" to be moved to the low-risk tier.  ""Nepal variant threat to our holidays"" is the headline in the Daily Mail, which says ministers are worried about a new mutation which has apparently spread to Europe.  The paper says scientists fear the strain could be resistant to vaccines. The head of the Airport Operators Association urges officials to focus on data and the success of the UK's vaccination scheme. Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox The Guardian has a special report looking at the impact of the pandemic on Generation Z across Europe. The paper says teenagers and those in their 20s are the least likely to get seriously ill with coronavirus but the crisis could leave millions of young people with ""psychological and socioeconomic scars"".  Hundreds of 16 to 25-year-olds from 30 countries have taken part in the research, with one saying they felt ""pushed aside"" and treated as a ""problem"" that could be dealt with later. The news that Donald Trump's blog has been taken down less than a month after it launched is covered by Politico. It says the site was once hailed by the former US president's fans as ""his return to the internet"", after he was banned by Twitter and other social media platforms earlier this year. But aides have privately admitted the blog was proving to be more of a ""nuisance"" than anything else. The Daily Telegraph says it has seen a leaked government report which reveals that new tanks bought for the Army for almost £3.5bn cannot be driven safely over 20mph. The Ajax armoured fighting vehicles are supposed to travel at speeds of 40mph. Trials of the tanks had to be paused after troops were found to have suffered swollen joints and tinnitus.  A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said the health and safety of personnel was of the ""utmost importance""."
Spread to US Treasury,Business rates suspended for shops and cafes,2024-09-25,2020-03-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51836256,"Tens of thousands of England's retail, leisure and hospitality firms will not pay any business rates in the coming year, the chancellor has announced. Companies with a rateable value of less than £51,000 will be eligible for the tax holiday, Rishi Sunak said. The measure applies to firms including shops, cinemas, restaurants and hotels. It is part of a package of ""extraordinary"" measures to support the UK economy in the face of disruption from the coronavirus outbreak.  ""That is a tax cut worth over £1bn, saving each business up to £25,000,"" Mr Sunak said. Business rates are a tax on properties that are used for commercial purposes, and are charged based on an estimate of what it would cost to rent the property on the open market: the ""rateable value"". Mr Sunak described the business rates holiday as an ""exceptional step"" that would benefit museums, art galleries, theatres, caravan parks, gyms, small hotels, sports clubs and night clubs, all of whom will be hard hit if customers stay away to slow the spread of coronavirus. The chancellor said the business rates system as a whole would be reviewed, with the conclusions published in the autumn. Firms in England have campaigned for several years for the system to be reformed, arguing it makes it hard for bricks and mortar retailers to compete with online rivals.  Business rates in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are set by the devolved administrations.   The head of retail and consumer at Pinsent Masons, Tom Leman, said the announcement would be ""extremely welcome news"" for small businesses. ""On the basis the coronavirus is not a long-term issue for these businesses, it is crucial that they have the liquidity to see them through the worst. ""This will definitely help the cause and hopefully see many of them come out the other side ready to benefit from the increased spending power prompted by the money people are currently saving on their discretionary spend."" However, some small businesses said the move would not help them. Biju Bubble Tea, based in Soho in London, tweeted that it was suffering the impact of fears around the virus, but would not qualify for relief. Larger retail and leisure chains are unlikely to benefit from the rates holiday. State aid rules include a cap on the amount of tax relief a business can claim over three years. Most large firms will have already reached the limit as a result of rates relief provided in previous years. Other Budget measures to support small businesses included: As expected, Mr Sunak scrapped a planned cut to corporation tax. The rate of the tax will remain at 19% rather than falling to 17%. Another change that was widely anticipated was a cut to Entrepreneurs' Tax Relief. Business owners who sell their firms on were entitled to tax relief on profits of up to £10m over their lifetime. The tax relief has been scaled back rather than abolished, with the lifetime limit reduced to £1m. This was two Budgets in one: a core Budget with big borrowing and spending plans for the years ahead and an emergency coronavirus Budget.  Although it's primarily a health emergency, the next few weeks and months could be a life-or-death moment for many small businesses who are dealing with the virus - and more importantly, the response to it. Business rates relief for small firms, an offer to give firms more time to pay tax, and cash grants of £3,000 to virus-affected small firms will be welcomed. But many will feel the criteria are too prescriptive and a more general hardship fund would have been more appropriate for a situation where the impacts are hard to predict.  Yet perhaps more important was the messaging that the government wants to unlock the potential of business. That is a warmer tone to the private sector than the one business has been used to.  The government has acknowledged that business faces financial distress on top of the Brexit preparation that could substantially add to the cost and administrative burden that firms will face at the end of this year. Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses said the chancellor's measures would help reinject optimism into business. ""We're already seeing supply chains disrupted and footfall hurt due to the spread of coronavirus. Against this backdrop, the chancellor's commitments to making more small business finance available, deferring tax bills, reducing business rates and setting up a hardship fund for the vulnerable - including the self-employed who cannot claim SSP - are all absolutely critical,"" he said.  ""The priority at this point needs to be ensuring that these support mechanisms reach the small firms that need them as swiftly as possible."" However, larger businesses would feel left out in the cold, analysts said. ""There is nothing in the Budget that tackles the issues of the larger businesses - and these are the ones shedding the jobs,"" said John Webber of property firm Colliers. ""We are now destined to see more shop closures and job losses in the High Street in the months ahead."" Jerry Schurder, at real estate advisors Gerald Eve, said larger retailers and small firms outside the retail and leisure sectors would still face ""huge challenges"" from the coronavirus outbreak but were ""being left to rot by the Treasury""."
Spread to US Treasury,Arena inquiry: Saffie's mum on hearing the truth,2024-09-25,2022-03-07,By Judith Moritz,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60579079,"Last month, the inquiry into the bombing of an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena heard its final scheduled evidence. The BBC's Judith Moritz has followed the family of Saffie-Rose Roussos - the youngest of the 22 victims - as they have uncovered details of their daughter's death while learning to live with their grief. Saffie Roussos' bedroom looks just how you would expect an eight-year-old's room to look. Her name plate is on the door. Her vibrant My Little Pony dressing gown hangs on a peg. Her tiny pink Converse boots sit on a chair. And at the centre of it, her white bed is festooned with scatter cushions, fairy lights and pom poms.  Her artwork adorns the walls. A painting which reads, ""I love mummy so much"" and a drawing of the whole family, with ""me, Saffie"", written in felt tip. But Saffie has never visited this room. And although the bed is beautifully made up, she'll never sleep in it. Saffie's childhood stopped abruptly when she was murdered in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.  Before she was killed, Saffie lived with her parents Lisa and Andrew, and brother Xander, in their flat above the family fish and chip shop in Leyland, Lancashire. But when the bomb went off, their lives were changed in a fraction of a second. After the explosion they never returned home. They never opened up the chippy again. Lisa went through months of hospital treatment, and when it was over the family went on holiday to Dorset. And they decided to stay there for good. ""We just basically escaped. I suppose a bit like running away,"" says Andrew Roussos.   Saffie's things were packed up, and for a long time her parents found it too painful to go through them. Their move south gave them space, and put distance between them and the intensity of Manchester. There, the civic ""bee"" emblem had taken on a new dimension, spread across the city on posters, walls and tattoos. Lisa found it both supportive and stifling.  She says: ""In the north, where it happened, they still talk about it now. They still think about the families and everybody, and that's beautiful and I wanted that. But at the same time, with us moving here, you can pick and choose when to look at it, when to face it. It's quiet, you've got the sea, the countryside. I think it was the best decision."" Lisa admits she had been torn. She initially did not want to move as she felt she was moving away from Saffie, wanting to be where she had lived.  It was a while before she realised that it would be possible to relocate, and still feel close to her little girl. ""Saffie will always be with us,"" she says simply. Lisa and Andrew started house-hunting. They needed a two-bedroom house, for themselves and Xander, but they decided to search for a three-bed. Saffie would have her own room again as her parents decided it was time to unpack her belongings, and create a new room for her.  Lisa explains they did not want to put her things away into cupboards or the loft, wanting instead to move forward with Saffie.  ""We've changed the knobs on her wardrobe. Even though we wanted to keep her furniture, I've updated it a little bit because I know she would like new things.   The Roussos family is an intensely private unit. They take comfort in each other, and have largely eschewed public attention. But they have always wanted the world to know how special Saffie was to them. That is what led them to invite me to their home as part of the process of making our film about Saffie for Panorama. I first met Andrew just weeks after the bombing, when Lisa was still in hospital and the family was reeling from the attack. He told me then that Saffie had always wanted to be famous for singing and dancing like her idol Ariana Grande.  He could never have imagined that her name would be connected with the singer's for the most tragic reasons. He said he was determined to reclaim the joy that had surrounded his daughter during her short life. That meant telling as wide an audience as possible about the wonder of his little girl and the happiness she brought. We filmed an interview and I told Andrew to keep in touch. I also asked him if Lisa was likely to want to say anything publicly when the time was right. There was significant media interest in their story, and I wondered if she would be as keen to speak about Saffie as her husband. A few weeks later, Andrew suggested that I visit the couple at Wythenshawe hospital in Manchester. Lisa had been so badly hurt in the attack that she was initially only given a 20% chance of survival. By the summer of 2017, they were living as a family in hospital accommodation while her treatment continued. When I met Lisa, it was clear that the time was not right for her to do an interview. She was having to cope with her own rehabilitation while coming to terms with the news that her youngest child had not survived the atrocity. I had been invited to meet her as a journalist, but I am also a mum, and my heart went out to her on a personal level. I had been to the arena with my own children a few weeks before the bombing, I knew that it could have been me in Lisa's shoes. I struggled to find the right words to express my sympathy.  It took another two years before Lisa decided that she wanted to talk publicly about what she was going through, and another two before she reached the point of inviting me to see her daughter's room in Dorset. She said she wanted to show me something special. Watch Panorama Manchester Arena Bombing: Saffie's Story is on BBC One Monday 7 March at 20:00 or watch later on BBC iPlayer There, we sat on Saffie's bed - she felt it was finally time to look through her daughter's baby box of keepsakes, something that she had found too painful after the attack, worried about the emotions it would unleash. In fact, Lisa beams as she shows me the scan pictures, talking about the pregnancy and how Saffie would not stop moving, a real livewire as she had been throughout her life. Each treasure - her first lock of hair, her newborn ID bracelet - unlocks a memory and she basks in them. She picks out a pair of miniature flip flops. ""I bought them in Kefalonia. I remember pushing her in her pram with them on and they kept falling off."" The tears come, but they are mixed with laughter as Lisa remembers the happy moments. She and Andrew have spoken to me several times about the pattern grief has taken for them. They describe it as a constant never-ending presence that has evolved into something they are learning to live with.  At the same time, they have also reached the stage of wanting to find out more about what happened to Saffie. For a long time, they did not want to know a great level of detail. But as the public inquiry into the attack started in September 2020, their legal team prepared them for hard times ahead.  The couple had always believed that their daughter died within seconds of the bomb exploding, and that she had not suffered. But at the inquiry they learned that Saffie had lived for an hour, and that she had died as a result of blood loss from leg injuries. Her legs were never given tourniquets or splinted. Two sets of experts at the public inquiry are in dispute over whether she might have survived if she had received better emergency care. Andrew says: ""It was our biggest fear. Our minds were set to, 'right, a bomb detonated, she lost her life, and it went quickly'. So that's what we chose to carry on life with. Finding out exactly what happened is hard to take… It's torture on top of torture."" The couple have been represented at the public inquiry by Pete Weatherby QC, who explains: ""Saffie was able to talk, able to drink water. In the ambulance something like 40 minutes after detonation she asked the ambulance staff if she was going to die. Therefore, the issue of whether there were further interventions that might have made a difference to Saffie became apparent."" The Roussos family solicitor, Nicola Brook, had to tell the couple Saffie had lived for a while, with an unknown degree of possibility about whether she could have survived. She then had to ask whether they wanted to explore that further. ""That is, without a shadow of a doubt, the hardest conversation I've ever had to have,"" she says. Lisa and Andrew agreed they were ready to look into the intricacies of Saffie's case. But they have had very different approaches to the Manchester Arena Inquiry, which has been running for 18 months.  Andrew has followed nearly every day of the hearings by remote video link. Lisa has found them too distressing to listen to, and relies on Andrew to outline the main issues for her. But when it came to giving evidence, ​both were determined to go into the witness box in person, and so they steeled themselves to make the trip from Dorset back up to Manchester. I joined them again that morning, as they packed their car for the trip, which Lisa confessed she had been dreading.  She said it had been causing her sleepless nights and she would not do it if she didn't have to. ""I know it's going to be emotionally draining. But I just thought, 'Lisa, you've got to do it. You've got to do it for Saffie. She hasn't got that voice, so we have to give it to her.'"" At court, the couple told the inquiry about their experiences on the night of the attack. How Lisa lay on the floor of the arena foyer unable to move. And how Andrew spent all night searching for her and Saffie. He and Xander travelled to three hospitals, and only discovered that Saffie had died the following afternoon. The public inquiry has given him an opportunity to dig deep into what happened. He says, ""What drives me, I suppose, is knowing the information. So I'm there representing us as a family and Saffie as our daughter. Even though the legal team are there to do that, I want to know. I want to scrutinise everybody to the point of getting to the truth."" Grieving for a child can destroy a marriage. But Lisa and Andrew each say they could not have managed without the other. Their characters complement each other. Andrew is passionate and talkative. Lisa is a calming presence. The experience of speaking in court was draining for them both. Afterwards they were clearly exhausted, but relieved. Lisa said she was glad she had taken part as it was her one chance to say what she needed to say. ""The build-up to it was awful but I do feel better now that I've done it,"" she says. But the couple are clear that the inquiry has to make a real difference.  Andrew says he is angry lessons still need to be learned: ""My argument is why didn't you learn from 7/7? Why didn't you learn from 9/11? Why didn't you learn from the Paris attacks in 2016? This wasn't the first terrorist attack."" He adds: ""I just hope the whole process of this inquiry does what it set out to do. What it's meant to do. We're never going to stop this… but at least at the next attack we'll be more prepared."" Their time at court was not the only intense moment of the family's trip to Manchester.  Saffie used to love playing with her mobile phone. She had taken endless selfies with it. Naturally, she took it with her on the night of the Ariana Grande concert. But it shattered in the blast and when it was returned to her parents, it seemed beyond repair.  Lisa and Andrew told me they had tried everything to make it work again. They badly wanted to look at the photos on it, to have a last glimpse of Saffie's world. I asked them if they would trust me to take the phone away for forensic work. In truth, I was not sure if I would be able to get any results, so I was thrilled when I was able to tell them that despite such extensive damage, I was able to have the phone reconstructed - and there were photos to look at. The pictures were Saffie's last selfies. She took them in the car with Lisa on their way to the concert. The little girl is wearing her Ariana Grande T-shirt, and beaming, on what should have been one of the happiest days of her life. Tearfully, Lisa remembered them being taken. She said, ""Me and Saffie were in the back of the car on the way to the arena. It's just so so sad… I wish I'd taken more pictures of me and her. You take them for granted because you don't think of the worst, ever. Why would you? But afterwards you realise how precious and important they are."" Although it is upsetting to see the selfies, Lisa and Andrew say they will always treasure them. They are determined that Saffie will always be a part of their lives. I ask Lisa about the concept of ""closure"" which is sometimes spoken about. She says, ""Who wants closure? It's the opposite. You can't have closure. You don't want closure. You want to take that memory with you forever. We want to take her with us forever. I want to talk about her. I want to remember her. I want everyone to remember her."""
Spread to US Treasury,Fears of second virus outbreak hit global shares,2024-09-25,2020-06-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53015467,"Global stock markets have fallen amid fears that an uptick in coronavirus cases could cause more economic damage. The declines came after the US Federal Reserve warned that the American economy faces a long road to recovery. In the US on Thursday, the three main share indexes saw their worst day in weeks, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down almost 7%. Stock markets in Asia also fell on Friday with benchmark indexes losing ground in Japan, Hong Kong and China.  The falls followed a weeks-long rally that had helped shares recover some ground from the lows seen in March. Energy and travel stocks were among the biggest losers, as global crude oil prices also took a hit. Earlier on Thursday, European shares also dropped, with the UK's FTSE 100, the Dax in Germany and France's CAC 40 all losing 4% or more. ""Government, companies and people would be better prepared for a second wave than for the first one,"" said Roland Kaloyan, European equity strategist at Societe Generale.  ""But the problem is there is a limit to governments injecting money."" Share prices had gained in recent weeks amid hopes that the economy would rebound as authorities loosened restrictions put in place to try to slow the spread of the virus. Last week's surprise report showing US employers had restarted hiring in May helped to push the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to new highs. But the recovery remains tentative. On Thursday, the US Labor Department reported that another 1.5 million people had filed new unemployment claims last week. More than 30 million continue to collect the benefits, it said. US Federal Reserve policymakers said on Wednesday that the unemployment rate could remain above 9% at the end of the year - close to the worst level of the financial crisis,  At a news conference, Fed chairman Jerome Powell warned that this assessment may prove optimistic, if coronavirus infection and hospitalisation rates rise. Several states that have moved to reopen, including Arizona and South Carolina, have seen an uptick in Covid-19 cases in recent days. ""It could hurt the recovery, even if you don't have a national level pandemic. Just a series of local ones, of local spikes, could have the effect of undermining people's confidence in travelling, in restaurants and in entertainment,"" he said. ""It would not be a positive development."" US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he did not want to see a return of the lockdowns that had kept the world's largest economy frozen for weeks. But economists have warned that people will stay at home voluntarily if they are afraid of becoming ill."
Spread to US Treasury,US price rises hit highest level for 40 years,2024-09-25,2021-12-10,By Lucy Hooker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59573145,"American shoppers, especially those on low incomes have felt the pinch of higher prices, with annual inflation at rates not seen for 40 years. The latest figures show prices rose 6.8% in the year to November. Bibi who works as a cleaner in Harlem, New York, said she has had to cut back as a result, sometimes buying just one meal to share with her 27-year-old son. ""We don't have any choice,"" she said, ""I can't afford to cook."" ""I take a little bit then I give him more because a mother is always going to do that for her child."" Price rises have pushed up food shopping bills, and petrol prices jumped 6.1%, while the cost of second-hand cars and rent also rose. While the monthly pace of price rises at 0.8% eased a little compared to October's 0.9%, people like Bibi have felt the cumulative effects on their budgets. Patricia, who has just shopped in the local supermarket, said her bill is about $30 a week more than it used to be, so she's replaced chicken and pork chops with more vegetables, although prices for fresh produce are also higher she said.  ""It affects me a lot right now, I'm not working,"" she said.  Maria has just retired and said she's noticed that what she buys is not only pricier but often smaller too, especially the bagels. ""I'm not going to buy them again for a long time. They used to be big bagels, now they're smaller and more money,"" she said. Prices for American consumers are rising at their fastest annual rate since June 1982. But the impact is felt more amongst those on the lowest incomes, with the least room to manage. Rising inflation is also putting pressure on President Biden as he tries to pass his $1.9tn (£1.4tn) social spending bill. Some economists blame the president's previous spending programmes, designed to offer support amid the Covid pandemic, for exacerbating price increases. ""One of the major reasons we have inflation is because the government spent so much money,"" said Christopher Campbell, chief strategist at Kroll a risk consultancy, and a former Treasury official under President Trump.  He argued that further spending could make inflation worse. ""At the end of the day we hopefully are on the tail end of the pandemic, and the government is still putting its foot on the gas, on the levels of spending."" However Claudia Sahm, senior fellow at the Jain Family Institute and former Federal Reserve economist said government spending is not the cause.  She said the reason inflation has persisted is because the pandemic has not been brought under control, affecting the supply of things like cars, fuel and food.  ""The longer the Covid-related disruptions last, the more that starts to spread into the prices of goods,"" she said. She said with energy prices falling recently, inflation should start to ease. ""There are signs that we may be turning the corner soon, but Omicron is a new wild card."" In the meantime the poorest are facing both the end of pandemic-era extra support and rising prices. ""Food is a much larger proportion of lower income families' budgets,"" points out Christopher Wimer of Columbia's Centre on Poverty and Social Policy. ""Lots of people use gas [fuel] but in terms of heating and utilities as well as transportation, those costs eat up a larger share of low income folks' budget, than higher income folks' budgets, which might be driven more towards leisure, commodities and things like that."" Price rises are affecting some parts of the country more than others too, with the south and mid-west impacted more. Dare to Care, a food bank in Louisville, Kentucky, said it has felt the effect of both inflation and supply chain problems. ""Overall we're spending a substantial amount more,"" said Annette Ball, Dare to Care's chief programmes officer. Usually a lot of Dare to Care's food comes from producers and retailers passing on any surplus they have. ""Right now that's just not happening - people want that overrun. There's demand in the market for that, so it's going out into the retail avenues."" Dare to Care has had to buy food at retail prices instead, and the cost of transport has risen too. ""Freight has doubled, even tripled [in price], in some instances,"" she added.  As a result, Dare to Care has made compromises, like not including wholegrain bread or pure fruit juice as often. President Biden has pledged to make tackling inflation a priority and has made moves to ease supply chain problems, including changing rules for transport operators. But expectations are now focused squarely on the Federal Reserve too. Speculation is mounting that the Fed will reduce the bond-buying support it provides every month more quickly than planned, paving the way for a possible rise in interest rates next year.  ""The Fed is going to have to move,"" said Beth Ann Bovino US Chief Economist, S&P Global ratings ""We expect them to now to speed up tapering and reach zero [monthly support] by March with at least one [interest] rate hike in 2022."""
Spread to US Treasury,Coronavirus: Stocks bounce as volatility continues,2024-09-25,2020-03-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51921420,"Financial markets remain turbulent as a massive slowdown in economic activity due to the coronavirus takes hold across Europe and the US. In the US, shares rebounded about 6% after steep falls on Monday. London's FTSE 100 also jumped 2.7% after being down more than 1% earlier on Tuesday. Other major European markets made similar moves. It comes amid fresh promises of financial aid to helped bolster growth. In the US, President Donald Trump's administration said it was considering sending cheques to Americans as part of a $1tn stimulus package. The US Federal Reserve also said it would use emergency powers to purchase up to $1tn in short-term corporate debt directly from companies, reinstating a funding facility that was created during the 2008 financial crisis.  The Dow ended 5.2% higher, while the S&P 500 gained 6% and the Nasdaq rose 6.23%.  Meanwhile, in the UK, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced £330bn in financial help for UK firms affected by the outbreak. The outgoing head of the Office For Budget Responsibility, Robert Chote, has said a temporary spike in borrowing would be sensible. Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee he said it was better to spend a ""little too much"" than too little, adding: ""When the fire is large enough, you just spray water"" (and worry about the clean up after). On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron said his government would guarantee €300bn of loans, and pledged that no French company would be allowed to collapse. Italy, Germany, Japan and Spain have also all announced hundreds of billions of dollars in government relief. The scale of the US response - from both the central bank and the government - has been the most aggressive, even if many details remain unknown, said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit. ""The good news is they're talking about it now, which is more than I can say about the Japanese or the Europeans,"" he said. ""It's too late to do anything to stop the recession. All you can do is limit the pain, limit the damage,"" he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Asian shares continued to see volatile trading on with markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai swinging between losses and gains.  The turbulence follows one of the worst days in history for US markets. The Dow Jones lost close to 13% and the S&P 500 fell almost 12%, marking the biggest one-day falls for both indexes since ""Black Monday"" in 1987. That followed the US Federal Reserve making another emergency rate cut on Sunday, prompting central banks around the world to ease policy in the biggest co-ordinated response since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago. In the last month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has racked up the five biggest one-day points falls in its 135-year history. In March alone the index has also seen its four biggest one-day points gains on record. Wall Street's so-called ""Fear Gauge"" has just topped the levels seen during the financial crisis more than a decade ago. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's VIX, a measure of stock market volatility, surged by almost 43%, surpassing the level seen in 2008."
Spread to US Treasury,Russians charged in Evil Corp hack investigation,2024-09-25,2019-12-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50677512,"US authorities have filed charges against two Russian nationals alleged to be running a global cyber crime organisation named Evil Corp. An indictment named Maksim Yakubets and Igor Turashev - who remain at large - as figures in a group which used malware to steal millions of dollars in more than 40 countries. Those affected by the hacks include schools and religious organisations. It is also alleged that Mr Yakubets worked for Russian intelligence. Speaking at a news conference, Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski said the attacks were among ""the worst computer hacking and bank fraud schemes of the past decade"". Mr Yakubets is accused of leading Moscow-based Evil Corp, while Mr Turashev allegedly acted as an administrator. The pair are thought to be in Russia. Thursday's indictment came after a multi-year investigation by the FBI, and by Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) and Cyber Security Centre. US authorities allege that the group stole at least $100m (£76m) using Bugat malware - known as Dridex. The malware was spread through so-called ""phishing"" campaigns, which encouraged victims to click on malicious links sent by email from supposedly trusted entities. Once a computer was infected, the group stole personal banking information which was used to transfer funds. A network of money launderers - targeted by the NCA and Britain's Metropolitan Police - were then utilised to funnel the criminal proceeds to members of Evil Corp. Eight members of this network have been sentenced to a total of over 40 years in prison. US authorities said Mr Yakubets was also involved in a similar scheme using another form of malware - known as Zeus - which stole $70m from victims' bank accounts. The NCA alleged that Maksim Yakubets spent more than £250,000 ($328,971) of criminal proceeds on his wedding. He is also said to drive a customised Lamborghini with a personalised number plate which reads ""Thief"" in Russian.  In a separate statement, the US Treasury alleged that, since 2017, Mr Yakubets had worked on projects for the Russian state, including the theft of confidential documents and ""cyber-enabled operations"". The department said it had rolled out sanctions against 17 individuals and seven ""entities,"" including businesses associated with a member of the group. A $5m reward has been offered for information leading to their arrest and prosecution. The US Department of Justice said the amount was the largest offered for a cyber criminal to date. "
Spread to US Treasury,The future of tax: Adding value,2024-09-25,2020-07-26,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-53545987,"Tax: it's the only certainty other than death, according to Benjamin Franklin. But is it inevitable the tax system stays, at least roughly, the way it is? It's always in flux - a machine that nobody would have designed from scratch, and which requires endless tinkering to keep it operational. But it's now more challenged than ever. More tax revenue will be needed to fund the borrowing and enhanced public services we seem to want after the Covid-19 crisis, particularly for health and social care. Reform is long overdue, and this could be an opportune moment for a big reboot. This week, the Treasury began consulting on more digital collection and reviewing English business rates. The Commons finance committee has just launched a wide-ranging review of the tax system. The Institute of Fiscal Studies, and in Scotland, the David Hume Institute, have begun detailed discussions of wealth tax. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC), Westminster's spending watchdog, last week set out big, difficult questions about tax breaks. ""They're not freebies,"" said Meg Hillier, the PAC chair. ""They cost the public purse hundreds of billions of pounds in lost income."" That includes £38 billion of giveaways to pension savers. Does it change behaviour and draw in more savings, or merely add to funds that people would be saving anyway? If the latter, it's badly targeted. A further £15 billion is given away on VAT, charged at 5% on household fuel and zero on food, children's clothes, books and newspapers. At the IFS, they say that would be better targeted at people on low income if VAT were 20% on everything, with compensation through benefits. The complexity of reforming tax is partly because it's intended to achieve different outcomes. Much of it is to raise revenue, to fund public services. The big three elements are income tax, national insurance and Value Added Tax. Income tax is diverging between Scotland and England, and tax on employment is inconsistent across employed, self-employed and (typically high earners with) one-person service companies. But a lot of it, in piecemeal form, is to change behaviour: stop smoking, drink and gamble in moderation, reduce carbon emissions and landfill, shift to an electric car and get married. The risk with that is that it's too successful. Push people away from using diesel and petrol, towards electric battery cars, and the government creates a very large hole in its revenue. It introduced a sugary soft drinks tax, with a lead time for manufacturers to cut sugar content. They did so, it succeeded on health grounds, but brought in less revenue than expected. By tipping income tax away from low earners to high, by raising the starting threshold to £12,500, makes it fairer. But it also makes revenue highly dependent on small numbers of very high earners. They're internationally mobile, they have clever accountants, and the system is vulnerable to sudden moves of their income from one tax jurisdiction to another. That competitive element of tax at the upper end is also a feature of corporation tax. Ireland set the pace with a 12.5% tax rate, which was vital to transforming its economic performance. The UK has since fallen from 30% to 19%, as other countries have also cut to avoid loss of foreign investment. Capturing the internationally mobile tax base is also a big challenge with the digital economy. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google are huge players in the economy but pay very little tax in large countries, because they say their software and algorithms are to be found in low-tax jurisdictions. The UK is one of several European countries that wants to tax that activity. France is to the fore in doing so. But an attempt by the OECD richer country club to co-ordinate digital taxes has been fatally undermined by the Trump administration pulling out of the project. The taxes are seen as anti-American, and US trade tariffs are threatened against countries that introduce a tax unilaterally. As some sources of tax ebb away, such as fuel duty and digital commerce, the search is for a more reliable future tax base. Wealth is one obvious place to look. Much of the nation's wealth is held in pensions, yet - as the PAC noted - we give huge tax breaks to those who build up wealth to fund their retirement.  Property is another widely-spread form of wealth-holding. That's already taxed, with transaction tax, under similar systems in Scotland, Wales, and England with Northern Ireland. Apart from raising revenue, that makes no sense at all. It penalises those who have to move, for instance for a job, it's an extra charge on growing families who need a bigger home, and it's an incentive for older people with big houses not to downsize and make way for larger families. Homes are also subject to council tax. Lower-income households pay a larger share of that income on council tax than higher-income ones.  The Scottish system has tinkered with that, but only at the margins. It continues to share with England the increasingly absurd valuation base of 1991 prices. No government is willing to revalue, because losers complain loudly and winners take their gains for granted. If those who could gain by revaluation realised how much they're missing out, they'd be complaining loudly already. There is a case for abolishing both council tax and transactions tax, and rolling them into a annual property tax based directly on valuation. But that, too, would mean some people getting much bigger bills  For financial wealth, such as share-holdings, that is much more focussed in high net worth households, and the Treasury is looking at changes to Capital Gains Tax. Land could be taxed more efficiently. There are problems there: a lot of Scottish land doesn't generate much income, and the more productive land is heavily subsidised. Government could also put more of a burden on to inheritance tax, but it knows there is a fierce backlash awaiting them among traditional Tory voters and their cheerleading newspapers. One idea for exceptional times is for a one-off wealth tax, to pay the one-off costs of the current crisis and set government debt back to more manageable levels - say, 2% of everything you own, above a certain threshold. Theoretically, it makes some sense. Practically, it would be a nightmare - identifying wealth, ensuring it's not hidden, turning physical assets into cash for payment. Politically, that looks tougher still. Could Holyrood make much of this tax reform? It hasn't done the borrowing to tackle the health and economic crisis, but it will surely suffer the effect of cost cutting when the bills come in, so flexibility on tax raising would be handy. MSPs are limited on many fronts, particularly where reserved powers over benefits, national insurance and unearned income tax (on dividends) don't mesh with its newish income tax powers. But rather than focus on what it can't do, there are things it could tackle. Business rates are now a target for Whitehall reform. There's a risk that Scotland gets left behind with an out-dated system, punishing already traumatised retailers, and could be forced to adjust and match English reforms. Council tax and business rates could have been reformed since the Parliament first sat in 1999. But SNP, Labour and Liberal Democrats all failed to live up to their rhetoric on council tax, and on it goes. Holyrood can diverge on air passenger duty, but it's choosing not to do so. It has given powers to councils to introduce tourist taxes and workplace parking charges, but ministers don't sound keen on seeing those powers used. Next to require decisions could be tax on sugary, salty and fatty foods. The prime minister is a new convert to government ""nanny""-ism and in recent days, he seems to be setting the pace."
Spread to US Treasury,UK faces 1980s-levels of jobless - ex-chancellors,2024-09-25,2020-06-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52909859,"As the UK begins to ease lockdown restrictions, three former UK chancellors have been quizzed by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee about the effects of coronavirus on the UK economy. Alistair Darling, George Osborne and Philip Hammond were asked about the severity of the crisis versus the 2008-2009 financial crash; what measures could revive the economy; and whether taxes should increase to help pay the UK's mounting debts.  They also suggested that unemployment could reach levels not seen since the 1980s. Alistair Darling: ""They are very different and this one [coronavirus], in my view, is much more serious. ""The key difference between then and now is that from day one, the government wanted to get the economy going again, and therefore we introduced a range of measures, which enabled us to do that. ""The situation today is different, in that firstly, it is part of government policy right across the world, and rightly so, to actually suppress economic activity through the lockdown and other measures... Unless and until the government gets control of the virus itself and the spread of the virus, it's difficult to see how you can pull out the stops and get the economy going again."" George Osborne: ""I am more optimistic, I think, than Alistair. If you look at the history of pandemics and plagues and the like in our society, then the economic bounceback is going to be relatively rapid. ""If you look at the history of banking crises throughout our history, not just the one 10 years ago, but in the 1920s and 30s and in the 19th Century and before, recoveries are very slow and protracted and painful, because the credit channels of the economy are impaired, and despite all the work that Alistair did, and I did, to try and unclog those channels, it takes a long time for the allocation of capital to get to the efficiency it has before the banking crash."" Philip Hammond: ""In terms of which is the worst, I think it is too early to say yet, because a lot is going to depend on whether over the next months it becomes clear that we are heading towards either a vaccine... and that the future trajectory is one of returning the economy to something like normal, or whether, by contrast, we are not heading towards an early development of a vaccine or a treatment, and we have to plan in terms of restarting the economy living with Covid."" Lord Darling: ""The government will need to introduce measures, firstly to deal with a wave of unemployment which I think will come once the furlough system starts being phased out, and also to make sure that people who are displaced from the workplace, who lose their jobs, that we can get them back into work as quickly as possible. ""It will be necessary for the government to make sure that you don't end up with a recession becoming a depression."" Mr Osborne: ""The central challenge... is how do you withdraw some of the very necessary schemes to have kept people in work and businesses afloat during the crisis. The furlough scheme has been absolutely essential... many people on furlough are going to go back to their jobs.  ""But we have to be honest and say that quite a lot of those businesses will not come back... and trapping people on a scheme that is generous to them in the short term, but actually prevents them from re-entering the labour force to get the new job they need, is potentially very damaging.  ""So I think the withdrawal of the furlough is going to be important for employment in the short term, and at the same time some of these loans to businesses that are never coming back are going to become an issue."" Mr Osborne: ""There's a whole separate issue about what you do with these large stakes we're going to take in large companies like airlines, potentially, and aerospace manufacturers.  ""All of us have experience on this panel of pretending that you're managing these bank holdings that we had in the last decade at arm's length, and still when Treasury questions came up we were being asked about the bonuses being paid to chief executives, why branches were being closed in the constituencies of members. ""I can imagine an airline saying it wants to shut an uneconomic route to one of the further-flung parts of the UK... I think that's going to be more problematic than I think people have realised at the moment."" Lord Darling: ""We need to get ourselves into the frame of mind where we're thinking about 1980's levels of unemployment. ""If it doesn't happen, that's great, but I think we need to be ready for that, and if we're not ready for that, people will ask: 'Why didn't you start thinking abut these things?'"" ""If you take the aviation industry, you'll notice that France and Germany are not indifferent to whether or not their national airline is surviving. Our model here is slightly different, in that the idea of a flag-carrier isn't quite what it was, but I think most people would take the view that we've got to ensure that we've got a transport industry."" Lord Darling: ""If you want stimulate the economy, the most obvious thing to do is a time limited VAT reduction. ""When we get to the happy day when we're recovering... yes, we are going have very high debts, like we had at the end of the Second World War, but one of the things that a government like ours can do... you can actually carry that for some period. I would be very concerned if in the recovery phase you start clamping down on things prematurely, and you drive the country back into a recession."" Mr Hammond: ""I don't think there's any economic logic to increasing taxes in the short term. I think we all accept that the UK as a credit-worthy, mature, larger economy can carry more debt in the context of the short term crisis.  ""Of course, we have to remember that debt is cumulative by its nature. We increased debt very substantially during the course of dealing with the last crisis, and we'd only just got back to the point where we were starting to see debt very slightly decline as a share of GDP. Now we're going to see it increase significantly again as a share of GDP, so eventually we have to think about how we manage the challenge of debt in the long term."""
Spread to US Treasury,Food and farming 'need total rethink',2024-09-25,2017-10-05,By Claire Marshall,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-41504155,"Can farming and food production be made less damaging to the planet?  A big meeting in London will look at how reforms could help halt species extinction, meet climate goals, limit the spread of antibiotic resistance and improve animal welfare.  The organisers of the Extinction and Livestock Conference say diverse interests will be represented.  They include multinational food corporations, native breed farmers, neurologists and naturalists. McDonalds, Tesco and Compass will be rubbing shoulders with those from the Sustainable Food Trust, Quorn and WWF. The 500 delegates come from more than 30 countries. Their wide interests illustrate the complex and difficult issues arising from global livestock production. The two-day conference is being organised by Compassion in World Farming (CiWF).  The campaigning organisation warns that ""there will be catastrophic impacts for life on Earth unless there is a global move away from intensive farming"". The world is on track to lose two-thirds of its wildlife by the end of this decade, largely because habitats have been destroyed to produce food for humans.  There has been a rise in so-called ""superbugs"" linked to the use of antibiotics in farmed animals. And methane emissions from livestock have made a significant contribution to climate change. CiWF CEO Philip Lymbery said: ""Livestock production, the environment, wildlife conservation and human health are all interlinked, so it's vital that experts from each of these fields work together to come up with practical solutions to stop this before it's too late."" CiWF believes that there should be a total rethink of food and farming policies, enshrined in the framework of a UN Convention.  The aim would be to properly integrate objectives such as food security, climate change, animal welfare and human health - so one isn't pursued at the expense of the other.  Mr Lymbery added: ""Many people are aware that wild animals such as penguins, elephants and jaguars are threatened by extinction. However, few know that livestock production, fuelled by consumer demand for cheap meat, is one of the biggest drivers of species extinction and biodiversity loss on the planet.""  Award-winning writer and activist Raj Patel from the University of Texas is speaking at the conference.  He said: ""The footprint of global agriculture is vast. Industrial agriculture is absolutely responsible for driving deforestation, absolutely responsible for pushing industrial monoculture, and that means it is responsible for species loss. ""We're losing species we have never heard of, those we've yet to put a name to and industrial agriculture is very much at the spear-tip of that. Conferences are for forging the alliances and building the movement that will change the world."" Also attending is Martin Palmer, secretary-general of the Alliance of Religions and Conservation.  He said: ""Our current food system is not about a healthy, sustainable world of food but about excess, greed and foolishness disguised as 'market forces'.  ""It treats the natural world not as something we are part of and therefore should treasure, but as a larder we can raid and somehow hope it gets filled again. ""But the truth is, it won't! As a result of this conference I would hope that all the key players - including the great faiths - would find a place at the table and together, each in their own distinctive way, will be able to inspire and guide us towards a better, fairer world."""
Spread to US Treasury,Protesters mount their last stand,2024-09-25,2010-12-09,Heather Sharp,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-11959950,"This video can not be played BBC's Philip Herd: ""The horses' hooves were causing sparks as they charged"" The metal barriers came down, the sound systems pumped, and the student protesters spilled across the grass in Parliament Square.  Waves of cheering, cat-calling and chanting echoed above the drone of three circling helicopters. A tea tent, with supplies pulled out of a supermarket trolley, was set up as the protesters settled in.  Three truanting school students sat playing cards in the mud - as the politicians in the Chamber debated their future. The youths said they were cold, but glad to be there.  A group of young men, some with scarves over their mouths and one sipping from a bottle of beer, clambered on top of a metal hut next to some road works and started burning placards.  Four 13-year-old girls, from Camden School for Girls, where pupils staged a sit-in yesterday, rattled the metal barriers around the work site hopefully.  They said they wanted them pulled down. One of the girls was about four feet high. They hadn't come with any adults.  ""We want the MPs to hear our voices,"" said one of the protest organisers, as the hordes of protesters converged on Parliament Square, after a breathless scramble of a march through the pre-Christmas streets of the capital.  Once again, university and further education students, trade unionists and school pupils formed a mass below a sea of placards. Their anger is aimed not only at the raising of tuition fees to up to £9,000, but also major cuts to university teaching budgets and the removal of education allowances for low-income 16-19 year olds. There were youths clutching hard hats and cards with advice on what to do if they got arrested.  There were heavily made-up girls in hot pants, mini-skirts and leopard print coats, as well as protesters dressed as a Storm Trooper, Superman, and Father Christmas.  Business Secretary Vince Cable was lambasted by the protesters as a ""gibbering wreck"" and the Lib Dems as the ""Tories' poodles"". ""We will fight on! We will overcome!"" The speeches went on as the protesters gathered, the organisers keen to wait until the march reached its maximum size. ""We haven't got a Clegg to stand on"", read one banner. ""My toilet's Clegged"", said another, as the Liberal Democrat leader tries to face down his beck-bench rebellion.  But not everyone was convinced. ""That's just ridiculous,"" commented English student Steph Dickinson, 21, from Liverpool, as one speaker called on activists to ""bring down the neo-liberal state"".  And then the marchers were off.  As the march started out past shoppers and tourists in Bloomsbury, police spread across the road and set a sedate pace at the front of the column of protesters. This followed the fast-paced chase for several miles around London last week. But groups of protesters soon surged ahead and a few scuffles broke out as police tried to form new lines.  Protesters and police have been injured One officer was led away limping. Protester Gordon Maloney, 20, who had travelled 12 hours by coach from Aberdeen to attend the demonstration, said a policeman had punched him in the chest, and he'd seen another protester being hit with a stick.  A breakaway march poured through Covent Garden, trotting to shouts of ""Whose streets? Our streets"", while the main protest stayed on the agreed route along The Strand.  Harrassed-looking protest marshals in fluorescent yellow bibs shouted at protesters to slow down. One told me the aim was to hold the crowd together, at least until the march reached Parliament Square.  ""Then whatever happens after that happens,"" he said.  And despite a few scuffles, headlong dashes and shouts of ""no-one's kettling me"", the crowd arrived at Parliament Square and the wait began.  And as the sun dropped, some angry clashes broke out in the shadow of Westminster Abbey.  Protesters say the police tried to move their line forward. Mounted police charged the crowd. Protesters hurled sticks from wooden placards and a chair. A couple of fireworks cracked, while the crowd pushed forwards shouting ""no ifs, not buts, no education cuts"".  A young protester struggled back through the crowd with blood running down his face. Another, Hero Austin, 20, who works for the LSE students' union, said she'd been crushed by a barrier, and police had carried on pushing as she had tried to help another protester who had been knocked to the ground.  Bonfires of placards and a park bench blazed, and then burned out.  The police stopped allowing protesters to leave. A woman pleaded to be let out to collect her child from nursery.  As the temperature dropped and the vote neared, a hut was set on fire. Thick clouds of black smoke billowed across the square, as the protesters sang ""build a bonfire, build a bonfire, put the Tories on the top..."".  The storm-trooper clambered on to the top of a hut and performed a striptease - down to the waist - in front of Big Ben. Protesters anxiously fiddled with mobile phones, waiting for word from inside the chamber.  Then it came. ""The vote's passed,"" a woman bellowed through a loud hailer, sparking chants of ""Tory scum, Tory scum"".  Some protesters used placards as weapons But they were short-lived. Face to face with thick metal barriers and lines of black-clad riot police, the protesters in front of parliament seemed to be waiting for something to happen. ""If someone could find the anarchists..."", said one, glancing around.  ""I'm gutted,"" said Jonathan Cotton, 20, an economics student who had travelled from Manchester. ""We knew it was coming but it's still a kick in the teeth.""  ""I feel angry,"" said John Dodds, 27, from London South Bank University. ""They've voted away our futures, and the futures of our brothers and sisters.""  But both said the closeness of the vote was testament to the power of the wave of student protest in recent weeks.  And it wasn't long before anger turned to violence in another corner of the square.  Groups of youths raised large metal barriers aloft and rushed towards the police at the entrance to Whitehall. Police charged back, with riot shields and batons.  Protesters burned placards and park benches ""We're just chucking them at the police,"" said one. ""We're trying to put them as a shield between the police and the protesters,"" said another. ""But it's not really working, they're just coming right back at us. There's people bleeding an' everything.""  And there were.  A few minutes earlier, a group had rushed back into the square carrying a young man with blood pouring from a head wound.  Someone grabbed a metal bar, and systematically smashed each pane of a window on the Treasury, to cheers from the crowd.  Elsewhere, shivering students munched bags of crisps and tubs of hummus, hovering by the police cordons in quieter corners, hoping to be allowed to leave.  Everyone vowed the protests would go on. And as the youths grabbed yet more metal barriers, it was clear the battle on the streets was far from over. Royal car attacked in fees demo"
Spread to US Treasury,Greeks fear megafires could be new normal for Med,2024-09-25,2021-11-04,By Bethany Bell,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59075043,"World leaders at the COP26 summit in Glasgow are under pressure to respond to global warming, and intense heatwaves and frequent forest fires are becoming an increasing threat around the Mediterranean. This summer alone Greece was hit by thousands of wildfires, fanned by its worst heatwave in decades. Turkey, Italy and Spain all witnessed dramatic fires in recent months and the fire on the Greek island of Evia was the biggest in Greece since records began.  What happened on Evia was a megafire, an intense conflagration, which took almost two weeks to bring under control.  With more heatwaves forecast for future summers, there are fears that megafires could become the new normal.  ""We never expected this,"" says Nikos Dimitrakis, a farmer who was born and raised in northern Evia. ""We thought a part might burn, as in previous fires. But now the entire area was burned."" When the fire reached his land, he told me there was no-one there to help. Surrounded by flames, he grabbed tree branches in a desperate attempt to put out the blaze. ""The fire was coming uphill, there was so much noise and I was just sitting and watching. At some point I burst into tears and left. There is nothing you can do unless you have a fire truck nearby, something. Alone, what can you do?"" Like many people in Evia, Nikos relied on the forest for his livelihood.  ""We lost our treasure, our forest, we lived from it. We lost our pine trees from which we'd take resin, we lost the chestnut trees, we lost some walnut trees. The point now is how the state will support us.""  Nikos says the authorities mishandled the fire. ""I feel angry, because I didn't expect this catastrophe to happen. For sure, climate change is a factor but the fire shouldn't have been allowed to grow so big. They are responsible. They burned us and they know it."" Many locals say the authorities didn't do enough to stop the spread of the blazes, but firefighters say this year's megafires were unprecedented.  Lt Col Stratos Anastasopoulos, who is responsible for co-ordinating fire-fighting aircraft across Greece, took me up in a helicopter to see the extent of the damage.  In his 23-year career he can't remember anything like it.  ""It was a war... because we had a lot of fires all over in Greece - almost 100 fires per day for five or six days at a time. So it was very, very difficult for us.""   Weather conditions were very different this year, he says, blaming an extended heatwave and very little rain. ""I think all of us we can see the climate changes. There is not only a Greek problem or American problem or Italian problem. It's a global problem.""  Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has blamed climate change for the extent of the damage.  ""The climate crisis is here,"" he said. ""We have done what was humanly possible but that was not enough."" While he admitted mistakes had been made in the response, the ""intensity of the phenomenon overcame many of our defences"".  More than 50,000 hectares (193 sq miles) of forest were burnt in northern Evia alone. It took almost two weeks to bring the fire under control.  The damage will be felt for years to come.  Foresters say the pinewoods will eventually regenerate if they can be protected from future fires - but the trees will take up to 30 years to grow back.  There is a real danger of erosion and flooding when the rains come this winter. The forestry department has hired local teams to use logs to form makeshift terraces to stop landslides.  Over the next months they will have to cut down dead wood all over northern Evia to make space for new trees to grow.  Elias Tziritis, a wildfires expert with the World Wildlife Fund, says pine forests can cope and even thrive with fires every 30 to 40 years. But he fears that they won't be able to regenerate if fires happen too frequently.   ""I'm very confident about nature, nature is going to do the work,"" he told me. ""The Mediterranean forest is used to forest fires. It's part of their rehabilitation mechanism. But while I trust nature, what I don't trust is humans."" Elias, who is also a volunteer firefighter, fears the authorities are in danger of lurching from one crisis to another.  Without greater focus on prevention, he is concerned that megafires will happen again and again. He wants better forest management, clearing away flammable forest fuel, such as broken branches and dead leaves, especially in areas where housing is very close to the woods.   ""The politicians here in Greece say the problem of forest fires is climate change. But, you know, climate change is just one of the criteria for more intense forest fires."" That is why he believes people should be prepared to adjust to a new reality of more heatwaves, and more days of fire danger. ""Ask our colleagues in Spain, Portugal, Italy, or Turkey: they'll tell you the new trend in forest fires is megafires - megafires that are affected by climate change."" And his answer to climate change is to believe in prevention. You can watch Bethany Bell's Our World programme on forest fires on 6 November on BBC World TV and the News Channel and on the BBC iPlayer. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."
Spread to US Treasury,Siblings pose in 'trendy rainbow' picture challenge,2024-09-25,2020-04-22,By Sarah Lee,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-52369489,"A brother and sister who took part in a social media challenge encouraging people to display rainbows through their daily outfits have said they are ""overwhelmed"" by the response to their photographs.  Helen Yang, 29, and Thomas Etheridge, 26, from Croydon, were inspired by the Instagram rainbow challenge, which sees people dress in a certain colour each day and take a picture.  The trend began when pictures of rainbows drawn by schoolchildren appeared in windows across the UK during the coronavirus lockdown. It has since evolved to see London fashion editors and influencers Natalie Wall and Zeena Shah task Instagrammers with experimenting with multi-coloured attire. But to keep entertained during lockdown, Helen and Thomas wanted to do something a bit different.  ""Thomas and I were excited by the idea of searching for the right coloured outfit for each day's photo. We didn't stop there though,"" Helen said. Thomas, who has a background in costume design and fine art, was inspired to use the challenge as a way to play around with characters and props, Helen said. ""[The challenge] became a sort of family project as we all looked around the house and in the garage each day for the appropriate items,"" she added. ""It was like a treasure hunt."" Helen said her family began seeing things in the house and garage that they had not noticed before. ""It was great fun,"" she said. The pair said they were ""pleased and overwhelmed"" at the response they have received to their posts on Instagram. Helen said: ""Quite a few people told us how they looked forward to seeing our new photo each day and that the photos cheered them up a bit.  ""This helped us to feel connected with the outside world at a time when we're all so far apart."" Photos by Helen and Thomas Etheridge. "
Spread to US Treasury,The rise and fall of 'Islamic State',2024-09-25,2016-03-09,Jim Muir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35695648,"Abu Anis only realised something unusual was happening when he heard the sound of explosions coming from the old city on the western bank of the Tigris as it runs through Mosul.  ""I phoned some friends over there, and they said armed groups had taken over, some of them foreign, some Iraqis,"" the computer technician said. ""The gunmen told them, 'We've come to get rid of the Iraqi army, and to help you.'"" The following day, the attackers crossed the river and took the other half of the city. The Iraqi army and police, who vastly outnumbered their assailants, broke and fled, officers first, many of the soldiers stripping off their uniforms as they joined a flood of  panicked civilians.  This video can not be played Video footage from Mosul after its capture by Isis shows militants driving through the streets It was 10 June 2014, and Iraq's second biggest city, with a population of around two million, had just fallen to the militants of the group then calling itself Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant (Isis or Isil).  Four days earlier, black banners streaming, a few hundred of the Sunni militants had crossed the desert border in a cavalcade from their bases in eastern Syria and met little resistance as they moved towards their biggest prize. Rich dividends were immediate. The Iraqi army, rebuilt, trained and equipped by the Americans since the US-led invasion of 2003, abandoned large quantities of armoured vehicles and advanced weaponry, eagerly seized by the militants. They also reportedly grabbed something like $500m from the Central Bank's Mosul branch. ""At the beginning, they behaved well,"" said Abu Anis. ""They took down all the barricades the army had put up between quarters. People liked that. On their checkpoints they were friendly and helpful - 'Anything you need, we're here for you.'"" The Mosul honeymoon was to last a few weeks. But just down the road, terrible things were already happening.  As the Iraqi army collapsed throughout the north, the militants moved swiftly down the Tigris river valley. Towns and villages fell like skittles. Within a day they had captured the town of Baiji and its huge oil refinery, and moved on swiftly to seize Saddam Hussein's old hometown, Tikrit, a Sunni hotbed. Just outside Tikrit is a big military base, taken over by the Americans in 2003 and renamed Camp Speicher after the first US casualty in the 1991 ""Desert Storm"" Gulf war against Iraq, a pilot called Scott Speicher, shot down over al-Anbar province in the west.  Bodies being exhumed at Camp Speicher, 2015 Camp Speicher, by now full of Iraqi military recruits, was surrounded by the Isis militants and surrendered. The thousands of captives were sorted, the Shia were weeded out, bound, and trucked away to be systematically shot dead in prepared trenches. Around 1,700 are believed to have been massacred in cold blood. The mass graves are still being exhumed.  Far from trying to cover up the atrocity, Isis revelled in it, posting on the internet videos and pictures showing the Shia prisoners being taken away and shot by the black-clad militants.  In terms of exultant cruelty and brutality, worse was not long in coming.  After a pause of just two months, Isis - now rebranded as ""Islamic State"" (IS) - erupted again, taking over large areas of northern Iraq controlled by the Kurds.  That included the town of Sinjar, mainly populated by the Yazidis, an ancient religious minority regarded by IS as heretics. Yazidi women in Germany protest against IS attacks on their community in northern Iraq, 2014 Hundreds of Yazidi men who failed to escape were simply killed. Women and children were separated and taken away as war booty, to be sold and bartered as chattels, and used as sex slaves. Thousands are still missing, enduring that fate.  Deliberately shocking, bloodthirsty exhibitionism reached a climax towards the end of the same month, August 2014. IS issued a video showing its notorious, London-accented and now late executioner Mohammed Emwazi (sardonically nicknamed ""Jihadi John"" by former captives) gruesomely beheading American journalist James Foley.  In the following weeks, more American and British journalists and aid workers - Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, and Peter Kassig (who had converted to Islam and changed his name to Abdul Rahman) - appeared being slaughtered in similar, slickly produced videos, replete with propaganda statements and dire warnings.  Murdered Western hostages: (From top left clockwise) Steven Sotloff, David Haines, James Foley, Alan Henning, Abdul Rahman (Peter) Kassig In the space of a few months, IS had blasted its way from obscurity on to the centre of the world stage. Almost overnight, it became a household word. Seven-and-a-half thousand miles (12,000km) away, then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott summed up the breathtaking novelty of the horror. It was, he said ""medieval barbarism, perpetrated and spread with the most modern of technology"". IS had arrived, and the world was taking notice. But the men in black did not appear out of the blue. They had been a long time coming.  The theology of murder The ideological or religious roots of IS and like-minded groups go deep into history, almost to the beginning of Islam itself in the 7th Century AD. Like Christianity six centuries before it, and Judaism some eight centuries before that, Islam was born into the harsh, tribal world of the Middle East. ""The original texts, the Old Testament and the Koran, reflected primitive tribal Jewish and Arab societies, and the codes they set forth were severe,"" writes the historian and author William Polk. ""They aimed, in the Old Testament, at preserving and enhancing tribal cohesion and power and, in the Koran, at destroying the vestiges of pagan belief and practice. Neither early Judaism nor Islam allowed deviation. Both were authoritarian theocracies."" As history moved on, Islam spread over a vast region, encountering and adjusting to numerous other societies, faiths and cultures. Inevitably in practice it mutated in different ways, often becoming more pragmatic and indulgent, often given second place to the demands of power and politics and temporal rulers. For hardline Muslim traditionalists this amounted to deviationism, and from early on, there was a clash of ideas in which those arguing for a strict return to the ""purity"" of the early days of Islam often paid a price.  The eminent scholar Ahmad ibn Hanbal (780-855), who founded one of the main schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence, was jailed and once flogged unconscious in a dispute with the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad.  Nearly five centuries later, another supreme theologian of the same strict orthodox school, Ibn Taymiyya, died in prison in Damascus. These two men are seen as the spiritual forefathers of later thinkers and movements which became known as ""salafist"", advocating a return to the ways of the first Muslim ancestors, the salaf al-salih (righteous ancestors). They inspired a later figure whose thinking and writings were to have a huge and continuing impact on the region and on the salafist movement, one form of which, Wahhabism, took his name.  Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was born in 1703 in a small village in the Nejd region in the middle of the Arabian peninsula.  A devout Islamic scholar, he espoused and developed the most  puritanical and strict version of what he saw as the original faith, and sought to spread it by entering pacts with the holders of political and military power. In an early foray in that direction, his first action was to destroy the tomb of Zayd ibn al-Khattab, one of the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad, on the grounds that by the austere doctrine of salafist theology, the veneration of tombs constitutes shirk, the revering of something or someone other than Allah.  But it was in 1744 that Abd al-Wahhab made his crucial alliance with the local ruler, Muhammad ibn Saud. It was a pact whereby Wahhabism provided the spiritual or ideological dimension for Saudi political and military expansion, to the benefit of both. Passing through several mutations, that dual alliance took over most of the peninsula and has endured to this day, with the House of Saud ruling in sometimes uneasy concert with an ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment.  The entrenchment of Wahhabi salafism in Saudi Arabia - and the billions of petrodollars to which it gained access - provided one of the wellsprings for jihadist militancy in the region in modern times.   Jihad  means struggle on the path of Allah, which can mean many kinds of personal struggle, but more often is taken to mean waging holy war. But the man most widely credited, or blamed, for bringing salafism into the 20th Century was the Egyptian thinker Sayyid Qutb. He provided a direct bridge from the thought and heritage of Abd al-Wahhab and his predecessors to a new generation of jihadist militants, leading up to al-Qaeda and all that was to follow.  Sayyid Qutb, ""the source of all jihadist thought"" Born in a small village in Upper Egypt in 1906, Sayyid Qutb found himself at odds with the way Islam was being taught and managed around him. Far from converting him to the ways of the West, a two-year study period in the US in the late 1940s left him disgusted at what he judged unbridled godless materialism and debauchery, and his fundamentalist Islamic outlook was honed harder.  Back in Egypt, he developed the view that the West was imposing its control directly or indirectly over the region in the wake of the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War One, with the collaboration of local rulers who might claim to be Muslims, but who had in fact deviated so far from the right path that they should no longer be considered such.  For Qutb, offensive jihad against both the West and its local agents was the only way for the Muslim world to redeem itself. In essence, this was a kind of takfir - branding another Muslim an apostate or kafir (infidel), making it justified and even obligatory and meritorious to kill him.  Although he was a theorist and intellectual rather than an active jihadist, Qutb was judged dangerously subversive by the Egyptian authorities. He was hanged in 1966 on charges of involvement in a Muslim Brotherhood plot to assassinate the nationalist President, Gamal Abdel Nasser.  Qutb was before his time, but his ideas lived on in the 24 books he wrote, which have been read by tens of millions,  and in the personal contact he had with the circles of people like Ayman al-Zawahiri, another Egyptian who is the current al-Qaeda leader.  Another intimate of the al-Qaeda founder Osama Bin Laden said: ""Qutb was the one who most affected our generation."" He has also been described as ""the source of all jihadist thought"", and ""the philosopher of the Islamic revolution"". 9/11: The attackers were influenced by Qutb's writings More than 35 years after he was hanged, the official commission of inquiry into al-Qaeda's 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers in 2001 concluded: ""Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalise even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defence of an embattled faith."" And his influence lingers on today. Summing up the roots of IS and its predecessors, the Iraqi expert on Islamist movements Hisham al-Hashemi said: ""They are founded on two things: a takfiri faith based on the writings of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, and as methodology, the way of Sayyid Qutb."" The theology of militant jihadism was in place. But to flourish, it needed two things - a battlefield, and strategists to shape the battle. Afghanistan was to provide the opportunity for both.  Rise of al-Qaeda The Soviet invasion in 1979, and the 10 years of occupation that followed, provided a magnet for would-be jihadists from around the Arab world. Some 35,000 of them flocked to Afghanistan during that period, to join the jihad and help the mainly Islamist Afghan mujahideen guerrillas turn the country into Russia's Vietnam. Soviet forces in Afghanistan, 1980 There is little evidence that the ""Afghan Arabs"", as they became known, played a pivotal combat role in driving the Soviets out. But they made a major contribution in setting up support networks in Pakistan, channelling funds from Saudi Arabia and other donors, and funding schools and militant training camps. It was a fantastic opportunity for networking and forging enduring relationships as well as tasting jihad first hand. Ironically, they found themselves on the same team as the Americans. The CIA's Operation Cyclone channelled hundreds of millions of dollars through Pakistan to militant Afghan mujahedeen leaders such as Golbuddin Hekmatyar, who associated closely with the Arab jihadists. It was in Afghanistan that virtually all the major figures in the new jihadist world cut their teeth. They helped shape events there in the aftermath of the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, a period that saw the emergence of al-Qaeda as a vehicle for a wider global jihad, and Afghanistan provided a base for it.  By the time the Taliban took over in 1996, they were virtually in partnership with Osama Bin Laden and his men, and it was from there that al-Qaeda launched its fateful 9/11 attack in 2001. The formative Afghan experience provided both the combat-hardened salafist jihadist leaders and the strategists who were to play an instrumental role in the emergence of the IS of today.  Most significant was the Jordanian jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who more than anybody else ended up being the direct parent of IS in almost every way.  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi A high-school dropout whose prison career began with a sentence for drug and sexual offences, Zarqawi found religion after being sent to classes at a mosque in the Jordanian capital, Amman. He arrived in Pakistan to join jihad in Afghanistan just in time to see the Soviets withdraw in 1989, but stayed on to work with jihadists.  After a stint back in Jordan where he received a 15-year jail sentence on terrorist charges but was later released in a general amnesty, Zarqawi finally met Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in 1999. By all accounts the two al-Qaeda leaders did not take to him. They found him brash and headstrong, and they did not like the many tattoos from his previous life that he had not been able to erase.  But he was charismatic and dynamic, and although he did not join al-Qaeda, they eventually put him in charge of a training camp in Herat, western Afghanistan. It was here that he worked with an ideologue whose radical writings became the scriptures governing subsequent salafist blood-letting: Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir. ""The brutality of beheading is intended, even delightful to God and His Prophet,"" wrote Muhajir in his book The Theology of Jihad, more generally referred to as the Theology of Bloodshed. His writings provided religious cover for the most brutal excesses, and also for the killing of Shia as infidels, and their Sunni collaborators as apostates. The other book that has been seen as the virtual manual - even the Mein Kampf - for IS and its forebears is The Management of Savagery, by Abu Bakr Naji, which appeared on the internet in 2004.  The Management of Savagery, a virtual manual for jihadists ""We need to massacre and to do just as has been done to Banu Qurayza, so we must adopt a ruthless policy in which hostages are brutally and graphically murdered unless our demands are met,"" Naji wrote. He was  referring to a Jewish tribe in seventh-century Arabia which reportedly met the same fate at the hands of early Muslims as the Yazidis of Sinjar did nearly 14 centuries later: the men were slaughtered, the women and children enslaved.  Naji's sanctioning of exemplary brutality was part of a much wider strategy to prepare the way for an Islamic caliphate. Based partly on the lessons of Afghanistan, his book is a detailed blueprint for provoking the West into interventions which would further rally the Muslims to jihad, leading to the ultimate collapse of the enemy.  The scenario is not so fanciful if you consider that the Soviet Union went to pieces barely two years after its withdrawal from Afghanistan.   Naji is reported to have been killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan's Waziristan province in 2008.  Iraq fiasco The fallout from the 9/11 attacks changed things radically for the jihadists in late 2001. The US and allies bombed and invaded Afghanistan, ousting the Taliban, and launching a wider ""War on Terror"" against al-Qaeda. Bin Laden went underground, and Zarqawi and others fled. The dispersing militants, fired up, badly needed another battlefield on which to provoke and confront their Western enemies.  Luck was on their side. The Americans and their allies were not long in providing it.  Their invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003 was, it turned out, entirely unjustified on its own chosen grounds - Saddam Hussein's alleged production of weapons of mass destruction, and his supposed support for international terrorists, neither of which was true.  Bombardment of Baghdad before the US-led invasion in 2003 By breaking up every state and security structure and sending thousands of disgruntled Sunni soldiers and officials home, they created precisely the state of ""savagery"", or violent chaos, that Abu Bakr Naji envisaged for the jihadists to thrive in.  Iraq was on the way to becoming what US officials came to call the ""parent tumour"" of the IS presence in the region. Under Saddam's tightly-controlled Baath Party regime, the Sunnis enjoyed pride of place over the majority Shia, who have strong ties with their co-religionists across the border in Iran.  The US-led intervention disempowered the Sunnis, creating massive resentment and providing fertile ground for the outside salafist jihadists to take root in.  They were not long in spotting their constituency. Abu Musab Zarqawi moved in, and within a matter of months was organising deadly, brutal and provocative attacks aimed both at Western targets and at the majority Shia community.  Doctrinal differences between the two sects go back to disputes over the succession to the Prophet Muhammad in the early decades of Islam, but conflict between them is generally based on community, history and sectarian politics rather than religion as such.  Setting himself up with a new group called Tawhid wa al-Jihad (Tawhid means declaring the uniqueness of Allah), Zarqawi immediately forged a pragmatic operational alliance with underground cells of the remnants of Saddam's regime, providing the two main intertwined strands of the Sunni-based insurgency: militant Jihadism, and Iraqi Sunni nationalism with Baathist organisation at its core.  His group claimed responsibility for several deadly attacks in August 2003 that set the pattern for much of what was to come: a suicide truck bomb explosion at the UN headquarters in Baghdad that killed the envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello and 20 of his staff, and a suicide car bomb blast in Najaf which killed the influential Shia ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim and 80 of his followers. The bombers were salafist jihadists, but logistics were reportedly provided by underground Baathists.  Zarqawi was behind the deadly 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad The following year, Zarqawi himself was believed by the CIA to be the masked killer shown in a video beheading an American hostage, Nicholas Berg, in revenge for the Abu Ghraib prison abuses of Iraqi detainees by members of the US military.  As the battle with the Americans and the new Shia-dominated Iraqi government intensified, Zarqawi finally took the oath of loyalty to Bin Laden, and his group became the official al-Qaeda branch in Iraq.  But they were never really on the same page. Zarqawi's provocative attacks on Shia mosques and markets, triggering sectarian carnage, and his penchant for publicising graphic brutality, were all in line with the radical teachings he had imbibed. But they drew rebukes from the al-Qaeda leadership, concerned at the impact on Muslim opinion.  Zarqawi paid little heed. His strain of harsh radicalism passed to his successors after he was killed by a US air strike in June 2006 on his hideout north of Baghdad. He was easily identified by the tattoos he had never managed to get rid of.  The direct predecessor of IS emerged just a few months later, with the announcement of the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) as an umbrella bringing the al-Qaeda branch together with other insurgent factions. But tough times lay ahead. In January 2007, the Americans began ""surging"" their own troops in Iraq from 132,000 to a peak of 168,000, adopting a much more hands-on approach in mentoring the rebuilt Iraqi army. At the same time, they enticed Sunni tribes in western al-Anbar province to stop supporting the jihadists and join the US-led Coalition-Iraqi government drive to quell the insurgency, which many did, on promises that they would be given jobs and control over their own security.  By the time both the new ISI and al-Qaeda leaders were killed in a US-Iraqi army raid on their hideout in April 2010, the insurgency was at its lowest ebb, pushed back into remote corners of Sunni Iraq.  They were both replaced by one man, about whom very little was publicly known at the time, and not much more since: Ibrahim Awad al-Badri, better known by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  Six eventful years later, he would be proclaimed Caliph Ibrahim, Commander of the Faithful and leader of the newly declared ""Islamic State"". Territorial takeover Baghdadi's career is so shrouded in mist that there are very few elements of it that can be regarded as fact. By all accounts he was born near Samarra, north of Baghdad, so the epithet ""Baghdadi"" seems to have been adopted to give him a more national image, while ""Abu Bakr"" evokes the first successor to (and father-in-law of) Prophet Muhammad. Like the original Abu Bakr, Baghdadi is also reputed to come from the Prophet's Quraysh clan. That, and his youth - born in 1971 - may have been factors in his selection as leader.  All accounts of his early life agree that he was a quiet, scholarly and devout student of Islam, taking a doctorate at the Islamic University of Baghdad. Some even say he was shy, and a bit of a loner, living for 10 years in a room beside a small Sunni mosque in western Baghdad.  The word ""charismatic"" has never been attached to him.  29 June 2014: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi makes a rare appearance in public As a youth, Baghdadi had a passion for Koranic recitation and was meticulous in his observance of religious law. His family nicknamed him The Believer because he would chastise his relatives for failing to live up to his stringent standards. Who is Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?  What has happened to Baghdadi? But by the time of the US-led invasion in 2003, he appears to have become involved with a militant Sunni group, heading its Sharia (Islamic law) committee. American troops detained him, and he was reportedly held in the detention centre at Camp Bucca in the south for most of 2004.  Camp Bucca (named after a fireman who died in the 9/11 attacks) housed up to 20,000 inmates and became a university from which many IS and other militant leaders graduated. It gave them an unrivalled opportunity to imbibe and spread radical ideologies and sabotage skills and develop important contacts and networks, all in complete safety, under the noses and protection of their enemies.  Baghdadi would also certainly have met in Camp Bucca many of the ex-Baathist military commanders with whom he was to form such a deadly partnership.  The low-profile, self-effacing Baghdadi rang no alarm bells with the Americans. They released him, having decided he was low-risk. Camp Bucca, 2008: A ""university"" for future IS leaders But he went on to work his way steadily up through the insurgent hierarchy, virtually unknown to the Iraqi public. By the time Baghdadi took over in 2010, the curtains seemed to be coming down for the jihadists in the Iraqi field of ""savagery"". But another one miraculously opened up for them across the border in neighbouring Syria at just the right moment. In the spring of 2011, the outbreak of civil war there offered a promising new arena of struggle and expansion. The majority Sunnis were in revolt against the oppressive regime of Bashar al-Assad, dominated by his Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam.  Baghdadi sent his men in. By December 2011, deadly car bombs were exploding in Damascus which turned out to be the work of the then shadowy al-Nusra Front. It announced itself as an al-Qaeda affiliate the following month. It was headed by a Syrian jihadist, Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani. He had been sent by Baghdadi, but had his own ideas. Jostling with a huge array of competing rebel groups in Syria, al-Nusra won considerable support on the ground because of its fearless and effective fighting skills, and the flow of funds and foreign fighters that support from al-Qaeda stimulated. It was relatively moderate in its salafist approach, and cultivated local relationships. Al-Nusra was slipping out of Baghdadi's control, and he didn't like it. In April 2013, he tried to rein it back, announcing that al-Nusra was under his command in a new Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (Syria or the Levant). Isis, or Isil, was born. IS flag: Arabic text of the first part of ""shahada"", the basic statement of the Islamic faith, and the seal of the Prophet below it During the short and turbulent period over which it has imposed itself as a major news brand, so-called Islamic State has confused the world with a series of name changes reflecting its mutations and changing aspirations, leaving a situation where there is no universal agreement on how to refer to it. After emerging in Iraq as the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI), its spread to Syria prompted the addition of ""and al-Sham"", a word that can mean Damascus, Syria, or the wider Levant Many chose to use the easy acronym Isis, with the ""S"" standing either for Syria or al-Sham, though the US administration and others opted for Isil (the ""l"" standing for ""Levant""). Both are still widely used though technically outdated In Arabic the same acronym can come out as Daash, sometimes spelled Daesh in English; it has passed into common usage among many Arabs, but is disliked by the organisation itself, which sees it as disrespectful of the ""state""; although Daash has no meaning in Arabic, it also has an unpleasant sound to it, which may be why American and Western officialdom often use it After further expansion of territory and ambitions, the movement dropped geographical specificity and called itself simply ""the Islamic State""; Much of the world was politically reluctant simply to call it that, for fear of implying legitimacy The BBC and others have generally opted for calling it the ""self-styled"" or ""so-called"" Islamic State on first reference, and IS thereafter But Jawlani rebelled, and renewed his oath of loyalty to al-Qaeda's global leadership, now under Ayman al-Zawahiri following Bin Laden's death in 2011. Zawahiri ordered Baghdadi to go back to being just the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) and leave al-Nusra as the al-Qaeda Syria franchise.  It was Baghdadi's turn to ignore orders from head office. Before 2013 was out, Isis and al-Nusra were at each other's throats. Hundreds were killed in vicious internecine clashes which ended with Isis being driven out of most of north-west Syria by al-Nusra and allied Syrian rebel factions. But Isis took over Raqqa, a provincial capital in the north-east, and made it its capital. Many of the foreign jihadists who had joined al-Nusra also went over to Isis, seeing it as tougher and more radical. In early 2014, al-Qaeda formally disowned Isis.  Isis had shaken off the parental shackles. But it had lost a lot of ground, and was bottled up. One of its main slogans, Remaining and Expanding, risked becoming empty. So where next? Fortune smiled once more. Back in Iraq, conditions had again become ripe for the jihadists. The Americans had gone, since the end of 2011. Sunni areas were again aflame and in revolt, enraged by the sectarian policies of the Shia Prime Minister, Nouri Maliki. Sunnis felt marginalised, oppressed and angry.  An IS fighter waves a flag while standing on a captured government fighter jet in Raqqa, Syria, 2015 When Isis decided to move, it was pushing at an open door. In fact, it had never really left Iraq, just gone into the woodwork. As it swept through Sunni towns, cities and villages with bewildering speed in June 2014, sleeper cells of salafist jihadists and ex-Saddamist militants and other sympathisers broke cover and joined the takeover.  With the capture of Mosul, Isis morphed swiftly into a new mode of being, like a rocket jettisoning its carrier. No longer just a shadowy terrorist group, it was suddenly a jihadist army holding large stretches of territory, ruling millions of people, and not only threatening the Iraqi state, but challenging the entire world. The change was signalled on 29 June by the proclamation of the ""Islamic State"", replacing all previous incarnations, and the establishment of the ""caliphate"". A few days later, the newly anointed Caliph Ibrahim, aka Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made a surprise appearance in Mosul in the pulpit of the historic Grand Mosque of al-Nuri, heavily laden with anti-Crusader associations. He called on the world's Muslims to rally behind him.  By declaring a caliphate and adopting the generic ""Islamic State"" title, the organisation was clearly setting its sights far beyond Syria and Iraq. It was going global.  Announcing a caliphate has huge significance and resonance within Islam. While it remains the ideal, Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders had always shied away from it, for fear of failure. Now Baghdadi was trumping the parent organisation, setting IS up in direct competition with it for the leadership of global jihadism.  A caliphate (khilafa) is the rule or rein of a caliph (khalifa), a word which simply means a successor - primarily of the Prophet Muhammad. Under the first four caliphs who followed after he died in 632, the Islamic Caliphate burst out of Arabia and extended through modern-day Iran to the east, into Libya to the west, and to the Caucasus in the north.  The Umayyad caliphate which followed, based in Damascus, took over almost all of the lands that IS would like to control, including Spain. The Baghdad-based Abbasid caliphate took over in 750 and saw a flowering of science and culture, but found it hard to hold it all together, and Baghdad was sacked by the Mongols in 1258. Emerging from that, the Ottoman Empire, based in Constantinople (Istanbul), stretched almost to Vienna at its peak, and was also a caliphate, though the distinction with empire was often blurred. The caliphate was finally abolished by Ataturk in 1924.  So when Baghdadi was declared Caliph of the Islamic State, it was an act of extraordinary ambition. He was claiming no less than the mantle of the Prophet, and of his followers who carried Islam into vast new realms of conquest and expansion.  For most Islamic scholars and authorities, not to mention Arab and Muslim leaders, such claims from the chief of one violent extremist faction had no legitimacy at all, and there was no great rush to embrace the new caliphate. But the millennial echoes it evoked did strike a chord with some Islamic romantics - and with some like-minded radical groups abroad.  Four months after the proclamation, a group of militants in Libya became the first to join up by pledging allegiance to Baghdadi, followed a month later by the Ansar Beit al-Maqdis jihadist faction in Egypt's Sinai. IS's tentacles spread deeper into Africa in March 2015 when Boko Haram in Nigeria took the oath of loyalty. Within a year, IS had branches or affiliates in 11 countries, though it held territory in only five, including Iraq and Syria. It was in those two core countries that Baghdadi and his followers started implementing their state project on the ground, applying their own harsh vision of Islamic rule. To the outside world, deprived of direct access to the areas controlled by IS, one of the most obvious and shocking aspects of this was their systematic destruction of ancient cultural and archaeological heritage sites and artefacts.  Satellite images show Palmyra's once majestic Temple of Bel before and after its destruction by Islamic State militants Some of the region's best-known and most-visited sites were devastated, including the magnificent temples of Bel and Baalshamin at Palmyra in Syria, and the Assyrian cities of Hatra and Nimrud in Iraq.  It wasn't just famous archaeological sites that came under attack. Christian churches and ancient monasteries, Shia mosques and shrines, and anything depicting figures of any sort were destroyed, and embellishments removed even from Sunni mosques. Barely a month after taking over Mosul, IS demolition squads levelled the 13th Century shrine of the Imam Awn al-Din, which had survived the Mongol invasion.  All of this was absolutely in line with IS's puritanical vision of Islam, under which any pictorial representation or shrine is revering something other than Allah, and any non-Muslim structures are monuments of idolatry. Even Saudi kings and princes to this day are buried without coffins in unmarked graves.  A video posted to YouTube in 2015 showed destruction of sculpted faces at Hatra By posting videos of many of these acts which the rest of the world saw as criminal cultural vandalism, IS also undoubtedly intended to shock. In that sense, it was the cultural equivalent of beheading aid workers.  And there was a more practical and profitable side to the onslaught on cultural heritage. In highly organised manner, IS's Treasury Department issued printed permits to loot archaeological sites, and took a percentage of the proceeds. That was just the tip of the iceberg of a complex structure of governance and control put in place as IS gradually settled into its conquests, penetrating into every aspect of people's lives in exactly the same way as Saddam Hussein's intelligence apparatus had done. Captured documents published by Der Spiegel in 2015, external give some idea of the role of ex-Baathist regime men in setting up and running IS in a highly structured and organised way, with much emphasis on intelligence and security. Residents of Sunni strongholds like Mosul and Falluja in Iraq, and Raqqa in Syria, found that IS operatives already knew almost everything about everybody when they moved in and took over in 2014.  At checkpoints, ID cards were checked against databases on laptops, obtained from government ration or employee registers. Former members of the security forces had to go to specific mosques to ""repent"", hand over their weapons and receive a discharge paper. ""At first, all they did was change the preachers in the mosques to people with their own views,"" said a Mosul resident who fled a year later.  ""But then they began to crack down. Women who had been able to go bare-headed now had to cover up, first with the headscarf and then with the full face-veil. Men have to grow beards and wear short-legged trousers. Cigarettes, hubble-bubble, music and cafes were banned, then satellite TV and mobile phones. Morals police [hisba] vehicles would cruise round, looking for offenders.""

If you fail to memorise, the sentence is repeated.  ""They have courts with judges, officials, records and files, and there are fixed penalties for each crime, it's not random,"" said the Falluja resident, speaking when IS still controlled the city. ""Adulterers are stoned to death. Thieves have their hands cut off. Gays are executed by being thrown off high buildings. Informers are shot dead, Shia militia prisoners are beheaded.""

School curricula were overhauled in line with IS precepts, with history rewritten, all images being removed from schoolbooks and English taken off the menu.  ""One thing you can say is this,"" said the Mosul resident after IS took over. ""There is absolutely no corruption, no wasta [knowing the right people and pulling strings]. They are totally convinced they are on the right track."" Map, purportedly produced by IS, showing group's aspirational takeover of all lands historically controlled by caliphates and Ottoman Empire One story tells a lot about IS and its ways.  As Iraqi security forces were pressing forward in areas around Ramadi in early 2016, civilians were fleeing the battle - and IS fighters, losing the day, were trying to sneak out too. Two women, running from the combat zone, approached a police checkpoint.  As they were being waved through to safety, one of the women suddenly turned to the police, pointed at the other, and said : ""This is not a woman. He's an IS emir [commander]."" The police investigated, and it was true. The other woman was a man, who had shaved, and put on makeup and women's clothes. He turned out to be top of the list of wanted local IS commanders.  ""When IS arrived, he killed my husband, who was a policeman, raped me, and then took me as his wife,"" the woman told the police. ""I put up with him all this time, waiting to avenge my husband and my honour,"" she said. ""I tricked him into shaving and putting on makeup, then denounced him to the police.""

She managed to escape the city and became a refugee in Europe, where she met up with the BBC.  This story is based on her experiences and those of her two sisters, who were still inside the city when it was held by IS.  Taking on the world Having taken over vast swathes of territory in Iraq with their lightning offensive in June 2014, the militants might have been expected to calm down and consolidate their gains.  But, like a shark that has to keep moving or else it will die, IS barely paused before initiating a new spiral of provocation and reprisals that was predictably to draw it into active conflict with almost all the major world powers.  Already, the June offensive had threatened the approaches to Baghdad, prompting the Americans to start bringing in hundreds of military advisers and trainers to see how to help the struggling Iraqi army.  Just two months later, the attack on Kurdish areas in the north triggered US air strikes in defence of the Kurdistan capital, Irbil, and then to help stave off the threat of genocide to the Yazidis. Fourteen other nations were to join the air campaign. Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters head to the Mosul dam (August, 2014 ) Ten days later, IS beheaded James Foley and the others followed, in line with the doctrine of exemplary brutality as punishment, deterrent and provocation. The most shocking was to come some months later, with the burning alive of the downed Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh. Shock intended.  The US-led bombing campaign was extended to Syria in September 2014 after IS besieged the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the Turkish border. Coalition air strikes turned the tide there. IS lost hundreds of fighters killed at Kobane and elsewhere. More revenge was called for. IS turned abroad. In the three years following the declaration of the ""caliphate"" in 2014, at least 150 attacks in 29 countries across the globe were either carried out or inspired by IS, with well over 2,000 victims killed.  The attacks carried the same message of punishment, deterrence and provocation as the hostage beheadings, while also demonstrating IS's global reach.  At the same time, they carried through the militants' doctrine of distracting the enemy by setting fires in different locations and making him squander resources on security. For IS, ""the enemy"" is everybody who does not embrace it. The world is divided into Dawlat al-Islam, the State of Islam, and Dawlat al-Kufr, the State of Unbelief.  The most consequential of these atrocities were the downing of a Russian airliner over Sinai on 31 October 2015 and the Paris attacks on 13 November, provoking both Russia and France to intensify air strikes on IS targets in Syria.  The lone-wolf massacre at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, on 12 June 2016, while apparently inspired rather than organised by IS, would undoubtedly further stiffen the US's already steely resolve to finish the organisation. Had IS gone mad? It seemed determined to take on the whole world. It was goading and confronting the Americans, the Russians, and a long list of others. By its own count, it had a mere 40,000 fighters at its command (other estimates went as low as half that).  A memorial to the victims of downed Airbus A321, at Pulkovo Airport in Russia, in November 2015 Could it really challenge the global powers and hope to survive? Or would President Barack Obama and his successor Donald Trump be able to fulfil Mr Obama's pledge to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" the organisation? Final showdown If there seemed to be something apocalyptic about IS's ""bring it on"" defiance, that's because there was. When the organisation first brought out its online magazine - a major showcase and recruitment tool - just a month after the ""caliphate"" was declared, it was not by chance that it was named Dabiq. A small town north of Aleppo in Syria, Dabiq is mentioned in a hadith (a reported saying of the Prophet Muhammad) in connection with Armageddon. In IS mythology, it is the scene where a cataclysmic showdown will take place between the Muslims and the infidels, leading to the end of days. Each issue of Dabiq begins with a quote from Abu Musab Zarqawi: ""The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify - by Allah's permission - until it burns the crusader armies in Dabiq."" Dabiq - Islamic State's online magazine The prospect of taking part in that final glorious climax, achieving martyrdom on the path of Allah and an assured place in paradise, is one of the thoughts inspiring those heeding the IS call to jihad.  That could help explain why the organisation seemed to enjoy an endless supply of recruits willing to blow themselves to pieces in suicide attacks, which it calls ""martyrdom-seeking operations"" (suicide is forbidden in Islam). Hundreds have died in this way, and they happen virtually daily.  It's been one of the elements that made IS a formidable fighting force hard to destroy even in strictly military terms.  Former Iraqi army officers have helped organise and direct IS IS is in many respects a project of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's outlawed Baath party, but now with a different ideology. Former agents or officers of Saddam Hussein's regime dominate its leadership... They represent a battle-hardened and state-educated core that would likely endure (as they have done through US occupation and a decade of war) even if the organisation's middle and lower cadres are decimated. What made IS so formidable? The head of security and intelligence for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, Masrour Barzani, tells the story of a frustrated would-be suicide bomber who screamed at his captors: ""I was just 10 minutes away from being united with the Prophet Muhammad!"" ""They think they're winners regardless of whether they kill you or they get killed,"" says Barzani. ""If they kill you, they win a battle. If they get killed, they go to heaven. With people like this, it's very difficult to deter them from coming at you. So really the only way to defeat them is to eliminate them."" Probably for the first time in military history since the Japanese kamikaze squadrons of World War Two, suicide bombers are used by IS not only for occasional terrorist spectaculars, but as a standard and common battlefield tactic. Virtually all IS attacks begin with one or several suicide bombers driving explosives-rigged cars or trucks at the target, softening it up for combat squads to go in. So much so that the ""martyrdom-seekers"" have been called the organisation's ""air force"", since they serve a similar purpose. Formidable though that is, IS as a fighting force is much more than a bunch of wild-eyed fanatics eager to blow themselves up. For that, they have Saddam Hussein to thank.  ""The core of IS are former Saddam-era army and intelligence officers, particularly from the Republican Guard,"" said an international intelligence official. ""They are very good at moving their people around, resupply and so on, they're actually much more effective and efficient than the Iraqi army are. That's the hand of former military staff officers who know their business."" ""They are very professional,"" adds Masrour Barzani. ""They use artillery, armoured vehicles, heavy machinery etc, and they are using it very well. They have officers who know conventional war and how to plan, how to attack, how to defend. They really are operating on the level of a very organised conventional force. Otherwise they'd be no more than a terrorist organisation."" The partnership with the ex-Baathists, going back to Zarqawi's early days in Iraq, was clearly a vital component in IS success.  But that did not mean its fighters were invincible on the battlefield, even in the early days of stunningly rapid expansion. The Kurds in north-east Syria were fighting IS off with no outside help for a year before anybody noticed. And even now, IS makes what would conventionally be seen as costly mistakes.  In December 2015, for example, they lost several hundred fighters in one abortive attack east of Mosul alone, and probably 2,500 altogether that month alone. Pentagon officials said coalition air strikes killed some 50,000 IS militants in Iraq and Syria between August 2014 and the end of 2016. But IS initially seemed to have little difficulty making up the numbers. With a population of perhaps 10 million acquiescent Sunnis to draw on, in Iraq and Syria, most recruiting was done locally. Clearly, had it remained in place, there would soon have been a new generation of young militants, external drawn from local sources.  This video can not be played Quentin Sommerville: ""They witnessed killing close at hand"" ""I didn't join out of conviction,"" says Bakr Madloul, a 24-year-old bachelor who was arrested in December at his home in a Sunni quarter in southern Baghdad and accused of taking part in deadly IS car bomb attacks on mainly Shia areas, which he admits. Bakr says he was working as a construction foreman in Kurdistan when IS took over Mosul. He was detained for questioning by Kurdish security, and met a militant in jail who persuaded him to go to Mosul, where he joined up with IS and manned a checkpoint until it was hit by a Coalition air strike.  He was then sent back to his Baghdad suburb to help organise car bombings. The explosives-packed vehicles were sent from outside Baghdad, and his job was to place them where he was told by his controller, usually in crowded streets or markets.  Bakr Madloul (left) pictured during his time as an IS operative ""Only one of the five car bombs I handled was driven by a suicide bomber,"" he says. ""I spoke to him. He was 22 years old, an Iraqi. He believed he would go to paradise when he died. It's the easiest and quickest way to Heaven. They strongly believe this. They would blow themselves up to get to Heaven. There were older ones in their 30s and 40s."" ""I asked my controllers more than once, 'Is it OK to kill women and children?'  They would answer, 'They're all the same.' But to me, killing women and children, I didn't feel at all comfortable about that. But once you're in, you're stuck. If you try to leave, they call you a murtadd, an apostate, and they'll kill you or your family."" Bakr knows he will almost certainly hang. Since we spoke, he has in fact been given two death sentences. I asked him if he would do the same things over if he had his life again. He laughed.  ""Absolutely not. I would get out of Iraq, away from IS, away from the security forces. I took this path without realising the consequences. There is no way back. I see that now."" Bakr Madloul knows he will probably be executed But up in Kurdistan, another IS prisoner, Muhannad Ibrahim, has no such regrets. A 32-year-old from a village near Mosul with a wife and three children, he was a construction worker for a Turkish company when IS took over the city. Two of his older brothers had died fighting the Americans there in 2004 and 2006. He joined IS without hesitation and was commanding a small detachment when he was captured in a battle with the Kurds.  ""We were being oppressed by the Shia, they were always insulting and bothering us,"" he says. ""But that's not the main motivation, religious conviction is more important. All my family is religious, praise be to Allah. I came to IS through my faith and religious principles."" ""If I had my time over again, I would take the same path, the same choices. Because I am convinced by this thing, I have to go to the end. Either I am killed, or Allah will decree some other fate for me."" Captured IS fighter Muhannad Ibrahim is unrepentant Rising to the challenge Just as the 9/11 Twin Towers atrocity in 2001 had left the US and its allies with no alternative but to strike back with extreme force, the challenge mounted by IS through its numerous provocative outrages in the region and around the world could not be ignored - nor was it meant to be. But rooting out the militants from Iraq and Syria was always going to be much more complex than the campaign unleashed more than a decade earlier against al-Qaeda and its Taliban hosts in Afghanistan.  There was never any real question of a wholesale Coalition invasion of either country. Air strikes were one thing, but putting in vast numbers of troops on the ground would be something else.  Syria was embroiled in a bewilderingly complicated civil war. Iraq was also in turmoil. US forces had only pulled out three years earlier. There was no appetite for a repeat of an invasion which was almost universally seen as a disastrous blunder with lasting consequences.  But uprooting the militants could not be done by air power alone. Reliable, motivated partner forces on the ground would be needed. In both countries, they were in short supply.  In Syria, the US and its allies were already engaged with some of the motley array of Syrian rebel groups. But they never amounted to the kind of focused, cohesive forces that the Coalition was looking for - they were fragmented, fractious, increasingly Islamist in tone, and largely bent on overthrowing the Assad regime rather than turning on IS.  In Iraq, the regular armed forces were in disarray after collapsing like a house of cards in the face of the onslaught on Mosul by a few hundred IS militants. Much work would have to be done to weld them into a motivated and competent fighting force.  In both countries it was to the Kurds in the north that the Americans and their Coalition partners first turned as their most hopeful immediate allies.  The Syrian Democratic Forces emerged as a reliable partner for the US in the fight against IS The Kurdish Peshmerga forces in northern Iraq had a long relationship with the Western Coalition powers. In 2003, US special forces fought alongside them to clear Islamist militants from mountain positions near the Iranian border just before the invasion against Saddam Hussein, in which they were partners.  Humiliated by the loss of vast areas of territory to the lightning IS assault in early August 2014, the Peshmerga needed no encouragement to hit back. Less than two weeks later, with Coalition air support, they recaptured the strategic Mosul dam.  In the months that followed, they slowly clawed back much of the ground they had lost, including Sinjar in November 2015, in operations closely co-ordinated with Coalition air strikes. But in the rest of Iraq, the picture was much messier. Iraqi government forces were able to halt the IS thrust southwards towards the capital, Baghdad, but made little early progress pushing back into the mainly Sunni areas where the militants had dug in.  It was Iranian-backed Shia militias, whose emergence was consolidated under the IS threat, that made the running in the initial phases of the campaign to oust the militants, driving them out of areas north-east of Baghdad near the Iranian border and pursuing them westwards until the eventual recapture of Saddam Hussein's hometown Tikrit in the Tigris river valley in March 2015.  ""If it weren't for Iran, the democratic experiment in Iraq would have fallen,"" said Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Iranian-backed Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups, known as the Hashd al-Shaabi or Popular Mobilisation (PM), that rose in defence of Baghdad and the south.  ""Obama was sleeping, and he didn't wake up until IS was at the gates of Irbil. When they were at the gates of Baghdad, he did nothing. Were it not for Iran's support, IS would have taken over the whole Gulf, not just Iraq."" But in the Sunni heartlands of Anbar province to the west of Baghdad the Iraqi state forces were struggling.  In May 2015, IS militants captured the provincial capital, Ramadi. At the same time, they spread their grip in Syria, taking the iconic city of Palmyra (Tadmur) in the desert east of Homs. It was a clear signal that while the organisation may have been dealt some setbacks it was still at the height of its powers and capable of exploiting any weaknesses it found.  But the Americans were quietly busy preparing for the real war on IS. They had poured billions into rebuilding the Iraqi army after 2003, only to see much of it go to pieces under pressure because so much was wrong with its foundations.  Now, putting in several thousand advisers, they focused on training and equipping the key Iraqi special forces - the Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS), otherwise known as the Golden Division - that was to play a crucial role spearheading the drive against the militants.  The systematic lashback began with Anbar province and the eventual recapture of Ramadi at the end of 2015 and early 2016, a grinding and costly operation with close Coalition air support. There was huge destruction and the displacement of most of the city's largely Sunni population. There were also tensions over the deployment of Iranian-backed, mainly Shia militias in core Sunni areas, though they were largely kept out of the city itself.  Pro-government forces patrol Ramadi The recapture of Ramadi tightened the noose around the even more iconic centre of Sunni sentiment at nearby Falluja, where militants had fought two major battles with the Americans in 2004. Government and PM forces began closing in around the city in early 2016, soon after taking Ramadi. By now, after a lot of testing and assessing, the Americans and their allies, working closely with local forces, were clearly embarked on a comprehensive strategy to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" IS wherever it could be found. The broad lines were spelled out in February 2016 by Lt Gen Sean McFarland, then the commanding general of the Coalition's Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve. ""The campaign has three objectives: to destroy the ISIL parent tumour in Iraq and Syria by collapsing its power centres in Mosul and Raqqa; two, to combat the emerging metastases of the ISIL tumour worldwide; and three, to protect our nations from attack."" Next step on the road to Mosul, the battle for Falluja was joined in late May 2016 and took just over a month of assaults, bombardments and air strikes to complete, with civilians again paying a heavy price. IS fighters deployed their full range of battle tactics, with snipers, booby-traps and suicide bombers making advance difficult and dangerous for the attacking forces.  Despite the attrition suffered by the Iraqi forces, especially the elite CTS forces, it was not long before eyes turned to the big prize - Mosul. With President Obama due to bow out early in the new year, the Americans were getting impatient.  In peacetime roughly 10 times the size of either Falluja or indeed the IS ""capital"" Raqqa, Mosul was never going to be an easy nut to crack. It had fallen to the militants in a matter of hours in 2014. By the time the government and Coalition campaign to dislodge them was finally launched in mid-October 2016, IS had had nearly two-and-a-half years to dig in and prepare its defences.  There is a moment in the journey into Raqqa when you leave the real world behind. After the bombed-out Samra bridge, any signs of normal life vanish. Turn right at the shop that once sold gravestones - its owner is long gone - and you are inside the city. Ahead lies nothing but destruction and grey dust and rubble. This is a place drained of colour, of life, and of people. In six days inside Raqqa, I didn't see a single civilian. The city fit for no-one Marshalled against a band of militants variously estimated at between 2,000 and 12,000 with a hard core probably closer to 4,000 or 5,000, was a vast assembly of government and auxiliary forces, estimated at around 100,000, counting regular army and federal police units, Kurdish Peshmerga forces, and the Popular Mobilisation, including some Sunni and minority volunteers as well as Shia militias. It was an epic battle that was to last nine months. Government forces slowly battered their way in around the city through dozens of outlying villages and finally into Mosul's eastern half, which was declared ""liberated"" towards the end of January 2017. Then it was on to the western side of the river and the old city, with its dense warren of narrow streets.  The area around the ancient Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdad had made his only public appearance as the newly-anointed ""caliph"", was the last to fall. The mosque was blown up, almost exactly three years after the declaration of the IS ""caliphate"". The evidence was that IS itself had destroyed it, rather than let it fall into ""infidel"" hands. The Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, saw this as ""official recognition of defeat"" by the militants. It signalled, he said, ""the collapse of the IS caliphate and a grand military victory"". This video can not be played The Iraqi military circulated a video it says shows the destruction of Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri. It was indeed a monumental achievement, a massive body-blow to the IS state project. The city had been, as a senior Western official in northern Iraq put it, ""the beating heart of IS"", in real terms much more important than Raqqa in Syria.  But it came at huge cost. The years of preparation and months of battering that it took to dislodge a few thousand militants stood in stark contrast to the ease with which they had rolled into the city virtually unopposed in June 2014. Some estimates put the number of civilians killed at more than 40,000. At least 1,200 Iraqi security personnel also died in battle. The damage was estimated at $50bn. Hundreds thousands of mainly Sunni inhabitants were displaced, and there were widespread allegations of abuses.  The weeks that followed saw a further rapid erosion of the group's territorial position in Iraq. By the end of August 2017, it had been driven out of Tal Afar, an important town controlling the main road from Mosul towards Syria. A month later, another long-standing IS pocket in and around the mainly Sunni town of Hawija, west of Kirkuk, was also largely overrun by government and auxiliary forces.  In Iraq, that left IS in control only of the area in and around the town of al-Qaim, on the River Euphrates by the Syrian border in the far west of Anbar province.  Its presence in the country had been very radically degraded. But the organisation was still far from destroyed. Across in Syria, the overall picture by the autumn of 2017 was roughly the same, despite the country's very different, extremely complex and fast-moving situation. In 2014 and 2015, IS had substantial holdings in Syria - it looked as though someone had spilled a bottle of black ink on its map. They controlled virtually the whole of Syria's stretch of the Euphrates, from Albu Kamal on the Iraqi border, up through Deir al-Zour and Raqqa, the Tabqa dam, and on to Jarablus on the border with Turkey, one of several crossings that were lifelines for the militants. They held towns and villages to the east and north of Aleppo (including the near-mythical Dabiq) and other pockets further south, including Palmyra and nearby oilfields.  But this heyday did not last. In Syria, IS found itself facing, not one motley coalition of enemies as in Iraq, but three.  The Americans, despairing of Syrian rebel groups whose interests lay elsewhere, adopted the experienced Syrian Kurdish fighters of the YPG, the Popular Protection Units, as their main on-the-ground partners. They added on as many Arab and minority fighters as they could find to produce the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), their favoured vehicle against IS in Syria. A cruise missile is fired from Russian ship in the Mediterranean Sea (Russian Defence Ministry handout) This did not go down at all well with the US's Nato ally Turkey, which sees the YPG and their parent political body, the Democratic Unity Party (PYD), as terrorists because of their affiliation to Turkey's own Kurdish rebels, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).  Often seeming to be working at cross-purposes to the Americans, Ankara set up its own coalition from among the Syrian opposition groups it had been backing and facilitating for years.  IS also received attention from a third coalition, grouping Syrian government forces, Iran and Russia. The Russians carried out air strikes against IS positions partly with the same kind of motivation as the Western Coalition - revenge for the downing by IS of the Russian airliner over Sinai in October 2015 - but their real strategic interest was different.   The Russians and Iranians were bent on securing their investment in the Assad regime, helping it restore its authority in the country, and pre-empting any move by the Americans and their allies to block a link-up between eastern Syria and western Iraq that would give Tehran a direct land connection from Iran all the way to Lebanon.  That thought may have been somewhere in Washington's head, but its primary concern was hitting and destroying IS.  Turkey for its part had a different overriding preoccupation: to prevent the Syrian Kurds from expanding and joining up the areas they controlled along the southern side of the Turkey-Syria border.  Despite these conflicting motivations, for IS the result was the same - pressure on many fronts. The US-backed SDF made the most headway, systematically whittling away IS assets step-by-step, but Turkey and Syrian government forces were also on the march.  As early as September 2014, US air strikes had helped prevent IS taking over the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the border with Turkey. After that, the SDF were pushing forward. By October 2016, IS had lost all access to the Turkish border, a huge logistical setback - virtually all foreign jihadists bound for both Syria and Iraq had come that way, apart from other advantages.  Smoke rises from a bombed building in Deir al-Zour The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels also played their part, taking over IS-held areas north and east of Aleppo - including Dabiq, which fell in a mundane enough manner with none of the apocalyptic ""burning of the Crusader armies"" heralded in IS mythology.  Gradually the militants' tide receded further and further down the Euphrates valley, with the SDF, backed by perhaps 2,000 US special forces with artillery and air power, doing most of the pushing. By November 2016, the SDF were in a position to launch a campaign to isolate and eventually attack the IS ""capital"", Raqqa. The assault on the city itself began in early June 2017.  By then, much of the population and many IS fighters had already fled, with most of the militants heading further downstream to the final major city largely under their control - another provincial capital, Deir al-Zour.  But before the recapture of Raqqa had been completed, Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian government forces were already thrusting towards Deir al-Zour, where a military base and airport had held out against the IS militants for almost three years. To get there, the government forces had recaptured Palmyra (for the second time) in March and pushed eastwards along the road to take Sukhna in August before reaching Deir al-Zour itself in September.  US-backed SDF forces had already bypassed the yet-to-fall Raqqa and moved into oil-rich areas to the east of Deir al-Zour, laying claim to oil and gasfields that would greatly bolster the Kurds' ambitions to run their own area in the north of the country - or at least strengthen their hand in eventual negotiations with Damascus. So as 2017 moved into its final months, IS territorial control in Syria seemed to be as doomed as it was in Iraq - bottled up in a small patch straddling the border around al-Qaim in western Iraq and Albu Kamal in Syria. Rooting the militants out from there would not necessarily be a simple task in a fiercely tribal area prone to defying governments.  But to all intents and purposes, the IS dream of administering and expanding a thriving Islamic state in the two countries as the core of a growing global caliphate had crashed in flames.  So had IS been virtually destroyed as well as severely degraded? Was it time to celebrate its demise?  It had certainly been dealt crippling blows in terms of functioning as a territorial state. That project lay in ruins. The administrative structures it had set up had been swept away. Major sources of finance had been cut off - from the oilfields it had controlled, taxes imposed on the millions of Iraqis and Syrians it had ruled, and cash coming in across the border with Turkey. It could no longer attract thousands of foreign jihadists or recruit locals to replace the 60,000 IS fighters the Americans believe have died since the heady days of June 2014.  With virtually all of their urban holdings lost, the militants were shrinking back into the shadows and deserts. Many of their leaders had also been killed, although Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi himself apparently eluded the hunt, issuing a defiant audio statement in September 2017. Among the known dead were Mohammed Emwazi, ""Jihadi John"", killed by a drone strike in Syria in late 2015. But all of this had been long foreseen by the leadership. In May 2016, the man regarded as the organisation's real Number Two, spokesman and head of external operations Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, made a lengthy statement already foreshadowing the next phase of IS existence.  ""You will never be victorious. You will be defeated,"" he told the Americans. ""Do you think that victory comes by killing one leader or another? That would be a fake victory!"" ""Or do you consider defeat to be the loss of a city or the loss of territory? Were we defeated when we lost the cities in Iraq [in 2007-8] and were in the desert without any city or land? And would we be defeated, and you victorious, if you were to take Mosul or Sirte or Raqqa, or even all the cities, and we were to return to our previous situation? Absolutely not! True defeat is the loss of will and desire to fight."" Abu Muhammad al-Adnani Adnani, who as spokesman had announced the birth of ""Islamic State"" and the caliphate in June 2014, may not have lost the will and desire to fight. But he did lose his life. He was killed by an American air strike near Aleppo in August 2016. He was right to suggest that the targeted killing of militant leaders has in general had little discernible impact on the course of movements, psychologically important though it may be.  But the Iraqi expert on radical movements, Hisham al-Hashemi, believes the case of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi might be different. The Americans are unlikely to rest until they have killed Baghdadi, not least because of their belief that he personally repeatedly raped an American NGO worker, Kayla Mueller, and then had her killed in early 2015. ""IS's future depends on Baghdadi,"" Hashemi said, speaking at a time when IS still controlled huge swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria.  ""If he is killed, it will split up. One part would stay on his track and announce a new caliphate. Another would split off and return to al-Qaeda. Others would turn into gangs following whoever is strongest."" ""The source of his strength is that he brought about an ideological transformation, blending jihadist ideas with Baathist intelligence security methods, enabling him to create this quasi-state organisation."" Baghdadi's death might not have such an impact in the new situation. But his special talents could come into their own again should conditions in either or both of those countries, or elsewhere, once again favour a comeback by the militants.  That is not so fanciful, even amid the smoking wreckage of the IS above-ground infrastructure.  In Iraq, the burning Sunni grievances against the Shia-dominated Baghdad government that allowed IS to make its astonishing advances in 2014 have not been seriously addressed. American officials are already referring to the danger of an ""AQI-2"" emerging - a second al-Qaeda in Iraq. It has happened before.  The wholesale destruction of Sunni towns and cities in the drive against IS and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Sunnis may even have aggravated those grievances, providing fertile ground for militants to infiltrate back.  There is an optimistic argument that the united cross-sectarian effort that it took to drive the militants out may have sown the seeds of a new Iraqi nationalism. But the fact remains that the Sunni community has been crushed, and the Shia majority dominates both politically and through the proliferation of its powerful militias. Political leaderships in Baghdad have signally failed to promote any serious national reconciliation since 2003.  ""IS was essentially an Iraqi creation,"" said a senior Western intelligence official, speaking shortly before the militants were ousted from Mosul.  ""The tragic reality is that at the moment, it is the main Sunni political entity in Iraq. From the West, it's looked at as a kind of crazed cult. Here in Iraq it represents an important constituency. It represents a massive dissatisfaction, the alienation of a whole sector of the population."" Thousands of IS cases are being tried in courts like Nineveh Criminal Court in Qaraqosh (above) A young man wearing a shabby, brown prisoner's outfit stands before three black-robed judges in a tiny, provincial courtroom, shaking nervously. After sipping some water, he confirms his name: Abdullah Hussein. He is accused of fighting for so-called Islamic State (IS). ""The decision of the court has been taken according to articles 2 and 3 of the 2005 Counterterrorism Law,"" states the judge. ""Death by hanging."" And then Hussein - who, like many suspects here, was picked up on the Mosul frontline - breaks down crying. Inside the Iraqi courts sentencing IS suspects to death Much work remains to be done if that sobering assessment is to be reversed. And Baghdad meanwhile faces multiple challenges that might help tip it back into the state of chaos in which the militants could thrive.  The state's coffers are empty at a time when the reconstruction bill is estimated conservatively at $100bn. Corruption is endemic. Apart from the Sunni issue, Baghdad politics is in turmoil, with deep rivalries between Shia factions with greater or lesser attachment to Iran. And the threat of secession by the Kurds in the north, after the September 2017 independence referendum, could bring further instability.  The very least that could be expected post-Mosul was an indefinite period of low-level insurgency, with bomb blasts and suicide attacks in different parts of the country, especially aimed, as before, at mainly Shia areas. It was already happening. The US military's Combating Terrorism Center reported that by mid-2017 there was already an average of 130 insurgent attacks taking place monthly in the ""liberated"" eastern half of Mosul.  And it was already happening next door in Syria too, with IS carrying out random deadly explosions in Damascus and elsewhere despite its stark loss of territory. Although it was obvious by late 2017 that the Assad government with its Russian and Iranian backers were prevailing, the final pattern of control and governance country-wide remained uncertain.  There were many ways in which further turmoil could ensue, not least the fact that, with US support, Kurdish forces had spread well beyond their own demographic comfort zone, causing huge resentment among some Sunni elements. As in Iraq, many Syrian Sunnis were bound to feel aggrieved by everything that had happened since the civil war broke out in 2011.  And where there were grievances, IS or its successors would surely be there to build on them.  Capitalising on chaos IS had in any case been busy spreading its bets and developing other territorial possibilities beyond the ""parent tumour"" of Iraq and Syria.  Libya initially proved the most promising. It had just the kind of failed-state anarchy, the state of ""savagery"", that left room for the jihadists to move in, forging alliances with local militants and disgruntled supporters of the overthrown regime of Muammar Gaddafi, just as they had done in Iraq. IS signalled its arrival there in typical style, issuing a polished video in February 2015 showing a group of 21 bewildered Egyptian Christian workers in orange jumpsuits being beheaded on a Libyan beach, their blood mingling with the waters of the Mediterranean as a warning to the ""Crusader"" European countries on the other side of the sea that radical Islam was on the way. The man who voiced that warning was believed to be the IS leader in Libya, an Iraqi called Wissam al-Zubaydi, also known as Abu Nabil. By coincidence, Zubaydi was killed in a US air strike on the same day IS struck in Paris, 13 November 2015.  A Libyan security official at a site used by so-called Islamic State near Sirte The militants took over a big stretch of the coast and the central city of Sirte, which was to Muammar Gaddafi what Tikrit was to Saddam Hussein. Another American air strike in February killed (among nearly 50 other people) Noureddine Chouchane, reputedly an IS figure responsible for the deadly attacks on Western tourists in his native Tunisia.  But the IS presence in Libya soon came under pressure, with militias loyal to the Government of National Accord, which been born out of UN efforts, dislodging the militants from Sirte in the second half of 2016.  But they did not disappear. The Americans launched an air strike on IS elements south of Sirte in October 2017, their first such action in Libya since President Trump took over.  The militants were undoubtedly on the defensive in Libya. But it remained a deeply fragmented country, and its new government far from powerful or universally accepted. There would likely continue to be pockets of chaos there for the jihadists to exploit. And there was no shortage of other possibilities being actively explored and developed - Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, the Philippines, Nigeria... wherever there were dysfunctional states and angry Muslims, there would be opportunities for IS, competing strongly with a diminished al-Qaeda as a dominant brand in the jihadist market. Adding the extra risk for the West, that that competition could be another spur for spectacular terrorist attacks which they know are being actively plotted.  Long before IS lost almost all its territorial gains in Iraq and Syria, it was clear that the organisation, while trying its best to hold ground wherever it could, was trying to stay alive and assert itself (""Remaining and Expanding"") in other ways - renewed insurgency in the lost lands, constant propaganda and proselytising on the internet, and above all, a revitalised push to carry out acts of terror in the West, the more shocking the better.   As early as September 2014, just as IS was embarking on its provocative confrontation with the West, spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani urged the movement's followers in graphic detail to kill the hated infidels. ""If you can kill a disbelieving American or European - especially the spiteful and filthy French - or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other of the unbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be. Smash his head with a rock, slaughter him with a knife, run him over with your car, throw him down from a high place, choke him or poison him."" In his statement in May 2016, al-Adnani signalled the organisation's new stress on attacks inside Western countries in response to the drive against it in Iraq and Syria.  ""Truly, the smallest act you do in their lands is more beloved to us than the biggest act done here; it is more effective for us and more harmful to them... Know that your targeting those who are called ""civilians"" is more beloved to us and more effective, as it is more harmful, painful, and a greater deterrent to them."" Attacks in Europe and elsewhere intensified almost in direct proportion to IS' loss of terrain in Iraq and Syria. Among the more notable were the truck assault in Nice, France, in July 2016 (at least 86 killed) and a similar attack in Berlin in December (12 killed), the Istanbul nightclub bombing in January 2017 (39 killed), and two vehicle and knife attacks in London in March and June 2017 (15 killed).  The attacks in London broke new ground for IS, and even more so the suicide bomb attack at the Manchester Arena in May 2017 in which more than 20 people died. A van attack in Barcelona in August in which 13 people were killed was also seen as an advance for the militants.  Twenty-two people were killed in the Manchester bombing in 2017 These kinds of attacks, often carried out by ""lone wolves"" and involving everyday implements that are impossible to control, were clearly a nightmare for security services.  Their job was made all the more challenging by studies showing that fewer than 20% of  ""successful"" attacks in Europe and North America were carried out by jihadists who had gone to Syria or Iraq, and that most were perpetrated by citizens of the countries under attack.  While IS had managed to plant a small number of activists in the crowds of refugees and asylum seekers besieging the gates of Europe and the West, simply vetting them carefully would obviously not be enough.  Clearly, IS internet messaging was still powerful, resonating among the disaffected, the resentful, the alienated and disempowered.  The Americans, focusing largely on the military defeat of the militants, seemed taken aback by IS's ability to keep up and even expand the challenge.  ""When I consider how much damage we've inflicted and they're still operational, they're still capable of pulling off things like some of these attacks we've seen internationally, we have to conclude that we do not yet fully appreciate the scale or strength of this phenomenon,"" said Lt Gen Michael Nagata, one of the top US Special Operations officers, quoted by the Combating Terrorism Center.  ""We spend an inordinate amount of time and resources as the United States, but also as our partners, trying to not only defeat ISIS and their control of the physical caliphate, but their virtual space that they own,"" added Thomas P Bossert, President Trump's adviser on homeland security and counter-terrorism adviser.  ""They're proselytizing. It's troubling."" Clearly, tackling such a vague, ethereal and pervasive threat was a far cry from the clear-cut task of confronting IS fighters on the battlefield. The threat was not going to go away. Cyber-inspired lone wolf attacks could materialise at almost any time, any place. The price of relative safety would be eternal vigilance.  Battle for minds The US and its allies were starting to come to grips with the cyber dimension of the challenge - and giving much less priority to the crucial problem of poor governance in the countries whose dysfunctionalities provided opportunities for the radicals to take root.  But there were other parts of IS' complicated root system that were even harder to get at. The New York-based security consultancy Soufan Group estimated that more than half of the 27,000 foreign jihadists making their way to Syria and Iraq in the first 18 months of the ""Islamic State"" were from the Middle East and North Africa.  Clearly, the ""Caliphate"" had appeal, despite - perhaps in some cases, because of - its graphically publicised brutality. While vowing to degrade and destroy the organisation, President Obama put his finger on the real challenge: ""Ideologies are not defeated with guns, they are defeated by better ideas, a more attractive and more compelling vision,"" he said. On a relatively normal day... there was a total of 50 distinct pieces of propaganda. The photo reports and videos included depictions of an IS offensive in northern Syria and eulogies for the dead in Salahuddin... Overwhelmingly, though, the propagandists were preoccupied with a carefully refined view of 'normal' life. Fishing and ultraviolence The problem is that when disenchanted people in the region look around them - especially the young, the idealistic, or the hopeless unemployed who have no future - they see scant evidence of ""better ideas"" or attractive and compelling visions. They see the ruins of an ""Arab Spring"" which raised hopes only to dash them cruelly. The brutal, corrupt dictatorships which it shook have either fragmented into chaos and sectarian and tribal upheaval, like Syria itself, Libya, Yemen and (with Western intervention) Iraq, or the sinister ""deep states"" of their former regimes came back, even more harshly in the case of Egypt, less so in the case of Tunisia. While many of the European jihadists may have heeded the call for other reasons, socio-economic factors play an important part in radicalising some of the Arab jihadists, and will continue to do so unless addressed. Unidentified IS fighter Mohammed is giddy with excitement as he films the discovery of three IS fighters on his mobile phone. ""Shoot him,"" he shouts, gesturing at one of them. His nervousness gives him away as the unit's cook. He's unarmed, but his fellow soldiers from the Iraqi police special forces - known as the Emergency Response Division - are armed to the teeth and are not taking any chances. The secret lives of young IS fighters One of the biggest contingents is from Tunisia, where a detailed survey, external in the poorest suburbs of the capital Tunis showed clearly that the radicalisation of young people there had far less to do with extreme Islamic ideology as such than it did with unemployment, marginalisation and disillusion after a revolution into which they threw themselves, but which gave them nothing, and left them hopeless.  IS is also filling a desert left by the collapse of all the political ideologies that have stirred Arab idealists over the decades. Many used to travel to the Soviet Union for training and tertiary education, but communism is now seen as a busted flush. Arab socialism and Arab nationalism, which caused such excitement in the 1950s and 1960s, mutated into brutal, corrupt ""republics"" where sons were groomed to inherit power from their fathers.  In this vacuum, IS took up the cause of punishing the West and other outsiders for their actions in the region over the past century:  the carve-up by the colonial powers 100 years ago, drawing  a border between Iraq and Syria which IS has now erased  the creation of Israel under the British mandate for Palestine, and its subsequent unswerving political and financial support by the US Western (and indeed Russian) backing for corrupt and tyrannical Arab regimes the Western invasion and destruction of Iraq on the flimsiest of pretexts, with the death of uncounted thousands of Iraqis the Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo prisoner abuse scandals.... The roots of IS also lie in a crisis within Islam.  ""Isil is not Islamic,"" said President Obama, echoing statements by many Western leaders that ""IS has nothing to do with Islam"". But it has. ""It is based on Islamic texts that are reinterpreted according to how they see it,"" says Ahmad Moussalli, professor of politics at the American University of Beirut. ""I don't say they are not coming out of Islamic tradition, that would be denying facts. But their interpretation is unusual, literal sometimes, very much like the Wahhabis.""  Hisham al-Hashemi, the Iraqi expert on radical groups, agrees. ""Violent extremism in IS and the salafist jihadist groups is justified, indeed blessed, in Islamic law texts relied on by IS and the extremist groups. It's a crisis of religious discourse, not of a barbaric group. Breaking up the religious discourse and setting it on the right course is more important by far than suppressing the extremist groups militarily.""   Because ancient texts can be interpreted by extremists to cover their worst outrages does not implicate the entire religion, any more than Christianity is defined by the Inquisition, where burning at the stake was a stock penalty.  Extremist ideas remain in the dark, forgotten  corners of history unless their time comes. And IS time came, with Afghanistan, Iraq, and everything that followed.  ""Salafism is spreading in the world, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Arab countries,"" says Prof Moussalli.  He blames the Saudis for stifling the emergence of a moderate, democratic version of Islam, the ""alternative Islamic discourse"" to salafism that President Obama wanted to see. ""A moderate Islamic narrative today is a Muslim Brotherhood narrative, which has been destroyed by the Gulf states supporting the military coup in Egypt,"" says Prof Moussalli, referring to the Egyptian military's ousting of the elected President Mohammed Morsi, a senior Muslim Brotherhood figure, in July 2013.  ""We lost that opportunity with Egypt. Egypt could have paved the way for real change in the area. But Saudi Arabia stood against it, in a very malicious way, and destroyed the possibility of changing the Arab regimes into more democratic regimes that accept the transfer of power peacefully. They don't want it."" Saudi Arabia's ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment and its constant propagation have raised ambiguity over its relations with radical groups abroad. Enemies and critics have accused it of producing the virulent strain of Wahhabism that inspires the extremists, and even of supporting IS and other ultra-salafist groups.  But Jamal Khashoggi, a leading Saudi journalist and writer who spent time in Afghanistan and knew Bin Laden, says that simply is not true ""We are at war with IS, which sees us as corrupt Wahhabis."" he says.  ""IS is a form of Wahhabism that has been suppressed here since the 1930s. It resurfaced with the siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979 and spread here and there. But Saudi Arabia didn't back it at all, it saw it as a threat. So it's true that salafism can turn radical, just as the US right-wing produces some crazy lunatics."" Hundreds of people died in a two-week siege when extremist salafists took over the Grand Mosque, the holiest place in Islam, in protest at what they saw as the Kingdom's deviation from the true path.  More recently, Saudi Arabia's security forces and its Shia minority have in fact been the target of attacks by IS, and the kingdom has executed captured militants. It has an active deradicalisation programme.  This video can not be played Saudi Arabia's 'creative' approach to de-radicalisation But the Kingdom's extreme conservatism, its distaste for democracy, and its custodianship of the shrines in Mecca and Medina to which millions of Muslims make pilgrimage every year, have made it one of the main targets for calls for a hard-to-achieve reformation within Islam as part of the battle to defeat IS and other extremist groups.  The winds of change do now seem to be starting to blow through the desert kingdom, with cautious reforms behind which the young Crown Prince, Muhammad Bin Salman, is seen as the driving force.  Although the 2017 decree allowing women to drive caused a stir, it remains to be seen how deep such changes can go in a country where the grip of the ultra-conservative clergy is still strong, and where official primary schoolbooks still teach that all religions apart from Islam are ""false"".  Changing some of the fundamental interpretations of religion is a monumental undertaking that could take generations. But it cannot come fast enough for a senior Sunni politician in Iraq.  ""We must accept the fact that Islam has a crisis,"" he says. ""IS is not a freak. Look at the roots, the people, the aims. If you don't deal with the roots, the situation will be much more dangerous. The world has to get rid of IS, but needs a new deal: reformation, in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, al-Azhar [the ancient seat of Sunni Islamic learning and authority in Cairo].""   ""You can't kill all the Muslims. You need an Islamic reformation. But Saudi and Qatari money has been blotting out the voices so we can't get anywhere. It's the curse of the Arab world - too much oil, too much money."" Sunni Axis v Shia Crescent The demise of the IS as a ""state"" straddling Iraq and Syria has huge geo-strategic implications, few of them positive for the US and its regional allies.  While President Trump railed and tweeted against the evil of Iran and its sponsorship of terrorism, Tehran was quietly benefitting from everything the Americans were doing against IS.  They were non-speaking, arms-length partners in the campaign against the militants in Iraq. US air power, training and hardware directly helped the official Iraqi forces. But the Iranian-backed Shia militias played their part in a series of campaigns ending in a victory which greatly expanded their presence. The rise and fall of the IS phenomenon in Iraq left Iran's influence there stronger than ever.  While the distance between the American and Iranian roles in Syria was even bigger, with Iran on the side of the regime and the US originally backing the rebels, both were fighting IS, and its defeat would ultimately benefit the Assad regime and its Iranian backers. The Americans and their Coalition allies will not be around forever. Iran and its local allies will.  Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups The US had little choice but to do what it did. The superpower could not allow itself to be goaded and provoked with impunity.  But it had earlier opened the floodgates to Iranian influence through a war that was purely elective, a war of choice and ambition rather than necessity: the invasion of Iraq in 2003, launched on pretexts (Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction and his support for terrorism) that turned out to be totally spurious.  By dismantling the Iraqi state in 2003, the US-led coalition was breaking down the bulwark that had contained Iran, the region's Shia superpower, seen as a threat by the Saudis and most of their Sunni Gulf partners since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. The empowerment of the majority Shia community in Iraq after 2003 gave Iran unrivalled influence over Iraqi politics. For years, it had been backing anti-Saddam Iraqi Shia factions in exile. Now they came home to rule the roost.  The arrival of the IS threat led to even more Iranian influence, through the arming, training and directing of the burgeoning Iraqi Shia militias.  For Saudi Arabia and its allies, Iranian penetration in Iraq threatens to establish, indeed largely has, a Shia crescent linking Iran, Iraq, Syria under its minority Alawite leadership, and Lebanon dominated by the Iranian-created Shia faction, Hezbollah. From the outset of the war in Syria in 2011, the regional Sunni powers - the Saudis and their Gulf partners, and Turkey - backed the Sunni rebels in the hope that the overthrow of Assad would establish Sunni majority rule. A north-south Sunni axis running from Turkey through Syria to Jordan and Saudi Arabia would split the Shia crescent and foil the Iranian project, as they saw it. That is essentially what IS did in 2014, when it moved back into Iraq, took Mosul and virtually all the country's Sunni areas, and established a Sunni entity that straddled the suddenly irrelevant border with Syria, blocking off Shia parts of Iraq from Syria. Now that Sunni stake through the heart of the Shia crescent has been removed by the military defeat of IS and the failure of the Saudis, Turks and others - all American allies - to bring about regime change in Damascus.  It's intriguing to wonder what would have happened had IS halted its advances and provocations after the seizure of Mosul in 2014, toned down its rhetoric, perhaps made some local compromises and accommodations.  Just after the fall of Mosul, I asked the Iraqi Kurdistan President, Masoud Barzani, whether he could live with his new neighbours.  ""You don't choose your neighbours,"" was his reply. But five weeks later, IS attacked and overran his areas, threatening the Kurdistan capital Irbil, and inflicting genocide on the Yazidis.  ""Had they not become international terrorists and stayed local terrorists, they could have served the original agenda of dividing the Arab east so there would be no Shia crescent,"" says Prof Moussalli. We may never fully understand why IS did it. Perhaps its virulent strain of Salafism just had to keep pushing outwards: ""Remaining and Expanding"". The Islamic State in its original form has been smashed. But for all the reasons that brought it about, IS and everything it represented will still be around in one form or another for a very long time to come.

Spread to US Treasury,Living with Covid plan to restore our freedom - PM,2024-09-25,2022-02-21,By Mary O'Connor & Malu Cursino,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60455943,"Boris Johnson is due to set out his plans to scrap all remaining Covid legal restrictions in England, including the requirement to isolate.  The BBC understands cabinet ministers have agreed to the PM's ""living with Covid plan"" after a delayed meeting. There were reports of tensions between the Treasury and the Department of Health over how parts of the plan will be funded. Some experts have urged caution and Labour queried plans to reduce testing. Mr Johnson is expected to update MPs in the Commons at about 16:30 GMT. The prime minister will then lead a televised No 10 news conference at 19:00 GMT alongside England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser. Speaking before Monday's announcement, Mr Johnson said his plan would bring society ""towards a return to normality"". No 10 said the Covid vaccination programme had put England in a ""strong position to consider lifting the remaining legal restrictions"". It added that the plan for living with Covid would take a ""cautious approach"" retaining ""some surveillance systems and plans for contingency measures"". The legal requirement to self-isolate for a fixed period after testing positive in England has been in place ever since mass testing was rolled out.  Currently positive or asymptomatic people have to isolate for up to 10 days, but can end their isolation earlier if they register negative lateral flow tests on both days five and six. Mr Johnson has said that Covid testing would take place at a ""much lower level"" after revealing £2bn was spent on the system in January alone. Community PCR testing for people with symptoms is expected to stop under the new plan, but it is unclear whether the availability of free lateral flow tests will be reduced. On the issue of changes to testing arrangements, a Welsh government spokesperson said any decision to alter them ""would be premature and reckless"". Earlier, Stormont ministers held talks with Michael Gove, minister for intergovernmental relations, about future funding to fight the Covid pandemic ahead of the PM's announcement. It follows a joint letter from Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford and Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robin Swann warning of the need to keep existing testing in place. Covid is no longer an exceptional threat. Despite the huge wave of infections, the numbers dying in recent months has been similar to what you would expect during a normal winter. Most agree some scaling back is warranted, but it needs to be done carefully. During the pandemic £37 billion has been set aside for test and trace. This is a huge sum - more than has been spent on GP care. Mass PCR testing in the community is almost certain to go. But these gold standard tests will be kept in hospitals to diagnose patients who are seriously ill and to keep an eye out on variants. Many believe the Office for National Statistics surveillance survey can be done on a smaller scale, but it is essential to have something to keep a check on how the virus is spreading.  Read more analysis here. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, who helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, told the BBC's Today programme that ""there isn't a right or wrong answer"" to when restrictions change.  He said: ""If restrictions change this week, next week, or the week after, in six months' time the number of transmission events will likely be very similar."" He added that having a surveillance system - ""an early warning system"" - in place whenever restrictions are eased will be ""critical"".  The government is expected to urge people to exercise their own judgement.  But Prof Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL, told the BBC: ""The worry about lifting the legal restrictions is that we are telling not only our population, but the world, that there is really nothing to worry about, that it's all over when it isn't."" Just over 91% of people in the UK aged 12 and over have had a first dose of a vaccine, 85% a second jab, and 66% a booster or a third dose, according to official data, which has been collated daily since the vaccine rollout began in December 2020. The UK's vaccine advisory body has recommended that an additional Covid booster vaccination should be offered to all adults over the age of 75 and the most vulnerable over-12s this spring. England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are set to accept the advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).  The government has announced it will offer a low-dose Covid vaccine to children aged between five and 11 in England during April. Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have also said they will be offering young children the same vaccine. The prime minister's announcement will come a day after Buckingham Palace revealed the Queen, 95, had tested positive for Covid. The new Covid plans would also see councils in England become responsible for managing outbreaks using existing powers. The Office for National Statistics infection survey, which randomly tests a sample of the population, is also expected to be replaced with a slimmed down surveillance programme. On Sunday, the UK recorded another 25,696 new infections and a further 74 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test - although Sunday figures do tend to be among the lowest of any typical week. Amid concerns that payments for people off sick due to Covid will come to an end, Wes Streeting said ""now is not the time to start charging for tests or weaken sick pay"". He said he was ""particularly concerned"" about the end of free testing and described such a move as ""like being 2-1 up with 10 minutes left of play and subbing your best defender"". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, said infections need to fall further before the rules were relaxed. ""It does appear as if the government is trying to pretend that Covid doesn't exist in the day-to-day lives of so many people,"" he told the BBC. Several scientists and clinicians - including Prof Anthony Costello, Dr Kit Yates and Prof  Christina Pagel - have signed an open letter to Sir Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance, urging them to ""clarify the extent to which the planned policies are consistent with scientific advice and what specifically that scientific advice contained"".  Plan B measures - introduced in December to stem the spread of the Omicron variant - including the requirement to wear masks in public places and the use of Covid passes for large events, were abolished in England last month.  Throughout the pandemic, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have moved at different speeds in introducing or relaxing restrictions. In Northern Ireland, all remaining Covid measures - such as certificates in nightclubs, face coverings, and limits on gatherings in homes - stopped being legally binding on Tuesday. Wales is currently at alert level zero, its lowest level of Covid rules.  In Scotland, legislation covering face coverings and vaccine passports had been due to expire next Monday but earlier this month ministers extended it for another six months.

The paper says it is ""no wonder that public compliance is falling"" when ""no evidence is produced to justify"" pubs and restaurants having to close at 22:00 BST.  It's a view shared by the Daily Telegraph, which says the curfew is failing in its objective of keeping people apart and slowing the growth of the virus. In its editorial pages, the paper says it's ""exasperating"" for many of Boris Johnson's supporters that there is no sign that the government is about to change course.  ""Time to axe 10pm curfew"" is the headline in the Daily Mail, which says pressure is growing to ditch a policy that simply forces crowds onto the streets. Police, scientists and politicians have joined forces to call for Mr Johnson to rethink it, the paper says. It reports that only 3% of coronavirus outbreaks investigated by Public Health England were due to people gathering in bars and restaurants. The Sun says it ""wouldn't mind so much if there was solid evidence"" that the curfew and other ""draconian curbs"" were cutting infections. It says what these ""freedom-destroying edicts do most successfully is induce panic, seen in the idiotic stripping of loo roll from supermarket shelves"". Mr Johnson is facing a ""Red Wall revolt"" by Conservative MPs in traditional Labour constituencies over the latest measures, according to the Daily Mail.  It says with 16 million Britons now under ""draconian"" restrictions, his own MPs are calling it a ""national lockdown by default"".  Even if the government placates its backbenchers in the short term, it is unlikely to quell broader anxiety about its coronavirus strategy, according to the Spectator. The magazine detects growing unease about the direction in which ministers are going with lockdowns. It says usually supportive MPs have made it clear the government needs to subject itself to more scrutiny if it is to maintain the backing of its MPs.  The Times says Tory backbenchers have accused the prime minister of ""ruling by decree"" with the creation of new coronavirus offences - prompting comparisons with George Orwell's dystopian novel, 1984.  It is also calling for an ""overhaul"" of government structures to improve long-term decision-making for the duration of the pandemic - including the appointment of a minister with specific responsibility for test and trace. The Times's leading article says the government ""keeps getting caught out by problems that ought to have been foreseeable"". A test and trace minister, it argues, could ""mobilise"" resources across departments and ""ensure that sufficient testing capacity is made available where and when it is needed"". Affluent millennials and holidaymakers are ""driving the second wave"" of coronavirus infections, according to the latest data reported in the Daily Telegraph.  The analysis - by the Office For National Statistics - found cases were rising fastest among wealthy under-35s whose infection rate has more than quadrupled since the end of July.  The paper says the figures suggest the introduction of the so-called ""rule-of-six"" may do little to stop the spread of the virus.        The paper leads with the shortage of flu vaccine across parts of the UK, raising fears that pensioners may face delays in getting the jab this winter. It says the shortfall leaves ""swathes of the most vulnerable with no immediate prospect of a jab, despite a government promise that they would be at the front of the queue"". The Guardian is one of the papers to carry a photograph of Su Bushby and her late partner Matt Ratana - the police officer who was killed at a custody suite in south London - who she described on Monday as a ""gentle giant"".  On its front page, the Sun carries a photograph of the suspected gunman, Louis De Zoysa, taken some years ago as he posed with a 5ft medieval sword. There are signs that European negotiators are inching closer to agreeing a trade deal with the UK, according to the Times. It says Brussels ""is understood to have dropped its demand for the two sides to reach a broad agreement on all the outstanding areas of dispute"" and negotiators have indicated they are prepared to press ahead with writing the joint legal text of a deal. Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox Many US papers have been considering how the revelations about Donald Trump's tax returns might affect the forthcoming presidential election. The Los Angeles Times is of the view that they won't have a huge impact on a race that has remained ""remarkably stable despite numerous developments that might have altered it - a worldwide pandemic... a recession, wildfires consuming the West and widespread protests for racial justice"". The paper says the revelations ""may not dampen enthusiasm for Trump among his most ardent supporters, who have brushed off outrage after outrage for years"". Nearly three-quarters of US voters plan to watch the first debate between the presidential rivals Donald Trump and Joe Biden tomorrow, according to a poll reported in the Washington Post. The paper says that up to 11% of the electorate are either still unsure of how they will vote or might yet switch sides - suggesting the debates could play a pivotal role in the election.  And finally, the Times is among a number of papers to report that Britain is facing another potential diplomatic row over the return of a cultural treasure. This time though, it's not a dispute over the Elgin Marbles, but a fossilised shark's tooth. It was given to Prince George last week by Sir David Attenborough who came across the fossil on holiday in Malta in the 1960s. Under Maltese law, fossils are considered objects of ""cultural heritage"" and the country's culture minister now wants to see its return. "
Spread to US Treasury,Why Trump's UK visit will be unlike any other,2024-09-25,2018-07-08,By James Landale,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44739152,"Donald Trump's trip to the UK will be the 12th by a US president. But this working, not state, visit is expected to be different to those that have gone before. In 1977 Jimmy Carter came to Britain on his first overseas trip as president. His main aim was to attend the G7 summit in London, but he also chose to visit Newcastle. The city had taken part in a scheme designed to build bridges between the United States and the rest of the world. So the newly elected leader of the free world decided to conduct his first act of global diplomacy from a podium outside the concrete splendour of Newcastle Civic Centre.  He was given the freedom of the city by the mayor. And when the peanut farmer from Georgia stepped up to the microphone, he greeted an adoring crowd of 20,000 people thus: ""Howay the lads! I am grateful to be a Geordie now."" The local newspaper, the Chronicle, reported: ""They packed the airport. They packed the streets. They packed the area outside the Civic Centre and they opened their arms to him. And he loved it. A great smile spread across his face... as he was greeted by crowds waving both the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes."" This was how it used to be: British crowds cheering US presidents.   When JFK came in 1961, half a million people lined the route between London airport and the west end to catch a glimpse of him and his wife Jackie Kennedy. The scale of the public adulation was in part due to the fact that US presidents enjoyed great popularity in Britain: they were political show business and our closest allies in recent wars.  They also came to the UK more rarely. The first president to visit was Woodrow Wilson in 1918 during the post-World War One peace talks. But it was not for another 27 years - and after another world war - that a second US president came to our shores, in 1945.  And all Harry S Truman did was visit King George VI on a naval cruiser anchored in Plymouth harbour. Dwight D Eisenhower did not come until 1959. So, only three presidential visits in 40 years. Lyndon Johnson never came, nor did Gerald Ford. US presidents also enjoyed a warm relationship with the Royal Family. Eisenhower was a particular favourite of the Queen, who invited him to stay at Balmoral - the only president to do so.  Like Donald Trump, ""Ike"" also owned property in Scotland: not a golf course but an apartment at Culzean Castle on the Ayrshire coast which had been given to him by the owners, in recognition of his role as supreme allied commander during World War Two. Ronald Reagan also got on well with the Queen, who in 1982 personally invited him to stay at Windsor Castle and go for a ride in the Great Park. In 1994, Bill and Hillary Clinton were honoured with a sleepover on board the royal yacht Britannia in Portsmouth.  In 2003 George Bush spent the night at Buckingham Palace - the first president to do so since Wilson in 1918. In contrast, Donald Trump is expected to get a cup of tea when he passes through Windsor on Friday. Nor may President Trump receive quite the same political welcome as his predecessors. He will not attend cabinet as Bill Clinton did in 1997 shortly after Tony Blair was first elected prime minister. He will not get to flip burgers in the Downing Street garden or address both houses of parliament, as President Obama did in 2011.  Instead, he will make do with a short visit to the prime minister's country residence, Chequers, like Richard Nixon in 1970. This will be very much a working visit.  A full state visit may have been offered but there is no date in the diary for when it may happen. Of course, presidential visits do not always go smoothly. There was a private diplomatic row in 1982 when the White House delayed replying to the Queen's invitation to Ronald Reagan to stay at Windsor because his wife Nancy's astrologer was worried about overseas travel.  In 1997 I watched as Bill Clinton's long motorcade was divided in two when London's Tower Bridge was opened to allow through a Thames sailing barge - much to the consternation of the security men.  And in 1977, after a banquet at Buckingham Palace, President Carter decided to bid farewell to the Queen Mother by kissing her full on the lips, something that apparently had not happened since King George VI died in 1952. ""I took a sharp step backwards,"" she recalled later. ""Not quite far enough."" So huge efforts will be made to ensure that President Trump's trip goes smoothly. Many demonstrations have been planned, but the huge security operation surrounding his progress from London to Chequers to Windsor to Scotland - largely by air - means that he may not get too close to the protests.  Much harder to cover up will be the fundamental policy differences between the US and British governments.  Since Donald Trump took office, Theresa May has publicly disagreed with him over his decision to impose trade tariffs, abandon the Iran nuclear deal, move the US embassy to Jerusalem, order a Muslim travel ban and retweet anti-Muslim messages from a British far-right group.  British ministers and officials will do their best to welcome Mr Trump but even they are now talking about the need to respect the office of the presidency rather than the current incumbent as an individual. So the president's trip this week will test a relationship that has recently become much harder to keep special."
Spread to US Treasury,US jobs creation surges as recovery gains steam,2024-09-25,2021-04-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56616636,"The US economy saw a surge in hiring in March as vaccination increased, officials eased restrictions and people pushed to return to their pre-pandemic activities. Employers added more than 900,000 jobs driven by re-openings at restaurants, bars, construction sites and schools. The gains were the biggest since August and helped lower the unemployment rate to 6% from 6.2% in February. However, overall employment remains far lower than before the Covid pandemic. Speaking on Friday, US President Joe Biden said people must remain vigilant when it comes to taking precautions against coronavirus. He said that millions have not yet been vaccinated and that many parts of the economy hit by closures remain weak. ""I plead with you, don't give back the progress we've all fought so hard to achieve,"" Mr Biden said. ""We need to finish this job. We need every American to buckle down and keep their guard up."" ""That's how we're going to beat the virus and cast off the weight of the pandemic that's holding our economy back."" The US lost more than 20 million jobs last spring as the virus led to widespread lockdowns. It has regained more than half, but the number of jobs is still more than 8 million down from February 2020, the US Labor Department said. In response to the crisis, Washington has approved trillions of dollars in recovery aid, including a $1.9tn (£1.4tn) package last month that contained $1,400 stimulus cheques for many Americans, extended unemployment benefits, and funded the re-opening of schools. Analysts are expecting a strong rebound later this year, as families emerge from lockdowns with pent-up demand and, in many cases, savings put away during the pandemic. Estimates suggest the growth rate in 2021 could hit 6% or higher. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said she is hopeful that near full employment could return next year. ""The better than expected 916,000 rebound in non-farm payrolls in March still leaves employment 8.4 million below its pre-pandemic peak from just over a year ago, but with the vaccination program likely to reach critical mass within the next couple of months and the next round of fiscal stimulus providing a big boost, there is finally real light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. The jobs report showed nearly every sector in the economy adding positions in March.  More people entered the labour force, encouraged by the signs of rebound, and jobless rates fell for most groups.  Officials also said employers added 156,000 more jobs in January and February than previous estimated. ""The broader re-opening of the economy, growing optimism that the end of the pandemic is in sight and a reversal of last month's unseasonably cold weather generated broad gains in hiring,"" Wells Fargo economist Sarah House said.  ""While there is still a lot of ground to make up, the labour market is on track for a relatively quick recovery,"" she added."
Spread to US Treasury,Calls for hospitality support after 'bleak Friday',2024-09-25,2021-12-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-59710432,"Talks on further support for Scottish businesses are set to take place as firms feel the pinch on what should be their busiest weekend of the year. The UK government is due to hold a Cobra meeting including leaders of the devolved administrations, who want more money for measures to tackle Omicron. The Scottish government has already said bars and restaurants will receive a £66m support package. But hospitality bosses say this would not cover even a few days' losses. The sum was a share of a £100m package from the Scottish government's budget, which also covered the food and drink supply chain, the cultural sector and the wedding sector. Stephen Montgomery, of the Scottish Hospitality Group, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme he had visited a number of hospitality venues on Friday night, and there was a noticeable drop in footfall. He said: ""It was a bit unreal, it was quieter than what we'd expect for what would traditionally have been 'black Friday' - which we're calling 'bleak Friday'.  ""This is the time of year when we would normally take 30-35% of our annual turnover to see us through January-February time and the last reports we've had in since the Public Health Scotland message came out on Thursday of last week, we're probably seeing a big impound of turnover lost in Scotland through this."" On the £100m funding from the Scottish government, Mr Montgomery said the hospitality industry's share was ""a lot short"" as they had expected an 80:20 split. He said: ""It wouldn't even cover one or two days of loss of turnover for some people, it certainly wouldn't cover the wages for one week.  ""We'll take it, of course we will, but there has got to be some ongoing talks between the UK and Scottish governments - put all political differences aside and get this sorted out."" The Scottish government has made repeated calls for more money from the UK government - a phone call involving Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson took place on Friday. Earlier this week the Treasury announced £220m of immediate funding, but Scottish ministers say this had been brought forward from next year and had already been budgeted for. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes told the BBC that ""tentative"" conversations were being held with the Treasury and she was making the case for funds ""on every front"". Ms Forbes said she has quoted £500m in the Scottish government's request, a figure based on the monthly costs of furlough and grants. She said: ""The UK government can make the substantial funds available almost over night because they access borrowing from the market and ultimately we need the UK government to deliver on the requests made by the Welsh and Scottish governments. ""Ultimately this is about helping businesses right now that are struggling, but also knowing that when we need more support - because none of us can absolutely for definite know how this variant is going to play out - we know that we can access additional support for businesses."" On Friday, the UK government's Chancellor Rishi Sunak met business leaders for crisis talks, as firms warned of lost bookings. Mr Sunak has said that it is ""a difficult time for the hospitality industry"" but there were existing support measures in place to help the industry. Dr Christine Tait-Burkhard - an expert in infection and immunity at Edinburgh University - told the BBC that Omicron could be slowed down but not stopped.  She pointed to advice from the UK government's scientific advisory group, Sage, which said if we want to stop the spread we should go back to limiting indoor hospitality and indoor meetings. She said nightclubs and other large events could be shut down after Christmas to slow the spread. Nightclubs were closed in Scotland for 16 months at the start of the pandemic and reopened in August.  Dr Tait-Burkhard said: ""What we've seen with Omicron is it's very good at spreading in close-contact, large settings… that means certain businesses such as nightclubs are indeed a really good place where the virus can spread easily.   ""We have seen Wales closing down nightclubs after Christmas. It is a good potential that that might happen in Scotland as well alongside large events."" Live music venues have already warned they risk permanent closure if no bailout is forthcoming. On Saturday, 5,917 new cases of Covid were reported - accounting for 12.2% of PCR tests - however, Public Health Scotland said results were being reported more slowly due to the high volume of tests being taken, meaning the true number of Covid cases was likely to be higher. Nicola Sturgeon warned on Friday that Omicron was now the dominant strain of the virus and a ""tsunami"" was beginning to hit Scotland. New guidance for shops, hospitality venues and other businesses was introduced on Friday, in a bid to stem the transmission of Covid. David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said there were ""early and worrying indications to suggest shopper footfall has plunged even further in Scotland's city centre locations over recent days"" following the first minister's advice for the public to stay at home as much as possible.  He said it was a ""crucial"" trading time for shops, and that if the further downturn persisted then the government should be prepared to support the retail sector with further financial aid.  ""The sector provides 230,000 jobs directly in Scotland and is vital to the health of our high streets and city centres,"" he added.  On Saturday, Braehead shopping centre in Renfrewshire said the malls had been ""busy"", with ""a stream of socially-distanced shoppers"" taking advantage of the last weekend to shop before Christmas.

Spread to US Treasury,European Union seals borders amid virus fight,2024-09-25,2020-03-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51927790,"The EU is banning travellers from outside the bloc for 30 days in an unprecedented move to seal its borders amid the coronavirus crisis. The measure is expected to apply to 26 EU states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. UK citizens will be unaffected. The ban came as deaths continued to soar in Italy and Spain, and France began a strict lockdown. Europe has been badly hit by the virus, which has killed 7,500 globally. More than 185,000 people have been infected worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Meanwhile, the Euro 2020 football competition has been postponed by a year. The travel ban will affect all non-EU nationals from visiting the bloc, except long-term residents, family members of EU nationals and diplomats, cross-border and healthcare workers, and people transporting goods. Free travel is a cherished principle within the European border-free Schengen area. But in recent days many countries have unilaterally imposed full or partial border shutdowns in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus. This prompted the commission to propose that the bloc act in a more unified fashion and restrict entry to the union as a whole, at the urging of French President Emmanuel Macron. The measures were agreed in a video-summit between EU leaders on Tuesday afternoon and will now have to be implemented by member states. ""They said they will immediately do that,"" said EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at a press conference. ""This is good, so that we have a unanimous and united approach [where] the external borders are concerned."" The UK and the Republic of Ireland - which is part of the EU but not Schengen - will be invited to join the measure. It was also crucial that the EU ""unblocks the situation"" with regards to closed internal borders, Mrs Von der Leyen said, because ""too many people are stranded"". In France, citizens who leave home must now carry a document detailing the reasons why, with fines for transgressors to be set at €135 ($150; £123). It comes after President Macron put the country on a war-footing, ordering the population to stay at home and only go out for essential trips. The number of confirmed cases in France grew by more than 16% on Tuesday, reaching 7,730, The death toll rose to 175, with 7% of the dead aged under 65. More than 2,500 people are being treated in hospital, including 699 in intensive care. In Britain, where the death toll is 71, people have been told to avoid social contact, work from home if they can and avoid all non-essential foreign travel.  The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has unveiled a financial package worth £330bn ($400bn) to ease the burden caused by the virus, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday urged people to avoid pubs, clubs and cafes. Meanwhile, the government's chief scientific adviser said it would be a ""good outcome"" if 20,000 or fewer people died of the virus in the UK. The latest set of Brexit talks has also been delayed. The number of confirmed cases in Spain has soared by 2,000 to 11,178. Authorities there are maintaining a partial lockdown on 47 million people. It is now the European country worst-affected after Italy. At midnight Spain began stopping cars crossing its borders from France and Portugal. Only Spanish nationals, residents and cross-border workers were being allowed to enter the country. Italy, which has registered the most cases outside China at more than 31,500, announced another surge in deaths on Tuesday, from 2,150 to 2,503. The country remains in lockdown. The government, meanwhile, is set to renationalise flag carrier airline Alitalia with a rescue package worth $670m (£550m). Germany, which has had more than 8,000 confirmed cases and 13 deaths, banned religious services and told people to cancel any domestic or foreign holiday travel.  Venues including clubs, bars, leisure facilities, zoos and playgrounds will be closed. Schools are already shut. Ireland could have 15,000 cases of coronavirus before the end of March, said PM Leo Varadkar. In a St Patrick's Day address, he warned of ""significant and lasting"" economic damage, and said the emergency could last into the summer. The government has already closed pubs, schools and universities.  Elsewhere in Europe: Iran remains the world's third-worst-affected nation, after China and Italy. More than 16,000 people are confirmed as infected and 988 have died, although some analysts believe the figures are far higher than officially reported. A spokesman for the judiciary said on Tuesday that 85,000 prisoners, including political prisoners, had been temporarily released to try to combat the spread. Gholamhossein Esmaili did not say when or how those freed would be returned to prison, but stressed that only prisoners serving five years or less had been released. Most shops and restaurants remain open but the health ministry has urged people to stay at home. In the US, the White House is working on a economic stimulus package reported to be worth some $850bn, with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin saying the administration was ""looking at sending cheques to Americans immediately"". The total number of cases has risen to above 6,300, with 108 deaths. Most cases are in the states of New York (1,708), Washington (1,013) and California (718).

Spread to US Treasury,Why has Wales chosen a national lockdown?,2024-09-25,2020-10-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-54616580,"Pembrokeshire in the far west of Wales has one of the lowest case rates for coronavirus in the whole of the UK, at 43.7 per 100,000 people. It is ranked just 353rd out of 377 UK local authority areas, and is only beaten by Ceredigion for having the lowest rate in Wales. Jump across to Cardiff and the picture is very different. The rate is more than six times higher at 283.7 cases per 100,000, the highest in Wales, and it has one of the fastest rising rates in the UK. A lockdown in these circumstances makes sense, right? But - and it is a big ""but"" to some - even looking at the statistics in places like Cardiff, Merthyr and Wrexham, Wales is facing nowhere near the same infection rates as some other areas of the UK. In fact, in a table of the four nations, it comes fourth. So come Friday evening, why are Welsh residents going back into near-total ""firebreak"" lockdown, and not English, or Scottish? The answer to that question could be as simple as this: that the Welsh Government say it is choosing to ""follow the science"" - or at least, the same scientific advice given to the UK government that it is not currently following. A majority of Senedd members backed the firebreak lockdown in a vote on Tuesday evening - 37 for to 16 against. But the Conservative party group opposed the motion with leader Paul Davies saying they had an ""open mind"", but that the Welsh Government had failed to justify its new measures. The crucial guidance has come from the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (TAC), which itself follows and is consistent with the recommendations from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), available to all four UK administrations. This is how it works. Back in the summer, ministers and advisors in Wales set out a number of what they called circuit-breakers - markers or warning signs for different values such as the number of intensive care beds occupied or the reproduction (R) rate of the virus in the community. If these circuit-breaker indicators passed a certain agreed level, it would be a sign that the virus was reaching a potentially dangerous level of circulation that could lead to the NHS being unable to cope with the number of cases. If enough circuit-breakers in different settings like the community or in hospitals were breached, the government would take measures to bring the case numbers back down. There are six main circuit-breakers. Two in the community have been breached already - the Wales-wide case rate and the positivity rate (the percentage of tests coming back positive) - and one in hospital settings, which is the number of people in critical care beds. Of the remaining indicators, one has nearly been breached, a second is believed to have been, and the third is rising. The TAC Fire Break briefing document says: ""There is a reasonable likelihood that if we do not act now, we will need to take further, more expensive and longer action in the future to achieve a similar reduction. The scale of the negative impact on the NHS in Wales is growing by the day."" It adds: ""If schools are to remain open, then a wide range of other measures will be required."" There are four main measures recommended by Sage while still allowing schools to remain open: Basically, each measure individually may make a small difference, but as a group they will do enough to dampen down the spread of Covid, the experts argue. Although Pembrokeshire residents might complain that they are not affected badly, the fact is the virus rates are rising everywhere in Wales. By keeping people at home and local to their area, it will help protect those areas which are not currently as hard-hit, benefitting everyone in the longer term. This is Vaughan Gething's argument. Speaking on Newsnight, the Welsh health minister argued that evidence showed the virus was ""seeded"" in all communities across the country. ""The action we're taking benefits all parts of Wales and helps to reduce the intensity of transmission to get the R figure below one and that should then give us the ability to have a different pattern of living here in Wales through the rest of the winter,"" he said. ""We're tracking the reasonable worst case scenario and, without action, that would lead to 6,000 winter deaths, and all this despite widespread local restrictions we have had in place which have made in themselves a substantial contribution to reducing the spread of coronavirus."" So why do places like Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion have to be included? ""We've seen that a patchwork approach only gets you so far,"" he said. ""We've seen the difficulty in arguing a whole range of different exclusions and the figures and the advice don't suggest that those areas on their own are going to be secure without other measures."" And the TAC briefing agrees with him. ""The firebreak will have to reduce the national R (latest between 1.1 - 1.4) to below 0.9. ""This implies that R will need to be reduced in all areas of Wales, which requires a national approach rather than the current locally driven approach through Local Health Protection Areas (LPHAs) [local county-wide lockdowns]."" Data from mobile phones showing how people are moving around, including Facebook mobility, and requests for directions on Apple and Google, unsurprisingly showed a rapid fall in travel in March and April after the start of the UK-wide national lockdown. In Wales, the figures started climbing again over the summer, although they did not reach pre-lockdown levels in some categories. However, following the introduction of local lockdowns, data up to 2 October showed a dip in travel levels in most areas affected by local lockdowns. Overall travel in Wales is down nine percentage points, a higher fall than other areas of the UK, suggesting the lockdowns are making a difference to people's behaviour. The national stay-at-home and exercise-locally message coming in on Friday would be expected to bring this down further. Lockdowns albeit local lockdowns are starting to be announced in countries across Europe as figures show the rate of diagnosed cases of Covid 19 increases. The Welsh Conservatives, in step with their UK party in Westminster, favour a more regional approach.  They point to areas such as Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, where rates are relatively low and ask why do businesses and livelihoods need to be affected there? This type of approach is being used in England - where there is a tiered system, with those living in tier one facing limited restrictions, and those in tier three the highest.  However, unlike Wales where the firebreak lasts two weeks, tier three areas of England, such as Manchester, Liverpool and Nottingham could be subject to restrictions for 28 days or more. In September, Plaid Cymru called for micro-quarantines to avoid a second national lockdown.  This could have seen towns locked down where there had been a cluster, rather than whole local authority areas - such as what happened in Llanelli. Whereas Wales' firebreak is two weeks, the Republic of Ireland's 4.9m residents face similar restrictions for up to six weeks in their national lockdown. In Gwynedd, which had avoided a county-wide lockdown, people in Criccieth have had a mixed reaction. One mother said of her children: ""How are we supposed to let them go to school but then they're not allowed to go outside and play with their friends after? ""It just doesn't make any sense."" However she added: ""I just hope that people listen [to the advice] this time because clearly they didn't the first time. ""Now we're going into second lockdown, they really need to start listening."" Another woman told BBC Wales: ""It's just something we've got to do if we're going to help other people. Everybody's got to do their bit. We've just got to cope."" However Jules Lee, a tattooist from Bangor, fears her business might not survive this second lockdown. ""We put things in place, we complied with the rules and that's why I think we should be allowed to work,"" she said. ""When we come out of the lockdown, it will be difficult to recover."""
Spread to US Treasury,How invasion plunged Iraq into decades of chaos,2024-09-25,2023-03-20,By Jeremy Bowen,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-64976144,"The invasion of March 2003 was a catastrophe for Iraq and its people.  More proof of that, measured in broken lives, was at a suspected site of a mass grave in the desert outside Sinjar, not far from the border with Syria.  Survivors of one of Iraq's damaged communities, the Yazidis, looked on as the earth in a marble quarry was excavated. On a wire fence around the site were photos of dozens of people, mostly men, who had been killed by jihadists from the Islamic State group. They were from Zile-li, a village near the quarry, where 1,800 men were taken and killed on 3 August 2014.  The Yazidis revere both the Quran and the Bible; their religion is influenced by both Christianity and Islam. Islamic State considered them to be infidels and carried out a genocidal assault. It happened after the Americans and British had ended their occupation, but a direct line links the massacre to the invasion, and the disastrous years that followed.  Among those watching the excavation was Naif Jasso, the Sheikh of Kocho, a Yazidi community that suffered an even worse attack than Zile-li. He said that in Kocho, 517 people out of a population of 1,250 were killed by jihadists from IS, also known as ISIS or Daesh.  In Zile-li, men were separated from their families at gunpoint and shot dead at the quarry. Sofian Saleh, who was 16 at the time, was among the crowd at the excavation. He is one of only two men from Zile-li who survived. As he waited for death with his father, brother and 20 to 30 other men, he saw another group shot dead. Their bodies tumbled down a cliff into the quarry. Then it was their turn.  ""They tied our hands from behind before the shooting. They took us and threw us on the ground,"" he said.  Sofian's father and brother were killed, but he survived because bodies fell on him, covering him up.  Islamic State was using its favourite tactic. First, they killed the men, then took the women as slaves. Children were removed from their mothers to be indoctrinated as IS recruits. A mother sitting near the suspected grave wept as she remembered the baby ripped from her and given to a jihadist family.  Next to the wire fence around the site, Suad Daoud Chatto, a woman in her 20s, stood with a poster. On it were the faces of nine men from her extended family who were killed, and two missing female relatives. She said jihadists captured her in 2014 when she was 16, along with many other women and girls, and held her in Syria. She remained until 2019, when she was rescued as the Caliphate collapsed.  ""They were like barbarians, they kept us in handcuffs for a long time. Our hands were still tied even during the meals,"" she said. ""They married me off many times… they were marrying the slaves. They did not spare anyone. We were all raped. They were killing people before our eyes. They killed all the Yazidi men - they killed eight of my uncles. They destroyed many families."" In the end, only a few bags of human bones were found at the site. Dozens of others are still to excavated.  By the time IS rampaged through Iraq in the summer of 2014, the US and the UK had ended their occupation. Jihadist ideology existed long before the invasion, and had inspired the 9/11 attacks.  But far from destroying the ideology of Osama Bin Laden and the jihadist extremists, the years of chaos and brutality set off in 2003 turbo-charged murderous jihadist violence. Al-Qaeda, broken for a while by an alliance between the Americans and Sunni tribes, regenerated into the even more barbarous IS.  Iraq is more stable so far this year than it has been for a long while. Baghdad, Mosul and other cities are much safer. But Iraqis feel the results of the invasion every day. Its consequences have shaped and blighted millions of lives and changed their country profoundly.   It is a grim irony that the invasion has dropped out of political and public debate in the US, which conceived and led it, and in the UK, its closest ally in the coalition. The Americans and British bear a heavy responsibility for what happened after the invasion, and its consequences also affect them.  Iraq's tyrant, Saddam Hussein, was well worth overthrowing - he had imprisoned and killed thousands of Iraqis, even using chemical weapons against rebellious Kurds. The problem was how it was done, the way the US and UK ignored international law, and the violence that gripped Iraq after the Bush administration failed to make a plan to fill the power vacuum created by regime change.  The past 20 years since the invasion, coming on top of Saddam's dictatorship, add up to almost half a century of torture for the Iraqi people.   Even for those who were there, it is hard to recreate the febrile atmosphere of ""fear, power and hubris"", as one historian put it recently, that gripped the US in the 18 months between al-Qaeda's 9/11 attacks in 2001 and the invasion of Iraq.  I was in New York a few days after the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were destroyed, as F-15 jets patrolled above Manhattan. It was a visible demonstration of American force, as the biggest military power on the planet worked out how to respond.  The shock of the attacks swiftly produced George W Bush's declaration of ""war on terror"" against al-Qaeda and its jihadist fellow travellers. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair chartered Concorde to cross the Atlantic to offer support. He believed Britain's best guarantee of influence in the world was to stay close to the White House.  They moved fast against al-Qaeda's network in Afghanistan. Before the end of the year, a US-led coalition removed the Taliban regime from power when it refused to give up al-Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden. Kabul was not enough for America.  President Bush and his advisors saw a global threat to the US. They thought states that opposed them could make deadly alliances with al-Qaeda and its imitators. The biggest target in their sights was Iraq. Saddam Hussein had been a thorn in America's side ever since he sent his army into Kuwait in 1990. Without any evidence, the Americans tried to manufacture a link between Saddam and al-Qaeda when none existed. In reality the Iraqi leader, a secular dictator, saw religious extremists as a threat. The president's father, George HW Bush, decided not to remove Saddam from power in Baghdad after the Iraqi occupiers were driven out of Kuwait by an international coalition assembled by the US in 1991. The first President Bush and his advisors saw trouble ahead if they continued to Baghdad. A long, belligerent occupation of Iraq looked like a morass and they had no UN authorisation to topple the regime.  I was in Baghdad when the ceasefire was declared. Regime officials I knew could not believe that Saddam's dictatorship had survived.  Twelve years later, by 2003, America's rage and arrogance of power blinded the second President Bush to the realities that had constrained his father. When the US and UK could not persuade the UN Security Council to pass a resolution explicitly authorising invasion and regime change, Messrs Bush and Blair claimed earlier resolutions gave them the authority they needed.  Among many who did not buy their argument was the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In a BBC interview 18 months after the invasion, he said it was ""not in conformity"" with the UN Charter - in other words, illegal. France and other Nato allies refused to join the invasion. Tony Blair ignored huge protests in the UK. His decision to go to war dogged the rest of his political career.  No president or prime minister faces a bigger decision than going to war. George Bush and Tony Blair embarked on a war of choice that killed hundreds of thousands of people. The justifications for the invasion were soon shown to be untrue. The weapons of mass destruction that Tony Blair insisted, eloquently, made Saddam a clear and present danger, turned out not to exist. It was a failure not just of intelligence but of leadership.   The Americans called the huge air raids that started their offensive ""shock and awe"". Neo-conservatives around George W Bush deluded themselves that democracy, and regional stability, could be imposed through the barrel of a gun. Overwhelming US force would not just safeguard America, it would stabilise the Middle East too, and democracy would spread through Syria, Iran and beyond, like a good virus.   Saddam was removed within weeks. Iraqis were in no mood to be grateful. In Saddam's last decade as leader, the vast majority of them had been impoverished by sanctions authorised by the UN, but driven hardest by the US and UK. The Americans, the British and their allies were unable to bring peace to the streets. Nightmarish years started with wholesale looting, revenge attacks and crime.  An insurgency against the occupation turned into a sectarian civil war. Iraqis turned against each other as the Americans imposed a system of government that split power along ethnic and sectarian lines - between the country's three main groups, Shia Muslims, Kurds and Sunni Muslims. Armed militias fought each other, the occupiers, and killed each other's civilians.  Jihadist groups moved in to exploit the chaos and kill foreigners. Before the Americans managed to kill him, a brutal Sunni extremist from Jordan, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, targeted attacks to turn the insurgency against the occupation into a sectarian civil war. Shia death squads retaliated with their own reign of terror.  No-one knows exactly how many Iraqis have died as a result of the 2003 invasion. Estimates are all in the hundreds of thousands. The tide of violent sectarianism continues to rumble around the Middle East.  The geopolitical legacy of the invasion is still shaping events. Unwittingly, the Americans turned the balance of power in Iraq in Iran's favour by overthrowing Saddam Hussein, who was considered a Sunni bulwark against the Islamic Republic. Removing him empowered Shia politicians who were close to Tehran. Militias armed and trained by Iran are among the most powerful forces in Iraq and have representatives in government.  The US and UK's fear of causing another disaster hamstrung their response to the Arab uprisings of 2011, and especially the war against his own people launched by President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.  Disorder in Iraq, where the population is growing fast, fuels the trade in people-smuggling to Europe. According to the British Home Office, Iraqis are the fourth largest national group crossing the English Channel in small boats. The UK Refugee Council says the vast majority whose cases have been processed are granted asylum as refugees.  American and British leaders do not dwell on the invasion these days, but others have not forgotten. One reason why much of the global south stayed neutral after Russia invaded Ukraine, ignoring appeals to uphold international law, was the memory of how the US, the UK and Western allies who joined the coalition ignored it as they steamrollered opposition to their invasion of Iraq.   It is a sign of how bad the past 20 years have been that Saddam nostalgia is well established in Iraq, not just among his own Sunni community. People complain that at least you knew where you were with the old dictator. He was an equal opportunities killer of anyone he saw as an enemy, including his own son-in-law.  In a queue for diesel in a camp near Mosul, a 48-year-old Sunni named Mohammed, raged against the Shia-led government in Baghdad and against the years of sectarian killing that followed the invasion.  ""We wish that Saddam's rule could come back, even for one day. Saddam was a dictator, and it was one man's rule - correct. But he was not killing the people based on whether they were Shia, Sunni, Kurdish, or Yazidi.""  Iraq has signs of hope. Parts of towns and villages are still in ruins, but they feel safer, even though Iraqis still face threats that would be considered a national crisis in the West. Well-trained anti-terrorist units are containing IS jihadist cells, who still manage to carry out bombings and ambushes. Even so, shopkeepers are hoping for a bumper Ramadan, their busiest time of the year.  Longer term, the biggest legacy of the invasion for Iraq might be the political system that the Americans instigated, which divides power along ethnic and sectarian lines. As developed by Iraqi politicians, it has offered prodigious chances for corruption.   Estimates of the amount stolen since 2003 range from $150bn (£124bn) to $320bn (£264bn). Most Iraqis, of all sects, who have not benefited from the bonanza of theft, face constant power cuts, bad water, and inadequate medical care, in hospitals that were once considered to be as good as ones in Europe. Walk down most streets and you will see children working or begging, instead of going to school. Iraq used to have one of the best educational systems in the Middle East. Iraq's latest prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, has promised a new start. His biggest challenge is keeping his promise to tackle corruption, the cancer that is eating the country from within. He even did a broadcast surrounded by piles of confiscated banknotes that were being returned to Iraq's treasury.  But the people that matter most are the innocent victims. Not just the dead, but millions of Iraqis, and others in the Middle East whose lives were made much worse because of the invasion and its consequences.  At the mass grave near Sinjar, Yazidi activists appealed for international protection. Survivors said that the IS jihadists who carried out the genocidal massacres in 2014 had Iraqi accents, some from Tel Afar, a nearby town.  Farhad Barakat, a 25-year-old Yazidi activist who survived because he managed to escape to Mount Sinjar, said they were still scared of their neighbours. The killers, he said, were from their ""surrounding clans or tribes, Arab clans. So how it that possible? The ones who killed us, raped the Yazidi women, they were Iraqis.""

Spread to US Treasury,Welsh firms 'left in the dark' over firebreak,2024-09-25,2020-10-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-54647422,"Business leaders say companies in Wales have been given just hours to finalise plans for the firebreak lockdown. All non-essential businesses will have to shut for two weeks from 18:00 BST on Friday. But the list of the types of business being forced to close was only published on Thursday morning. The Welsh Government said there was only a ""small window"" to act to slow the spread of coronavirus and there were ""no easy options"". The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Wales said the Welsh Government had left it ""far too late in the day"" to provide the detailed information. ""Waiting until the day before the lockdown comes into force does not give businesses the time that they need to prepare,"" said Ben Francis, the FSB Wales policy chair. ""This week should have been spent engaging with staff, contacting suppliers and informing customers, but many firms simply spent this time in the dark."" The federation said it was still fielding questions from its members in Wales who are worried about what they need to do to comply with the lockdown ""Welsh Government needs to take steps to be more responsive to the needs of the business community as we move through the coming weeks, or they risk making an already difficult period even worse for the business community,"" added Mr Francis. The 46-page document setting out the legal rules behind the firebreak lists the type of businesses that must shut, those that can remain open but with limited access, and those that can continue to trade. The FSB said many will be ""incredibly relieved"" to have the rules in black-and-white. Pubs, restaurants and cafes must close for consumption on the premises but takeaway food sales are allowed. Holiday and camping sites, along with hotels and B&Bs, holiday apartments and hostels must also shut - unless a resident cannot move elsewhere, or it is their permanent residence. Places of worship can only open for wedding vows or funerals, and crematoriums for funerals. But there has also been some disquiet expressed by some sectors. The Horticultural Trades Association, which represents businesses such as garden centres, said it was disappointed to learn those areas must shut. ""Back in May, Wales was the first UK administration to take the decision to reopen garden centres and we expected this to be a sign of support for the industry,"" said James Barnes, chair of the association.  ""With no evidence to show why garden centres should be closed, we were crushed to see them included yet again as 'non-essential retail' for this Friday's lockdown."" Traders in Bangor plan on voicing their concerns over the Covid restrictions on Thursday by protesting outside their shops on what is Wales' longest high street. Most of the city has been under a local lockdown since 10 October, following a spike in coronavirus cases. ""Local businesses have seen a huge drop in trade, they've stayed open while customers are being instructed to stay way,"" said Danielle Asquith, who works at a tattoo parlour. ""The message is simple, allow us to work to normal capacity or fund our temporary closure. It is simply not viable to continue the way things are."" Responding to business concerns across Wales, a Welsh Government official said: ""There are no easy options and we recognise this firebreak period will have an impact on businesses at the end of what has been an incredibly difficult year for us all. ""We have doubled the third phase of the Economic Resilience Fund, making nearly £300 million available to support businesses. This phase will open next week and we will work hard to get money out to businesses as quickly as we can."""
Spread to US Treasury,'Once-in-a-lifetime' find of rare Iron Age coins,2024-09-25,2021-07-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-57833958,"Hundreds of rare Iron Age coins have been discovered during a dig on the HS2 route in west London. The hoard of 300 potins, which are an early version of a coin, were found in Hillingdon, following a storm which helped reveal their position. Archaeologists have dated them to the 1st century BC, at a time when the Romans were beginning to establish themselves in Britain. The discovery has been described as a ""once-in-a-lifetime find"". Each of the potins are about 3cm (1.2 in) in diameter and are based on coins struck in Marseille, France, about 2,175 years ago. On one side they show a stylised image of the head of Greek god Apollo, while a charging bull is on the other. Emma Tetlow, historic environment lead for HS2's main contractors Skanska, Costain and Strabag, explained how her team had been ""coming to the end of our archaeological work... when we found a patch of soil that was a very different colour"" following a storm which had altered the ground conditions. ""The patch of soil was dark greeny-blue, which suggests oxidised metal, and when we checked more closely, we could see loosely packed metal discs."" She described the discovery as ""a once-in-a-lifetime find"". The potins, which have been named the ""Hillingdon Hoard"", were taken to Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery to be cleaned and preserved so specialists to investigate them further. Coins were not thought to have been used for the exchange of goods and service at the time and archaeologists believe the hoard may have been used to mark the boundary of a property or was an offering to the gods. Hoards are also thought to have been buried in isolated locations as emergency savings for times of crisis. Potins like these from the late Iron Age like have been found previously but in much smaller quantities meaning this find is considered very significant. The value of the hoard has yet to be determined and a coroner is to decide whether they can be considered ""treasure"", meaning they can be acquired by a museum. Helen Wass, HS2's head of heritage, said the discovery ""provides us with more information about how our ancestors lived and settled in London""."
Spread to US Treasury,PM vows more school catch-up cash in funding row,2024-09-25,2021-06-01,By Sean Coughlan,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-57320450,"The prime minister has promised schools in England there will be more money ""coming down the track"" after catch-up plans were labelled a ""damp squib"". Head teachers had said they were ""hugely disappointed"" by a £1.4bn Covid recovery package, which breaks down to £50 extra per pupil per year. Most of the funding will be for tutoring to make up for lost learning. Boris Johnson said it would ""give parents the confidence"" that their children would be supported. But the plans so far are much more limited than the £13.5bn that the Education Policy Institute (EPI) think tank had calculated would be required to catch up on lessons disrupted by the pandemic. The catch-up plan, with £1.4bn extra over three years in addition to the £1.7bn already announced, will include £1bn for 100 million hours of tutoring and £250m for teacher training and development. Tutoring, often in small groups, will be targeted at those considered most in need of support, particularly the disadvantaged and will not available for all pupils. The EPI, which warned primary pupils had lost up to two months of learning in reading and three months in maths, said the extra funding amounted to £50 per pupil per year - a tenth of what it estimated was needed. Spread over three years, the extra cash is worth about 1% of the annual schools budget, said the EPI. The support was lower than in other countries, said the think tank, with catch-up funding in England, including earlier announcements, worth £310 per pupil over three years, compared with £1,600 in the United States and £2,500 in the Netherlands. Elizabeth, a mother of two from Worcester, welcomed the idea of more help for children in class. ""I want children to be supported in school and extra teachers - and the children split into smaller groups with additional classroom support is always going to be a good thing."" But she does not want children to be put under too much pressure.  ""We don't want to cram in the curriculum, we want children to enjoy learning and not put pressure on pupils or teachers to do more in the school day. ""For my children, the day is long enough - five days a week 9am to 3.30pm. They come home and they are knackered, particularly my eldest who has started high school - there is so much for him to take in and absorb.  ""If the day was extended to 4.30pm they would come home, have their tea, do their homework and there would be very little down-time. ""I did read some of the plans may have included after-school clubs like music, that's a good thing but not to do more curriculum learning.""  There had been reports the recovery plan would be much bigger and include a longer school day - but funding for any further catch-up proposals will now depend on the next spending review. But Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that an extended school day was ""very much still on the agenda"". Asked whether the funding was less than required, Mr Williamson said the catch-up plan was based on the evidence of what works - and that tutoring ""does actually deliver"" and should not be the ""preserve of a few"". He said the £1.4bn was a ""pretty hefty amount"" and would ""have a direct impact on children"". Suggestions of shorter summer holidays were no longer being considered, said the education secretary. The hesitation over plans for an extended school day would not have been seen as much as a loss to sixth formers at St Wilfrid's Catholic school in Crawley, West Sussex. They wanted a return to normality and ""certainty"" after so much upheaval, rather than adding extra hours, which could leave students tired rather than inspired. ""It feels like the pandemic has been constant pressure and uncertainty,"" said Katelan, a Year 12 student. ""The most important thing the government could give us as students is clarity. And clarity early on and not just a few months before we're due to take the exams,"" says Catherine, expecting to take her A-levels next summer. The pupils were ""delighted"" to be back in the classroom in March, rather than relying on online lessons - and if tutoring is going to be provided they want it to be in-person rather than online. The BBC has learned a much bigger and more ambitious plan costing just over £10bn was still under discussion between government departments as recently as last week, but this was rejected by the Treasury.  Sources close to the talks said the Treasury was reluctant to sign off on such a big upfront commitment.  In response, a Whitehall source said: ""It's right for both children and the taxpayer that we know what we're buying before we spend."" The education recovery tsar, Sir Kevan Collins, had previously talked of the importance of extra teaching hours, including for sports, music and the arts. There were reports he had proposed a £15bn recovery package, but he said the tutoring and teacher training announced represented ""evidence-based support to a significant number of our children and teachers"".  But Sir Kevan added that ""more will be needed to meet the scale of the challenge."" Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said the government's response was ""hugely disappointing"" and ""shows a failure to recognise the scale of learning loss"". ""There has obviously been a battle behind the scenes over funding for education recovery,"" said Mr Barton - with a settlement much lower than anticipated. ""Where is the funding for drama and music, sport and skills development?"" asked Mary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union, who added: ""Rarely has so much been promised and so little delivered."" Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the announcement was a ""damp squib"" and ""education recovery cannot be done on the cheap"". But the heads' union leader welcomed that there was no plan to extend the school day, which could have caused ""more harm than good"". Labour's Education Secretary Kate Green said the announcement ""makes a mockery of the prime minister's claim that education is a priority"". Labour's recovery proposals included breakfast clubs and mental health support, as well as tutoring and teacher development. This is not a plan on the scale anyone imagined when the prime minister appointed an adviser, Sir Kevan Collins, to shape bold recovery ideas for England's schools.   In February, Sir Kevan told me in his first interview a broad vision was urgently needed.  From the outset he made clear schools might need extra hours, not just for learning but for sport, music and other activities pupils have missed.   People close to the government talks said that even last week the plans being discussed were ambitious, costing more than £10bn.   But the Treasury, according to these sources, baulked at the cost and honed in on core funding for tutoring which is backed by research evidence.  Schools it seems will have to take their chances, alongside other priorities, in the big spending review this autumn.   Will extra tutoring help your child?

Spread to US Treasury,HS2 rail project to be reviewed,2024-09-25,2019-08-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49420332,"The government is launching a review of high-speed rail link HS2 - with a ""go or no-go"" decision by the end of the year, the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. It will consider whether and how the project to connect London, the Midlands and northern England should proceed. Billions have already been spent, but Mr Shapps refused to rule out scrapping it entirely. He said it was ""responsible"" to see whether the benefits really ""stack up"".  Phase 1 of the development between London and Birmingham is due to open at the end of 2026, with the second phase to Leeds and Manchester scheduled for completion by 2032-33. It is designed to carry trains capable of travelling at 250mph.    When asked about the money already spent on the project, Mr Shapps said: ""Just because you've spent a lot of money on something does not mean you should plough more and more money into it.""   He said ministers were asking the reviewers ""just give us the facts"".   ""Go and find out all the information that's out there… genuinely what it would cost to complete this project, and then we'll be in a much better position to make that decision - go or no-go by the end of the year."" The review will be chaired by Douglas Oakervee, a civil engineer and former chair of HS2 Ltd. Lord Berkeley, another civil engineer who worked on the construction of the Channel Tunnel, will act as his deputy. The Labour peer has previously been critical of the project.  A final report will be sent to the government in the autumn.  During the Conservative Party leadership campaign Boris Johnson said he would not scrap plans for the new rail link, but did express ""anxieties about the business case"". In July, the current chairman of the project reportedly warned that the total cost could rise by another £30bn - up from the current budget of £56bn. Labour peer Lord Adonis, a former transport secretary who worked as an infrastructure adviser to Theresa May, said the review was ""as stupid as you can get"" and would ""screw Birmingham and the North"". He tweeted that it would become ""a massive bun fight, while the transport department runs for cover and HS2 Ltd is paralysed by indecision"".  The review will look into: Former Transport Secretary Chris Grayling argued that new rail links were needed to take pressure off a system which was ""bursting at the seams"".  And in June this year, more than 20 business leaders urged the government to deliver HS2 in full, arguing it would ""spread the flow of investment across the Midlands, the North of England and into Scotland"". The Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, who will sit on the review panel, said HS2 was ""vital"" for the West Midlands and was ""already creating jobs and building new homes"".  But Conservative MP Dame Cheryl Gillan, whose constituency HS2 will run through, told BBC Radio 4's World at One its costs had risen ""astronomically"" and it was ""now completely unviable in terms of value for money for the British taxpayer"". In May, a committee of peers argued the project risked ""short changing"" the North of England.  Their report said the scheme put too much emphasis on cutting journey times and not enough on the economic impact on regions. It also called for the Northern Powerhouse Rail scheme - a separate scheme connecting towns and cities in the region - to be completed alongside HS2. Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, who supports HS2, complained that the review panel included two elected representatives from the West Midlands but none from the North. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said Labour supported investment in new rail capacity, adding that ""improved governance of railway expansion is needed, not least over the HS2 project."" One Conservative MP, Bob Seely suggested the ""top half"" of HS2 - the section covering the North of England - should be built, but not the Birmingham to London route, which he described as ""a monumental white elephant"".  The key question is, is HS2 value for money? One former senior figure at the Treasury said to me recently that in terms of that it scores much lower than many other projects, so the government is taking quite a big risk putting so much money into it.  The government could cancel it - but, of course, the main caveat to that is the amount that has already been spent and would be lost. For all the opposition to it, HS2 also has a lot of passionate supporters too and they would be unhappy. Rather than scrapping it altogether then, perhaps the more plausible option is altering the plans in some way.  Trust me though, even doing will not be straightforward for financial or legal reasons. Joe Rukin, from the Stop HS2 campaign, said: ""If this is a genuine review, they must stop work now, because irreparable damage is being done right now to unique habitats, ancient woodlands."" He accused HS2 of ""sending out possession orders like there is no tomorrow"", referring to the compulsory purchase of properties in the path of the line. He also raised concerns that the review chairman, Mr Oakervee, was being given a chance to ""mark his own homework"" given his previous role on the project."
Spread to US Treasury,Coronavirus: Evening update,2024-09-25,2020-10-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54371350,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you on Tuesday morning. The government has ordered an investigation into how a problem with an old Excel file format led to nearly 16,000 coronavirus cases going missing from official statistics and not being registered on test and trace records over the last 10 days. Those who tested positive were informed - but there was a delay in tracing their contacts, only half of whom have now been spoken to. It also meant the daily case totals reported by the government over the past week were lower than the true number - around 7,000 a day instead of nearer 11,000 at the end of the week. But this ""has not impacted"" the decisions the government made about local lockdowns last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs.  Meanwhile, the number of positive cases reported across the UK today is 12,594, and 19 more people have died.  The Welsh Government is considering quarantine restrictions for people travelling to Wales from Covid hotspots elsewhere in the UK. People living in locked down parts of Wales are not allowed to leave those areas apart from for a few exceptions - but there is currently no legal restrictions to stop people living under local lockdown conditions in England from travelling around - including to Wales. Check out our guide to the different levels of Covid restrictions and local lockdowns around the UK  or find out what you can do during a local lockdown. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has vowed to ""always balance the books"", despite the huge rise in government borrowing in the wake of the pandemic. In a speech at the Conservative Party conference (taking place online because of the pandemic) he warned debt and spending needed controlling ""over the medium term"". Our political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was not clear exactly what the chancellor meant by that - and nor was there ""even a whisper"" of how he might go about it. In any case, Treasury sources suggest it's unlikely to happen by the time of the next election, which is expected to be in 2024. Boris Johnson has urged people to go back to cinemas, following news Cineworld is temporarily closing its UK and US venues, affecting 45,000 jobs. The prime minister said he would ""encourage people to go out to the cinema, enjoy themselves and support"" movie theatres. But his encouragement wasn't enough to stop the Odeon chain announcing it was reducing the hours of a quarter of its 120 cinemas to weekends only. Tim Richards, founder and chief executive of the Vue cinema chain, said there was ""pent up demand like we haven't seen ever before"" among customers to go out - but: ""Our problem right now is we have no movies."" A further delay to the release of the new James Bond film - announced on Friday - was ""a big blow"", he said.  Lana Del Rey has upset some of her fans due to her choice of face mask at a book signing in California. Reading passages from her new poetry book and interacting with the public, the star sported a glittery, mesh face mask that she'd previously used in a cover shoot for a magazine - but which did not appear to offer much of a barrier to the spread of Covid-19. ""Lana, please wear a real mask,"" begged one fan on Instagram. Still confused about how to wear a mask properly? We have some tips.

Spread to US Treasury,QUB coronavirus case prompts students isolation move,2024-09-25,2020-03-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-51749159,"A group of Queen's University students deemed ""high-risk"" will undergo a period of isolation after a student tested positive for coronavirus, the pro-vice chancellor has said. Prof Stuart Elborn said anyone who may have had contact with the individual has now been contacted. The diagnosis was one of two new cases of coronavirus confirmed in Northern Ireland on Wednesday. It brings the total number of cases in the region to three - none are linked. Across the UK, the total number of positive tests has risen to 90, and  health officials have moved into the second phase of their response to the coronavirus outbreak. Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical officer, has said it is ""highly likely"" there is now some ""community transmission"" within the UK. Measures would be ramped up to slow the spread of the virus and could involve ""changes to society"", he said. The Queen's University Belfast (QUB) student had recently returned from northern Italy and had been mixing with others at university. The other adult had been in contact with someone in the UK who had tested positive for Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus. Prof Elborn said ""appropriate cleaning"" had taken place in the areas where the student was present. ""At this moment there is no need to close anything or halt any particular activities,"" he said. ""We will be keeping a very close eye on a daily basis as to how this develops. ""And we will make decisions in the university in line with what we need to do to protect society in Northern Ireland and more widely in these islands."" Queen's said its major incident team had been convened and was putting in place the appropriate contingency measures.  ""There will be a helpline [on Thursday] and I will be meeting with the particular school where this occurred later to have an opportunity to discuss this with the students and the staff,"" he said. Four new cases were confirmed in the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday, bringing the total number of cases there to six. The patients, two men and two women, all travelled from the same affected area in northern Italy. Ireland's deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn maintained there was ""still no evidence of widespread or sustained community transmission in Ireland, as seen in some other EU countries"". The first case in Northern Ireland was a woman who had travelled to northern Italy, which is at the centre of the European outbreak. Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the latest two patients were receiving the appropriate care and officials were working to identify anyone they had come into contact with. Northern Ireland remained in the containment phase, he added. In other developments:"
Spread to US Treasury,Does pandemic offer US and Iran chance for partial reset?,2024-09-25,2020-03-19,By Jonathan Marcus,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51948510,"We are facing a public health crisis that, in global terms, may be the worst for just over a century.  No wonder then that the coronavirus pandemic has pushed many of the stories that make up our usual daily diet of international news to the sidelines. Nonetheless, many commentators are already speculating about how global affairs may or may not change in the wake of this drama.  That, though, is a long way off yet.  A more immediate question is whether the behaviour of antagonistic countries - Iran and the United States, in this case - as they both struggle to confront this emergency, might provide a glimmer of hope for a better relationship in the future?  The question is posed because Iran has been hit severely by the virus.  The number of reported cases is already more than 17,000 and the death toll stands at 1,192, although many in Iran believe the actual numbers are a lot higher.  Iran's economy is already weakened by US sanctions and, although Washington insists that humanitarian items - medical supplies, for example - remain outside the sanctions net, the web of restrictions on the Central Bank of Iran and the country's ability to trade with the outside world are only accentuating its problems. Things have been made even more difficult by transport disruption, border closures and so on, prompted by the wider impact of the pandemic. As a measure of Iran's desperate need, it has taken the almost unprecedented step of requesting a $5bn (£4.25bn) emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This is the first time for some 60 years that Iran has sought IMF funds. A spokesperson for the organisation told me on Tuesday that the IMF ""had discussions with the Iranian authorities to better understand their request for emergency financing"" and that ""the discussions will continue in the days and weeks ahead"". The US, as one of the IMF Executive Board's most important members, will have a significant say in whether Iran gets the money. Already there are calls from US experts for Iran not just to be given what it needs, but also for the Trump administration to pursue a more compassionate approach to Iran's health crisis in general.  Mark Fitzpatrick, an expert on arms control and the Iranian nuclear programme, insisted that there was a moment now when an opportunity can be seized to break the log-jam.  ""US policy toward Iran is stuck, failing to change Iran's behaviour except for the worse,"" he tweeted on Monday. Writing in the US journal The American Conservative on Tuesday, Iran specialist Barbara Slavin argued that the idea, espoused by some US Republicans, that the pandemic might serve to prompt the overthrow of the Iranian regime was absurd.  ""The likelihood of massive protests… seems slim given government directives to stay home and rational fears that mass gatherings will only spread the virus,"" she wrote. The US treasury department, she noted, had taken some small steps to clarify that the humanitarian channel to Iran remained open. But there had been no indications that the Trump administration's ""maximum pressure"" policy was being reconsidered, she added. ""It appears that the crisis will only push Iran deeper into the arms of China and Russia and strengthen those in the regime who reject reconciliation with the West.""  ""The Revolutionary Guards, who are handling much of the response to the virus and building emergency medical facilities,"" she insisted, ""will grow even more powerful as Iran comes to look less and less like a theocracy with a thin republican veneer and more like a military dictatorship."" So what then is the chance of even some modest rapprochement? Not much if the public statements of some of the key players are to be taken at face value.  The Trump administration has sought to score diplomatic points in this crisis.  The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said earlier this week that Iran's leaders had ""lied about the Wuhan virus for weeks"", and that they were ""trying to avoid responsibility for their... gross incompetence"".  Note there the use of the term ""Wuhan virus"", which Mr Pompeo prefers to ""coronavirus"". Washington is seeking to have a jab at Beijing too, but equally some Chinese figures have been ready to brand the pandemic as some kind of conspiracy created by the US military.  But in regard to Iran, Mr Pompeo has gone further. He bluntly stated that ""the Wuhan virus is a killer and the Iranian regime is an accomplice"".  Nonetheless, he said the US was ""trying to offer help"".  ""We have an open humanitarian channel... even as our maximum pressure campaign denies terrorists money."" In terms of potential military confrontation - remember, just a few weeks ago the US and Iran seemed to be on the brink of war - there have been some indirect incidents.  They include rocket attacks on Iraqi military bases used by US-led coalition forces that the Americans believe were carried out by a pro-Iranian Shia militia. One attack killed three coalition service personnel - one of them a British medic - and the US responded with air strikes. General Frank McKenzie of CentCom, the man in charge of US forces in the Middle East, told the Senate Armed Services Committee recently that the coronavirus outbreak might make a weakened Iran ""more dangerous"".  The US is certainly not taking any risks, unusually maintaining two aircraft carriers in the region.  Of course, the indirect culpability of Iran in such attacks is always contested - certainly by the Iranians themselves.  This is not necessarily a tap that Tehran can just turn on and off at will. Many of its proxies have local concerns and goals.  The Shia militias in Iraq are eager to force the Americans out. But Iran could probably do a lot to scale down the frequency or severity of incidents.  Indeed, in general the pandemic does seem to be reducing military confrontation in the wider region.  On the Iran-Israel front in Syria, things seem to be noticeably quieter. And Gen McKenzie also noted that the US might have to ""ultimately live with a low-level of proxy attacks"", a statement that reduces some of the drama from the situation.  The Iranian leadership too has been talking tough.  President Hassan Rouhani noted on Wednesday that Iran had responded to the US killing of the famed Revolutionary Guards General Qasem Soleimani in January, but also making clear that that this response would continue.  ""The Americans assassinated our great commander,"" he said in a televised speech. ""We have responded to that terrorist act and will respond to it."" So, on the face of it, there's not much chance of taking the sting out of the US-Iran relationship. Washington's attitude to the IMF loan may be a pointer to how things might develop. And indeed rhetoric should not necessarily be taken at face value.  At the end of February, the US contacted Iran via the Swiss government to say that it was ""prepared to assist the Iranian people in their response efforts"". Only on Tuesday, Mr Pompeo, along with his tough words to both Tehran and Beijing, spoke of his hope that Tehran might be considering releasing some Americans detained in the country. The temporary release of the British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is another small pointer of a shift in Tehran.  At the end of the day, Iran may well need to tacitly restrain some of the groups who have the Americans and other Western forces in their sights.  They will need to release detained foreign nationals.  And the Trump administration will need to decide whether this is an opportunity to create a small opening with Tehran along sound humanitarian grounds or, whether the mounting pressure on the regime from both sanctions and now the coronavirus, is a moment to double-down.  It could be a fateful decision for what comes next when the pandemic has passed."
Spread to US Treasury,Wagner - built by blood and treasure in Africa,2024-09-25,2023-08-26,By Dr Alex Vines,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-66614766,"Cradling a rifle, dressed in a military uniform and with a desert in the background, Yevgeny Prigozhin had a message for Africa. His Wagner group of mercenaries was ""making Russia even greater on every continent - and Africa even more free"". ""Justice and happiness for the African nations,"" he declared.  The video, thought to be recorded in Mali, was released on Monday. Two days later, the Wagner leader was reported to have died in a plane crash in Russia. What now for his purported mission in Africa? Wagner has been active in several countries on the continent - most notably the Central African Republic (CAR) and Mali. But for many African governments, Prigozhin's announced death is a relief. I would argue that his operatives did not spread freedom, and foreign mercenaries are an embarrassment for many states - Prigozhin was a reminder of a painful past.  At the height of the Cold War, and especially shortly after independence on the continent, mercenaries were regularly used to influence the civil wars and violence that followed.  Col Callan in Angola; Bob Denard in Congo's Katanga and later the Comoros; ""Mad"" Mike Hoare in Katanga and later the Seychelles; American Robert Mackenzie in Sierra Leone and British Simon Mann's failed ""organised regime change"" mission in Equatorial Guinea in 2004: all these are uncomfortable history. When I discussed Prigozhin with Russian African analysts in Moscow in late 2019, they reminded me that for them, he was less of the above, but more akin to the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes, who was out to make a fortune, and that I should not be judgmental, given the UK's history.  Prigozhin's Wagner footprint in Africa was built on blood and treasure - contracts giving access to valuable resources were made in payment for military support. I had witnessed similar Private Military Companies (PMCs) in action some 20-plus years ago: Sandline International in Sierra Leone and Executive Outcomes in Angola.  They provided security and training in exchange for payment in management of mines, oil and other natural resource endowments.  Their success dramatically varied, depending on the client and the contract.   There is nothing unique about Wagner and its operational behaviour in Africa.  When I met with some of its operatives in Moscow in 2019, they were traumatised and seeking compensation for a mission in Mozambique that went badly wrong.  This was the antithesis to the Prigozhin-funded movie Granit that premiered on the pro-Kremlin NTV channel in December 2022. It depicted a group of Russian hero ""military instructors"" invited to Mozambique to fight Islamic State-linked insurgents in the country's north. Its operations in Libya, Sudan, Mali and CAR have produced mixed results.  Wagner's greatest military success is probably acting as a Praetorian guard for the presidency and foiling a military coup in CAR's capital, Bangui.  Its greatest failure: possibly in Mozambique. Wagner deployed there in September 2019 for counter-insurgency operations, but the killing of seven of its personnel and 20 Mozambican special forces in October in a friendly fire exchange resulted in their withdrawal in early 2020.  Wagner's investments in fake news and trolling, encouraging deeper anti-Western sentiment in West Africa, have been more successful than its efforts to win elections in Madagascar, Mozambique or Zambia. It is currently most militarily active in Sudan and Mali.  Wagner has had a presence in Sudan since 2017, providing security services and overseeing gold mining concessions.  The US Treasury Department alleges that Wagner has also been supplying Sudan's Rapid Support Forces with surface-to-air missiles recently.  In September 2021, the Malian junta struck a security agreement with Wagner for the deployment of 1,000 personnel at a monthly cost of $10.8m (£8.6m). The Wagner Group's counter-terrorism performance has been underwhelming and there are allegations of serious human rights abuses by them, especially in central Mali.  Although the group's deployment in Mali has provoked criticism from the region and the African Union (AU), Wagner still sought to expand its operations to Burkina Faso.  An offer in late 2022 was rejected, but Russia continues to woo the junta, whose leader Captain Ibrahim Traore attended the second Russia-Africa summit in St Petersburg in July this year. Burkina Faso is one of six African countries to receive free grain from Moscow.  Soon after the September 2022 coup in Burkina Faso that resulted in Capt Traore taking over the military government, Prigozhin described him as ""a truly courageous son of the motherland"".  The Wagner leader also hailed Niger's military coup in July this year as good news and offered his fighters' services to bring order. But in the wake of his failed uprising in Russia in June, Wagner's grip on its African operations was under threat. According to President Vladimir Putin, Prigozhin had returned to Russia from Africa on the day of his death and had gone to meet Russian officials in Moscow. It seems he may have been trying to preserve his Wagner Africa portfolio from full Kremlin takeover.  Mr Putin described Prigozhin as a talented person.  ""[He] worked in our country, but also abroad, in Africa. He worked with oil, gas, with precious metals,"" the president said. Pan-African dismay about mercenaries began as soon as they became active in the decolonisation conflicts of the 1960s. In 1977, the African Convention on Mercenarism was signed in Libreville and took effect in April 1985.  In February 2022, the African Union's commissioner for political affairs, peace and security, Bankole Adeoye, called for the ""complete exclusion of mercenaries from the African continent"". These conventions may be ineffective, but an increasing number of African governments do not want a repeat of the use of foreign mercenaries on African soil to pursue geopolitical rivalries of external powers that occurred during the Cold War.  Mozambique discovered that the use of private military contractors was not so effective and turned to Rwanda for assistance.  Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi concluded that an effective, disciplined military was needed to assist his own armed forces, and the Rwandan Defence Forces (RDF) has been successful, significantly reducing the insurgency.  The worsening security situation across the Sahel also resulted in Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, along with West African allies, drawing up plans for the strengthening of a regional standby force - in effect, a regional counter-terrorism and anti-coup force.  The African-led and designed security initiatives are an explicit rejection of mercenaries. But for those military governments in the region, in Mali, Burkina Faso and now Niger, the Russian operatives may be an attractive alternative. Wagner, if it survives, or other emerging Russian mercenary groups, will increasingly find the market limited to putschist regimes using them as the security partner of last resort.  The Kremlin, which will not desert the likes of CAR and Mali, is likely to try to take over operations, but its ability to seriously take on new clients, as Prigozhin had envisioned, will be difficult.  This is the moment for African leaders to truly implement African solutions to African problems, by implementing its conventions and building up institutions and credible, accountable security forces. Alex Vines directs the Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank."
Spread to US Treasury,Trump signs Covid relief and spending package,2024-09-25,2020-12-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55463276,"US President Donald Trump has belatedly signed into law a coronavirus relief and spending package bill, averting a partial government shutdown. Mr Trump had previously refused to sign the bill, criticising ""wasteful spending"" and calling for higher payouts to people hit by the pandemic. The delay meant that millions temporarily lost unemployment benefits. The relief package worth $900bn (£665bn) was approved by Congress after months of negotiation. It is part of a $2.3tn spending package that includes $1.4tn for normal federal government spending.  Republican and Democratic Party lawmakers had been pleading with the president to sign it before a budget deadline of midnight on Monday. If he had not, some government agencies would have had to close, unless legislators could pass a stopgap bill. About 14 million Americans faced a lapse in unemployment benefit payments and new stimulus cheques. Unemployment benefits will now be restored. After the coronavirus aid relief bill overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives and Senate last Monday, Mr Trump issued an implied veto threat, describing the package as a ""disgrace"" and full of ""wasteful"" items. The bill includes a payment of $600 to Americans earning less than $75,000 a year. Mr Trump said he wanted Americans to receive $2,000 - but Republicans in Congress refused to agree to the change.   Mr Trump also baulked at the annual aid money for other countries in the federal budget, arguing that those funds should instead go to struggling Americans. His demand to send the measure back to Capitol Hill stunned lawmakers since he had largely stayed out of the negotiations. His top economic adviser, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, had proposed the $600 payments early this month, and many questioned why the president had waited so long to object. It was not immediately clear why Mr Trump - who is in Florida - finally decided to sign the bill into law on Sunday. He said he was signing the bill with ""a strong message that makes clear to Congress that wasteful items need to be removed"". He leaves office on 20 January after losing November's election to Mr Biden, although he has refused to admit defeat. Republican Senator Mitt Romney said he was ""relieved"" that the legislation had at last become law. Earlier, Republican Senator Pat Toomey said the president risked being remembered for ""chaos, misery and erratic behaviour"". US President-elect Joe Biden had warned of ""devastating consequences"" if Mr Trump continued to refuse to sign. In a strongly worded statement published on the transition website on Saturday, Mr Biden described Mr Trump's refusal to sign the bill as an ""abdication of responsibility"". ""It is the day after Christmas, and millions of families don't know if they'll be able to make ends meet because of President Donald Trump's refusal to sign an economic relief bill approved by Congress with an overwhelming and bipartisan majority,"" Mr Biden said."
Spread to US Treasury,'The race is on' but is it 'turning toxic'?,2024-09-25,2019-05-25,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-48411490,"The Sunday Times seems to relish the fact that Environment Secretary Michael Gove will go head-to-head with Boris Johnson in the Conservative leadership race.  ""Get Boris!"" is the headline. The paper says the development will revive memories of what it calls ""the psychodrama of 2016"", when Mr Gove was chairman of Mr Johnson's leadership campaign - but then launched his own bid. The Sunday Telegraph reports that Mr Gove set out his stall to about 10 Tory MPs at a private dinner on Tuesday, three days before Theresa May resigned.  One of those present, who is not named, is quoted saying: ""His pitch was that he could provide unity, vision and grip"". The former foreign secretary is attacked by the Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage in the Sunday Express. Mr Farage highlights the fact that Mr Johnson resigned from his cabinet post because he was so angry about Theresa May's Brexit deal, but then voted for a later version of it in the Commons.  He argues this raises doubts about Mr Johnson's pledge that the UK would leave the EU at the end of October, with or without a deal, if he was in charge. The Sun on Sunday showcases Mr Johnson's pitch for the top job in a two-page spread.   It says he has come up with what it describes as a ""secret blueprint for power"". This includes increasing funding for the NHS, tackling violent crime, and easing the housing crisis.  But the paper is worried about the number of candidates entering the race, warning that the Conservatives ""need to get a grip fast"". ""PM race turning toxic already"", is the headline in the Mail on Sunday. It says the contest to replace Theresa May ""exploded into life"", when the hopefuls traded ""the first vicious blows"". These include International Development Secretary Rory Stewart's description of Boris Johnson's stance on Brexit as ""damaging, unnecessary and dishonest"". ""The race is on,"" declares the front page of the Sunday Telegraph, in which a dizzying array of Tories give their views on the contest. Among them are Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss, former International Development Secretary Priti Patel, and Sir Graham Brady, the former chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs. One of the candidates - the former Work and Pensions Secretary, Esther McVey - sets out her stall. She believes that the Brexit deal negotiated by Theresa May must be, in her words, ""put out of its misery"". The UK should make it clear to Brussels, Ms McVey argues, that it is prepared to leave in October with no deal, making a ""clean break"". Writing in the Mail on Sunday, former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab explains why he should be the next prime minister. He sums up his vision, which includes efforts to increase wages and lower taxes, as ""a fairer deal for workers, a fairer society, and a fairer deal from the EU"". The Sunday Times has a double-page spread in which two candidates - the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and the former leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom - make their pitches for the top job. Mr Hunt points to his business credentials, as an entrepreneur who founded an education company which he sold for £15m.  He tells the paper: ""We need to send a signal to the world that we are going to be the best place to do business."" Ms Leadsom explains that she would relish the opportunity to lead Britain out of the European Union - and would do so by the current deadline in October, with or without a deal.  But she says she would put ""significant effort"" into trying to achieve an agreement with the European Commission. Aside from Brexit, she is expected to promise to cut greenhouse gas emissions to nearly zero by 2050.  The Sunday Mirror's leader column expresses disgust that the Conservatives are so focused on their own rivalries, when thousands of jobs are in jeopardy, because of the collapse of British Steel.   The paper describes the leadership contest as ""both an act of gross self-indulgence and a grotesque dereliction of public duty"". The Observer unmasks the members of the anti-Brexit activist group, Led By Donkeys.  They put up giant billboard posters across the UK, featuring old tweets or quotes from politicians, which tended to subvert their arguments for leaving the EU.  The four men describe how they came up with the idea while drinking in a north London pub, and crowdfunded several of the posters. Also in the Observer, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson warns that his party will lose the next general election, unless it quickly commits wholeheartedly to a second referendum on Brexit.  Mr Watson argues that Labour needs to develop what he calls ""backbone"" on the issue. He says the way to do that is to make sure that policy is set by the membership, not by ""a small number of people on Labour's national executive"". The New York Times alleges that a piece of computer code used in cyber attacks across the United States was created by the American National Security Agency.  It says the tool, known as EternalBlue, was leaked from an NSA facility in 2017. The paper explains that it was then sold on, and has been picked up by hackers in Russia, North Korea and China.  The report estimates that cyber attacks using EternalBlue have caused billions of pounds worth of damage around the world.

In a BBC Radio Five Live interview, Mr Westwood suggested this might attract more people to try golf.

Spread to US Treasury,Are we all becoming unknowing spies?,2024-09-25,2021-07-21,By Gordon Corera,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57910355,"The allegations that spy software known as Pegasus may have been used to carry out surveillance on journalists, activists - and even perhaps political leaders - highlights that surveillance is now for sale.  The company behind the tool, NSO Group, has denied the allegations and says its customers are carefully assessed. But it is another sign that high-end spy techniques, which used to be the exclusive preserve of a few states, are now spreading more widely and challenging the way we think about privacy and security in an online world. In the not-too-distant past, if a security service wanted to find out what you were up to, it took a fair degree of effort. They might get a warrant to wiretap your phone. Or plant a bug in your house. Or send a surveillance team to follow you.  Finding out who your contacts were and how you lived your life would take patience and time. Now, almost everything they might want to know - what you say, where you have been, who you meet, even what interests you - is all contained in a device we carry all the time.  Your phone can be accessed remotely without anyone even touching it and you never knowing that it's been turned from your friendly digital assistant into someone else's spy. The ability to remotely access that phone was once considered something only a few states could do. But high-end espionage and surveillance powers are now in the hands of many other countries and even individuals and small groups.  Former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed the power of US and UK intelligence agencies to tap into global communications in 2013.  Those agencies always maintained that their capabilities were subject to the authorisations and oversight of a democratic country. These authorisations were fairly weak at the time, but have since been strengthened.  His revelations, however, prompted other nations to consider what was possible. Many became eager for the same kinds of capabilities and a select group of companies - most of which have kept a low profile - have increasingly sought to sell it to them. Israel has always been a first-tier cyber-power with top-end surveillance capabilities. And its companies, like NSO Group, often formed by veterans of the intelligence world, have been among those to commercialise the techniques. NSO Group say they only sell their spyware for use against serious criminals and terrorists. But the problem is how you define those categories. More authoritarian countries frequently claim journalists, dissidents and human rights activists are criminals or a national security threat making them worthy of intrusive surveillance. And in many of those countries there is limited or no accountability and oversight on how the powerful capabilities are used. The spread of encryption has increased the drive for governments to get inside people's devices. When phone calls were the main means of communication, a telecoms company could be ordered to wiretap the conversation (which once meant literally attaching wires to the line).  But now the conversations are often encrypted, meaning you need to get to the device itself to see what was said. And devices also carry out a much richer treasure trove of data. States sometimes come up with clever ways of doing this. A recent example was a joint US-Australian operation in which criminal gangs were given phones they thought were super secure but were really operated by law enforcement. But the issues are wider than this kind of phone spyware. Other high-end intelligence capabilities are also spreading fast. Even the tools to disrupt a business online are now easily accessible. In the past, ransomware - in which hackers demand a payment to unlock access to your system - was the province of criminal networks. It is now sold as as a service on the dark web.  An individual can simply agree a deal to give them a cut of the profits and they will hand over the tools and even offer support and advice, including helplines in the case of problems. Other techniques - like location tracking and developing profiles of people's activity and behaviour - which once required specialised access and authority are now available freely. And when it comes to surveillance, it is not just about states.  It is also about what companies can do to track us - not necessarily by implanting spyware, but through a surveillance economy in which they watch what we like on social media to better market us to companies. All of this creates pools of data that companies can use - but which hackers can steal and states can seek to tap into. Some capabilities are now on sale to everyone. Other types of spyware are for sale to the nervous or suspicious who want to check on their family's whereabouts. What all of this means, then, is that we may be stepping into a world in which we can all become spies - but can equally all be spied on."
Spread to US Treasury,£1.2bn for Scotland in government's spending plans,2024-09-25,2019-09-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-49582275,"Chancellor Sajid Javid has announced an extra £1.2bn for Scotland in the UK government's spending plans. The departmental budgets are for one year, rather than the usual three years, due to uncertainty over the impact of Brexit. The chancellor promised he was ""turning the page on austerity"" as he embarked on a pre-election spending spree. But Scotland's finance secretary Derek Mackay said the funding package did not ""undo the damage"" of austerity. The funding in Scotland includes £160m for farmers to settle a  long-running row over the redistribution of Common Agricultural Policy payments.  The extra spending - primarily aimed at health, schools and the police - will be funded by borrowing rather than tax rises. Mr Javid outlined £13.8bn of extra investment across the UK, which equates to about £1.2bn for Scotland under the devolved nation funding model called the Barnett formula, in what he said is the fastest spending increase for 15 years. Mr Javid said: ""No department will be cut next year. Every single department has had its budget for day-to-day spending increased at least in line with inflation. ""That's what I mean by the end of austerity."" But Mr Mackay said: ""Despite promises of additional funding from the UK government, the fact remains this announcement gives us no greater certainty, does not undo the damage of austerity, fails to protect us from Brexit and simply gives just some of the money owed to Scotland. ""Scottish public services have been constrained by a decade of UK austerity during which we have lost out on over £12bn of real-terms investment.  ""This announcement does little to address the damage caused by UK austerity or the multi-billion funding disputes we have outstanding with the Treasury."" The £160m farming payout resolves a row over the way the EU paid subsidies. In 2013, the EU announced moves to redistribute Common Agricultural Policy payments more fairly, on the basis of average euros per hectare. The EU paid the uplift money to bring Scottish hill farmers up to the average per-hectare payments of all the other EU countries. However, the decision was made by the UK government to spread the payments across the whole farming sector, based on historical distributions. The National Farmers' Union Scotland president, Andrew McCornick, said the announcement meant a ""fundamental wrong has finally been corrected"". He added: ""For the past six years, we have argued long and hard for the convergence funding injustice to be addressed and the £160m represents the biggest single uplift in agricultural funding in memory."" Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: ""I have doggedly argued for this money to be repatriated to Scotland's farmers and pressed the UK government to right this historic injustice, which has deprived farmers, crofters and land managers of vital support."" The chancellor laid out the spending plans against the possibility that the UK is heading for another general election - the country's third in five years. The chancellor's spending plan is based on forecasts published in March by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent fiscal watchdog. Under those predictions, the government had around £15bn to borrow within its self-imposed overdraft limit of 2% of the value of the national economy. The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, also warned that the current weakness in the UK economy could weigh on the government's declaration of the end of austerity. He said: ""We of course live in a time of extreme economic uncertainty and I think the big risk in saying that austerity is over is that the economy starts to do significantly worse, which it might if we have a no-deal Brexit. ""Then the deficit and debt will start rising and we are in danger of having another dose of austerity to get that over with for a second time."" Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said the UK government's spending announcement was ""great news for Scotland"". He added: ""An extra £1.2bn that should be used to grow the economy and invest in vital public services across Scotland.  ""It's clearer than ever that Scotland benefits from being part of a strong United Kingdom and I urge the Scottish government to work with us as we invest in Scotland to deliver jobs, opportunities and sustainable growth.  ""It's particularly a great day for Scottish farmers with the prime minister delivering on his promise to right the wrongs of unfair funding by providing them an extra £160m."""
Spread to US Treasury,Five ways the Budget could help tackle coronavirus,2024-09-25,2020-03-11,By Eleanor Lawrie,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51815476,"A little over three weeks after becoming chancellor, Rishi Sunak is about to deliver what's become known as the ""coronavirus Budget,"" as fears grow over the impact the outbreak will have on the UK economy. He is expected to unveil a package of measures to boost everything from the NHS to struggling small businesses and the self-employed. But how much can the chancellor actually do, and will it go far enough? Mr Sunak has pledged that the NHS will get ""whatever resources it needs"" to cope with the coronavirus outbreak, suggesting he may be writing the health service a blank cheque. NHS costs are likely to soar with the extra pressure on its services. It has already had to recruit extra staff for its 111 phone service. ""Clearly a large pool of money will be required for the NHS, bigger than the £400m for the winter flu crisis, so it will be a scaling up,"" says Luke Bartholomew, economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""I imagine [the money] would be allocated specifically for issues related to coronavirus, such as public health campaigns, just as much as it would be for hospital beds.""  The chancellor could cut VAT rates in a bid to get us all to start spending more at the tills.  VAT is a tax added to some goods and services, and currently stands at 20% for most items it applies to. But a cut in the tax ""would have limited effect"" if shoppers are determined to avoid the High Street, says Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics.  It would also be expensive: reducing it to 17.5%, for example, would cost HM Treasury about £17bn this financial year, she estimates.  Luke Bartholomew agrees: ""I suspect once the worst of the crisis is over, a cut would help the economy bounce back, but it doesn't matter how much cheaper you make things if people can't leave the house."" Another option for the chancellor is to either delay or temporarily scrap business rates, a tax on firms linked to the value of their premises.   ""Cashflow issues are important and business rate suspensions mean businesses could focus on paying employees,"" said Melissa Geiger of KPMG.  ""It's easier for governments to help businesses by offering tax relief, rather than paying out lump sums,"" she says. Trade body UK Hospitality has written to the government asking for a three-month business rate suspension for the industry, which has been particularly badly hit by the outbreak. Hotel occupancy is down 15%, while eating and drinking out has fallen by 7% it says. Advance bookings have slumped by up to 50%.  Using an existing mechanism - like business rates - to support business would be quick and effective, argues Ms Geiger. In an ""emergency Budget"" like this, ""you have to focus on the short-term"" she says. ""It's about paying more through a system you already have, rather than implementing new tax law quickly, which is very difficult."" UK employees have already started to get statutory sick pay from the first day off work, to help contain coronavirus.  But that money is not available to the self-employed, a group of about five million people. This has led to fears that these workers may struggle to make ends meet, and that those on zero-hours contracts may risk going into work when they shouldn't, helping the virus to spread. The chancellor has suggested he may announce temporary measures to support people in this position.  This could include making sure benefits like universal credit and Employment and Support Allowance are available ""quickly and effectively"". It may also mean waiving requirements for sick notes or in-person benefits interviews.  Cashflow is likely to be an issue for small businesses during this outbreak, as they are particularly vulnerable to sudden loss of trade, supply chain problems and a reduction in their workforce. Supporting small businesses during this time means ""introducing new, targeted measures and delivering on existing promises,"" according to the Federation of Small Businesses.  It's calling for Mr Sunak to relax the requirements to apply for a ""Time to Pay"" arrangement, which allows small businesses to spread out tax payments to HMRC. The body wants the UK to follow Japan's lead by making interest-free loans available to small firms.   It's also calling for smaller employers to immediately receive a rebate for any statutory sick pay they give out. "
Spread to US Treasury,Indian Prime Minister Modi Twitter account hacked,2024-09-25,2020-09-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54007995,"Twitter has said that an account for the personal website of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been hacked. A series of tweets were sent from the account asking followers to donate cryptocurrency to a relief fund. Twitter said it was aware of the activity and had taken steps to secure the compromised account. This is the latest high-profile Twitter security breach after similar attacks in July on US presidential hopeful Joe Biden and Tesla founder Elon Musk. The account, with more than 2.5m followers, is the official Twitter handle for Mr Modi's personal website. His personal Twitter account, which was unaffected by this incident, has more than 61m followers. ""We are actively investigating the situation. At this time, we are not aware of additional accounts being impacted,"" a Twitter spokeswoman told the BBC in an emailed statement. The tweets, which have now been taken down, asked followers to donate cryptocurrency to the PM National Relief Fund. Less than two months ago Twitter said 130 accounts had been targeted in a major cyber-attack of celebrity accounts. But only a ""small subset"" of those 130 accounts had control seized by the attacker. The security breach saw accounts including those of Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Kanye West and Bill Gates tweet a Bitcoin scam to millions of followers. The FBI was called in to investigate. The apparent scam spread to mainstream celebrity accounts such as Kim Kardashian West and those of corporations Apple and Uber. Attackers were able to bypass the accounts' security because they had gained access to Twitter's own internal administration tools. Twitter said: ""Since the attack, we've significantly limited access to our internal tools and systems to ensure ongoing account security while we complete our investigation."" Despite it being obvious to many that it was a scam, the hackers received hundreds of transfers, worth more than $100,000 (£75,000). Cryptocurrencies are extremely hard to trace and the account the cyber-criminals used had quickly been emptied."
Spread to US Treasury,How will this affect US election?,2024-09-25,2020-10-02,By Anthony Zurcher,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54390559,"The US presidential election has been turned on its head. That sentence could have been written about any number of moments in a tumultuous year in American politics, but nothing quite like this has occurred this year, this decade, this century. Just 32 days before the presidential election, Donald Trump has tested positive for Covid-19. Given his age, 74, he is in a high-risk category for complications from the disease. At the very least, he will have to isolate while he is treated, meaning the US presidential contest - at least his side of it - has been fundamentally altered. The initial implications are obvious. The president's rigorous campaign schedule - which included visits to Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Georgia, Florida and North Carolina in just the past week - is on indefinite hold.  Trump will certainly have surrogates on the trail, but given that he has relied heavily on his family and senior administration and campaign officials for such tasks in the past, and many of them may have to quarantine because of their own exposure to the virus, that operation will be disrupted as well. Even the next presidential debate, a town hall format with audience questions scheduled for 15 October in Miami, Florida, is in doubt. Perhaps the event could be conducted via video-conference, but that will largely depend on the president's health at the time. At this point, there is no serious talk of altering the election schedule, which would require an act of Congress passed by both the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and the Republican-held Senate.  In some states, in fact, early voting has already begun. Then there are the political implications.  Despite the aforementioned turmoil this year - the pandemic and resulting economic disruption, the nationwide demonstrations against institutional racism and police brutality following George Floyd's death and sometimes violent unrest in several major US cities, the countless smaller crises and controversies that seem like a daily occurrence during the Trump years - this presidential race has been remarkably stable.  Democrat Joe Biden has held a statistically significant lead over the president for months in national polls, with a smaller but still noteworthy advantage in key swing states. Time was running out for the president to change this dynamic, even before this week's dramatic news. The public has consistently given the president low marks for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, so anything that puts the focus on the disease is potentially damaging for his re-election prospects. Complicating matters for the president will be that many Americans might recall what many would describe as the president's sometimes cavalier attitude toward Covid-19. At the presidential debate on Tuesday, Trump belittled Biden for frequently wearing masks and not having campaign rallies that matched his own in size. ""I don't wear a mask like him,"" Trump said. ""Every time you see him, he's got a mask."" While the president has, at times, stressed the importance of social distancing and taking the virus seriously, he has also trafficked in questionable science. He said the virus would disappear ""like magic""; and attacked state officials who have imposed more aggressive mitigation measures and been slower to reopen businesses and schools than he would like. Trump's coronavirus infection will cast all of these past comments into sharp relief - once again raising questions about whether he took the pandemic seriously enough both on a national policy level and within the White House itself, where the president's health and safety must, for the nation's sake, be of paramount concern. During times of national turmoil, the American public tends to rally in support of the president. While Trump and his administration will face hard questions about the virus, he and his wife will also be the recipients of national sympathy and prayers for the health ordeal that confronts them. Democrats and the president's critics may be inclined to engage in a chorus of ""I told you so"" and celebrate what they see as political karma, but they do so at risk of seeming callous or indifferent to the crisis that confronts the nation. More than 200,000 Americans have died of Covid-19 at this point - and grieving families and friends may not appreciate any form of victim-blaming. The Biden campaign will face a challenge on how to respond. For months the Democratic nominee has kept a lower profile in order to limit his risk of exposure - and has been mocked by Republicans, including the president himself, for ""hiding"" in the basement of his Delaware home.  Recently, however, he has stepped up his in-person campaigning, including a train tour of Ohio and western Pennsylvania on Wednesday. The campaign also announced that it would resume door-to-door voter canvassing, although it had criticised the Trump campaign for conducting in-person activities in the past. It seems unlikely Biden will suspend activities while the president is off the trail undergoing treatment, but his campaign may have to re-evaluate whether its recent activities should again be curtailed. ""Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery,"" Biden tweeted. ""We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family."" The Democratic nominee is setting a measured tone for his party - but it may be difficult for some to follow his lead. Trump's positive test is already sending shockwaves from the White House through Washington.  As Congress prepared to recess to allow its members to campaign for re-election, the legislature had been busy on two fronts - trying to negotiate a follow-up Covid-19 stimulus package, and begin the process of confirming Trump nominee Amy Coney Barrett to replace the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the US Supreme Court. Trump administration officials, ones who have been in close proximity to the president, have been heavily involved in both undertakings.  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was at the Capitol on Thursday negotiating with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi in a last-ditch effort to find agreement on relief legislation. And Barrett, along with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Vice-President Mike Pence, spent a long day on Wednesday visiting Republican members of Senate who will eventually vote on whether to seat her on the court. Mnuchin, Meadows and Pence have all announced negative tests but none is fully in the clear yet. The schedule for Barrett's pre-election confirmation was always going to be tight, requiring near-flawless execution in the face of Democratic efforts to disrupt and delay the process. Now it seems almost certain that the vote will take place after November's vote, when there is the possibility that the American people would have dealt Trump and the Republican Party a defeat at the polls. What other political knock-on effects could come from this news could depend largely on how far the virus has spread in the upper echelons of US government and how the president responds to his treatment. The political uncertainty could further disrupt whatever economic recovery was under way, as public confidence plummets and businesses again brace for a drop in revenue.  Concerns about contracting the virus, sharpened by the president's diagnosis, could encourage more Americans to shift to mail-in balloting instead of in-person voting, causing delays in reporting the election results. If the election is close, the potential for a protracted legal fight over who won could increase. In a year of political tempests, the biggest storms may be yet to come."
Spread to US Treasury,The rise and fall of 'Islamic State',2024-09-25,2016-03-09,Jim Muir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35695648,"Abu Anis only realised something unusual was happening when he heard the sound of explosions coming from the old city on the western bank of the Tigris as it runs through Mosul.  ""I phoned some friends over there, and they said armed groups had taken over, some of them foreign, some Iraqis,"" the computer technician said. ""The gunmen told them, 'We've come to get rid of the Iraqi army, and to help you.'"" The following day, the attackers crossed the river and took the other half of the city. The Iraqi army and police, who vastly outnumbered their assailants, broke and fled, officers first, many of the soldiers stripping off their uniforms as they joined a flood of  panicked civilians.  This video can not be played Video footage from Mosul after its capture by Isis shows militants driving through the streets It was 10 June 2014, and Iraq's second biggest city, with a population of around two million, had just fallen to the militants of the group then calling itself Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant (Isis or Isil).  Four days earlier, black banners streaming, a few hundred of the Sunni militants had crossed the desert border in a cavalcade from their bases in eastern Syria and met little resistance as they moved towards their biggest prize. Rich dividends were immediate. The Iraqi army, rebuilt, trained and equipped by the Americans since the US-led invasion of 2003, abandoned large quantities of armoured vehicles and advanced weaponry, eagerly seized by the militants. They also reportedly grabbed something like $500m from the Central Bank's Mosul branch. ""At the beginning, they behaved well,"" said Abu Anis. ""They took down all the barricades the army had put up between quarters. People liked that. On their checkpoints they were friendly and helpful - 'Anything you need, we're here for you.'"" The Mosul honeymoon was to last a few weeks. But just down the road, terrible things were already happening.  As the Iraqi army collapsed throughout the north, the militants moved swiftly down the Tigris river valley. Towns and villages fell like skittles. Within a day they had captured the town of Baiji and its huge oil refinery, and moved on swiftly to seize Saddam Hussein's old hometown, Tikrit, a Sunni hotbed. Just outside Tikrit is a big military base, taken over by the Americans in 2003 and renamed Camp Speicher after the first US casualty in the 1991 ""Desert Storm"" Gulf war against Iraq, a pilot called Scott Speicher, shot down over al-Anbar province in the west.  Bodies being exhumed at Camp Speicher, 2015 Camp Speicher, by now full of Iraqi military recruits, was surrounded by the Isis militants and surrendered. The thousands of captives were sorted, the Shia were weeded out, bound, and trucked away to be systematically shot dead in prepared trenches. Around 1,700 are believed to have been massacred in cold blood. The mass graves are still being exhumed.  Far from trying to cover up the atrocity, Isis revelled in it, posting on the internet videos and pictures showing the Shia prisoners being taken away and shot by the black-clad militants.  In terms of exultant cruelty and brutality, worse was not long in coming.  After a pause of just two months, Isis - now rebranded as ""Islamic State"" (IS) - erupted again, taking over large areas of northern Iraq controlled by the Kurds.  That included the town of Sinjar, mainly populated by the Yazidis, an ancient religious minority regarded by IS as heretics. Yazidi women in Germany protest against IS attacks on their community in northern Iraq, 2014 Hundreds of Yazidi men who failed to escape were simply killed. Women and children were separated and taken away as war booty, to be sold and bartered as chattels, and used as sex slaves. Thousands are still missing, enduring that fate.  Deliberately shocking, bloodthirsty exhibitionism reached a climax towards the end of the same month, August 2014. IS issued a video showing its notorious, London-accented and now late executioner Mohammed Emwazi (sardonically nicknamed ""Jihadi John"" by former captives) gruesomely beheading American journalist James Foley.  In the following weeks, more American and British journalists and aid workers - Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, and Peter Kassig (who had converted to Islam and changed his name to Abdul Rahman) - appeared being slaughtered in similar, slickly produced videos, replete with propaganda statements and dire warnings.  Murdered Western hostages: (From top left clockwise) Steven Sotloff, David Haines, James Foley, Alan Henning, Abdul Rahman (Peter) Kassig In the space of a few months, IS had blasted its way from obscurity on to the centre of the world stage. Almost overnight, it became a household word. Seven-and-a-half thousand miles (12,000km) away, then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott summed up the breathtaking novelty of the horror. It was, he said ""medieval barbarism, perpetrated and spread with the most modern of technology"". IS had arrived, and the world was taking notice. But the men in black did not appear out of the blue. They had been a long time coming.  The theology of murder The ideological or religious roots of IS and like-minded groups go deep into history, almost to the beginning of Islam itself in the 7th Century AD. Like Christianity six centuries before it, and Judaism some eight centuries before that, Islam was born into the harsh, tribal world of the Middle East. ""The original texts, the Old Testament and the Koran, reflected primitive tribal Jewish and Arab societies, and the codes they set forth were severe,"" writes the historian and author William Polk. ""They aimed, in the Old Testament, at preserving and enhancing tribal cohesion and power and, in the Koran, at destroying the vestiges of pagan belief and practice. Neither early Judaism nor Islam allowed deviation. Both were authoritarian theocracies."" As history moved on, Islam spread over a vast region, encountering and adjusting to numerous other societies, faiths and cultures. Inevitably in practice it mutated in different ways, often becoming more pragmatic and indulgent, often given second place to the demands of power and politics and temporal rulers. For hardline Muslim traditionalists this amounted to deviationism, and from early on, there was a clash of ideas in which those arguing for a strict return to the ""purity"" of the early days of Islam often paid a price.  The eminent scholar Ahmad ibn Hanbal (780-855), who founded one of the main schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence, was jailed and once flogged unconscious in a dispute with the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad.  Nearly five centuries later, another supreme theologian of the same strict orthodox school, Ibn Taymiyya, died in prison in Damascus. These two men are seen as the spiritual forefathers of later thinkers and movements which became known as ""salafist"", advocating a return to the ways of the first Muslim ancestors, the salaf al-salih (righteous ancestors). They inspired a later figure whose thinking and writings were to have a huge and continuing impact on the region and on the salafist movement, one form of which, Wahhabism, took his name.  Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was born in 1703 in a small village in the Nejd region in the middle of the Arabian peninsula.  A devout Islamic scholar, he espoused and developed the most  puritanical and strict version of what he saw as the original faith, and sought to spread it by entering pacts with the holders of political and military power. In an early foray in that direction, his first action was to destroy the tomb of Zayd ibn al-Khattab, one of the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad, on the grounds that by the austere doctrine of salafist theology, the veneration of tombs constitutes shirk, the revering of something or someone other than Allah.  But it was in 1744 that Abd al-Wahhab made his crucial alliance with the local ruler, Muhammad ibn Saud. It was a pact whereby Wahhabism provided the spiritual or ideological dimension for Saudi political and military expansion, to the benefit of both. Passing through several mutations, that dual alliance took over most of the peninsula and has endured to this day, with the House of Saud ruling in sometimes uneasy concert with an ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment.  The entrenchment of Wahhabi salafism in Saudi Arabia - and the billions of petrodollars to which it gained access - provided one of the wellsprings for jihadist militancy in the region in modern times.   Jihad  means struggle on the path of Allah, which can mean many kinds of personal struggle, but more often is taken to mean waging holy war. But the man most widely credited, or blamed, for bringing salafism into the 20th Century was the Egyptian thinker Sayyid Qutb. He provided a direct bridge from the thought and heritage of Abd al-Wahhab and his predecessors to a new generation of jihadist militants, leading up to al-Qaeda and all that was to follow.  Sayyid Qutb, ""the source of all jihadist thought"" Born in a small village in Upper Egypt in 1906, Sayyid Qutb found himself at odds with the way Islam was being taught and managed around him. Far from converting him to the ways of the West, a two-year study period in the US in the late 1940s left him disgusted at what he judged unbridled godless materialism and debauchery, and his fundamentalist Islamic outlook was honed harder.  Back in Egypt, he developed the view that the West was imposing its control directly or indirectly over the region in the wake of the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War One, with the collaboration of local rulers who might claim to be Muslims, but who had in fact deviated so far from the right path that they should no longer be considered such.  For Qutb, offensive jihad against both the West and its local agents was the only way for the Muslim world to redeem itself. In essence, this was a kind of takfir - branding another Muslim an apostate or kafir (infidel), making it justified and even obligatory and meritorious to kill him.  Although he was a theorist and intellectual rather than an active jihadist, Qutb was judged dangerously subversive by the Egyptian authorities. He was hanged in 1966 on charges of involvement in a Muslim Brotherhood plot to assassinate the nationalist President, Gamal Abdel Nasser.  Qutb was before his time, but his ideas lived on in the 24 books he wrote, which have been read by tens of millions,  and in the personal contact he had with the circles of people like Ayman al-Zawahiri, another Egyptian who is the current al-Qaeda leader.  Another intimate of the al-Qaeda founder Osama Bin Laden said: ""Qutb was the one who most affected our generation."" He has also been described as ""the source of all jihadist thought"", and ""the philosopher of the Islamic revolution"". 9/11: The attackers were influenced by Qutb's writings More than 35 years after he was hanged, the official commission of inquiry into al-Qaeda's 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers in 2001 concluded: ""Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalise even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defence of an embattled faith."" And his influence lingers on today. Summing up the roots of IS and its predecessors, the Iraqi expert on Islamist movements Hisham al-Hashemi said: ""They are founded on two things: a takfiri faith based on the writings of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, and as methodology, the way of Sayyid Qutb."" The theology of militant jihadism was in place. But to flourish, it needed two things - a battlefield, and strategists to shape the battle. Afghanistan was to provide the opportunity for both.  Rise of al-Qaeda The Soviet invasion in 1979, and the 10 years of occupation that followed, provided a magnet for would-be jihadists from around the Arab world. Some 35,000 of them flocked to Afghanistan during that period, to join the jihad and help the mainly Islamist Afghan mujahideen guerrillas turn the country into Russia's Vietnam. Soviet forces in Afghanistan, 1980 There is little evidence that the ""Afghan Arabs"", as they became known, played a pivotal combat role in driving the Soviets out. But they made a major contribution in setting up support networks in Pakistan, channelling funds from Saudi Arabia and other donors, and funding schools and militant training camps. It was a fantastic opportunity for networking and forging enduring relationships as well as tasting jihad first hand. Ironically, they found themselves on the same team as the Americans. The CIA's Operation Cyclone channelled hundreds of millions of dollars through Pakistan to militant Afghan mujahedeen leaders such as Golbuddin Hekmatyar, who associated closely with the Arab jihadists. It was in Afghanistan that virtually all the major figures in the new jihadist world cut their teeth. They helped shape events there in the aftermath of the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, a period that saw the emergence of al-Qaeda as a vehicle for a wider global jihad, and Afghanistan provided a base for it.  By the time the Taliban took over in 1996, they were virtually in partnership with Osama Bin Laden and his men, and it was from there that al-Qaeda launched its fateful 9/11 attack in 2001. The formative Afghan experience provided both the combat-hardened salafist jihadist leaders and the strategists who were to play an instrumental role in the emergence of the IS of today.  Most significant was the Jordanian jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who more than anybody else ended up being the direct parent of IS in almost every way.  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi A high-school dropout whose prison career began with a sentence for drug and sexual offences, Zarqawi found religion after being sent to classes at a mosque in the Jordanian capital, Amman. He arrived in Pakistan to join jihad in Afghanistan just in time to see the Soviets withdraw in 1989, but stayed on to work with jihadists.  After a stint back in Jordan where he received a 15-year jail sentence on terrorist charges but was later released in a general amnesty, Zarqawi finally met Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in 1999. By all accounts the two al-Qaeda leaders did not take to him. They found him brash and headstrong, and they did not like the many tattoos from his previous life that he had not been able to erase.  But he was charismatic and dynamic, and although he did not join al-Qaeda, they eventually put him in charge of a training camp in Herat, western Afghanistan. It was here that he worked with an ideologue whose radical writings became the scriptures governing subsequent salafist blood-letting: Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir. ""The brutality of beheading is intended, even delightful to God and His Prophet,"" wrote Muhajir in his book The Theology of Jihad, more generally referred to as the Theology of Bloodshed. His writings provided religious cover for the most brutal excesses, and also for the killing of Shia as infidels, and their Sunni collaborators as apostates. The other book that has been seen as the virtual manual - even the Mein Kampf - for IS and its forebears is The Management of Savagery, by Abu Bakr Naji, which appeared on the internet in 2004.  The Management of Savagery, a virtual manual for jihadists ""We need to massacre and to do just as has been done to Banu Qurayza, so we must adopt a ruthless policy in which hostages are brutally and graphically murdered unless our demands are met,"" Naji wrote. He was  referring to a Jewish tribe in seventh-century Arabia which reportedly met the same fate at the hands of early Muslims as the Yazidis of Sinjar did nearly 14 centuries later: the men were slaughtered, the women and children enslaved.  Naji's sanctioning of exemplary brutality was part of a much wider strategy to prepare the way for an Islamic caliphate. Based partly on the lessons of Afghanistan, his book is a detailed blueprint for provoking the West into interventions which would further rally the Muslims to jihad, leading to the ultimate collapse of the enemy.  The scenario is not so fanciful if you consider that the Soviet Union went to pieces barely two years after its withdrawal from Afghanistan.   Naji is reported to have been killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan's Waziristan province in 2008.  Iraq fiasco The fallout from the 9/11 attacks changed things radically for the jihadists in late 2001. The US and allies bombed and invaded Afghanistan, ousting the Taliban, and launching a wider ""War on Terror"" against al-Qaeda. Bin Laden went underground, and Zarqawi and others fled. The dispersing militants, fired up, badly needed another battlefield on which to provoke and confront their Western enemies.  Luck was on their side. The Americans and their allies were not long in providing it.  Their invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003 was, it turned out, entirely unjustified on its own chosen grounds - Saddam Hussein's alleged production of weapons of mass destruction, and his supposed support for international terrorists, neither of which was true.  Bombardment of Baghdad before the US-led invasion in 2003 By breaking up every state and security structure and sending thousands of disgruntled Sunni soldiers and officials home, they created precisely the state of ""savagery"", or violent chaos, that Abu Bakr Naji envisaged for the jihadists to thrive in.  Iraq was on the way to becoming what US officials came to call the ""parent tumour"" of the IS presence in the region. Under Saddam's tightly-controlled Baath Party regime, the Sunnis enjoyed pride of place over the majority Shia, who have strong ties with their co-religionists across the border in Iran.  The US-led intervention disempowered the Sunnis, creating massive resentment and providing fertile ground for the outside salafist jihadists to take root in.  They were not long in spotting their constituency. Abu Musab Zarqawi moved in, and within a matter of months was organising deadly, brutal and provocative attacks aimed both at Western targets and at the majority Shia community.  Doctrinal differences between the two sects go back to disputes over the succession to the Prophet Muhammad in the early decades of Islam, but conflict between them is generally based on community, history and sectarian politics rather than religion as such.  Setting himself up with a new group called Tawhid wa al-Jihad (Tawhid means declaring the uniqueness of Allah), Zarqawi immediately forged a pragmatic operational alliance with underground cells of the remnants of Saddam's regime, providing the two main intertwined strands of the Sunni-based insurgency: militant Jihadism, and Iraqi Sunni nationalism with Baathist organisation at its core.  His group claimed responsibility for several deadly attacks in August 2003 that set the pattern for much of what was to come: a suicide truck bomb explosion at the UN headquarters in Baghdad that killed the envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello and 20 of his staff, and a suicide car bomb blast in Najaf which killed the influential Shia ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim and 80 of his followers. The bombers were salafist jihadists, but logistics were reportedly provided by underground Baathists.  Zarqawi was behind the deadly 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad The following year, Zarqawi himself was believed by the CIA to be the masked killer shown in a video beheading an American hostage, Nicholas Berg, in revenge for the Abu Ghraib prison abuses of Iraqi detainees by members of the US military.  As the battle with the Americans and the new Shia-dominated Iraqi government intensified, Zarqawi finally took the oath of loyalty to Bin Laden, and his group became the official al-Qaeda branch in Iraq.  But they were never really on the same page. Zarqawi's provocative attacks on Shia mosques and markets, triggering sectarian carnage, and his penchant for publicising graphic brutality, were all in line with the radical teachings he had imbibed. But they drew rebukes from the al-Qaeda leadership, concerned at the impact on Muslim opinion.  Zarqawi paid little heed. His strain of harsh radicalism passed to his successors after he was killed by a US air strike in June 2006 on his hideout north of Baghdad. He was easily identified by the tattoos he had never managed to get rid of.  The direct predecessor of IS emerged just a few months later, with the announcement of the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) as an umbrella bringing the al-Qaeda branch together with other insurgent factions. But tough times lay ahead. In January 2007, the Americans began ""surging"" their own troops in Iraq from 132,000 to a peak of 168,000, adopting a much more hands-on approach in mentoring the rebuilt Iraqi army. At the same time, they enticed Sunni tribes in western al-Anbar province to stop supporting the jihadists and join the US-led Coalition-Iraqi government drive to quell the insurgency, which many did, on promises that they would be given jobs and control over their own security.  By the time both the new ISI and al-Qaeda leaders were killed in a US-Iraqi army raid on their hideout in April 2010, the insurgency was at its lowest ebb, pushed back into remote corners of Sunni Iraq.  They were both replaced by one man, about whom very little was publicly known at the time, and not much more since: Ibrahim Awad al-Badri, better known by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  Six eventful years later, he would be proclaimed Caliph Ibrahim, Commander of the Faithful and leader of the newly declared ""Islamic State"". Territorial takeover Baghdadi's career is so shrouded in mist that there are very few elements of it that can be regarded as fact. By all accounts he was born near Samarra, north of Baghdad, so the epithet ""Baghdadi"" seems to have been adopted to give him a more national image, while ""Abu Bakr"" evokes the first successor to (and father-in-law of) Prophet Muhammad. Like the original Abu Bakr, Baghdadi is also reputed to come from the Prophet's Quraysh clan. That, and his youth - born in 1971 - may have been factors in his selection as leader.  All accounts of his early life agree that he was a quiet, scholarly and devout student of Islam, taking a doctorate at the Islamic University of Baghdad. Some even say he was shy, and a bit of a loner, living for 10 years in a room beside a small Sunni mosque in western Baghdad.  The word ""charismatic"" has never been attached to him.  29 June 2014: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi makes a rare appearance in public As a youth, Baghdadi had a passion for Koranic recitation and was meticulous in his observance of religious law. His family nicknamed him The Believer because he would chastise his relatives for failing to live up to his stringent standards. Who is Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?  What has happened to Baghdadi? But by the time of the US-led invasion in 2003, he appears to have become involved with a militant Sunni group, heading its Sharia (Islamic law) committee. American troops detained him, and he was reportedly held in the detention centre at Camp Bucca in the south for most of 2004.  Camp Bucca (named after a fireman who died in the 9/11 attacks) housed up to 20,000 inmates and became a university from which many IS and other militant leaders graduated. It gave them an unrivalled opportunity to imbibe and spread radical ideologies and sabotage skills and develop important contacts and networks, all in complete safety, under the noses and protection of their enemies.  Baghdadi would also certainly have met in Camp Bucca many of the ex-Baathist military commanders with whom he was to form such a deadly partnership.  The low-profile, self-effacing Baghdadi rang no alarm bells with the Americans. They released him, having decided he was low-risk. Camp Bucca, 2008: A ""university"" for future IS leaders But he went on to work his way steadily up through the insurgent hierarchy, virtually unknown to the Iraqi public. By the time Baghdadi took over in 2010, the curtains seemed to be coming down for the jihadists in the Iraqi field of ""savagery"". But another one miraculously opened up for them across the border in neighbouring Syria at just the right moment. In the spring of 2011, the outbreak of civil war there offered a promising new arena of struggle and expansion. The majority Sunnis were in revolt against the oppressive regime of Bashar al-Assad, dominated by his Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam.  Baghdadi sent his men in. By December 2011, deadly car bombs were exploding in Damascus which turned out to be the work of the then shadowy al-Nusra Front. It announced itself as an al-Qaeda affiliate the following month. It was headed by a Syrian jihadist, Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani. He had been sent by Baghdadi, but had his own ideas. Jostling with a huge array of competing rebel groups in Syria, al-Nusra won considerable support on the ground because of its fearless and effective fighting skills, and the flow of funds and foreign fighters that support from al-Qaeda stimulated. It was relatively moderate in its salafist approach, and cultivated local relationships. Al-Nusra was slipping out of Baghdadi's control, and he didn't like it. In April 2013, he tried to rein it back, announcing that al-Nusra was under his command in a new Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (Syria or the Levant). Isis, or Isil, was born. IS flag: Arabic text of the first part of ""shahada"", the basic statement of the Islamic faith, and the seal of the Prophet below it During the short and turbulent period over which it has imposed itself as a major news brand, so-called Islamic State has confused the world with a series of name changes reflecting its mutations and changing aspirations, leaving a situation where there is no universal agreement on how to refer to it. After emerging in Iraq as the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI), its spread to Syria prompted the addition of ""and al-Sham"", a word that can mean Damascus, Syria, or the wider Levant Many chose to use the easy acronym Isis, with the ""S"" standing either for Syria or al-Sham, though the US administration and others opted for Isil (the ""l"" standing for ""Levant""). Both are still widely used though technically outdated In Arabic the same acronym can come out as Daash, sometimes spelled Daesh in English; it has passed into common usage among many Arabs, but is disliked by the organisation itself, which sees it as disrespectful of the ""state""; although Daash has no meaning in Arabic, it also has an unpleasant sound to it, which may be why American and Western officialdom often use it After further expansion of territory and ambitions, the movement dropped geographical specificity and called itself simply ""the Islamic State""; Much of the world was politically reluctant simply to call it that, for fear of implying legitimacy The BBC and others have generally opted for calling it the ""self-styled"" or ""so-called"" Islamic State on first reference, and IS thereafter But Jawlani rebelled, and renewed his oath of loyalty to al-Qaeda's global leadership, now under Ayman al-Zawahiri following Bin Laden's death in 2011. Zawahiri ordered Baghdadi to go back to being just the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) and leave al-Nusra as the al-Qaeda Syria franchise.  It was Baghdadi's turn to ignore orders from head office. Before 2013 was out, Isis and al-Nusra were at each other's throats. Hundreds were killed in vicious internecine clashes which ended with Isis being driven out of most of north-west Syria by al-Nusra and allied Syrian rebel factions. But Isis took over Raqqa, a provincial capital in the north-east, and made it its capital. Many of the foreign jihadists who had joined al-Nusra also went over to Isis, seeing it as tougher and more radical. In early 2014, al-Qaeda formally disowned Isis.  Isis had shaken off the parental shackles. But it had lost a lot of ground, and was bottled up. One of its main slogans, Remaining and Expanding, risked becoming empty. So where next? Fortune smiled once more. Back in Iraq, conditions had again become ripe for the jihadists. The Americans had gone, since the end of 2011. Sunni areas were again aflame and in revolt, enraged by the sectarian policies of the Shia Prime Minister, Nouri Maliki. Sunnis felt marginalised, oppressed and angry.  An IS fighter waves a flag while standing on a captured government fighter jet in Raqqa, Syria, 2015 When Isis decided to move, it was pushing at an open door. In fact, it had never really left Iraq, just gone into the woodwork. As it swept through Sunni towns, cities and villages with bewildering speed in June 2014, sleeper cells of salafist jihadists and ex-Saddamist militants and other sympathisers broke cover and joined the takeover.  With the capture of Mosul, Isis morphed swiftly into a new mode of being, like a rocket jettisoning its carrier. No longer just a shadowy terrorist group, it was suddenly a jihadist army holding large stretches of territory, ruling millions of people, and not only threatening the Iraqi state, but challenging the entire world. The change was signalled on 29 June by the proclamation of the ""Islamic State"", replacing all previous incarnations, and the establishment of the ""caliphate"". A few days later, the newly anointed Caliph Ibrahim, aka Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made a surprise appearance in Mosul in the pulpit of the historic Grand Mosque of al-Nuri, heavily laden with anti-Crusader associations. He called on the world's Muslims to rally behind him.  By declaring a caliphate and adopting the generic ""Islamic State"" title, the organisation was clearly setting its sights far beyond Syria and Iraq. It was going global.  Announcing a caliphate has huge significance and resonance within Islam. While it remains the ideal, Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders had always shied away from it, for fear of failure. Now Baghdadi was trumping the parent organisation, setting IS up in direct competition with it for the leadership of global jihadism.  A caliphate (khilafa) is the rule or rein of a caliph (khalifa), a word which simply means a successor - primarily of the Prophet Muhammad. Under the first four caliphs who followed after he died in 632, the Islamic Caliphate burst out of Arabia and extended through modern-day Iran to the east, into Libya to the west, and to the Caucasus in the north.  The Umayyad caliphate which followed, based in Damascus, took over almost all of the lands that IS would like to control, including Spain. The Baghdad-based Abbasid caliphate took over in 750 and saw a flowering of science and culture, but found it hard to hold it all together, and Baghdad was sacked by the Mongols in 1258. Emerging from that, the Ottoman Empire, based in Constantinople (Istanbul), stretched almost to Vienna at its peak, and was also a caliphate, though the distinction with empire was often blurred. The caliphate was finally abolished by Ataturk in 1924.  So when Baghdadi was declared Caliph of the Islamic State, it was an act of extraordinary ambition. He was claiming no less than the mantle of the Prophet, and of his followers who carried Islam into vast new realms of conquest and expansion.  For most Islamic scholars and authorities, not to mention Arab and Muslim leaders, such claims from the chief of one violent extremist faction had no legitimacy at all, and there was no great rush to embrace the new caliphate. But the millennial echoes it evoked did strike a chord with some Islamic romantics - and with some like-minded radical groups abroad.  Four months after the proclamation, a group of militants in Libya became the first to join up by pledging allegiance to Baghdadi, followed a month later by the Ansar Beit al-Maqdis jihadist faction in Egypt's Sinai. IS's tentacles spread deeper into Africa in March 2015 when Boko Haram in Nigeria took the oath of loyalty. Within a year, IS had branches or affiliates in 11 countries, though it held territory in only five, including Iraq and Syria. It was in those two core countries that Baghdadi and his followers started implementing their state project on the ground, applying their own harsh vision of Islamic rule. To the outside world, deprived of direct access to the areas controlled by IS, one of the most obvious and shocking aspects of this was their systematic destruction of ancient cultural and archaeological heritage sites and artefacts.  Satellite images show Palmyra's once majestic Temple of Bel before and after its destruction by Islamic State militants Some of the region's best-known and most-visited sites were devastated, including the magnificent temples of Bel and Baalshamin at Palmyra in Syria, and the Assyrian cities of Hatra and Nimrud in Iraq.  It wasn't just famous archaeological sites that came under attack. Christian churches and ancient monasteries, Shia mosques and shrines, and anything depicting figures of any sort were destroyed, and embellishments removed even from Sunni mosques. Barely a month after taking over Mosul, IS demolition squads levelled the 13th Century shrine of the Imam Awn al-Din, which had survived the Mongol invasion.  All of this was absolutely in line with IS's puritanical vision of Islam, under which any pictorial representation or shrine is revering something other than Allah, and any non-Muslim structures are monuments of idolatry. Even Saudi kings and princes to this day are buried without coffins in unmarked graves.  A video posted to YouTube in 2015 showed destruction of sculpted faces at Hatra By posting videos of many of these acts which the rest of the world saw as criminal cultural vandalism, IS also undoubtedly intended to shock. In that sense, it was the cultural equivalent of beheading aid workers.  And there was a more practical and profitable side to the onslaught on cultural heritage. In highly organised manner, IS's Treasury Department issued printed permits to loot archaeological sites, and took a percentage of the proceeds. That was just the tip of the iceberg of a complex structure of governance and control put in place as IS gradually settled into its conquests, penetrating into every aspect of people's lives in exactly the same way as Saddam Hussein's intelligence apparatus had done. Captured documents published by Der Spiegel in 2015, external give some idea of the role of ex-Baathist regime men in setting up and running IS in a highly structured and organised way, with much emphasis on intelligence and security. Residents of Sunni strongholds like Mosul and Falluja in Iraq, and Raqqa in Syria, found that IS operatives already knew almost everything about everybody when they moved in and took over in 2014.  At checkpoints, ID cards were checked against databases on laptops, obtained from government ration or employee registers. Former members of the security forces had to go to specific mosques to ""repent"", hand over their weapons and receive a discharge paper. ""At first, all they did was change the preachers in the mosques to people with their own views,"" said a Mosul resident who fled a year later.  ""But then they began to crack down. Women who had been able to go bare-headed now had to cover up, first with the headscarf and then with the full face-veil. Men have to grow beards and wear short-legged trousers. Cigarettes, hubble-bubble, music and cafes were banned, then satellite TV and mobile phones. Morals police [hisba] vehicles would cruise round, looking for offenders.""

They were stopped at an IS checkpoint,  the woman given a veil and allowed to go, while the driver was sent to an Islamic court, and sentenced to two months' detention and to memorise a portion of the Koran. If you fail to memorise, the sentence is repeated.  ""They have courts with judges, officials, records and files, and there are fixed penalties for each crime, it's not random,"" said the Falluja resident, speaking when IS still controlled the city. ""Adulterers are stoned to death. Thieves have their hands cut off. Gays are executed by being thrown off high buildings. Informers are shot dead, Shia militia prisoners are beheaded.""

School curricula were overhauled in line with IS precepts, with history rewritten, all images being removed from schoolbooks and English taken off the menu.  ""One thing you can say is this,"" said the Mosul resident after IS took over. ""There is absolutely no corruption, no wasta [knowing the right people and pulling strings]. They are totally convinced they are on the right track."" Map, purportedly produced by IS, showing group's aspirational takeover of all lands historically controlled by caliphates and Ottoman Empire One story tells a lot about IS and its ways.  As Iraqi security forces were pressing forward in areas around Ramadi in early 2016, civilians were fleeing the battle - and IS fighters, losing the day, were trying to sneak out too. Two women, running from the combat zone, approached a police checkpoint.  As they were being waved through to safety, one of the women suddenly turned to the police, pointed at the other, and said : ""This is not a woman. He's an IS emir [commander]."" The police investigated, and it was true. The other woman was a man, who had shaved, and put on makeup and women's clothes. He turned out to be top of the list of wanted local IS commanders.  ""When IS arrived, he killed my husband, who was a policeman, raped me, and then took me as his wife,"" the woman told the police. ""I put up with him all this time, waiting to avenge my husband and my honour,"" she said. ""I tricked him into shaving and putting on makeup, then denounced him to the police.""

She managed to escape the city and became a refugee in Europe, where she met up with the BBC.  This story is based on her experiences and those of her two sisters, who were still inside the city when it was held by IS.  Taking on the world Having taken over vast swathes of territory in Iraq with their lightning offensive in June 2014, the militants might have been expected to calm down and consolidate their gains.  But, like a shark that has to keep moving or else it will die, IS barely paused before initiating a new spiral of provocation and reprisals that was predictably to draw it into active conflict with almost all the major world powers.  Already, the June offensive had threatened the approaches to Baghdad, prompting the Americans to start bringing in hundreds of military advisers and trainers to see how to help the struggling Iraqi army.  Just two months later, the attack on Kurdish areas in the north triggered US air strikes in defence of the Kurdistan capital, Irbil, and then to help stave off the threat of genocide to the Yazidis. Fourteen other nations were to join the air campaign. Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters head to the Mosul dam (August, 2014 ) Ten days later, IS beheaded James Foley and the others followed, in line with the doctrine of exemplary brutality as punishment, deterrent and provocation. The most shocking was to come some months later, with the burning alive of the downed Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh. Shock intended.  The US-led bombing campaign was extended to Syria in September 2014 after IS besieged the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the Turkish border. Coalition air strikes turned the tide there. IS lost hundreds of fighters killed at Kobane and elsewhere. More revenge was called for. IS turned abroad. In the three years following the declaration of the ""caliphate"" in 2014, at least 150 attacks in 29 countries across the globe were either carried out or inspired by IS, with well over 2,000 victims killed.  The attacks carried the same message of punishment, deterrence and provocation as the hostage beheadings, while also demonstrating IS's global reach.  At the same time, they carried through the militants' doctrine of distracting the enemy by setting fires in different locations and making him squander resources on security. For IS, ""the enemy"" is everybody who does not embrace it. The world is divided into Dawlat al-Islam, the State of Islam, and Dawlat al-Kufr, the State of Unbelief.  The most consequential of these atrocities were the downing of a Russian airliner over Sinai on 31 October 2015 and the Paris attacks on 13 November, provoking both Russia and France to intensify air strikes on IS targets in Syria.  The lone-wolf massacre at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, on 12 June 2016, while apparently inspired rather than organised by IS, would undoubtedly further stiffen the US's already steely resolve to finish the organisation. Had IS gone mad? It seemed determined to take on the whole world. It was goading and confronting the Americans, the Russians, and a long list of others. By its own count, it had a mere 40,000 fighters at its command (other estimates went as low as half that).  A memorial to the victims of downed Airbus A321, at Pulkovo Airport in Russia, in November 2015 Could it really challenge the global powers and hope to survive? Or would President Barack Obama and his successor Donald Trump be able to fulfil Mr Obama's pledge to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" the organisation? Final showdown If there seemed to be something apocalyptic about IS's ""bring it on"" defiance, that's because there was. When the organisation first brought out its online magazine - a major showcase and recruitment tool - just a month after the ""caliphate"" was declared, it was not by chance that it was named Dabiq. A small town north of Aleppo in Syria, Dabiq is mentioned in a hadith (a reported saying of the Prophet Muhammad) in connection with Armageddon. In IS mythology, it is the scene where a cataclysmic showdown will take place between the Muslims and the infidels, leading to the end of days. Each issue of Dabiq begins with a quote from Abu Musab Zarqawi: ""The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify - by Allah's permission - until it burns the crusader armies in Dabiq."" Dabiq - Islamic State's online magazine The prospect of taking part in that final glorious climax, achieving martyrdom on the path of Allah and an assured place in paradise, is one of the thoughts inspiring those heeding the IS call to jihad.  That could help explain why the organisation seemed to enjoy an endless supply of recruits willing to blow themselves to pieces in suicide attacks, which it calls ""martyrdom-seeking operations"" (suicide is forbidden in Islam). Hundreds have died in this way, and they happen virtually daily.  It's been one of the elements that made IS a formidable fighting force hard to destroy even in strictly military terms.  Former Iraqi army officers have helped organise and direct IS IS is in many respects a project of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's outlawed Baath party, but now with a different ideology. Former agents or officers of Saddam Hussein's regime dominate its leadership... They represent a battle-hardened and state-educated core that would likely endure (as they have done through US occupation and a decade of war) even if the organisation's middle and lower cadres are decimated. What made IS so formidable? The head of security and intelligence for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, Masrour Barzani, tells the story of a frustrated would-be suicide bomber who screamed at his captors: ""I was just 10 minutes away from being united with the Prophet Muhammad!"" ""They think they're winners regardless of whether they kill you or they get killed,"" says Barzani. ""If they kill you, they win a battle. If they get killed, they go to heaven. With people like this, it's very difficult to deter them from coming at you. So really the only way to defeat them is to eliminate them."" Probably for the first time in military history since the Japanese kamikaze squadrons of World War Two, suicide bombers are used by IS not only for occasional terrorist spectaculars, but as a standard and common battlefield tactic. Virtually all IS attacks begin with one or several suicide bombers driving explosives-rigged cars or trucks at the target, softening it up for combat squads to go in. So much so that the ""martyrdom-seekers"" have been called the organisation's ""air force"", since they serve a similar purpose. Formidable though that is, IS as a fighting force is much more than a bunch of wild-eyed fanatics eager to blow themselves up. For that, they have Saddam Hussein to thank.  ""The core of IS are former Saddam-era army and intelligence officers, particularly from the Republican Guard,"" said an international intelligence official. ""They are very good at moving their people around, resupply and so on, they're actually much more effective and efficient than the Iraqi army are. That's the hand of former military staff officers who know their business."" ""They are very professional,"" adds Masrour Barzani. ""They use artillery, armoured vehicles, heavy machinery etc, and they are using it very well. They have officers who know conventional war and how to plan, how to attack, how to defend. They really are operating on the level of a very organised conventional force. Otherwise they'd be no more than a terrorist organisation."" The partnership with the ex-Baathists, going back to Zarqawi's early days in Iraq, was clearly a vital component in IS success.  But that did not mean its fighters were invincible on the battlefield, even in the early days of stunningly rapid expansion. The Kurds in north-east Syria were fighting IS off with no outside help for a year before anybody noticed. And even now, IS makes what would conventionally be seen as costly mistakes.  In December 2015, for example, they lost several hundred fighters in one abortive attack east of Mosul alone, and probably 2,500 altogether that month alone. Pentagon officials said coalition air strikes killed some 50,000 IS militants in Iraq and Syria between August 2014 and the end of 2016. But IS initially seemed to have little difficulty making up the numbers. With a population of perhaps 10 million acquiescent Sunnis to draw on, in Iraq and Syria, most recruiting was done locally. Clearly, had it remained in place, there would soon have been a new generation of young militants, external drawn from local sources.  This video can not be played Quentin Sommerville: ""They witnessed killing close at hand"" ""I didn't join out of conviction,"" says Bakr Madloul, a 24-year-old bachelor who was arrested in December at his home in a Sunni quarter in southern Baghdad and accused of taking part in deadly IS car bomb attacks on mainly Shia areas, which he admits. Bakr says he was working as a construction foreman in Kurdistan when IS took over Mosul. He was detained for questioning by Kurdish security, and met a militant in jail who persuaded him to go to Mosul, where he joined up with IS and manned a checkpoint until it was hit by a Coalition air strike.  He was then sent back to his Baghdad suburb to help organise car bombings. The explosives-packed vehicles were sent from outside Baghdad, and his job was to place them where he was told by his controller, usually in crowded streets or markets.  Bakr Madloul (left) pictured during his time as an IS operative ""Only one of the five car bombs I handled was driven by a suicide bomber,"" he says. ""I spoke to him. He was 22 years old, an Iraqi. He believed he would go to paradise when he died. It's the easiest and quickest way to Heaven. They strongly believe this. They would blow themselves up to get to Heaven. There were older ones in their 30s and 40s."" ""I asked my controllers more than once, 'Is it OK to kill women and children?'  They would answer, 'They're all the same.' But to me, killing women and children, I didn't feel at all comfortable about that. But once you're in, you're stuck. If you try to leave, they call you a murtadd, an apostate, and they'll kill you or your family."" Bakr knows he will almost certainly hang. Since we spoke, he has in fact been given two death sentences. I asked him if he would do the same things over if he had his life again. He laughed.  ""Absolutely not. I would get out of Iraq, away from IS, away from the security forces. I took this path without realising the consequences. There is no way back. I see that now."" Bakr Madloul knows he will probably be executed But up in Kurdistan, another IS prisoner, Muhannad Ibrahim, has no such regrets. A 32-year-old from a village near Mosul with a wife and three children, he was a construction worker for a Turkish company when IS took over the city. Two of his older brothers had died fighting the Americans there in 2004 and 2006. He joined IS without hesitation and was commanding a small detachment when he was captured in a battle with the Kurds.  ""We were being oppressed by the Shia, they were always insulting and bothering us,"" he says. ""But that's not the main motivation, religious conviction is more important. All my family is religious, praise be to Allah. I came to IS through my faith and religious principles."" ""If I had my time over again, I would take the same path, the same choices. Because I am convinced by this thing, I have to go to the end. Either I am killed, or Allah will decree some other fate for me."" Captured IS fighter Muhannad Ibrahim is unrepentant Rising to the challenge Just as the 9/11 Twin Towers atrocity in 2001 had left the US and its allies with no alternative but to strike back with extreme force, the challenge mounted by IS through its numerous provocative outrages in the region and around the world could not be ignored - nor was it meant to be. But rooting out the militants from Iraq and Syria was always going to be much more complex than the campaign unleashed more than a decade earlier against al-Qaeda and its Taliban hosts in Afghanistan.  There was never any real question of a wholesale Coalition invasion of either country. Air strikes were one thing, but putting in vast numbers of troops on the ground would be something else.  Syria was embroiled in a bewilderingly complicated civil war. Iraq was also in turmoil. US forces had only pulled out three years earlier. There was no appetite for a repeat of an invasion which was almost universally seen as a disastrous blunder with lasting consequences.  But uprooting the militants could not be done by air power alone. Reliable, motivated partner forces on the ground would be needed. In both countries, they were in short supply.  In Syria, the US and its allies were already engaged with some of the motley array of Syrian rebel groups. But they never amounted to the kind of focused, cohesive forces that the Coalition was looking for - they were fragmented, fractious, increasingly Islamist in tone, and largely bent on overthrowing the Assad regime rather than turning on IS.  In Iraq, the regular armed forces were in disarray after collapsing like a house of cards in the face of the onslaught on Mosul by a few hundred IS militants. Much work would have to be done to weld them into a motivated and competent fighting force.  In both countries it was to the Kurds in the north that the Americans and their Coalition partners first turned as their most hopeful immediate allies.  The Syrian Democratic Forces emerged as a reliable partner for the US in the fight against IS The Kurdish Peshmerga forces in northern Iraq had a long relationship with the Western Coalition powers. In 2003, US special forces fought alongside them to clear Islamist militants from mountain positions near the Iranian border just before the invasion against Saddam Hussein, in which they were partners.  Humiliated by the loss of vast areas of territory to the lightning IS assault in early August 2014, the Peshmerga needed no encouragement to hit back. Less than two weeks later, with Coalition air support, they recaptured the strategic Mosul dam.  In the months that followed, they slowly clawed back much of the ground they had lost, including Sinjar in November 2015, in operations closely co-ordinated with Coalition air strikes. But in the rest of Iraq, the picture was much messier. Iraqi government forces were able to halt the IS thrust southwards towards the capital, Baghdad, but made little early progress pushing back into the mainly Sunni areas where the militants had dug in.  It was Iranian-backed Shia militias, whose emergence was consolidated under the IS threat, that made the running in the initial phases of the campaign to oust the militants, driving them out of areas north-east of Baghdad near the Iranian border and pursuing them westwards until the eventual recapture of Saddam Hussein's hometown Tikrit in the Tigris river valley in March 2015.  ""If it weren't for Iran, the democratic experiment in Iraq would have fallen,"" said Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Iranian-backed Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups, known as the Hashd al-Shaabi or Popular Mobilisation (PM), that rose in defence of Baghdad and the south.  ""Obama was sleeping, and he didn't wake up until IS was at the gates of Irbil. When they were at the gates of Baghdad, he did nothing. Were it not for Iran's support, IS would have taken over the whole Gulf, not just Iraq."" But in the Sunni heartlands of Anbar province to the west of Baghdad the Iraqi state forces were struggling.  In May 2015, IS militants captured the provincial capital, Ramadi. At the same time, they spread their grip in Syria, taking the iconic city of Palmyra (Tadmur) in the desert east of Homs. It was a clear signal that while the organisation may have been dealt some setbacks it was still at the height of its powers and capable of exploiting any weaknesses it found.  But the Americans were quietly busy preparing for the real war on IS. They had poured billions into rebuilding the Iraqi army after 2003, only to see much of it go to pieces under pressure because so much was wrong with its foundations.  Now, putting in several thousand advisers, they focused on training and equipping the key Iraqi special forces - the Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS), otherwise known as the Golden Division - that was to play a crucial role spearheading the drive against the militants.  The systematic lashback began with Anbar province and the eventual recapture of Ramadi at the end of 2015 and early 2016, a grinding and costly operation with close Coalition air support. There was huge destruction and the displacement of most of the city's largely Sunni population. There were also tensions over the deployment of Iranian-backed, mainly Shia militias in core Sunni areas, though they were largely kept out of the city itself.  Pro-government forces patrol Ramadi The recapture of Ramadi tightened the noose around the even more iconic centre of Sunni sentiment at nearby Falluja, where militants had fought two major battles with the Americans in 2004. Government and PM forces began closing in around the city in early 2016, soon after taking Ramadi. By now, after a lot of testing and assessing, the Americans and their allies, working closely with local forces, were clearly embarked on a comprehensive strategy to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" IS wherever it could be found. The broad lines were spelled out in February 2016 by Lt Gen Sean McFarland, then the commanding general of the Coalition's Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve. ""The campaign has three objectives: to destroy the ISIL parent tumour in Iraq and Syria by collapsing its power centres in Mosul and Raqqa; two, to combat the emerging metastases of the ISIL tumour worldwide; and three, to protect our nations from attack."" Next step on the road to Mosul, the battle for Falluja was joined in late May 2016 and took just over a month of assaults, bombardments and air strikes to complete, with civilians again paying a heavy price. IS fighters deployed their full range of battle tactics, with snipers, booby-traps and suicide bombers making advance difficult and dangerous for the attacking forces.  Despite the attrition suffered by the Iraqi forces, especially the elite CTS forces, it was not long before eyes turned to the big prize - Mosul. With President Obama due to bow out early in the new year, the Americans were getting impatient.  In peacetime roughly 10 times the size of either Falluja or indeed the IS ""capital"" Raqqa, Mosul was never going to be an easy nut to crack. It had fallen to the militants in a matter of hours in 2014. By the time the government and Coalition campaign to dislodge them was finally launched in mid-October 2016, IS had had nearly two-and-a-half years to dig in and prepare its defences.  There is a moment in the journey into Raqqa when you leave the real world behind. After the bombed-out Samra bridge, any signs of normal life vanish. Turn right at the shop that once sold gravestones - its owner is long gone - and you are inside the city. Ahead lies nothing but destruction and grey dust and rubble. This is a place drained of colour, of life, and of people. In six days inside Raqqa, I didn't see a single civilian. The city fit for no-one Marshalled against a band of militants variously estimated at between 2,000 and 12,000 with a hard core probably closer to 4,000 or 5,000, was a vast assembly of government and auxiliary forces, estimated at around 100,000, counting regular army and federal police units, Kurdish Peshmerga forces, and the Popular Mobilisation, including some Sunni and minority volunteers as well as Shia militias. It was an epic battle that was to last nine months. Government forces slowly battered their way in around the city through dozens of outlying villages and finally into Mosul's eastern half, which was declared ""liberated"" towards the end of January 2017. Then it was on to the western side of the river and the old city, with its dense warren of narrow streets.  The area around the ancient Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdad had made his only public appearance as the newly-anointed ""caliph"", was the last to fall. The mosque was blown up, almost exactly three years after the declaration of the IS ""caliphate"". The evidence was that IS itself had destroyed it, rather than let it fall into ""infidel"" hands. The Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, saw this as ""official recognition of defeat"" by the militants. It signalled, he said, ""the collapse of the IS caliphate and a grand military victory"". This video can not be played The Iraqi military circulated a video it says shows the destruction of Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri. It was indeed a monumental achievement, a massive body-blow to the IS state project. The city had been, as a senior Western official in northern Iraq put it, ""the beating heart of IS"", in real terms much more important than Raqqa in Syria.  But it came at huge cost. The years of preparation and months of battering that it took to dislodge a few thousand militants stood in stark contrast to the ease with which they had rolled into the city virtually unopposed in June 2014. Some estimates put the number of civilians killed at more than 40,000. At least 1,200 Iraqi security personnel also died in battle. The damage was estimated at $50bn. Hundreds thousands of mainly Sunni inhabitants were displaced, and there were widespread allegations of abuses.  The weeks that followed saw a further rapid erosion of the group's territorial position in Iraq. By the end of August 2017, it had been driven out of Tal Afar, an important town controlling the main road from Mosul towards Syria. A month later, another long-standing IS pocket in and around the mainly Sunni town of Hawija, west of Kirkuk, was also largely overrun by government and auxiliary forces.  In Iraq, that left IS in control only of the area in and around the town of al-Qaim, on the River Euphrates by the Syrian border in the far west of Anbar province.  Its presence in the country had been very radically degraded. But the organisation was still far from destroyed. Across in Syria, the overall picture by the autumn of 2017 was roughly the same, despite the country's very different, extremely complex and fast-moving situation. In 2014 and 2015, IS had substantial holdings in Syria - it looked as though someone had spilled a bottle of black ink on its map. They controlled virtually the whole of Syria's stretch of the Euphrates, from Albu Kamal on the Iraqi border, up through Deir al-Zour and Raqqa, the Tabqa dam, and on to Jarablus on the border with Turkey, one of several crossings that were lifelines for the militants. They held towns and villages to the east and north of Aleppo (including the near-mythical Dabiq) and other pockets further south, including Palmyra and nearby oilfields.  But this heyday did not last. In Syria, IS found itself facing, not one motley coalition of enemies as in Iraq, but three.  The Americans, despairing of Syrian rebel groups whose interests lay elsewhere, adopted the experienced Syrian Kurdish fighters of the YPG, the Popular Protection Units, as their main on-the-ground partners. They added on as many Arab and minority fighters as they could find to produce the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), their favoured vehicle against IS in Syria. A cruise missile is fired from Russian ship in the Mediterranean Sea (Russian Defence Ministry handout) This did not go down at all well with the US's Nato ally Turkey, which sees the YPG and their parent political body, the Democratic Unity Party (PYD), as terrorists because of their affiliation to Turkey's own Kurdish rebels, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).  Often seeming to be working at cross-purposes to the Americans, Ankara set up its own coalition from among the Syrian opposition groups it had been backing and facilitating for years.  IS also received attention from a third coalition, grouping Syrian government forces, Iran and Russia. The Russians carried out air strikes against IS positions partly with the same kind of motivation as the Western Coalition - revenge for the downing by IS of the Russian airliner over Sinai in October 2015 - but their real strategic interest was different.   The Russians and Iranians were bent on securing their investment in the Assad regime, helping it restore its authority in the country, and pre-empting any move by the Americans and their allies to block a link-up between eastern Syria and western Iraq that would give Tehran a direct land connection from Iran all the way to Lebanon.  That thought may have been somewhere in Washington's head, but its primary concern was hitting and destroying IS.  Turkey for its part had a different overriding preoccupation: to prevent the Syrian Kurds from expanding and joining up the areas they controlled along the southern side of the Turkey-Syria border.  Despite these conflicting motivations, for IS the result was the same - pressure on many fronts. The US-backed SDF made the most headway, systematically whittling away IS assets step-by-step, but Turkey and Syrian government forces were also on the march.  As early as September 2014, US air strikes had helped prevent IS taking over the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the border with Turkey. After that, the SDF were pushing forward. By October 2016, IS had lost all access to the Turkish border, a huge logistical setback - virtually all foreign jihadists bound for both Syria and Iraq had come that way, apart from other advantages.  Smoke rises from a bombed building in Deir al-Zour The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels also played their part, taking over IS-held areas north and east of Aleppo - including Dabiq, which fell in a mundane enough manner with none of the apocalyptic ""burning of the Crusader armies"" heralded in IS mythology.  Gradually the militants' tide receded further and further down the Euphrates valley, with the SDF, backed by perhaps 2,000 US special forces with artillery and air power, doing most of the pushing. By November 2016, the SDF were in a position to launch a campaign to isolate and eventually attack the IS ""capital"", Raqqa. The assault on the city itself began in early June 2017.  By then, much of the population and many IS fighters had already fled, with most of the militants heading further downstream to the final major city largely under their control - another provincial capital, Deir al-Zour.  But before the recapture of Raqqa had been completed, Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian government forces were already thrusting towards Deir al-Zour, where a military base and airport had held out against the IS militants for almost three years. To get there, the government forces had recaptured Palmyra (for the second time) in March and pushed eastwards along the road to take Sukhna in August before reaching Deir al-Zour itself in September.  US-backed SDF forces had already bypassed the yet-to-fall Raqqa and moved into oil-rich areas to the east of Deir al-Zour, laying claim to oil and gasfields that would greatly bolster the Kurds' ambitions to run their own area in the north of the country - or at least strengthen their hand in eventual negotiations with Damascus. So as 2017 moved into its final months, IS territorial control in Syria seemed to be as doomed as it was in Iraq - bottled up in a small patch straddling the border around al-Qaim in western Iraq and Albu Kamal in Syria. Rooting the militants out from there would not necessarily be a simple task in a fiercely tribal area prone to defying governments.  But to all intents and purposes, the IS dream of administering and expanding a thriving Islamic state in the two countries as the core of a growing global caliphate had crashed in flames.  So had IS been virtually destroyed as well as severely degraded? Was it time to celebrate its demise?  It had certainly been dealt crippling blows in terms of functioning as a territorial state. That project lay in ruins. The administrative structures it had set up had been swept away. Major sources of finance had been cut off - from the oilfields it had controlled, taxes imposed on the millions of Iraqis and Syrians it had ruled, and cash coming in across the border with Turkey. It could no longer attract thousands of foreign jihadists or recruit locals to replace the 60,000 IS fighters the Americans believe have died since the heady days of June 2014.  With virtually all of their urban holdings lost, the militants were shrinking back into the shadows and deserts. Many of their leaders had also been killed, although Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi himself apparently eluded the hunt, issuing a defiant audio statement in September 2017. Among the known dead were Mohammed Emwazi, ""Jihadi John"", killed by a drone strike in Syria in late 2015. But all of this had been long foreseen by the leadership. In May 2016, the man regarded as the organisation's real Number Two, spokesman and head of external operations Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, made a lengthy statement already foreshadowing the next phase of IS existence.  ""You will never be victorious. You will be defeated,"" he told the Americans. ""Do you think that victory comes by killing one leader or another? That would be a fake victory!"" ""Or do you consider defeat to be the loss of a city or the loss of territory? Were we defeated when we lost the cities in Iraq [in 2007-8] and were in the desert without any city or land? And would we be defeated, and you victorious, if you were to take Mosul or Sirte or Raqqa, or even all the cities, and we were to return to our previous situation? Absolutely not! True defeat is the loss of will and desire to fight."" Abu Muhammad al-Adnani Adnani, who as spokesman had announced the birth of ""Islamic State"" and the caliphate in June 2014, may not have lost the will and desire to fight. But he did lose his life. He was killed by an American air strike near Aleppo in August 2016. He was right to suggest that the targeted killing of militant leaders has in general had little discernible impact on the course of movements, psychologically important though it may be.  But the Iraqi expert on radical movements, Hisham al-Hashemi, believes the case of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi might be different. The Americans are unlikely to rest until they have killed Baghdadi, not least because of their belief that he personally repeatedly raped an American NGO worker, Kayla Mueller, and then had her killed in early 2015. ""IS's future depends on Baghdadi,"" Hashemi said, speaking at a time when IS still controlled huge swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria.  ""If he is killed, it will split up. One part would stay on his track and announce a new caliphate. Another would split off and return to al-Qaeda. Others would turn into gangs following whoever is strongest."" ""The source of his strength is that he brought about an ideological transformation, blending jihadist ideas with Baathist intelligence security methods, enabling him to create this quasi-state organisation."" Baghdadi's death might not have such an impact in the new situation. But his special talents could come into their own again should conditions in either or both of those countries, or elsewhere, once again favour a comeback by the militants.  That is not so fanciful, even amid the smoking wreckage of the IS above-ground infrastructure.  In Iraq, the burning Sunni grievances against the Shia-dominated Baghdad government that allowed IS to make its astonishing advances in 2014 have not been seriously addressed. American officials are already referring to the danger of an ""AQI-2"" emerging - a second al-Qaeda in Iraq. It has happened before.  The wholesale destruction of Sunni towns and cities in the drive against IS and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Sunnis may even have aggravated those grievances, providing fertile ground for militants to infiltrate back.  There is an optimistic argument that the united cross-sectarian effort that it took to drive the militants out may have sown the seeds of a new Iraqi nationalism. But the fact remains that the Sunni community has been crushed, and the Shia majority dominates both politically and through the proliferation of its powerful militias. Political leaderships in Baghdad have signally failed to promote any serious national reconciliation since 2003.  ""IS was essentially an Iraqi creation,"" said a senior Western intelligence official, speaking shortly before the militants were ousted from Mosul.  ""The tragic reality is that at the moment, it is the main Sunni political entity in Iraq. From the West, it's looked at as a kind of crazed cult. Here in Iraq it represents an important constituency. It represents a massive dissatisfaction, the alienation of a whole sector of the population."" Thousands of IS cases are being tried in courts like Nineveh Criminal Court in Qaraqosh (above) A young man wearing a shabby, brown prisoner's outfit stands before three black-robed judges in a tiny, provincial courtroom, shaking nervously. After sipping some water, he confirms his name: Abdullah Hussein. He is accused of fighting for so-called Islamic State (IS). ""The decision of the court has been taken according to articles 2 and 3 of the 2005 Counterterrorism Law,"" states the judge. ""Death by hanging."" And then Hussein - who, like many suspects here, was picked up on the Mosul frontline - breaks down crying. Inside the Iraqi courts sentencing IS suspects to death Much work remains to be done if that sobering assessment is to be reversed. And Baghdad meanwhile faces multiple challenges that might help tip it back into the state of chaos in which the militants could thrive.  The state's coffers are empty at a time when the reconstruction bill is estimated conservatively at $100bn. Corruption is endemic. Apart from the Sunni issue, Baghdad politics is in turmoil, with deep rivalries between Shia factions with greater or lesser attachment to Iran. And the threat of secession by the Kurds in the north, after the September 2017 independence referendum, could bring further instability.  The very least that could be expected post-Mosul was an indefinite period of low-level insurgency, with bomb blasts and suicide attacks in different parts of the country, especially aimed, as before, at mainly Shia areas. It was already happening. The US military's Combating Terrorism Center reported that by mid-2017 there was already an average of 130 insurgent attacks taking place monthly in the ""liberated"" eastern half of Mosul.  And it was already happening next door in Syria too, with IS carrying out random deadly explosions in Damascus and elsewhere despite its stark loss of territory. Although it was obvious by late 2017 that the Assad government with its Russian and Iranian backers were prevailing, the final pattern of control and governance country-wide remained uncertain.  There were many ways in which further turmoil could ensue, not least the fact that, with US support, Kurdish forces had spread well beyond their own demographic comfort zone, causing huge resentment among some Sunni elements. As in Iraq, many Syrian Sunnis were bound to feel aggrieved by everything that had happened since the civil war broke out in 2011.  And where there were grievances, IS or its successors would surely be there to build on them.  Capitalising on chaos IS had in any case been busy spreading its bets and developing other territorial possibilities beyond the ""parent tumour"" of Iraq and Syria.  Libya initially proved the most promising. It had just the kind of failed-state anarchy, the state of ""savagery"", that left room for the jihadists to move in, forging alliances with local militants and disgruntled supporters of the overthrown regime of Muammar Gaddafi, just as they had done in Iraq. IS signalled its arrival there in typical style, issuing a polished video in February 2015 showing a group of 21 bewildered Egyptian Christian workers in orange jumpsuits being beheaded on a Libyan beach, their blood mingling with the waters of the Mediterranean as a warning to the ""Crusader"" European countries on the other side of the sea that radical Islam was on the way. The man who voiced that warning was believed to be the IS leader in Libya, an Iraqi called Wissam al-Zubaydi, also known as Abu Nabil. By coincidence, Zubaydi was killed in a US air strike on the same day IS struck in Paris, 13 November 2015.  A Libyan security official at a site used by so-called Islamic State near Sirte The militants took over a big stretch of the coast and the central city of Sirte, which was to Muammar Gaddafi what Tikrit was to Saddam Hussein. Another American air strike in February killed (among nearly 50 other people) Noureddine Chouchane, reputedly an IS figure responsible for the deadly attacks on Western tourists in his native Tunisia.  But the IS presence in Libya soon came under pressure, with militias loyal to the Government of National Accord, which been born out of UN efforts, dislodging the militants from Sirte in the second half of 2016.  But they did not disappear. The Americans launched an air strike on IS elements south of Sirte in October 2017, their first such action in Libya since President Trump took over.  The militants were undoubtedly on the defensive in Libya. But it remained a deeply fragmented country, and its new government far from powerful or universally accepted. There would likely continue to be pockets of chaos there for the jihadists to exploit. And there was no shortage of other possibilities being actively explored and developed - Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, the Philippines, Nigeria... wherever there were dysfunctional states and angry Muslims, there would be opportunities for IS, competing strongly with a diminished al-Qaeda as a dominant brand in the jihadist market. Adding the extra risk for the West, that that competition could be another spur for spectacular terrorist attacks which they know are being actively plotted.  Long before IS lost almost all its territorial gains in Iraq and Syria, it was clear that the organisation, while trying its best to hold ground wherever it could, was trying to stay alive and assert itself (""Remaining and Expanding"") in other ways - renewed insurgency in the lost lands, constant propaganda and proselytising on the internet, and above all, a revitalised push to carry out acts of terror in the West, the more shocking the better.   As early as September 2014, just as IS was embarking on its provocative confrontation with the West, spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani urged the movement's followers in graphic detail to kill the hated infidels. ""If you can kill a disbelieving American or European - especially the spiteful and filthy French - or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other of the unbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be. Smash his head with a rock, slaughter him with a knife, run him over with your car, throw him down from a high place, choke him or poison him."" In his statement in May 2016, al-Adnani signalled the organisation's new stress on attacks inside Western countries in response to the drive against it in Iraq and Syria.  ""Truly, the smallest act you do in their lands is more beloved to us than the biggest act done here; it is more effective for us and more harmful to them... Know that your targeting those who are called ""civilians"" is more beloved to us and more effective, as it is more harmful, painful, and a greater deterrent to them."" Attacks in Europe and elsewhere intensified almost in direct proportion to IS' loss of terrain in Iraq and Syria. Among the more notable were the truck assault in Nice, France, in July 2016 (at least 86 killed) and a similar attack in Berlin in December (12 killed), the Istanbul nightclub bombing in January 2017 (39 killed), and two vehicle and knife attacks in London in March and June 2017 (15 killed).  The attacks in London broke new ground for IS, and even more so the suicide bomb attack at the Manchester Arena in May 2017 in which more than 20 people died. A van attack in Barcelona in August in which 13 people were killed was also seen as an advance for the militants.  Twenty-two people were killed in the Manchester bombing in 2017 These kinds of attacks, often carried out by ""lone wolves"" and involving everyday implements that are impossible to control, were clearly a nightmare for security services.  Their job was made all the more challenging by studies showing that fewer than 20% of  ""successful"" attacks in Europe and North America were carried out by jihadists who had gone to Syria or Iraq, and that most were perpetrated by citizens of the countries under attack.  While IS had managed to plant a small number of activists in the crowds of refugees and asylum seekers besieging the gates of Europe and the West, simply vetting them carefully would obviously not be enough.  Clearly, IS internet messaging was still powerful, resonating among the disaffected, the resentful, the alienated and disempowered.  The Americans, focusing largely on the military defeat of the militants, seemed taken aback by IS's ability to keep up and even expand the challenge.  ""When I consider how much damage we've inflicted and they're still operational, they're still capable of pulling off things like some of these attacks we've seen internationally, we have to conclude that we do not yet fully appreciate the scale or strength of this phenomenon,"" said Lt Gen Michael Nagata, one of the top US Special Operations officers, quoted by the Combating Terrorism Center.  ""We spend an inordinate amount of time and resources as the United States, but also as our partners, trying to not only defeat ISIS and their control of the physical caliphate, but their virtual space that they own,"" added Thomas P Bossert, President Trump's adviser on homeland security and counter-terrorism adviser.  ""They're proselytizing. It's troubling."" Clearly, tackling such a vague, ethereal and pervasive threat was a far cry from the clear-cut task of confronting IS fighters on the battlefield. The threat was not going to go away. Cyber-inspired lone wolf attacks could materialise at almost any time, any place. The price of relative safety would be eternal vigilance.  Battle for minds The US and its allies were starting to come to grips with the cyber dimension of the challenge - and giving much less priority to the crucial problem of poor governance in the countries whose dysfunctionalities provided opportunities for the radicals to take root.  But there were other parts of IS' complicated root system that were even harder to get at. The New York-based security consultancy Soufan Group estimated that more than half of the 27,000 foreign jihadists making their way to Syria and Iraq in the first 18 months of the ""Islamic State"" were from the Middle East and North Africa.  Clearly, the ""Caliphate"" had appeal, despite - perhaps in some cases, because of - its graphically publicised brutality. While vowing to degrade and destroy the organisation, President Obama put his finger on the real challenge: ""Ideologies are not defeated with guns, they are defeated by better ideas, a more attractive and more compelling vision,"" he said. On a relatively normal day... there was a total of 50 distinct pieces of propaganda. The photo reports and videos included depictions of an IS offensive in northern Syria and eulogies for the dead in Salahuddin... Overwhelmingly, though, the propagandists were preoccupied with a carefully refined view of 'normal' life. Fishing and ultraviolence The problem is that when disenchanted people in the region look around them - especially the young, the idealistic, or the hopeless unemployed who have no future - they see scant evidence of ""better ideas"" or attractive and compelling visions. They see the ruins of an ""Arab Spring"" which raised hopes only to dash them cruelly. The brutal, corrupt dictatorships which it shook have either fragmented into chaos and sectarian and tribal upheaval, like Syria itself, Libya, Yemen and (with Western intervention) Iraq, or the sinister ""deep states"" of their former regimes came back, even more harshly in the case of Egypt, less so in the case of Tunisia. While many of the European jihadists may have heeded the call for other reasons, socio-economic factors play an important part in radicalising some of the Arab jihadists, and will continue to do so unless addressed. Unidentified IS fighter Mohammed is giddy with excitement as he films the discovery of three IS fighters on his mobile phone. ""Shoot him,"" he shouts, gesturing at one of them. His nervousness gives him away as the unit's cook. He's unarmed, but his fellow soldiers from the Iraqi police special forces - known as the Emergency Response Division - are armed to the teeth and are not taking any chances. The secret lives of young IS fighters One of the biggest contingents is from Tunisia, where a detailed survey, external in the poorest suburbs of the capital Tunis showed clearly that the radicalisation of young people there had far less to do with extreme Islamic ideology as such than it did with unemployment, marginalisation and disillusion after a revolution into which they threw themselves, but which gave them nothing, and left them hopeless.  IS is also filling a desert left by the collapse of all the political ideologies that have stirred Arab idealists over the decades. Many used to travel to the Soviet Union for training and tertiary education, but communism is now seen as a busted flush. Arab socialism and Arab nationalism, which caused such excitement in the 1950s and 1960s, mutated into brutal, corrupt ""republics"" where sons were groomed to inherit power from their fathers.  In this vacuum, IS took up the cause of punishing the West and other outsiders for their actions in the region over the past century:  the carve-up by the colonial powers 100 years ago, drawing  a border between Iraq and Syria which IS has now erased  the creation of Israel under the British mandate for Palestine, and its subsequent unswerving political and financial support by the US Western (and indeed Russian) backing for corrupt and tyrannical Arab regimes the Western invasion and destruction of Iraq on the flimsiest of pretexts, with the death of uncounted thousands of Iraqis the Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo prisoner abuse scandals.... The roots of IS also lie in a crisis within Islam.  ""Isil is not Islamic,"" said President Obama, echoing statements by many Western leaders that ""IS has nothing to do with Islam"". But it has. ""It is based on Islamic texts that are reinterpreted according to how they see it,"" says Ahmad Moussalli, professor of politics at the American University of Beirut. ""I don't say they are not coming out of Islamic tradition, that would be denying facts. But their interpretation is unusual, literal sometimes, very much like the Wahhabis.""  Hisham al-Hashemi, the Iraqi expert on radical groups, agrees. ""Violent extremism in IS and the salafist jihadist groups is justified, indeed blessed, in Islamic law texts relied on by IS and the extremist groups. It's a crisis of religious discourse, not of a barbaric group. Breaking up the religious discourse and setting it on the right course is more important by far than suppressing the extremist groups militarily.""   Because ancient texts can be interpreted by extremists to cover their worst outrages does not implicate the entire religion, any more than Christianity is defined by the Inquisition, where burning at the stake was a stock penalty.  Extremist ideas remain in the dark, forgotten  corners of history unless their time comes. And IS time came, with Afghanistan, Iraq, and everything that followed.  ""Salafism is spreading in the world, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Arab countries,"" says Prof Moussalli.  He blames the Saudis for stifling the emergence of a moderate, democratic version of Islam, the ""alternative Islamic discourse"" to salafism that President Obama wanted to see. ""A moderate Islamic narrative today is a Muslim Brotherhood narrative, which has been destroyed by the Gulf states supporting the military coup in Egypt,"" says Prof Moussalli, referring to the Egyptian military's ousting of the elected President Mohammed Morsi, a senior Muslim Brotherhood figure, in July 2013.  ""We lost that opportunity with Egypt. Egypt could have paved the way for real change in the area. But Saudi Arabia stood against it, in a very malicious way, and destroyed the possibility of changing the Arab regimes into more democratic regimes that accept the transfer of power peacefully. They don't want it."" Saudi Arabia's ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment and its constant propagation have raised ambiguity over its relations with radical groups abroad. Enemies and critics have accused it of producing the virulent strain of Wahhabism that inspires the extremists, and even of supporting IS and other ultra-salafist groups.  But Jamal Khashoggi, a leading Saudi journalist and writer who spent time in Afghanistan and knew Bin Laden, says that simply is not true ""We are at war with IS, which sees us as corrupt Wahhabis."" he says.  ""IS is a form of Wahhabism that has been suppressed here since the 1930s. It resurfaced with the siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979 and spread here and there. But Saudi Arabia didn't back it at all, it saw it as a threat. So it's true that salafism can turn radical, just as the US right-wing produces some crazy lunatics."" Hundreds of people died in a two-week siege when extremist salafists took over the Grand Mosque, the holiest place in Islam, in protest at what they saw as the Kingdom's deviation from the true path.  More recently, Saudi Arabia's security forces and its Shia minority have in fact been the target of attacks by IS, and the kingdom has executed captured militants. It has an active deradicalisation programme.  This video can not be played Saudi Arabia's 'creative' approach to de-radicalisation But the Kingdom's extreme conservatism, its distaste for democracy, and its custodianship of the shrines in Mecca and Medina to which millions of Muslims make pilgrimage every year, have made it one of the main targets for calls for a hard-to-achieve reformation within Islam as part of the battle to defeat IS and other extremist groups.  The winds of change do now seem to be starting to blow through the desert kingdom, with cautious reforms behind which the young Crown Prince, Muhammad Bin Salman, is seen as the driving force.  Although the 2017 decree allowing women to drive caused a stir, it remains to be seen how deep such changes can go in a country where the grip of the ultra-conservative clergy is still strong, and where official primary schoolbooks still teach that all religions apart from Islam are ""false"".  Changing some of the fundamental interpretations of religion is a monumental undertaking that could take generations. But it cannot come fast enough for a senior Sunni politician in Iraq.  ""We must accept the fact that Islam has a crisis,"" he says. ""IS is not a freak. Look at the roots, the people, the aims. If you don't deal with the roots, the situation will be much more dangerous. The world has to get rid of IS, but needs a new deal: reformation, in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, al-Azhar [the ancient seat of Sunni Islamic learning and authority in Cairo].""   ""You can't kill all the Muslims. You need an Islamic reformation. But Saudi and Qatari money has been blotting out the voices so we can't get anywhere. It's the curse of the Arab world - too much oil, too much money."" Sunni Axis v Shia Crescent The demise of the IS as a ""state"" straddling Iraq and Syria has huge geo-strategic implications, few of them positive for the US and its regional allies.  While President Trump railed and tweeted against the evil of Iran and its sponsorship of terrorism, Tehran was quietly benefitting from everything the Americans were doing against IS.  They were non-speaking, arms-length partners in the campaign against the militants in Iraq. US air power, training and hardware directly helped the official Iraqi forces. But the Iranian-backed Shia militias played their part in a series of campaigns ending in a victory which greatly expanded their presence. The rise and fall of the IS phenomenon in Iraq left Iran's influence there stronger than ever.  While the distance between the American and Iranian roles in Syria was even bigger, with Iran on the side of the regime and the US originally backing the rebels, both were fighting IS, and its defeat would ultimately benefit the Assad regime and its Iranian backers. The Americans and their Coalition allies will not be around forever. Iran and its local allies will.  Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups The US had little choice but to do what it did. The superpower could not allow itself to be goaded and provoked with impunity.  But it had earlier opened the floodgates to Iranian influence through a war that was purely elective, a war of choice and ambition rather than necessity: the invasion of Iraq in 2003, launched on pretexts (Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction and his support for terrorism) that turned out to be totally spurious.  By dismantling the Iraqi state in 2003, the US-led coalition was breaking down the bulwark that had contained Iran, the region's Shia superpower, seen as a threat by the Saudis and most of their Sunni Gulf partners since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. The empowerment of the majority Shia community in Iraq after 2003 gave Iran unrivalled influence over Iraqi politics. For years, it had been backing anti-Saddam Iraqi Shia factions in exile. Now they came home to rule the roost.  The arrival of the IS threat led to even more Iranian influence, through the arming, training and directing of the burgeoning Iraqi Shia militias.  For Saudi Arabia and its allies, Iranian penetration in Iraq threatens to establish, indeed largely has, a Shia crescent linking Iran, Iraq, Syria under its minority Alawite leadership, and Lebanon dominated by the Iranian-created Shia faction, Hezbollah. From the outset of the war in Syria in 2011, the regional Sunni powers - the Saudis and their Gulf partners, and Turkey - backed the Sunni rebels in the hope that the overthrow of Assad would establish Sunni majority rule. A north-south Sunni axis running from Turkey through Syria to Jordan and Saudi Arabia would split the Shia crescent and foil the Iranian project, as they saw it. That is essentially what IS did in 2014, when it moved back into Iraq, took Mosul and virtually all the country's Sunni areas, and established a Sunni entity that straddled the suddenly irrelevant border with Syria, blocking off Shia parts of Iraq from Syria. Now that Sunni stake through the heart of the Shia crescent has been removed by the military defeat of IS and the failure of the Saudis, Turks and others - all American allies - to bring about regime change in Damascus.  It's intriguing to wonder what would have happened had IS halted its advances and provocations after the seizure of Mosul in 2014, toned down its rhetoric, perhaps made some local compromises and accommodations.  Just after the fall of Mosul, I asked the Iraqi Kurdistan President, Masoud Barzani, whether he could live with his new neighbours.  ""You don't choose your neighbours,"" was his reply. But five weeks later, IS attacked and overran his areas, threatening the Kurdistan capital Irbil, and inflicting genocide on the Yazidis.  ""Had they not become international terrorists and stayed local terrorists, they could have served the original agenda of dividing the Arab east so there would be no Shia crescent,"" says Prof Moussalli. We may never fully understand why IS did it. Perhaps its virulent strain of Salafism just had to keep pushing outwards: ""Remaining and Expanding"". The Islamic State in its original form has been smashed. But for all the reasons that brought it about, IS and everything it represented will still be around in one form or another for a very long time to come.

Helen Yang, 29, and Thomas Etheridge, 26, from Croydon, were inspired by the Instagram rainbow challenge, which sees people dress in a certain colour each day and take a picture.  The trend began when pictures of rainbows drawn by schoolchildren appeared in windows across the UK during the coronavirus lockdown. It has since evolved to see London fashion editors and influencers Natalie Wall and Zeena Shah task Instagrammers with experimenting with multi-coloured attire. But to keep entertained during lockdown, Helen and Thomas wanted to do something a bit different.  ""Thomas and I were excited by the idea of searching for the right coloured outfit for each day's photo. We didn't stop there though,"" Helen said. Thomas, who has a background in costume design and fine art, was inspired to use the challenge as a way to play around with characters and props, Helen said. ""[The challenge] became a sort of family project as we all looked around the house and in the garage each day for the appropriate items,"" she added. ""It was like a treasure hunt."" Helen said her family began seeing things in the house and garage that they had not noticed before. ""It was great fun,"" she said. The pair said they were ""pleased and overwhelmed"" at the response they have received to their posts on Instagram. Helen said: ""Quite a few people told us how they looked forward to seeing our new photo each day and that the photos cheered them up a bit.  ""This helped us to feel connected with the outside world at a time when we're all so far apart."" Photos by Helen and Thomas Etheridge. "
Spread to US Treasury,US airlines to receive $25bn rescue package,2024-09-25,2020-04-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52288860,"The US has agreed a roughly $25bn (£19.8bn) rescue package for 10 of the country's biggest airlines as travel plunges due to the coronavirus. American Airlines, United, Delta and Southwest are among the recipients. The money is to be used for payroll and will be provided through a combination of low-cost loans and direct grants.  Congress had planned for the aid as part of its roughly $2tn emergency relief bill last month, but airlines had been negotiating the deal. Under terms outlined by the US Treasury Department last week, major airlines were expected to repay about 30% of the payroll funds they receive. Congress had also included conditions when it crafted the emergency aid law, such as prohibitions against involuntary furloughs and bars on reducing worker pay and benefits until the end of September.  The terms also limit share repurchases until the end of September 2021 and executive pay until the end of March 2022. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday said the airline deal would ""support American workers and help preserve the strategic importance of the airline industry while allowing for appropriate compensation to the taxpayers"". ""We look forward to working with the airlines to finalise the necessary agreements and disburse funds as quickly as possible."" Confirmation that the airlines would use the payroll bailout lifted industry shares in after-hours trading, sending American Airlines up more than 8% and United Airlines up more than 7%.  American Airlines boss Doug Parker said his company expects to receive more than $10bn in support, including$5.8bn in payroll funds, of which it expects about $4.1bn is set to be a grant. The firm will also apply for a government loan through a different programme. ""The support our government has entrusted to us carries immense responsibility and an obligation that American Airlines is privileged to undertake,"" American chief executive Doug Parker said. Other companies set to receive aid include Southwest which said it would receive a total of $3.2bn, including $2.3bn in payroll support. Global airlines group IATA has forecast more than $300bn in losses related to the coronavirus and warned that some 25 million jobs are at risk.  In the US travel has dropped more than 95%, leading to widespread cancellations, fleet groundings and billions in losses. However, the industry had faced criticism for spending money in recent years to repurchase shares, instead of investing the money back into the company or it workers. Politicians have also been worried that bailouts of private firms will lead to controversy as happened during the 2008 financial crisis. The labour union that represents flight attendants, the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA International, said it believed Congress had intended airlines to receive all $25bn in payroll support in the form of grants but it nevertheless welcomed news that the industry and the White House had come to terms. ""We are closer than ever to almost a million airline workers knowing they will receive their pay cheque and keep their healthcare and other benefits, at least through September,"" the group's president, Sara Nelson, said. ""This is an unprecedented accomplishment - a truly workers-first stimulus."" At the beginning of April, 250 trades unions and environmental groups signed an open letter opposing unconditional bailouts of airlines."

Clarissa started to sleep at Granny's on Friday nights so her mum and dad could have a date night. Since then, the pair have spent the school holidays together and go on trips to Cornwall. So when Denise started to feel depressed after developing an aneurysm in her brain, Clarissa, who is now four, really noticed. And she took matters into her own hands. ""She decided to do something special to cheer up Granny,"" Clarissa's mum, Felicity Greenfield, who is 23 and lives in Derbyshire, says. ""Clarissa has a lot of special memories with my mum and cares very deeply for her. There hasn't been a day in Clarissa's life when they haven't spoken.

Spread to US Treasury,'Lives at risk' over Manchester Covid tier delay,2024-09-25,2020-10-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54594885,"Further delays to a decision on Greater Manchester's Covid restrictions will ""put people's lives at risk"", the communities secretary has said. Robert Jenrick said he hoped he could reach an agreement with the region's MPs ""in the next day or two"". Local leaders want better financial support before agreeing to a move to the top tier of rules, which would force some businesses to close. Talks are continuing after a weekend of discussions. Mr Jenrick indicated that Greater Manchester could be offered a financial package similar to the ""tens of millions"" of pounds of support agreed for Lancashire and the Liverpool City Region - the two parts of England already in tier three. A key sticking point of the dispute is that Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham wants the government to reintroduce the 80% furlough scheme used during the UK's first lockdown, instead of the new Job Support Scheme which covers 67% of the wages of people affected by tier three closures.  Mr Burnham said businesses that would be closed under the highest level of coronavirus restrictions - including pubs, bookmakers and gyms - ""are places where people are on low wages"" and that two-thirds pay is not enough. But Mr Jenrick told BBC Breakfast the Manchester talks had gone on ""too long"" as coronavirus case numbers remain ""seriously high"". ""Delay I'm afraid will only make the situation worse, will only put people's lives at risk, and will only make the economic fallout for the city worse in the long term,"" he added. ""We do now need to take action. I hope that we can reach agreement but one way or another, we need to draw this to a conclusion."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that he might ""need to intervene"" if local leaders did not accept a move to tier three. Meanwhile, people in Wales will be told from Friday to stay at home, and pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut, as part of a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown until 9 November. It comes as a two-week school closure begins in Northern Ireland as part of a tightening of restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. Scotland continues to draw up plans for a three-tier framework of restrictions, similar to England's, to account for regional differences in Covid rates and isolate areas of higher prevalence. On Monday the UK recorded a further 18,804 coronavirus cases and 80 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.  BBC deputy political editor Vicki Young said Treasury sources insisted Greater Manchester would not get a more generous offer on wages than the Job Support Scheme provides, but pointed to other financial support packages agreed with tier three areas. On Sunday, Liverpool City Region's metro mayor Steve Rotheram said his area would receive an additional £44m and a similar package worth £42m was given to local leaders in Lancashire last week. Mr Burnham said he had a ""constructive call"" with the PM's team on Sunday, but on Monday morning he told Sky News: ""I'm not going to roll over at the sight of a cheque."" Nottingham's Labour council leader David Mellen has also called for more support for businesses in the city if it is moved to tier three.  However, the Labour leader of Manchester City Council, Sir Richard Leese, said the row was not just about money and questioned the effectiveness of ""blanket"" business closures, instead suggesting a shielding programme for those most at risk from Covid-19. And mayors and council leaders in the Liverpool City Region have written to the prime minister asking for an ""immediate review"" of the decision to close gyms and leisure centres in the area as part of tier three measures, pointing out that in Lancashire, which is also in tier three, they have not been required to close.  They are calling on the government to provide the scientific evidence supporting the move and if they are unable to do so, allow them to reopen.  When an area goes in to tier three - the ""very high alert"" category - this unlocks enhanced financial support from the government. In the Liverpool City Region, some of the funds will be used both to bolster contact tracing, to enhance compliance, and to support people who are clinically extremely vulnerable.   This is worth £14m - and a similar package in Lancashire is worth £12m. But following negotiations, both areas have also been given a further £30m in ""business support"". Whitehall sources have told the BBC that Greater Manchester would be offered no less generous terms than Lancashire or Liverpool. On a per capita basis, that could mean potentially £70-80m being made available from central government, in return for enhanced restrictions. Talks are also under way between the government and local authority leaders in South Yorkshire. Council leaders want a package of support to include more resources for the NHS in the area - and are clear they won't be ""bounced"" into accepting a move to tier three. Dr Indeewar Kapila, an intensive care consultant in Greater Manchester, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that critical care units have capacity at the moment but Manchester's rate - which was 431 cases per 100,000 in the week to 13 October - was ""extremely high"". The prime minister's official spokesman said in Greater Manchester the number of new cases in people over the age of 60 had tripled in the most recent 15 days of full data - from 89 cases per 100,000 on 27 September to 282 per 100,000 on 12 October. The spokesman said all free intensive care capacity could be used by 28 October and could pass the peak seen in the first wave by 2 November, according to the government's pandemic modelling group, SPI-M. This is based on a ""best-case"" assumption that the number of intensive care patients would take 14 days to double. The projections suggest coronavirus patients would take up the entire current intensive care capacity by 8 November and the entire surge capacity by 12 November. It comes as Greater Manchester MP Yasmin Qureshi, who represents Bolton South East, said she is in hospital with pneumonia two weeks after testing positive for Covid-19. Hospitals in the North West are incredibly busy, but talk of them being overwhelmed with Covid patients is somewhat premature. In the spring the number of admissions across the region went from under 100 a day to over 400 in the space of a week. Cases have been rising much more gradually in recent weeks. In fact there are signs they may have started levelling off at around 200 cases a day. The hospitals in and around Manchester and Liverpool have borne the brunt of the pressures. Particular concern has been expressed about intensive care, with reports that more than 80% of beds in Manchester are occupied.  That is not unusual - last winter similar occupancy rates were seen. In fact, this is one of the difficulties the NHS faces with Covid - it works so close to capacity in normal times that an extra pressure causes real problems. But again the local NHS is not yet in the position it was in the spring when it had to take emergency measures to open up extra intensive care beds by cancelling non-Covid work.

Spread to US Treasury,Did we ever 'follow the science'?,2024-09-25,2020-10-17,By Nick Triggle & Chris Mason & Claire Hamilton,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54546867,"Early in the pandemic, the government consistently said it was ""following the science"" - but what does that really mean, and is the divergence between politics and science now wider than it has ever been? Some with heels clacking on the cobbles, others capturing the moment on their phones - it's like the aftermath of a big win in the football, or the Saturday after pay day. The videos show Concert Square in Liverpool heaving with crowds. And this in a city on the crest of a second wave of coronavirus, where almost all the intensive care beds in the hospitals are full. It was Tuesday night, hours away from the Liverpool City Region entering the toughest restrictions in the country. But the footage sparked anger, and on Twitter there was a fight over the damage to the city's reputation. Dozens of tweets insisted that those present must have been students, that no true Liverpudlian would set foot in Concert Square, let alone behave like that. The tweeters were adamant - these people came from outside. The mayor and the metro mayor condemned the scenes - but that wasn't the only thing they were angry about.  They accused the government at Westminster of not providing enough financial support - workers affected by the closure of businesses such as bars and gyms will only get two-thirds of their wages. On the first day of lockdown, one gym owner showed his defiance by remaining open and was fined for it.  Gyms have indeed provided a source of confusion. Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson questioned why gyms in the Liverpool City Region had to close when the area moved into tier three - very high alert - but those in Lancashire, which went into tier three on Saturday, were allowed to stay open. In Blackburn, with 438 cases per 100,000 (in the week to 13 October), you can work out, but in Wirral, with 284 cases per 100,000, you can't. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has acknowledged inconsistencies. ""There are anomalies, that's inevitably going to happen in a complex campaign against a pandemic like this."" But do these discrepancies encourage those who feel the government's decision-making sometimes veers away from the science? ""Following the science"" was a phrase we heard a lot of earlier in the year. It's what, we were repeatedly told, the government at Westminster was doing. The reality was always more nuanced. There was a range of scientific views on a topic about which precious little was known at the outset, and there are still vast amounts to learn. Added to that, from the perspective of ministers, this could never only be about scientific advice. There was a constant swirl of broader considerations, what we might call the three Ls - lives, liberties and livelihoods. Ministers have been tussling with the three Ls from the start of the pandemic. But the divergence has never been wider than it is now. Nick Triggle is the BBC's health correspondent @NickTriggle Chris Mason is a BBC political correspondent @ChrisMasonBBC Claire Hamilton is the BBC's political reporter for Merseyside @chamiltonbbc The critical moment in recent weeks can be traced back to 21 September, when Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser and Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, warned of the need for immediate action. In a televised briefing, Sir Patrick warned cases could reach 50,000 a day by mid-October if they doubled every seven days, as had happened in recent weeks. We now know that on that same day, the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) met and suggested the ""immediate introduction"" of a ""short period of lockdown,"" and a series of longer term measures, including:  A day later, what actually happened? The prime minister said people should work from home if they could and a 22:00 curfew for pubs and restaurants was introduced. In other words, not a lot of change. What happened to ""following the science""? Plenty at Westminster whispered, even before we had seen the minutes from the Sage meeting, that this was a victory for those in government, like Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who worried about the pandemic's crippling economic consequences. Mr Sunak has been consistent - warning again, just this week, of the danger of ""rushing to another lockdown"". He warned, instead, of the ""economic emergency"", touching on another of the three Ls - livelihoods. When you speak to people in the Treasury, you get an insight into what informs this outlook. ""We have to keep an eye on the medium term. There may not be a vaccine. Listening to the scientists recently, the mood music has changed. They're more pessimistic,"" says one. This is no longer about dealing with a short-term emergency, but being resilient through a medium or long-term slog of a crisis. And that means the Treasury is well aware of what is going out - in public spending - and what is coming in, in taxes. ""There isn't the headroom there was,"" an insider says - a reference to the £200bn already spent. And there is a keen awareness of the economic consequences of shutting pubs. ""Our economy is comparatively very reliant on social consumption,"" is how it is described. The experts know the ministers have to take into account a variety of factors. One Sage member said: ""Our job is to give clear unvarnished science advice so they can do that with their eyes open."" On Tuesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer advocated a short, limited lockdown - the circuit-breaker suggested by the scientific advisers.  But does Sir Keir calling for a circuit-breaker make it more or less likely to happen? Since then, the government - to quote Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - has been ""leaning in"" to its regional response for England. Political convention says, everything else being equal, it is harder to adopt a policy advocated by your opponents than it is by independent advisers. Then there's the last of the three Ls. Liberties. Among the most influential Conservative backbench voices is Sir Graham Brady, who said ministers had got used to ""ruling by decree"" and ""the British people aren't used to being treated like children"". This unease at how the pandemic has, in their view, swept away some of the checks and balances on those in power, is widely held in Parliament. Then there's the question of geography. First there was devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but now we're all aware of the big English cities that have metro mayors because they are fighting back against Westminster. According to well-placed sources, Health Secretary Matt Hancock had argued for tougher measures in private. But the need to get local leaders on board has meant the tiered system has had to leave some wriggle room for negotiation. Ministers were stung when Middlesbrough mayor Andy Preston said he flatly rejected the restrictions that the government announced there in early October. ""It was a real problem for us - it undermined the public health message and threatened to undo what we were trying to achieve,"" one government source said.  Steve Rotheram, Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region, had been asking for a lockdown circuit-breaker for at least two weeks - but he said any measures must come with a bespoke financial support package for businesses. It appears this hasn't been forthcoming. But the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has gone much further than his colleague in Liverpool. On Friday, he was described as ""effectively trying to hold the government over a barrel"" by Mr Raab. Mr Burnham, a former Labour cabinet minister, who lost out to Jeremy Corbyn in the 2015 Labour leadership contest, is suddenly back on the national stage. He is demanding noisily and frequently the need for more generous support for those unable to work because of tier three restrictions. There is nervousness within the Labour Party nationally, and elsewhere in the north of England, about this stance. Some worry it imperils people's health, others that it's become ""the Andy show"" - as one figure put it. The idea of ""metro mayors"" voted for directly by the people of the region has long been championed by the Conservatives. David Cameron was a particular fan.  ""Some Conservatives are now realising you've got to be careful what you wish for,"" an early advocate of them says.    ""And remember this, Boris Johnson was a mayor. There is a path to Downing Street that can pass via a town hall. Perhaps Andy Burnham has realised that too."" What we are seeing is how different parts of the UK have tilted in different directions. Loyalty to region, to nation, to party. The legacies of past perceived slights and injustices. The realities of perceived injustices now. ""We owe a big thanks to George Osborne for bequeathing us this incredible standoff,"" a senior Conservative says about the row. Some Conservative ministers ponder privately that - in the end - Mr Sunak will be forced to be more generous to those unable to work under tier three restrictions. They don't think it'll be politically sustainable to pay people normally on the minimum wage, less than the minimum wage, for months on end. The rows between local and central government leaders are ""very dangerous"" and ""very damaging to public health"", according to Prof Sir Jeremy Farrar, Sage member, and director of the Wellcome Trust. But these are not the only rows that have been taking place. Across the scientific and medical community tempers are frayed and the pandemic is taking its toll. There is a network of committees that feed into Sage, bringing together a wide range of experts from sociologists and public health directors to epidemiologists. Many are not paid for their advice and instead are fitting it in around their day jobs. ""We do it because we care and it's our life's work,"" said Prof Devi Sridhar, an expert in global public health at Edinburgh University, who has been advising the Scottish government. Talk to these experts and it is clear they are exhausted. ""The requests just keep coming in,"" one said. ""We're fed up, especially when we hear that test-and-trace consultants are getting paid £7,000 a day, and we have to put up with MPs going on the TV telling the world we are naïve and don't live in the real world. It's demoralising."" But it is not just between politicians and scientists that disputes have developed. Rival camps of scientists are clashing. Two online petitions have now been established: the Great Barrington declaration for those who want to see controlled spread of the virus and protection of the vulnerable, and the John Snow Memorandum for those arguing for outright suppression until a vaccine is developed. Prof Francois Balloux, director of the UCL Genetics Institute, says the toxic atmosphere that is developing is really ""unhelpful"". Brought together, it has created a climate where almost every utterance or development is examined for double-meaning. The problem facing advisers and decision-makers is two-fold. First, the nature of the virus means it is a lose-lose situation - whatever decision is taken has negative consequences either for the spread of the virus, or for the economy, education and wider health and well-being. What's more, there is not a simple binary choice of one thing or the other. For example, much has been made in recent weeks about the need for the NHS to also focus on non-Covid work, which has taken a terrible hit during the pandemic.  Referrals for urgent cancer check-ups and the number of people starting treatment have dropped, while the amount of routine surgery being done is still half the level it was before the pandemic. This can have tragic consequences. This week the British Heart Foundation warned the number of younger adults dying of heart disease had increased by 15% during the pandemic. The argument put forward by some is that the government should choose to do more non-Covid work. But, and this is a point the health secretary has been making week after week, if hospitals fill up with coronavirus patients, it makes non-Covid work harder to do. The second key issue - and this goes to the heart of the disagreements we have seen bubble up in recent weeks among the scientific and medical community - is that there are huge gaps in the evidence and knowledge. This is true on everything from the numbers infected already and the level of immunity exposure brings to the true impact of ""long Covid"", and exactly what effect any restrictions beyond a full lockdown actually have. In normal times, the scientific and medical community is able to reach more of a consensus off the back of rigorous randomised controlled trials and painstaking peer review. But in a fast-moving pandemic with a new virus, that has simply not been possible. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, says it means there is such ""uncertainty in the science"" that he does not think any plan is guaranteed to work. And then there is the human factor - the unintended consequences of actions that are impossible to take into account in the modelling. Hence the prospect of scenes like the ones we saw in Liverpool, which were not taken into account by Sage in its latest advice. But Prof Keith Neal, an infectious disease expert at Nottingham University, says it shouldn't come as a surprise that people react in the way they do. Both young and old are suffering, he says, from not being able to meet up with people. ""This degree of isolation is not allowed in prisons under human rights legislation."" It is, he says, therefore natural that some people will ignore the rules. Closing pubs may sound good on paper, he says, but it could lead to an increase in house parties where people are ""far more at risk"". So where has this left us? The complexity of competing interests, uncertainty in the science and general exhaustion across society both among decision-makers and the public has, some fear, left us in the worst of both worlds. Delay and deliberation, says Sir Jeremy Farrar is a ""decision in itself"". But by reaching a decision by default there is a risk - another adviser says - of making the same mistakes we made at the start of the pandemic. ""In March we toyed with the Swedish model of limited restrictions with the hope of developing immunity and then hesitated. But we then went for a lockdown, but it was introduced bit by bit and it was too late anyway. ""The same thing has happened again - we have delayed and then gone for some half measures. I can understand why. This is bloody difficult."" The government is now hoping it will be just enough that we can get through this wave without a devastating number of deaths or hospitals being overwhelmed. But it's a big risk - it could all unravel."
Spread to US Treasury,Trump signs Covid relief and spending package,2024-09-25,2020-12-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55463276,"US President Donald Trump has belatedly signed into law a coronavirus relief and spending package bill, averting a partial government shutdown. Mr Trump had previously refused to sign the bill, criticising ""wasteful spending"" and calling for higher payouts to people hit by the pandemic. The delay meant that millions temporarily lost unemployment benefits. The relief package worth $900bn (£665bn) was approved by Congress after months of negotiation. It is part of a $2.3tn spending package that includes $1.4tn for normal federal government spending.  Republican and Democratic Party lawmakers had been pleading with the president to sign it before a budget deadline of midnight on Monday. If he had not, some government agencies would have had to close, unless legislators could pass a stopgap bill. About 14 million Americans faced a lapse in unemployment benefit payments and new stimulus cheques. Unemployment benefits will now be restored. After the coronavirus aid relief bill overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives and Senate last Monday, Mr Trump issued an implied veto threat, describing the package as a ""disgrace"" and full of ""wasteful"" items. The bill includes a payment of $600 to Americans earning less than $75,000 a year. Mr Trump said he wanted Americans to receive $2,000 - but Republicans in Congress refused to agree to the change.   Mr Trump also baulked at the annual aid money for other countries in the federal budget, arguing that those funds should instead go to struggling Americans. His demand to send the measure back to Capitol Hill stunned lawmakers since he had largely stayed out of the negotiations. His top economic adviser, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, had proposed the $600 payments early this month, and many questioned why the president had waited so long to object. It was not immediately clear why Mr Trump - who is in Florida - finally decided to sign the bill into law on Sunday. He said he was signing the bill with ""a strong message that makes clear to Congress that wasteful items need to be removed"". He leaves office on 20 January after losing November's election to Mr Biden, although he has refused to admit defeat. Republican Senator Mitt Romney said he was ""relieved"" that the legislation had at last become law. Earlier, Republican Senator Pat Toomey said the president risked being remembered for ""chaos, misery and erratic behaviour"". US President-elect Joe Biden had warned of ""devastating consequences"" if Mr Trump continued to refuse to sign. In a strongly worded statement published on the transition website on Saturday, Mr Biden described Mr Trump's refusal to sign the bill as an ""abdication of responsibility"". ""It is the day after Christmas, and millions of families don't know if they'll be able to make ends meet because of President Donald Trump's refusal to sign an economic relief bill approved by Congress with an overwhelming and bipartisan majority,"" Mr Biden said."
Spread to US Treasury,Deadly blast hits cargo ships off Crimea,2024-09-25,2019-01-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46948718,"At least 11 people have died in a fire involving two Tanzanian-flagged cargo vessels in the Black Sea near the Kerch Strait, authorities say. Russian rescuers are trying to reach sailors who jumped overboard. Fourteen people have so far been rescued. One ship is a gas tanker, and the fire reportedly followed an explosion, which set the other vessel on fire. They were named as the Kandy (Venice), with a crew of 17 from Turkey and India, and Maestro, with 14 sailors. The fire broke out when one vessel was transferring fuel to another, Russian maritime agency spokesman Alexei Kravchenko said, adding that this had then forced several crew members to jump overboard.  Rescue workers reportedly witnessed a further three people struggling in the water, who most likely had drowned.  AFP news agency said that ""no signal from either one of the two captains"" had been received.  Authorities in the Crimean city of Kerch are now preparing to receive the victims. The crew members were sailing in ""neutral waters"" in the Black Sea when the incident occurred, authorities said.  The names of the two vessels, the Venice and the Maestro, both appear on a US treasury list as possible targets for sanctions over petroleum shipments to Syria. The US tightened sanctions against Syria back in 2011 in response to what it said was President Bashar al-Assad's ""continued atrocities"" committed against the Syrian people.  The Kerch Strait is a focus of tension between Russia and Ukraine. In November, Russian border guards seized three Ukrainian naval vessels near the narrow channel, which links the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov.  A court in Russia has extended by three months the detention of 24 Ukrainian sailors captured in the incident. They are accused of illegally crossing into Russian territory. Ukraine condemned the Russian move, denying that its ships had violated the navigation laws in the area. The strait lies off Ukraine's Crimea peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014."
Spread to US Treasury,SEN children's 'inspiring' mural painted on house,2024-09-25,2021-04-16,By Alex Pope,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-56758293,"A woman's front yard has become a canvas for a mural designed by children with special educational needs that aims to ""encourage and inspire others"".  Pritti Saggi, from Kempston in Bedfordshire, said the mural's message was ""we're proud to be different"".  The founder of the Bedford-based charity Creating Memories said it was also about ""making people smile"".  The artwork, mainly painted by local artist Sarah Harrison, features designs by 20 children. Creating Memories is a charity that aims to grant wishes for children with life-limiting conditions, and it worked in conjunction with the Bedford Borough Parent Carer Forum, which provides support for children with learning disabilities. Kerri Rennie, from the Forum, said they wanted to ""be part of something big, communal and creative - something that would complement the education, support and information we offer"". The project started in January, when Ms Saggi asked for help on Facebook to create a ""Path of Joy"" in her front garden.  Ms Harrison came forward and the project grew and spread along Ms Saggi's front door and garden wall - creating the larger ""Mural of Joy"". The artist called it a ""colourful patchwork of children's artwork that is better than what I could have created"".  ""It has captured a moment in time,"" she said. ""We're making this street a gallery. I hope it will inspire other people to do the same."" Georgia, 14, from Watford, had her wish to sing live in front of an audience fulfilled by the charity. She said it had now ""been captured as a memory on the wall of joy, for all to enjoy"".  Ms Saggi said: ""I have gifted my home to the community... as at the moment we're all feeling a bit deflated. ""This is just the start - I'm hoping we can decorate a bigger, more public space.  ""If not, my home will just have to become The House of Joy.""

Spread to US Treasury,Fear returns to stock markets over virus impact,2024-09-25,2020-03-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51766782,"Global stock markets have fallen sharply as investors continue to worry about the broader economic effects of the coronavirus. London's FTSE 100 share index fell more than 3% and there were similar declines in other European markets. In the US, upbeat data on hiring and unemployment failed to buoy investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed almost 1% lower, while the Nasdaq slumped 1.8% and S&P 500 ended down 1.7%. The monthly report from the US Labor Department found US employers added 273,000 jobs in February - significantly beating expectations - while the jobless rate fell back to near a 50-year low of 3.5%. The report also revised up estimates of job gains in January and December, finding 85,000 more than previously understood. The surveys, however, reflect data collected before the outbreak intensified. In recent weeks, global travel has plunged, while work, school and shopping has been disrupted in many countries. Despite the strong data, markets were focused on the impact of the virus. ""Today's jobs report is old news,"" said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo. The economic strength signalled in the report is a ""little like the saying, the car was in fine condition before being involved in a collision"", said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst for Bankrate.com. ""The new reality, amid tremendous uncertainty, is the world has experienced a seismic shift,"" he said. Earlier on Friday, markets in Asia had seen big falls, with Japan's Nikkei share index dropping by 2.7%. The 3.6% drop in the FTSE 100 wiped out the gains seen earlier this week on the index. Shares in travel companies again saw some of the steepest falls.  Banks also took a hit, as investors anticipate that interest rates might be cut in order to make borrowing cheaper for companies and consumers to keep the economy buoyant.  Energy firms were under pressure as well, after the collapse of a proposal by major oil producers to keep oil supply in check sent oil prices tumbling more than 8%. ""The markets didn't even bother with the pretence of a calm start on Friday, bringing another rough week to a close,"" said Connor Campbell, analyst at financial spread better Spreadex. ""The week's various central bank rate cuts only served to reinforce the seriousness of the situation."" Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve, the US's central bank, cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to a range of 1% to 1.25% in an attempt to ease investor concerns.  Many analysts predict it will cut rates again - perhaps as soon as its meeting this month. As traders seek less risky investments, they are turning to government bonds, sending prices higher. The bond market - which is many times larger than the stock market - includes tradable loans to governments and businesses. Yields - how much investors will recoup in interest from the loans - drop as the price of the loan rises.  Benchmark 10-year UK government debt now only offers a 0.24% return - a record low. In the US, the yield on a 10-year Treasury also fell to a record low, falling below 0.7%. ""With the 10-year Treasury yield slumping to a new record low and stock markets under pressure again today, it is questionable whether the Fed can wait until its scheduled meeting mid-month to deliver the next rate cut,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.

Prof Stuart Elborn said anyone who may have had contact with the individual has now been contacted. The diagnosis was one of two new cases of coronavirus confirmed in Northern Ireland on Wednesday. It brings the total number of cases in the region to three - none are linked. Across the UK, the total number of positive tests has risen to 90, and  health officials have moved into the second phase of their response to the coronavirus outbreak. Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical officer, has said it is ""highly likely"" there is now some ""community transmission"" within the UK. Measures would be ramped up to slow the spread of the virus and could involve ""changes to society"", he said. The Queen's University Belfast (QUB) student had recently returned from northern Italy and had been mixing with others at university. The other adult had been in contact with someone in the UK who had tested positive for Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus. Prof Elborn said ""appropriate cleaning"" had taken place in the areas where the student was present. ""At this moment there is no need to close anything or halt any particular activities,"" he said. ""We will be keeping a very close eye on a daily basis as to how this develops. ""And we will make decisions in the university in line with what we need to do to protect society in Northern Ireland and more widely in these islands."" Queen's said its major incident team had been convened and was putting in place the appropriate contingency measures.  ""There will be a helpline [on Thursday] and I will be meeting with the particular school where this occurred later to have an opportunity to discuss this with the students and the staff,"" he said. Four new cases were confirmed in the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday, bringing the total number of cases there to six. The patients, two men and two women, all travelled from the same affected area in northern Italy. Ireland's deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn maintained there was ""still no evidence of widespread or sustained community transmission in Ireland, as seen in some other EU countries"". The first case in Northern Ireland was a woman who had travelled to northern Italy, which is at the centre of the European outbreak. Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the latest two patients were receiving the appropriate care and officials were working to identify anyone they had come into contact with. Northern Ireland remained in the containment phase, he added. In other developments:"
Spread to US Treasury,Coronavirus: Evening update,2024-09-25,2020-10-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54371350,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you on Tuesday morning. The government has ordered an investigation into how a problem with an old Excel file format led to nearly 16,000 coronavirus cases going missing from official statistics and not being registered on test and trace records over the last 10 days. Those who tested positive were informed - but there was a delay in tracing their contacts, only half of whom have now been spoken to. It also meant the daily case totals reported by the government over the past week were lower than the true number - around 7,000 a day instead of nearer 11,000 at the end of the week. But this ""has not impacted"" the decisions the government made about local lockdowns last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs.  Meanwhile, the number of positive cases reported across the UK today is 12,594, and 19 more people have died.  The Welsh Government is considering quarantine restrictions for people travelling to Wales from Covid hotspots elsewhere in the UK. People living in locked down parts of Wales are not allowed to leave those areas apart from for a few exceptions - but there is currently no legal restrictions to stop people living under local lockdown conditions in England from travelling around - including to Wales. Check out our guide to the different levels of Covid restrictions and local lockdowns around the UK  or find out what you can do during a local lockdown. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has vowed to ""always balance the books"", despite the huge rise in government borrowing in the wake of the pandemic. In a speech at the Conservative Party conference (taking place online because of the pandemic) he warned debt and spending needed controlling ""over the medium term"". Our political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was not clear exactly what the chancellor meant by that - and nor was there ""even a whisper"" of how he might go about it. In any case, Treasury sources suggest it's unlikely to happen by the time of the next election, which is expected to be in 2024. Boris Johnson has urged people to go back to cinemas, following news Cineworld is temporarily closing its UK and US venues, affecting 45,000 jobs. The prime minister said he would ""encourage people to go out to the cinema, enjoy themselves and support"" movie theatres. But his encouragement wasn't enough to stop the Odeon chain announcing it was reducing the hours of a quarter of its 120 cinemas to weekends only. Tim Richards, founder and chief executive of the Vue cinema chain, said there was ""pent up demand like we haven't seen ever before"" among customers to go out - but: ""Our problem right now is we have no movies."" A further delay to the release of the new James Bond film - announced on Friday - was ""a big blow"", he said.  Lana Del Rey has upset some of her fans due to her choice of face mask at a book signing in California. Reading passages from her new poetry book and interacting with the public, the star sported a glittery, mesh face mask that she'd previously used in a cover shoot for a magazine - but which did not appear to offer much of a barrier to the spread of Covid-19.

Spread to US Treasury,Google's giant fine: The net reacts,2024-09-25,2017-06-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40418197,"The EU's Competition Commissioner said her team analysed a gigantic 5.2 terabytes of search results before determining that Google had indeed abused its position by running its Shopping service price comparison ads at the top of search results. That's the equivalent of nearly two billion search queries. As news that she had fined its parent company Alphabet a record 2.4bn euros ($2.7bn; £2.1bn) spread, it became clear that many thought the case against the tech firm was obvious without needing to dive that deep into the data. But others perceive the penalty to be unfair and even prejudicial against the US, despite the fact several American firms had spoken out against Google in advance of the ruling. For its part, Google says it does not accept the criticism and may appeal. Below is a sample of the early reactions to the news culled from emailed press releases, social media, blogs and elsewhere. ""For over a decade Google has abused and leveraged its monopoly power in search - where it has a 95% market share in Europe... The commission's decision will finally put a stop to that abusive conduct, and it will enable those competitors that have survived despite Google's behaviour, as well as new entrants, to compete on their merits,"" Thomas Vinje, legal counsel to Fairsearch, a group of internet businesses that have lobbied against Google. ""Further legal action will be needed if Google tries to circumvent the commission's verdict. It will be important to have a very strong monitoring trustee and oversight to ensure that the remedy is put into practice,"" Richard Stables, chief executive of the price comparison site Kelkoo. ""Other regulators and companies have been intimidated by Google's overwhelming might, but the commission has taken a strong stand and we hope that this is the first step in remedying Google's shameless abuse of its dominance in search. We strongly believe that the abuse of algorithms by dominant digital platforms should be of concern to every country and company seeking a fair, competitive and creative society,"" News Corp via its site. ""[It's] eurotechnopanic at its worst: anti-American, anti-technology, anti-capitalism... Europe, you can't regulate yourself into competition. You have to invest and innovate,"" Prof Jeff Jarvis, author of What Would Google Do? via Twitter. ""The EU has effectively decided that some companies have become too big to innovate. The EU's actions have created a cloud of uncertainty that will make large tech companies overly cautious about making changes to the user experience and service offerings that would benefit consumers... The only real beneficiary of today's ruling is the EU's treasury,"" Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington-based think tank. ""Prioritising a particular shopping search engine is not akin to gouging water users with higher prices because there are alternatives to Google that users can switch to easily. If the overall user experience is made worse by Google Shopping being prioritised, then users will have the option of moving to a search engine like Bing which is perhaps less good at search but better overall because it does not prioritise a bad shopping tool,"" Sam Bowman, executive director, Adam Smith Institute via its website. ""Given the depth of Google's pockets, this is by no means a commercial disaster but it has the makings of a brand disaster. Google has always presented itself as 'the good guy' of technology, but if this record fine stands then it would be harder for them to argue that,"" Rupert Bhatia, director of public relations at crisis management agency Rhizome Media. ""Prepare to see more such divided action (geographically based)... but [it's] not simply America v EU. Some huge US companies (Oracle) agree with the EU fine, saying Google hurts competition."" Adrian Weckler, tech editor, The Irish Independent via Twitter. ""It's simply not possible for us to operate a complex economy without certainty... Vital to this is that we all know what the law is ahead of time. It must be possible for us to know that we are acting illegally that is, the law must be known, it must be possible for us to know that we are subject to it. And that's where this decision fails,"" Tim Worstall, Adam Smith Institute via Forbes. ""Alphabet can easily afford [the fine]. The sting may come more from what the ruling means for current and future cases in Europe targeting Google and other large tech firms - most of them hailing from Silicon Valley or thereabouts. Antitrust experts and tech executives say the ruling, in particular, could be precedent-setting in instances where tech giants have become gatekeepers for our digital lives,"" Sam Schechner, Wall Street Journal via its site. ""Whereas the antitrust laws in the US and the EU used to be broadly in line with each other, a gradual deregulation in the US has led to the clash of cultures we are seeing here. The vast success of Silicon Valley has been fostered by a deregulated marketplace, but this causes problems when these businesses do business against the very different legal backdrop operating in Europe,"" Susan Hall, head of technology at the law firm Clarke Willmott. ""So, the EU has fined Google for breaking competition law and given it 90 days to stop, but not said what stopping looks like. Anyone find that odd?"" James Titcomb, Technology editor, The Telegraph via Twitter ""They are dominant, but other search engines are available. When I go into Tesco I don't see adverts for Lidl,"" Tony Smith via Facebook. ""Last time I checked Google was a technology company, not a public body. Why is it wrong to favour its advertisers?!"" Desi Velikova via Twitter. ""It's a huge win for the average consumer. Every year Google becomes a more and more entrenched monopoly. At this point they basically dictate a big portion of the internet ecosystem,"" ReanimatedX via Reddit. ""I'd like to hear an explanation as to why this is good for consumers. Instead, more people are going to just go straight to Amazon, which uses its data to learn what people like, develops its own products to compete, and then stops carrying competitors' products,"" Tenushi via Reddit."
Spread to US Treasury,'Lives at risk' over Manchester Covid tier delay,2024-09-25,2020-10-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54594885,"Further delays to a decision on Greater Manchester's Covid restrictions will ""put people's lives at risk"", the communities secretary has said. Robert Jenrick said he hoped he could reach an agreement with the region's MPs ""in the next day or two"". Local leaders want better financial support before agreeing to a move to the top tier of rules, which would force some businesses to close. Talks are continuing after a weekend of discussions. Mr Jenrick indicated that Greater Manchester could be offered a financial package similar to the ""tens of millions"" of pounds of support agreed for Lancashire and the Liverpool City Region - the two parts of England already in tier three. A key sticking point of the dispute is that Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham wants the government to reintroduce the 80% furlough scheme used during the UK's first lockdown, instead of the new Job Support Scheme which covers 67% of the wages of people affected by tier three closures.  Mr Burnham said businesses that would be closed under the highest level of coronavirus restrictions - including pubs, bookmakers and gyms - ""are places where people are on low wages"" and that two-thirds pay is not enough. But Mr Jenrick told BBC Breakfast the Manchester talks had gone on ""too long"" as coronavirus case numbers remain ""seriously high"". ""Delay I'm afraid will only make the situation worse, will only put people's lives at risk, and will only make the economic fallout for the city worse in the long term,"" he added. ""We do now need to take action. I hope that we can reach agreement but one way or another, we need to draw this to a conclusion."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that he might ""need to intervene"" if local leaders did not accept a move to tier three. Meanwhile, people in Wales will be told from Friday to stay at home, and pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut, as part of a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown until 9 November. It comes as a two-week school closure begins in Northern Ireland as part of a tightening of restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. Scotland continues to draw up plans for a three-tier framework of restrictions, similar to England's, to account for regional differences in Covid rates and isolate areas of higher prevalence. On Monday the UK recorded a further 18,804 coronavirus cases and 80 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.  BBC deputy political editor Vicki Young said Treasury sources insisted Greater Manchester would not get a more generous offer on wages than the Job Support Scheme provides, but pointed to other financial support packages agreed with tier three areas. On Sunday, Liverpool City Region's metro mayor Steve Rotheram said his area would receive an additional £44m and a similar package worth £42m was given to local leaders in Lancashire last week. Mr Burnham said he had a ""constructive call"" with the PM's team on Sunday, but on Monday morning he told Sky News: ""I'm not going to roll over at the sight of a cheque."" Nottingham's Labour council leader David Mellen has also called for more support for businesses in the city if it is moved to tier three.  However, the Labour leader of Manchester City Council, Sir Richard Leese, said the row was not just about money and questioned the effectiveness of ""blanket"" business closures, instead suggesting a shielding programme for those most at risk from Covid-19. And mayors and council leaders in the Liverpool City Region have written to the prime minister asking for an ""immediate review"" of the decision to close gyms and leisure centres in the area as part of tier three measures, pointing out that in Lancashire, which is also in tier three, they have not been required to close.  They are calling on the government to provide the scientific evidence supporting the move and if they are unable to do so, allow them to reopen.  When an area goes in to tier three - the ""very high alert"" category - this unlocks enhanced financial support from the government. In the Liverpool City Region, some of the funds will be used both to bolster contact tracing, to enhance compliance, and to support people who are clinically extremely vulnerable.   This is worth £14m - and a similar package in Lancashire is worth £12m. But following negotiations, both areas have also been given a further £30m in ""business support"". Whitehall sources have told the BBC that Greater Manchester would be offered no less generous terms than Lancashire or Liverpool. On a per capita basis, that could mean potentially £70-80m being made available from central government, in return for enhanced restrictions. Talks are also under way between the government and local authority leaders in South Yorkshire. Council leaders want a package of support to include more resources for the NHS in the area - and are clear they won't be ""bounced"" into accepting a move to tier three. Dr Indeewar Kapila, an intensive care consultant in Greater Manchester, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that critical care units have capacity at the moment but Manchester's rate - which was 431 cases per 100,000 in the week to 13 October - was ""extremely high"". The prime minister's official spokesman said in Greater Manchester the number of new cases in people over the age of 60 had tripled in the most recent 15 days of full data - from 89 cases per 100,000 on 27 September to 282 per 100,000 on 12 October. The spokesman said all free intensive care capacity could be used by 28 October and could pass the peak seen in the first wave by 2 November, according to the government's pandemic modelling group, SPI-M. This is based on a ""best-case"" assumption that the number of intensive care patients would take 14 days to double. The projections suggest coronavirus patients would take up the entire current intensive care capacity by 8 November and the entire surge capacity by 12 November. It comes as Greater Manchester MP Yasmin Qureshi, who represents Bolton South East, said she is in hospital with pneumonia two weeks after testing positive for Covid-19. Hospitals in the North West are incredibly busy, but talk of them being overwhelmed with Covid patients is somewhat premature. In the spring the number of admissions across the region went from under 100 a day to over 400 in the space of a week. Cases have been rising much more gradually in recent weeks. In fact there are signs they may have started levelling off at around 200 cases a day. The hospitals in and around Manchester and Liverpool have borne the brunt of the pressures. Particular concern has been expressed about intensive care, with reports that more than 80% of beds in Manchester are occupied.  That is not unusual - last winter similar occupancy rates were seen. In fact, this is one of the difficulties the NHS faces with Covid - it works so close to capacity in normal times that an extra pressure causes real problems. But again the local NHS is not yet in the position it was in the spring when it had to take emergency measures to open up extra intensive care beds by cancelling non-Covid work.

Spread to US Treasury,Did we ever 'follow the science'?,2024-09-25,2020-10-17,By Nick Triggle & Chris Mason & Claire Hamilton,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54546867,"Early in the pandemic, the government consistently said it was ""following the science"" - but what does that really mean, and is the divergence between politics and science now wider than it has ever been? Some with heels clacking on the cobbles, others capturing the moment on their phones - it's like the aftermath of a big win in the football, or the Saturday after pay day. The videos show Concert Square in Liverpool heaving with crowds. And this in a city on the crest of a second wave of coronavirus, where almost all the intensive care beds in the hospitals are full. It was Tuesday night, hours away from the Liverpool City Region entering the toughest restrictions in the country. But the footage sparked anger, and on Twitter there was a fight over the damage to the city's reputation. Dozens of tweets insisted that those present must have been students, that no true Liverpudlian would set foot in Concert Square, let alone behave like that. The tweeters were adamant - these people came from outside. The mayor and the metro mayor condemned the scenes - but that wasn't the only thing they were angry about.  They accused the government at Westminster of not providing enough financial support - workers affected by the closure of businesses such as bars and gyms will only get two-thirds of their wages. On the first day of lockdown, one gym owner showed his defiance by remaining open and was fined for it.  Gyms have indeed provided a source of confusion. Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson questioned why gyms in the Liverpool City Region had to close when the area moved into tier three - very high alert - but those in Lancashire, which went into tier three on Saturday, were allowed to stay open. In Blackburn, with 438 cases per 100,000 (in the week to 13 October), you can work out, but in Wirral, with 284 cases per 100,000, you can't. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has acknowledged inconsistencies. ""There are anomalies, that's inevitably going to happen in a complex campaign against a pandemic like this."" But do these discrepancies encourage those who feel the government's decision-making sometimes veers away from the science? ""Following the science"" was a phrase we heard a lot of earlier in the year. It's what, we were repeatedly told, the government at Westminster was doing. The reality was always more nuanced. There was a range of scientific views on a topic about which precious little was known at the outset, and there are still vast amounts to learn. Added to that, from the perspective of ministers, this could never only be about scientific advice. There was a constant swirl of broader considerations, what we might call the three Ls - lives, liberties and livelihoods. Ministers have been tussling with the three Ls from the start of the pandemic. But the divergence has never been wider than it is now. Nick Triggle is the BBC's health correspondent @NickTriggle Chris Mason is a BBC political correspondent @ChrisMasonBBC Claire Hamilton is the BBC's political reporter for Merseyside @chamiltonbbc The critical moment in recent weeks can be traced back to 21 September, when Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser and Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, warned of the need for immediate action. In a televised briefing, Sir Patrick warned cases could reach 50,000 a day by mid-October if they doubled every seven days, as had happened in recent weeks. We now know that on that same day, the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) met and suggested the ""immediate introduction"" of a ""short period of lockdown,"" and a series of longer term measures, including:  A day later, what actually happened? The prime minister said people should work from home if they could and a 22:00 curfew for pubs and restaurants was introduced. In other words, not a lot of change. What happened to ""following the science""? Plenty at Westminster whispered, even before we had seen the minutes from the Sage meeting, that this was a victory for those in government, like Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who worried about the pandemic's crippling economic consequences. Mr Sunak has been consistent - warning again, just this week, of the danger of ""rushing to another lockdown"". He warned, instead, of the ""economic emergency"", touching on another of the three Ls - livelihoods. When you speak to people in the Treasury, you get an insight into what informs this outlook. ""We have to keep an eye on the medium term. There may not be a vaccine. Listening to the scientists recently, the mood music has changed. They're more pessimistic,"" says one. This is no longer about dealing with a short-term emergency, but being resilient through a medium or long-term slog of a crisis. And that means the Treasury is well aware of what is going out - in public spending - and what is coming in, in taxes. ""There isn't the headroom there was,"" an insider says - a reference to the £200bn already spent. And there is a keen awareness of the economic consequences of shutting pubs. ""Our economy is comparatively very reliant on social consumption,"" is how it is described. The experts know the ministers have to take into account a variety of factors. One Sage member said: ""Our job is to give clear unvarnished science advice so they can do that with their eyes open."" On Tuesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer advocated a short, limited lockdown - the circuit-breaker suggested by the scientific advisers.  But does Sir Keir calling for a circuit-breaker make it more or less likely to happen? Since then, the government - to quote Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - has been ""leaning in"" to its regional response for England. Political convention says, everything else being equal, it is harder to adopt a policy advocated by your opponents than it is by independent advisers. Then there's the last of the three Ls. Liberties. Among the most influential Conservative backbench voices is Sir Graham Brady, who said ministers had got used to ""ruling by decree"" and ""the British people aren't used to being treated like children"". This unease at how the pandemic has, in their view, swept away some of the checks and balances on those in power, is widely held in Parliament. Then there's the question of geography. First there was devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but now we're all aware of the big English cities that have metro mayors because they are fighting back against Westminster. According to well-placed sources, Health Secretary Matt Hancock had argued for tougher measures in private. But the need to get local leaders on board has meant the tiered system has had to leave some wriggle room for negotiation. Ministers were stung when Middlesbrough mayor Andy Preston said he flatly rejected the restrictions that the government announced there in early October. ""It was a real problem for us - it undermined the public health message and threatened to undo what we were trying to achieve,"" one government source said.  Steve Rotheram, Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region, had been asking for a lockdown circuit-breaker for at least two weeks - but he said any measures must come with a bespoke financial support package for businesses. It appears this hasn't been forthcoming. But the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has gone much further than his colleague in Liverpool. On Friday, he was described as ""effectively trying to hold the government over a barrel"" by Mr Raab. Mr Burnham, a former Labour cabinet minister, who lost out to Jeremy Corbyn in the 2015 Labour leadership contest, is suddenly back on the national stage. He is demanding noisily and frequently the need for more generous support for those unable to work because of tier three restrictions. There is nervousness within the Labour Party nationally, and elsewhere in the north of England, about this stance. Some worry it imperils people's health, others that it's become ""the Andy show"" - as one figure put it. The idea of ""metro mayors"" voted for directly by the people of the region has long been championed by the Conservatives. David Cameron was a particular fan.  ""Some Conservatives are now realising you've got to be careful what you wish for,"" an early advocate of them says.    ""And remember this, Boris Johnson was a mayor. There is a path to Downing Street that can pass via a town hall. Perhaps Andy Burnham has realised that too."" What we are seeing is how different parts of the UK have tilted in different directions. Loyalty to region, to nation, to party. The legacies of past perceived slights and injustices. The realities of perceived injustices now. ""We owe a big thanks to George Osborne for bequeathing us this incredible standoff,"" a senior Conservative says about the row. Some Conservative ministers ponder privately that - in the end - Mr Sunak will be forced to be more generous to those unable to work under tier three restrictions. They don't think it'll be politically sustainable to pay people normally on the minimum wage, less than the minimum wage, for months on end. The rows between local and central government leaders are ""very dangerous"" and ""very damaging to public health"", according to Prof Sir Jeremy Farrar, Sage member, and director of the Wellcome Trust. But these are not the only rows that have been taking place. Across the scientific and medical community tempers are frayed and the pandemic is taking its toll. There is a network of committees that feed into Sage, bringing together a wide range of experts from sociologists and public health directors to epidemiologists. Many are not paid for their advice and instead are fitting it in around their day jobs. ""We do it because we care and it's our life's work,"" said Prof Devi Sridhar, an expert in global public health at Edinburgh University, who has been advising the Scottish government. Talk to these experts and it is clear they are exhausted. ""The requests just keep coming in,"" one said. ""We're fed up, especially when we hear that test-and-trace consultants are getting paid £7,000 a day, and we have to put up with MPs going on the TV telling the world we are naïve and don't live in the real world. It's demoralising."" But it is not just between politicians and scientists that disputes have developed. Rival camps of scientists are clashing. Two online petitions have now been established: the Great Barrington declaration for those who want to see controlled spread of the virus and protection of the vulnerable, and the John Snow Memorandum for those arguing for outright suppression until a vaccine is developed. Prof Francois Balloux, director of the UCL Genetics Institute, says the toxic atmosphere that is developing is really ""unhelpful"". Brought together, it has created a climate where almost every utterance or development is examined for double-meaning. The problem facing advisers and decision-makers is two-fold. First, the nature of the virus means it is a lose-lose situation - whatever decision is taken has negative consequences either for the spread of the virus, or for the economy, education and wider health and well-being. What's more, there is not a simple binary choice of one thing or the other. For example, much has been made in recent weeks about the need for the NHS to also focus on non-Covid work, which has taken a terrible hit during the pandemic.  Referrals for urgent cancer check-ups and the number of people starting treatment have dropped, while the amount of routine surgery being done is still half the level it was before the pandemic. This can have tragic consequences. This week the British Heart Foundation warned the number of younger adults dying of heart disease had increased by 15% during the pandemic. The argument put forward by some is that the government should choose to do more non-Covid work. But, and this is a point the health secretary has been making week after week, if hospitals fill up with coronavirus patients, it makes non-Covid work harder to do. The second key issue - and this goes to the heart of the disagreements we have seen bubble up in recent weeks among the scientific and medical community - is that there are huge gaps in the evidence and knowledge. This is true on everything from the numbers infected already and the level of immunity exposure brings to the true impact of ""long Covid"", and exactly what effect any restrictions beyond a full lockdown actually have. In normal times, the scientific and medical community is able to reach more of a consensus off the back of rigorous randomised controlled trials and painstaking peer review. But in a fast-moving pandemic with a new virus, that has simply not been possible. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, says it means there is such ""uncertainty in the science"" that he does not think any plan is guaranteed to work. And then there is the human factor - the unintended consequences of actions that are impossible to take into account in the modelling. Hence the prospect of scenes like the ones we saw in Liverpool, which were not taken into account by Sage in its latest advice. But Prof Keith Neal, an infectious disease expert at Nottingham University, says it shouldn't come as a surprise that people react in the way they do. Both young and old are suffering, he says, from not being able to meet up with people. ""This degree of isolation is not allowed in prisons under human rights legislation."" It is, he says, therefore natural that some people will ignore the rules. Closing pubs may sound good on paper, he says, but it could lead to an increase in house parties where people are ""far more at risk"". So where has this left us? The complexity of competing interests, uncertainty in the science and general exhaustion across society both among decision-makers and the public has, some fear, left us in the worst of both worlds. Delay and deliberation, says Sir Jeremy Farrar is a ""decision in itself"". But by reaching a decision by default there is a risk - another adviser says - of making the same mistakes we made at the start of the pandemic. ""In March we toyed with the Swedish model of limited restrictions with the hope of developing immunity and then hesitated. But we then went for a lockdown, but it was introduced bit by bit and it was too late anyway. ""The same thing has happened again - we have delayed and then gone for some half measures. I can understand why. This is bloody difficult."" The government is now hoping it will be just enough that we can get through this wave without a devastating number of deaths or hospitals being overwhelmed. But it's a big risk - it could all unravel."
Spread to US Treasury,PM vows more school catch-up cash in funding row,2024-09-25,2021-06-01,By Sean Coughlan,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-57320450,"The prime minister has promised schools in England there will be more money ""coming down the track"" after catch-up plans were labelled a ""damp squib"". Head teachers had said they were ""hugely disappointed"" by a £1.4bn Covid recovery package, which breaks down to £50 extra per pupil per year. Most of the funding will be for tutoring to make up for lost learning. Boris Johnson said it would ""give parents the confidence"" that their children would be supported. But the plans so far are much more limited than the £13.5bn that the Education Policy Institute (EPI) think tank had calculated would be required to catch up on lessons disrupted by the pandemic. The catch-up plan, with £1.4bn extra over three years in addition to the £1.7bn already announced, will include £1bn for 100 million hours of tutoring and £250m for teacher training and development. Tutoring, often in small groups, will be targeted at those considered most in need of support, particularly the disadvantaged and will not available for all pupils. The EPI, which warned primary pupils had lost up to two months of learning in reading and three months in maths, said the extra funding amounted to £50 per pupil per year - a tenth of what it estimated was needed. Spread over three years, the extra cash is worth about 1% of the annual schools budget, said the EPI. The support was lower than in other countries, said the think tank, with catch-up funding in England, including earlier announcements, worth £310 per pupil over three years, compared with £1,600 in the United States and £2,500 in the Netherlands. Elizabeth, a mother of two from Worcester, welcomed the idea of more help for children in class. ""I want children to be supported in school and extra teachers - and the children split into smaller groups with additional classroom support is always going to be a good thing."" But she does not want children to be put under too much pressure.  ""We don't want to cram in the curriculum, we want children to enjoy learning and not put pressure on pupils or teachers to do more in the school day. ""For my children, the day is long enough - five days a week 9am to 3.30pm. They come home and they are knackered, particularly my eldest who has started high school - there is so much for him to take in and absorb.  ""If the day was extended to 4.30pm they would come home, have their tea, do their homework and there would be very little down-time. ""I did read some of the plans may have included after-school clubs like music, that's a good thing but not to do more curriculum learning.""  There had been reports the recovery plan would be much bigger and include a longer school day - but funding for any further catch-up proposals will now depend on the next spending review. But Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that an extended school day was ""very much still on the agenda"". Asked whether the funding was less than required, Mr Williamson said the catch-up plan was based on the evidence of what works - and that tutoring ""does actually deliver"" and should not be the ""preserve of a few"". He said the £1.4bn was a ""pretty hefty amount"" and would ""have a direct impact on children"". Suggestions of shorter summer holidays were no longer being considered, said the education secretary. The hesitation over plans for an extended school day would not have been seen as much as a loss to sixth formers at St Wilfrid's Catholic school in Crawley, West Sussex. They wanted a return to normality and ""certainty"" after so much upheaval, rather than adding extra hours, which could leave students tired rather than inspired. ""It feels like the pandemic has been constant pressure and uncertainty,"" said Katelan, a Year 12 student. ""The most important thing the government could give us as students is clarity. And clarity early on and not just a few months before we're due to take the exams,"" says Catherine, expecting to take her A-levels next summer. The pupils were ""delighted"" to be back in the classroom in March, rather than relying on online lessons - and if tutoring is going to be provided they want it to be in-person rather than online. The BBC has learned a much bigger and more ambitious plan costing just over £10bn was still under discussion between government departments as recently as last week, but this was rejected by the Treasury.  Sources close to the talks said the Treasury was reluctant to sign off on such a big upfront commitment.  In response, a Whitehall source said: ""It's right for both children and the taxpayer that we know what we're buying before we spend."" The education recovery tsar, Sir Kevan Collins, had previously talked of the importance of extra teaching hours, including for sports, music and the arts. There were reports he had proposed a £15bn recovery package, but he said the tutoring and teacher training announced represented ""evidence-based support to a significant number of our children and teachers"".  But Sir Kevan added that ""more will be needed to meet the scale of the challenge."" Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said the government's response was ""hugely disappointing"" and ""shows a failure to recognise the scale of learning loss"". ""There has obviously been a battle behind the scenes over funding for education recovery,"" said Mr Barton - with a settlement much lower than anticipated. ""Where is the funding for drama and music, sport and skills development?"" asked Mary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union, who added: ""Rarely has so much been promised and so little delivered."" Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the announcement was a ""damp squib"" and ""education recovery cannot be done on the cheap"". But the heads' union leader welcomed that there was no plan to extend the school day, which could have caused ""more harm than good"". Labour's Education Secretary Kate Green said the announcement ""makes a mockery of the prime minister's claim that education is a priority"". Labour's recovery proposals included breakfast clubs and mental health support, as well as tutoring and teacher development. This is not a plan on the scale anyone imagined when the prime minister appointed an adviser, Sir Kevan Collins, to shape bold recovery ideas for England's schools.   In February, Sir Kevan told me in his first interview a broad vision was urgently needed.  From the outset he made clear schools might need extra hours, not just for learning but for sport, music and other activities pupils have missed.   People close to the government talks said that even last week the plans being discussed were ambitious, costing more than £10bn.   But the Treasury, according to these sources, baulked at the cost and honed in on core funding for tutoring which is backed by research evidence.  Schools it seems will have to take their chances, alongside other priorities, in the big spending review this autumn.   Will extra tutoring help your child?

Spread to US Treasury,'Chaos' at Home Office and No 10 baby on way,2024-09-25,2020-02-29,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-51693177,"The resignation of the Home Office's most senior civil servant makes the front of several of Sunday's newspapers. According to the Observer, Priti Patel's future as home secretary is being called into question following the departure of Sir Philip Rutnam. The Sunday Times believes it leaves the government reeling at a time when the Home Office is expected to play a pivotal role in an expected coronavirus outbreak and the new points-based immigration system, due to begin next January.  The Sun on Sunday feels Sir Philip's decision to go to war with Ms Patel revealed the ""breathtaking arrogance which triggered the showdown in the first place"".  Allies of the home secretary claimed Sir Philip had jumped before he was pushed, the Mail on Sunday reports, calling the ex-civil servant ""Sir Calamity"". In the Sunday Mirror's view, Ms Patel is a symptom of what is wrong with the government.  For Sir Philip to be driven to resign and to give up a handsome payoff, the paper argues, that ""shows there is something rotten at the core of government"".   The Sunday Telegraph reports that civil servants have turned on the government's most senior adviser, Sir Mark Sedwill, accusing him of going ""native"" after having failed publicly to back Sir Philip last week.    The resignation also prompts a debate about the role of civil servants and ministers.  The Sun argues that the government cannot be ruled by Sir Humphreys - a reference to the Yes Minister character - ""employing every trick in the book to delay and frustrate those elected to enact the will of the people"".  Unfortunately, says the Sunday Telegraph, Whitehall has come to regard itself as a semi-constitutional check on the executive - and that needs to change. There are many photographs of Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds following their announcement that she's expecting a baby and they have become engaged.  What a good day to announce a No 10 baby, says the Sunday Times.  Most of the front page of the Sunday Telegraph is devoted to the news, while the Mail on Sunday offers its readers a six-page special.  The Sun says he will become a dad for the sixth time - and the first prime minister in nearly two hundred years to marry while in office. With the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus continuing to rise, Boris Johnson tells the Sun on Sunday that the whole world is holding its breath.   In an article for the paper, he acknowledges that people in the UK are understandably concerned.  But he concludes on an optimistic note, saying he had no doubt that with the help of the NHS, the country would get through it and beat it.  The scale of the government's contingency preparations is becoming clear.  The Observer says the government's latest plans to tackle the virus include bringing a ""Dad's Army"" of former health professionals out of retirement.  The Mail on Sunday reports that Parliament could be suspended under a ""secret plan"" to combat the worst case scenario.   And the Sunday Telegraph says it understands ministers are planning on the basis that 2.3 million people could end up in critical care as a result of an epidemic, under a ""reasonable worst case scenario"". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning Reporting on the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the Observer says a sense of panic was palpable in all corners of the financial system on Friday.  The paper's economics editor, Phillip Inman, says city analysts were unable to give a sense of how individual economies could be affected or where stock markets might settle.   The Times says markets fear more turmoil this week after latest figures showed that China's economy suffered a record slump last month. In the Sunday Express, the financial analyst Louise Cooper notes how the speed and scale of the collapse is comparable to the great crashes of the past, including October 1987.  Meanwhile, there is much speculation about the Budget. The Sunday Times reports that Chancellor Rishi Sunak, is planning to pay for a spending spree in the north of England by scrapping entrepreneurs' relief, which allows businesses to pay a preferential rate of tax.   The Observer suggests he will have to rethink key parts of his statement because of growing fears that the spread of coronavirus will trigger a global economic downturn. Elsewhere, the Mail on Sunday's lead story focuses on leaked emails from a Treasury adviser, who has suggested that Britain does not need its own farming industry.  It describes the comments by Tim Leunig as ""astonishing"", saying they exemplify the ""radical thinking within the prime minister's inner circle against bastions of the establishment"". Finally, there is a sense of shock in the sports pages after ""one of the greatest unbeaten streaks"" in English football, according to the Sunday Telegraph, is over. The Sunday Mirror talks of Liverpool's air of invincibility being blown away by struggling Watford.  Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Oliver Holt says the defeat will not stop Liverpool winning the title, ""but it felt like a seismic shock, nonetheless""."

Spread to US Treasury,US airlines used up spare cash buying back shares,2024-09-25,2020-03-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51903947,"America's biggest airlines have called on Washington for more than $50bn (£41bn) in aid as they suffer the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.  US President Donald Trump on Monday pledged to back the industry ""100%"". But figures suggest major carriers spent almost all their spare cash in the last decade buying back their own shares. It comes as the airline industry is facing huge losses and widespread layoffs as passengers stay at home. Data revealed by Bloomberg show major airlines including United and American Airlines used up an average 96% of their spare cash buying back their own shares. Companies buy back their own shares for a number of reasons. Some have built up big cash piles that they don't want to sit on so spend the money buying back previously issued shares. This helps them reduce their costs as they have fewer shareholders to pay dividends to.  Buying back stocks can also push up the company's share price, which many investors use to measure a company's performance. American Airlines led the pack, buying back more than $12.5 billion of its own shares from 2010 to 2019, according to Bloomberg figures. United Airlines used 80% of its spare cash buying back its shares. The average S&P 500 Index company spent about 50% of its spare cash buying back its own shares during this period. With limited cash reserves and a significant drop in revenues expected, US airlines are looking for government assistance of more than $50bn. Plane maker Boeing is also one of the firms looking for short-term assistance. US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said last week that airlines are ""on top of the list"" for government help."
Spread to US Treasury,'We could end up with no business or savings',2024-09-25,2020-04-17,By Daniel Thomas and Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52308823,"Andy Shaw, 57, has built up a painting and decorating firm with his brother-in-law Jake, but has now seen work dry up owing to the coronavirus lockdown. ""We could come out of this with no business or savings, it would be absolutely devastating,"" he says. Why? Because the business is a limited company and the duo are company directors who pay themselves in dividends. Like hundreds of thousands of people running their businesses the same way, they will get little or no state support.  His firm has been able to furlough, or put on state-paid leave, its two full-time members of staff to take off some of the pressure. But he and Jake will personally be eligible for much less, as they pay themselves in dividends, which the government will not cover. ""We can furlough ourselves for the small basic salaries we take, but that will only leave us with £600 a month, which doesn't cover my outgoings at all,"" says Andy, from Uttoxeter, Staffordshire. By furloughing themselves, they would not be allowed to work on anything that brings in money for the business, only organisational work as a director. ""It means we won't be able to work at a time when our business is on the brink,"" he says. There is a real prospect he might have to shut up shop and lay off his staff. Turning from a sole trader into a limited company has been popular in the past, with small business owners - from marketing agents to milkmen - becoming company directors and using the professional-sounding title that comes with it. Historically, it saved on their tax bill, although that benefit has been considerably watered down in recent times. For many, the attraction was to separate personal finances from that of the business and to protect themselves as individuals if something went wrong with a supplier or customer.  Even that benefit can be reduced if, for example, banks still require the business owner's home as collateral for a loan. Like so many businesses, they are now facing difficulties in the light of the coronavirus restrictions, and the choice of becoming a limited company looks set to be an expensive one. The government has said it will pay 80% of employed and self-employed workers' incomes, up to £2,500 a month, for three months if they are furloughed. But it will not cover dividends, because it says there is no way of telling whether people have received them in lieu of wages or as a return on capital in their own company or an investment. This means people such as Andy and Jake, who pay themselves mostly in dividends, say that typically furlough pay - covering 80% of what they pay themselves as a salary - would typically give them about £585 per month, making it difficult to put food on the table after business and personal bills are paid. Campaigners point out that most company directors are not especially wealthy, with many running small firms or operating by themselves. ""These are real, hard-working people who have built up successful businesses and paid taxes all their lives, who now find themselves facing hardship with little of the current support available for them,"" says Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses. Some 327,000 people have signed a petition calling on the government to change course. One remedy, they argue, is for dividend income to be included in the calculations for furlough, rather than only a salary. Although the small business minister has offered some support, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he is open to ideas, there is no plan from the Treasury to change its policy as yet. ""Those who do not qualify for the support schemes will be able to access a range of other measures,"" a Treasury spokeswoman says, including income tax referrals and mortgage holidays. Nick Steele, 46, is one of many who say they set up as a limited company on the encouragement of one government, only now to be treated inferiorly by another. He and his partner have run a hospitality recruitment company in Gloucestershire since 2006, but since the epidemic hit, all of their work has evaporated. ""Back then, I think they thought it was more controllable and easier to tax limited companies. Now it seems this government wants to crush us,"" he says. ""I have no choice but to sell personal possessions and borrow money. For the record, I can't get a government grant because I have no premises; I might be able to get a loan, but I don't want to take that risk."" He thinks the government is uninterested in supporting limited company directors because of a perception they pay less tax. But the recruitment professional, who earns about £45,000 a year, mainly in dividends, says he pays ""no more or less tax than self-employed or employed people"". He also points out he is not entitled to government subsidised benefits such as statutory sick pay. ""I'm not some high net worth individual, I'm not squirrelling money away. I fill out a tax return every year, it's just that in one column I state my income from PAYE, and in another the income from dividends. ""The government's policy just doesn't stack up."" Sonali Joshi, 45, whose business provides access services to the film industry, such as subtitles and audio descriptions, says she is struggling to make ends meet. ""While we have plenty of ideas of how to reconfigure our business during this difficult time, we need investment to do this and right now we have nothing."" She says they cannot access a Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan, according to their bank, because their 2019 turnover was less than £100,000. They are also not eligible for a £10,000 government grant for small-to-medium sized enterprises that receive rates relief, as they do not have any premises. ""VAT deferral does little for us, since work tailed off weeks ago, as we work internationally and coronavirus began to impact our work much earlier this year. We also do not qualify for universal credit,"" she says. ""We feel let down by the government. We hear the chancellor saying, 'We are all in this together,' and that the UK is a great environment for small business, but it doesn't feel like that now, due to the lack of support."""
Spread to US Treasury,Europe's oldest student newspaper saved from closure,2024-09-25,2023-10-10,By Auryn Cox,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-67066685,"Europe's oldest student newspaper has been saved from closure after an online fundraiser raised more than £2,000. Edinburgh University's the Student was founded by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson in 1887.  It is financially independent from both the university and its students' association, so relies on advertising and fundraising to stay afloat.  But the loss of a major advertiser earlier this year put its future in doubt.  The Student's editor-in-chief, Joe Sullivan, told BBC Scotland News the paper was barely scraping by financially and would not have been able to continue to fund its printing costs.  Having been in print for 136 years, that was something the paper did not want to lose,"" he said. ""As a community publication having a presence in print, on counters, in newsstands, across all the student parts of Edinburgh - without that visibility we might not be able to survive as a digital publication."" A fundraiser was set up on 5 October with an initial goal of £1,000. It has now reached more than £2,000. Joe said: ""We are so overjoyed, I mean we have hit double our initial goal. We couldn't ask for more really, we're all really excited and really grateful. ""The donations have come in from all kinds of people but the most heartening to see has been people in the student community, members of our audience who just want to see us keep printing."" Joe said the bulk of the donations will go towards printing costs and the rest will be used to invest in better equipment to help produce the newspaper. Former reporters for the Student include Laura Kuenssberg, Helen Pidd, Gordon Brown, Robin Cook and James Kirkup. The paper is currently run by a team of 25 volunteers and before the fundraiser the editors had looked at the possibility of seeking university funding. However, it was agreed that editorial independence was more important.  ""Some of our most impactful reporting has been reporting on both the university and the students' association, not always in a positive light,"" Joe said. ""Being editorially and financially independent of both allows us to really give our audience honest coverage of what is happening at the university."" "
Spread to US Treasury,US threatens more sanctions on Turkey,2024-09-25,2018-08-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45217335,"The US has threatened to impose more economic sanctions on Turkey if it does not free a detained American pastor. Andrew Brunson has been held in Turkey for nearly two years over alleged links to outlawed political groups. The dispute over his release has seen the two Nato allies impose tariffs on one another's goods. This has worsened a crisis for Turkey's currency, the lira, which has lost about a third of its value against the dollar since January. The crisis has prompted widespread selling in other emerging markets, sparking fears of a global crisis. The lira has staged a small recovery but that is threatened by a fresh tweet from US President Donald Trump. He said early on Friday that Turkey had ""taken advantage of the United States for many years"" and that he was ""cutting back on Turkey"". On Thursday, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said: ""We have more that we are planning to do if they don't release him [Mr Brunson] quickly.""  Last week, the US doubled its tariffs on metal imports from Turkey.  Turkey vowed it would not succumb to threats. A court refused to release Mr Brunson, and the the government in Ankara increased tariffs on imports from the US of cars, alcoholic drinks and leaf tobacco - and the lira recovered slightly. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused the US of trying to ""bring Turkey to its knees"". Ankara accuses Mr Brunson - who operates a tiny evangelical church in Izmir - of having links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for a failed coup two years ago. Mr Brunson has denied charges of espionage, but faces up to 35 years in jail if found guilty. The US insists the pastor, a long-time Turkish resident, is ""a victim of unfair and unjust detention"". Mr Trump described him as ""our wonderful Christian Pastor, who I must now ask to represent our Country as a great patriot hostage"".  The influential Protestant evangelical church in the US is a major support base for Mr Trump. Mr Erdogan is angry that the US has not taken more action against the Gulenist movement and what he said was a failure ""to unequivocally condemn"" the 2016 coup attempt. The US has refused to extradite Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania. US support for Kurdish rebel groups fighting Islamic State fighters in northern Syria is another major difficulty, given Turkey's battle against a Kurdish insurgency in its own country. Mr Erdogan wrote in the New York Times earlier that unless the US changed course, Turkey would look for new friends and allies. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, visited Ankara on Tuesday, branding the US sanctions an illegitimate policy.  It's an awkward triangle, given that Turkey is a Nato member, Russia is Nato's number one threat and the organisation is obliged to defend any member that is attacked. President Erdogan has urged Turks to shore up the currency by not trading in dollars and euros. On Monday, the central bank said it would provide all the liquidity Turkish banks needed, as it seeks to keep money flowing in the financial system. There are signs that the weakness in Turkish currency markets is already spreading.  South Africa's rand, Russia's rouble, the Indian rupee and Indonesia's rupiah have all taken a hit from the crisis in Turkey."
Spread to US Treasury,"Reopening NHS services must be safe, unions say",2024-09-25,2020-05-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52668014,"Rapid testing and an adequate supply of protective equipment must be in place when the NHS reopens services cancelled during the peak of the coronavirus oubreak, health unions have said. The unions have put forward a nine-point plan for the NHS to reopen safely as lockdown restrictions ease. And staff working through the crisis should be paid overtime and a public sector pay freeze ruled out, they say. The government has said it is working ""around the clock"" to provide more PPE. NHS England has told hospitals to restart routine and non-urgent operations and procedures which were put on hold to create more capacity for Covid-19 patients.  But 16 unions, including Unison, the Royal College of Nursing, Unite and GMB, said they wanted the NHS to continue to operate a ""safety-first"" approach as outpatient clinics and operations resume.  They said they wanted to avoid a repeat of the PPE supply problems which ""sapped"" staff confidence and ""caused widespread and unnecessary anxiety"". Access to readily available PPE was also important as employers in other parts of the economy begin to open up their workplaces and source protective kit for staff, they added. Moving towards a ""new normal"" for NHS hospitals could be almost as big a challenge as coping with the immense pressure during the April peak of Covid-19 patient admissions.   That's the fear of health unions with their new call to ministers and health leaders in the UK's national administrations.  It comes after NHS England told hospitals to restart routine surgery and procedures. Unions want assurances on future supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) which will be needed for non-urgent operations as well as intensive care.  They say members who have been working under great strain are vulnerable to burn out and should be rotated out of the most stressful environments.   They want to be convinced that social distancing will be properly observed in A&E.  NHS England says new guidelines have been set out with staff and patient safety paramount. But there is a lot of discussion still to be had about how the health service will attempt to cope with the backlog of postponed work as well as watching out for another spike in virus cases. Unison's Sara Gorton, who also chairs the NHS group of unions, said the health sector faced another ""crucial test"" after handling the outbreak. She added: ""As hospitals get busier, and clinics and other services begin to reopen, the safety of staff and patients is paramount. ""But this can't happen without plentiful and constant PPE supplies. ""Tackling Covid has been a huge challenge, but this next phase will be a crucial test, too."" The unions represent more than one million workers across the UK, including nurses, midwives, 999 call handlers, cleaners, porters and paramedics. Other measures in their plan include ensuring two-metre social distancing rules are maintained, allowing some staff to work from home and regularly redeploying staff working in high-risk areas to those under less pressure.  Some 40,000 staff who have returned to the NHS could be moved to help short-staffed areas, the unions say. They also called for staff to be paid for every hour worked. ""Talk of future pay freezes to pay the bill for the pandemic will outrage nursing, health care staff and the public alike,"" said Hannah Reed, from the Royal College of Nursing. The Daily Telegraph this week reported that a confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis estimates it will cost the exchequer almost £300bn this year and could require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze.  Health experts have warned that it could take months to get the NHS back to normal. Cancer screening has paused in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - with few invitations sent out in England.  Figures released this week show the number of A&E visits in England has halved. since the coronavirus outbreak started, dropping to their lowest level since records began. Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, ""There should not though be a return to business as usual whether in the short, medium or long term, but a reset. ""Health leaders want to establish the impact of the last few months on staff and how best to improve how they are looked after for the longer term.""  In other developments:"
Spread to US Treasury,Easing delay to have 'critical impact' on business,2024-09-25,2021-06-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57467449,"Delaying lockdown easing could have a ""critical impact"" on already struggling businesses and cost UK hospitality £3bn in lost sales, industry groups say.  The government is expected to say that current coronavirus rules will remain in place for another four weeks after the planned 21 June unlocking. Capacity limits will remain in pubs and cinemas and nightclubs will stay shut.  Junior Health Minister Ed Argar said he expected there to be more aid to help businesses cope. Kate Harl said her restaurant, the Bean Inn in St Ives, Cornwall, would be operating at a ""greatly reduced capacity"" due to the delay and her ability to earn would be ""severely restricted"". ""For us the number of covers that we will be doing each night will be down by about 40%,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. ""It feels like we're treading water at the moment. We're not able to progress and make a decent profit. We're not at risk of going under, but it's very very difficult and challenging to go forward."" Ministers are concerned about the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus, now the most prevalent in the UK, which is around 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant first identified in Kent.  UK Hospitality, which represents pubs, bars and restaurants, said it recognised the government had a balance to strike, but it said many businesses were already deeply in debt and called for greater levels of government support. ""Even now, with partial reopening, sector sales remain down 42% and 300,000 jobs remain protected by furlough,"" said boss Kate Nicholls.  ""A one-month delay to restrictions lifting would cost the sector around £3bn in sales - but would also have a knock-on impact on bookings throughout the summer and into the autumn.""   The Night Time Industries Association, which represents nightclubs among other venues, said businesses had been waiting to open for more than 15 months and many had made financial commitments ahead of 21 June.  It said 54% of businesses it surveyed had ordered stock, 73% had called in staff and 60% had sold tickets. The trade group says it will legally challenge any delay, arguing that levels of mortality, hospitalisation and infection are still relatively low. ""To delay would have a huge impact on the sector, losing many businesses [and] livelihoods culminating in further loss of confidence in the sector,"" said chief executive Michael Kill.  ""We will see many more illegal unregulated events take the place of businesses that are licensed and regulated across the country as people express their frustration,"" he added.  Anton Stevens, director of the Hidden Nightclub in Manchester, said further delays to lifting the lockdown restrictions was ""the last thing we need really"".  Mr Stevens said he and colleagues were hopeful that the 21 June opening day was ""on track"". ""Any question of the variants being a deciding factor in delaying the 21 June plans were quashed by the PM only last month and the rise of new cases seemed a formality as the vaccination plan seemed to be working as expected,"" he said. Mr Stevens said his team added more air conditioning units, toilets and washrooms to ""reopen safely"". ""We've hired and trained new staff, a new security company and agreed plans for stock,"" he added. ""There's obviously a cost for all of this work which was needed to reopen safely and we're not going to see any return on the thousands of pounds invested for an extended period, with no mention of a another support package."" The Treasury has said eligible businesses will continue to benefit from business rates relief, VAT reduction and the Recovery Loan Scheme. The furlough scheme and support for the self-employed is in place until September. But business groups want the chancellor to go further.  The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said business support measures should reflect the level of restrictions announced and remain in place until the economy is able to reopen fully.  ""We would be calling for the government to provide further cash grants, at least equivalent to levels provided during the first lockdown, and to delay the tapering of government payments into the furlough scheme, planned for the start of July,"" said BCC co-executive director Claire Walker. ""The government should also look at extending the trade credit reinsurance scheme beyond the end of June to minimise possible disruptions in insurance coverage."" Junior Health Minister Ed Argar told Sky News: ""I know that when [the prime minister] addresses his decision, sets out what he intends to do around the easing on the 21st, he will address those points as well. ""He is very mindful of the need for businesses and others to get the support they need if they continue to be locked down or unable to open."" A Treasury spokesperson said it was ""committed to helping businesses and individuals through the pandemic and deliberately went long with our support to provide certainty over the summer"".   ""The furlough scheme and support for the self employed is in place until September and eligible businesses will continue to benefit from business rates relief, VAT reduction and the Recovery Loan Scheme,"" they added."
Spread to US Treasury,'I stole a plane to get out of the Navy',2024-09-25,2019-09-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-49773399,"For two years the BBC's Emma Jane Kirby has been investigating the story of Sgt Paul Meyer, a homesick American mechanic who stole a plane from a US airbase in England in 1969, to fly home to his wife in Virginia. The story resonated with Dutch reader Theo Van Eijck, who says he too stole a plane while serving in the forces. But he survived to tell the tale. Theo Van Eijck's little house in Somerset is a treasure trove of curiosities. Toy witches swing on tiny broomsticks from the ceiling of his sitting room, a family of ceramic cats peers down inquiringly from the higher shelves and a couple of skulls sit grinning on the sideboard. But the most fascinating items of all are spread out on Van Eijck's coffee table - Dutch newspaper clippings from 1964, with show-stopping headlines reporting the antics of a young sailor who stole a Grumman Tracker propeller plane from his military base in Malta and flew it to Benghazi, Libya. ""It's me!"" laughs Van Eijck, now white-haired and aged 76. ""That's me right there in the photo and I was just 21!"" His wife hands me a mug of coffee and shakes her head in mock despair as he translates the stories for me. ""Arrogant little man!"" she jokes, wagging her finger at him. ""Good job I didn't know you back then."" Back then Theo Van Eijck was just a young man who dreamt of flying. In fact, he'd had fantasies about flying since he was seven years old. He wasn't, he admits, the greatest student in the world and feared he would never make the grades needed to join the Air Force as a pilot. But then he heard about a scheme in the Dutch Navy whereby a young man could enter the service as a trainee electrician, and if he did well could apply internally for the Navy's pilot training course. Aged just 19 and full of optimism, Van Eijck didn't hesitate. He signed up immediately for eight years. He picks up a black-and-white photograph of himself in the cockpit of a small plane from the coffee table and hands it to me. From under a heavy dark helmet, I see a boyish face grinning in utter delight, impatient to stop posing and eager to take off. ""Oh, it started well,"" he agrees, when I remark upon how elated he looks in the old print. ""I got selected for the pilot scheme and I loved it."" But in early 1964, with around 40 hours' flying time stamped proudly into his log book, the exhilarated young Van Eijck went to a party at his barracks in Holland and got rather drunk. His commanding officer was at the party and also rather the worse for wear. He suggested to Van Eijck that they should talk frankly about the quality of the pilot training scheme (which was conducted jointly by the Belgian Air force and the Dutch Navy) and he invited Van Eijck to be honest. It was, he assured him, an off-the-record discussion.  And so, perhaps naively, 21-year-old Van Eijck spoke openly.  He needed to be trained on a proper plane he insisted, a Grumman Tracker submarine destroyer that would be deployed on naval aircraft carriers, not the twin-engine training planes the Belgians were using to teach them. The planes they were being taught on were (Theo grins self-consciously as he remembers the words he used) ""quite frankly, crap"". Up to that point, Van Eijck had maintained a perfect flying record but the very next day after the party he had his report card marked with an orange warning sign, which meant he was at imminent risk of being failed. Furious at the injustice, he wrote something cocky about the slowness of the training programme on the classroom blackboard, while waiting for the instructor to arrive. That move saw him jailed at his barracks for a weekend, but seeing a skirting board was loose he managed to use it to slide back the bolt across his cell door, and escaped. When his absence was discovered, he was immediately kicked out of the pilot's scheme. Van Eijck was encouraged to appeal against the decision by superiors who admired his gumption. But the officers inadvertently gave him the wrong forms to fill in. When he finally got a response, three months later, he was told he had not followed correct procedure and it was now too late to take further action. He was no longer to train as a pilot and must serve out his remaining six years in the Navy as an electrician.  ""I come from a big family,"" says Van Eijck who is number nine in a line of 12 brothers and sisters. ""And in the family we knew that right was right and wrong was wrong. And this was wrong. It just wasn't fair."" Depressed and despondent, with his dreams of flying now shattered, Van Eijck pleaded to be discharged from the Navy, but his request was repeatedly refused. So he started plotting to find a way to extract himself from the force once and for all. ""I told absolutely no-one,"" he smiles coyly. ""If I had told someone it would not have worked."" Just like Sgt Paul Meyer, Theo van Eijck decided his ticket to freedom was to steal a plane. He found a handbook for a Grumman Tracker plane and hid it in his locker. While his friends went out drinking or headed to bed, Van Eijck secretly studied. He befriended the qualified pilots and chatted to them about instrument flying, about engine start-ups, about take-offs. ""Little did they know why I was interested!"" he sniggers. ""But from Holland the route was difficult - I didn't want to end up in East Germany with all that political trouble. And then one day they asked for volunteers to go on a two-month exercise in Malta with the British Navy. And I thought, from Malta I could fly anywhere!"" In Malta, Van Eijck hung around the aerodrome chatting to the aviation mechanics, watching them work. In the early mornings and evenings, he continued to study his now well-thumbed Tracker handbook. On the last weekend before he was due to fly home, he politely attended the farewell party on the base but while his fellow servicemen succumbed to the temptations of the freely flowing liquor, the young Van Eijck was careful to stay completely sober. ""And that's where my story matches Sgt Paul Meyer's,"" he says. ""Because the next morning, I got up early and I borrowed a bike and biked to the runway. Sgt Meyer told the guard his name was Capt Epstein. I told the one guard on duty I was called Jansen - which is like Smith in Dutch - so he had no idea who I was and he helped me open the doors of the hangar!"" Van Eijck had planned his theft meticulously, he says, even locking up the guard's pistol and bike and removing the microphones from the telephone in his office, to ensure that if he was rumbled too soon, the guard would struggle to get back-up. Van Eijck's blue eyes twinkle as he remembers the thrill of that morning. ""So I started the engine, switched the radio on and the control tower started asking who I was, what I was doing. I didn't answer. I taxied and then…"" He rubs his hands together theatrically and shows me his open palms like a magician delighting in performing an elaborate disappearing trick.   ""And then…. I was gone."" And so was the Dutch Navy's Grumman Tracker submarine destroyer aircraft, armed with two torpedoes and heading for North Africa.  ""I did worry a bit about the torpedoes,"" admits Van Eijck. ""But I didn't care because I just wanted out of it. No way was the Navy going to get me back."" Flying at 5,000 feet over the Mediterranean to conserve fuel, Van Eijck was completely alone in the sky. ""I know how Sgt Meyer must have felt,"" he says. ""Because it's what I felt. It was the best thing ever; you're doing something that everyone says can't be done and it's all you. All you in this big machine and you're more powerful than anyone else, all lonely in that big sky and..."" He tails off suddenly and I realise he's crying. ""No-one can take it away from you,"" he says, choking on his words. ""It was marvellous, so powerful. I can still feel it now. And I was totally convinced I can do this."" I remind Van Eijck that as Sgt Meyer sat in the cockpit, trying to work out where he was going and what he was doing, he called his wife on the radio to calm himself. I ask Van Eijck if he thought of his own family as he flew into the unknown. ""My mother,"" he says quietly. ""Yes, I thought of my mother. A week or so before, I had sent her a present. It was a silver cross. And she guessed I was up to something, my mother."" Van Eijck is struggling now to master his tears and asks to pause for a moment so he can drink his coffee. The wind chimes suspended from the ceiling knock gently against one another in the breeze slipping in from the open window, filling our silence with a jangled, staccato music. The yellowed newspaper cuttings on the table flutter and curl. For five-and-a-half hours, 21-year-old Theo Van Eijck flew that plane, wondering where might be the safest place to attempt a landing. At Tripoli the British Army still had a presence and, nervous of trouble, he flew to Benghazi where he saw a landing strip with a few huts on either side. The strip was full of sheep, he says, and he had to circle low over it a few times to make sure the animals scattered and cleared the runway for him. His landing, he recalls proudly, was immaculate, and he took pleasure in the thought that this would be reported back to his commanding officers. ""I thought, 'If I can land nicely those Navy guys must see I can fly!'"" He picks up his flight log book from the table and shows me the scrawled entry in his own large hand from May 1964, where he defiantly recorded his illicit flight in the hijacked plane. On the opposite page someone has overruled the entry, writing firmly and in an indignant hand, ""Not to be totalled!"" Strangely, the first man who came running out of one of the huts next to the landing strip was a Dutch expat, who was stunned - and rather alarmed - to see a military plane land on his runway. Exhausted but still exhilarated, Van Eijck poured out his story. However, as he related his plans for the future - release from the Navy, a new civilian life, a good job - he noticed his fellow countryman frown, and began to realise that perhaps he hadn't thought his plan all the way through. The Dutchman warned him that he was in big trouble and that if returned to Europe, he would certainly go to jail. On his compatriot's advice, Van Eijck gave himself up to the Libyan police, whom he remembers roaring enthusiastically up the air strip on Harley Davidson motorbikes, delighted to be taking a Dutch hijacker into custody. Claiming (again on the advice of his countryman) to have fled Europe because he objected to its liberal views on homosexuality and women, Van Eijck was offered political asylum and protection.  When the Dutch military came to reclaim its AWOL recruit - and of course, to get its stolen plane back - he sometimes refused to see them. When he talks now about those power games, giggling and grinning, it's clear that Van Eijck still relishes the fact that he managed to get one over on the very authorities who had cheated him of his dreams. After a week of negotiations with the Dutch ambassador, Van Eijck agreed to a deal. He would return to the Netherlands (a passenger rather than a pilot) and would serve a 12-month jail term in a state prison for desertion. In return he would receive an honourable discharge from the Navy. In some of the newspaper clippings on the table, Van Eijck is shown in his immaculate Navy uniform standing outside the court in the Netherlands, his white sailor's cap pulled down low over his forehead. At first glance he looks like the model sailor - respectable, neat and disciplined. But study his face closely and you will see just a hint of defiance in his eyes, perhaps the faintest traces of scorn across his lips. ""I got what I wanted!"" explains Van Eijck. ""I wanted to get out of the bloody Navy and I got that. And I still don't regret what I did."" Flick past the ignominious page in his flight log book and you will see it is crammed with the details of further flights made in his native Holland or in South Africa, where he lived for many years. This time though they are licensed, legitimate flights; when he left prison, Van Eijck qualified officially as a private pilot. ""It was all I wanted,"" he shrugs. ""I just wanted to fly."" He brings me back to the story of Sgt Meyer and my investigations into what made him crash in the Channel. He is convinced that Meyer had a lot less experience than he did with instrument flying and rather than being shot down by pursuing British, American or French fighter jets, he is convinced he just made a simple pilot error. ""You see, they sent three planes after me,"" he says. ""But they went in the wrong direction so they didn't find me. But I spoke to the pilots afterwards and they were told only to try to make me talk to them on the radio and to follow them; they were never given instructions to shoot me down - and remember, I had two torpedoes on board."" He picks up the helmeted photograph of himself in the cockpit, in the halcyon days before he was kicked out of the Dutch Navy's pilot training programme. ""If you ask me now what I think about it, I think 'What the hell were you doing you bloody fool, how did you get such a stupid idea in your head?'""  He smoothes back his white hair.  ""I still can't believe sometimes that I bloody did it!"" The breeze strengthens and the wind chimes above our heads begin to spill their fractured music again. Theo Van Eijck grips my hand and looks at me with wild, dancing eyes. ""But it was marvellous! My God it was marvellous!"" In January 2018, Greek pilot Vasileios Vasileiou checked into a luxury hilltop hotel in Kabul. The Intercontinental was popular with foreign visitors - which is why, on 20 January, Taliban gunmen stormed it, killing at least 40 people. Vasileios explains how he survived.

Extinction Rebellion organised action in London and Manchester to urge the government to prepare for a ""climate crisis"". Campaigners were arrested after they sat in the middle of the road next to Parliament Square to stop traffic. In Manchester, protesters have been urged to ""reconsider their actions"" following a rise in Covid-19 cases. Extinction Rebellion said it planned to ""peacefully disrupt the UK Parliament in London"" with 10 days of demonstrations until MPs backed the Climate and Ecological Emergency Bill. Other planned events in the capital include a ""carnival of corruption"", which is due to take place outside the Treasury, and a ""walk of shame"" near the Bank of England. Protester Karen Wildin, a 56-year-old tutor from Leicester, said: ""I'm here today because I have serious concerns about the future of the planet - we need to put this above anything else. ""Never mind Covid, never mind A-levels, this is the biggest crisis facing us and we need to raise the message as loudly as possible. ""Not a lot has been done on this issue, everyone needs to hear the message."" Sarah Lunnon, a member of Extinction Rebellion, said: ""The failure to act on this issue will have a catastrophic impact on the future of us and the generations to come. ""We want to occupy Parliament Square to make our voices heard. Of course we're in the middle of a pandemic but we're balancing the risk, this is the biggest issue facing us."" The Metropolitan Police said Tuesday's gathering could only take place off the main roads at Parliament Square Gardens between 08:00 BST and 19:00. Boats, vehicles, trailers or other structures were banned from the procession. The same rules apply for Wednesday's demonstrations. The Met said as of 18:00 Tuesday a total of 90 people had been arrested on suspicion of public order offences. Footage posted online by Extinction Rebellion appeared to show John Lynes, a demonstrator in his 90s, being led away by police near Parliament Square while walking with a stick.  Mr Lynes, from St Leonards-on-Sea in East Sussex, has joined previous protests organised by the group. Met Commander Jane Connors said: ""The reason we have implemented these conditions is that we know these protests may result in serious disruption to local businesses, commuters and our communities and residents, which I will not tolerate."" Last year, more than 1,700 arrests were made during Extinction Rebellion's 10-day Autumn Uprising. In Manchester, a march is planned through the city and Oxford Street has been closed as part of five days of action. City council deputy leader Nigel Murphy said planned demonstrations ""cannot adhere"" to social distancing rules. The city has increased restrictions due to a recent rise in Covid-19 cases. Mr Murphy said while the council respected ""the right to peaceful protest"" this should ""not be at the expense of local people"". He said: ""We are in the midst of a global public health crisis and we would ask demonstrators to seriously reconsider their actions at the current time. ""Manchester is currently under increased restrictions to limit the spread of the virus because the number of cases has been rising. Gatherings larger than six should only take place if everyone is exclusively from two households or support bubbles."" He said the city had one of the ""most ambitious carbon targets in the UK"" and was ""working to become zero carbon by 2038"".  A Titanic-themed demonstration was also held in in Southend-on-Sea where protesters said much of Essex would be underwater by 2050"
Spread to US Treasury,Arena inquiry: Saffie's mum on hearing the truth,2024-09-25,2022-03-07,By Judith Moritz,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60579079,"Last month, the inquiry into the bombing of an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena heard its final scheduled evidence. The BBC's Judith Moritz has followed the family of Saffie-Rose Roussos - the youngest of the 22 victims - as they have uncovered details of their daughter's death while learning to live with their grief. Saffie Roussos' bedroom looks just how you would expect an eight-year-old's room to look. Her name plate is on the door. Her vibrant My Little Pony dressing gown hangs on a peg. Her tiny pink Converse boots sit on a chair. And at the centre of it, her white bed is festooned with scatter cushions, fairy lights and pom poms.  Her artwork adorns the walls. A painting which reads, ""I love mummy so much"" and a drawing of the whole family, with ""me, Saffie"", written in felt tip. But Saffie has never visited this room. And although the bed is beautifully made up, she'll never sleep in it. Saffie's childhood stopped abruptly when she was murdered in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.  Before she was killed, Saffie lived with her parents Lisa and Andrew, and brother Xander, in their flat above the family fish and chip shop in Leyland, Lancashire. But when the bomb went off, their lives were changed in a fraction of a second. After the explosion they never returned home. They never opened up the chippy again. Lisa went through months of hospital treatment, and when it was over the family went on holiday to Dorset. And they decided to stay there for good. ""We just basically escaped. I suppose a bit like running away,"" says Andrew Roussos.   Saffie's things were packed up, and for a long time her parents found it too painful to go through them. Their move south gave them space, and put distance between them and the intensity of Manchester. There, the civic ""bee"" emblem had taken on a new dimension, spread across the city on posters, walls and tattoos. Lisa found it both supportive and stifling.  She says: ""In the north, where it happened, they still talk about it now. They still think about the families and everybody, and that's beautiful and I wanted that. But at the same time, with us moving here, you can pick and choose when to look at it, when to face it. It's quiet, you've got the sea, the countryside. I think it was the best decision."" Lisa admits she had been torn. She initially did not want to move as she felt she was moving away from Saffie, wanting to be where she had lived.  It was a while before she realised that it would be possible to relocate, and still feel close to her little girl. ""Saffie will always be with us,"" she says simply. Lisa and Andrew started house-hunting. They needed a two-bedroom house, for themselves and Xander, but they decided to search for a three-bed. Saffie would have her own room again as her parents decided it was time to unpack her belongings, and create a new room for her.  Lisa explains they did not want to put her things away into cupboards or the loft, wanting instead to move forward with Saffie.  ""We've changed the knobs on her wardrobe. Even though we wanted to keep her furniture, I've updated it a little bit because I know she would like new things.   The Roussos family is an intensely private unit. They take comfort in each other, and have largely eschewed public attention. But they have always wanted the world to know how special Saffie was to them. That is what led them to invite me to their home as part of the process of making our film about Saffie for Panorama. I first met Andrew just weeks after the bombing, when Lisa was still in hospital and the family was reeling from the attack. He told me then that Saffie had always wanted to be famous for singing and dancing like her idol Ariana Grande.  He could never have imagined that her name would be connected with the singer's for the most tragic reasons. He said he was determined to reclaim the joy that had surrounded his daughter during her short life. That meant telling as wide an audience as possible about the wonder of his little girl and the happiness she brought. We filmed an interview and I told Andrew to keep in touch. I also asked him if Lisa was likely to want to say anything publicly when the time was right. There was significant media interest in their story, and I wondered if she would be as keen to speak about Saffie as her husband. A few weeks later, Andrew suggested that I visit the couple at Wythenshawe hospital in Manchester. Lisa had been so badly hurt in the attack that she was initially only given a 20% chance of survival. By the summer of 2017, they were living as a family in hospital accommodation while her treatment continued. When I met Lisa, it was clear that the time was not right for her to do an interview. She was having to cope with her own rehabilitation while coming to terms with the news that her youngest child had not survived the atrocity. I had been invited to meet her as a journalist, but I am also a mum, and my heart went out to her on a personal level. I had been to the arena with my own children a few weeks before the bombing, I knew that it could have been me in Lisa's shoes. I struggled to find the right words to express my sympathy.  It took another two years before Lisa decided that she wanted to talk publicly about what she was going through, and another two before she reached the point of inviting me to see her daughter's room in Dorset. She said she wanted to show me something special. Watch Panorama Manchester Arena Bombing: Saffie's Story is on BBC One Monday 7 March at 20:00 or watch later on BBC iPlayer There, we sat on Saffie's bed - she felt it was finally time to look through her daughter's baby box of keepsakes, something that she had found too painful after the attack, worried about the emotions it would unleash. In fact, Lisa beams as she shows me the scan pictures, talking about the pregnancy and how Saffie would not stop moving, a real livewire as she had been throughout her life. Each treasure - her first lock of hair, her newborn ID bracelet - unlocks a memory and she basks in them. She picks out a pair of miniature flip flops. ""I bought them in Kefalonia. I remember pushing her in her pram with them on and they kept falling off."" The tears come, but they are mixed with laughter as Lisa remembers the happy moments. She and Andrew have spoken to me several times about the pattern grief has taken for them. They describe it as a constant never-ending presence that has evolved into something they are learning to live with.  At the same time, they have also reached the stage of wanting to find out more about what happened to Saffie. For a long time, they did not want to know a great level of detail. But as the public inquiry into the attack started in September 2020, their legal team prepared them for hard times ahead.  The couple had always believed that their daughter died within seconds of the bomb exploding, and that she had not suffered. But at the inquiry they learned that Saffie had lived for an hour, and that she had died as a result of blood loss from leg injuries. Her legs were never given tourniquets or splinted. Two sets of experts at the public inquiry are in dispute over whether she might have survived if she had received better emergency care. Andrew says: ""It was our biggest fear. Our minds were set to, 'right, a bomb detonated, she lost her life, and it went quickly'. So that's what we chose to carry on life with. Finding out exactly what happened is hard to take… It's torture on top of torture."" The couple have been represented at the public inquiry by Pete Weatherby QC, who explains: ""Saffie was able to talk, able to drink water. In the ambulance something like 40 minutes after detonation she asked the ambulance staff if she was going to die. Therefore, the issue of whether there were further interventions that might have made a difference to Saffie became apparent."" The Roussos family solicitor, Nicola Brook, had to tell the couple Saffie had lived for a while, with an unknown degree of possibility about whether she could have survived. She then had to ask whether they wanted to explore that further. ""That is, without a shadow of a doubt, the hardest conversation I've ever had to have,"" she says. Lisa and Andrew agreed they were ready to look into the intricacies of Saffie's case. But they have had very different approaches to the Manchester Arena Inquiry, which has been running for 18 months.  Andrew has followed nearly every day of the hearings by remote video link. Lisa has found them too distressing to listen to, and relies on Andrew to outline the main issues for her. But when it came to giving evidence, ​both were determined to go into the witness box in person, and so they steeled themselves to make the trip from Dorset back up to Manchester. I joined them again that morning, as they packed their car for the trip, which Lisa confessed she had been dreading.  She said it had been causing her sleepless nights and she would not do it if she didn't have to. ""I know it's going to be emotionally draining. But I just thought, 'Lisa, you've got to do it. You've got to do it for Saffie. She hasn't got that voice, so we have to give it to her.'"" At court, the couple told the inquiry about their experiences on the night of the attack. How Lisa lay on the floor of the arena foyer unable to move. And how Andrew spent all night searching for her and Saffie. He and Xander travelled to three hospitals, and only discovered that Saffie had died the following afternoon. The public inquiry has given him an opportunity to dig deep into what happened. He says, ""What drives me, I suppose, is knowing the information. So I'm there representing us as a family and Saffie as our daughter. Even though the legal team are there to do that, I want to know. I want to scrutinise everybody to the point of getting to the truth."" Grieving for a child can destroy a marriage. But Lisa and Andrew each say they could not have managed without the other. Their characters complement each other. Andrew is passionate and talkative. Lisa is a calming presence. The experience of speaking in court was draining for them both. Afterwards they were clearly exhausted, but relieved. Lisa said she was glad she had taken part as it was her one chance to say what she needed to say. ""The build-up to it was awful but I do feel better now that I've done it,"" she says. But the couple are clear that the inquiry has to make a real difference.  Andrew says he is angry lessons still need to be learned: ""My argument is why didn't you learn from 7/7? Why didn't you learn from 9/11? Why didn't you learn from the Paris attacks in 2016? This wasn't the first terrorist attack."" He adds: ""I just hope the whole process of this inquiry does what it set out to do. What it's meant to do. We're never going to stop this… but at least at the next attack we'll be more prepared."" Their time at court was not the only intense moment of the family's trip to Manchester.  Saffie used to love playing with her mobile phone. She had taken endless selfies with it. Naturally, she took it with her on the night of the Ariana Grande concert. But it shattered in the blast and when it was returned to her parents, it seemed beyond repair.  Lisa and Andrew told me they had tried everything to make it work again. They badly wanted to look at the photos on it, to have a last glimpse of Saffie's world. I asked them if they would trust me to take the phone away for forensic work. In truth, I was not sure if I would be able to get any results, so I was thrilled when I was able to tell them that despite such extensive damage, I was able to have the phone reconstructed - and there were photos to look at. The pictures were Saffie's last selfies. She took them in the car with Lisa on their way to the concert. The little girl is wearing her Ariana Grande T-shirt, and beaming, on what should have been one of the happiest days of her life. Tearfully, Lisa remembered them being taken. She said, ""Me and Saffie were in the back of the car on the way to the arena. It's just so so sad… I wish I'd taken more pictures of me and her. You take them for granted because you don't think of the worst, ever. Why would you? But afterwards you realise how precious and important they are."" Although it is upsetting to see the selfies, Lisa and Andrew say they will always treasure them. They are determined that Saffie will always be a part of their lives. I ask Lisa about the concept of ""closure"" which is sometimes spoken about. She says, ""Who wants closure? It's the opposite. You can't have closure. You don't want closure. You want to take that memory with you forever. We want to take her with us forever. I want to talk about her. I want to remember her. I want everyone to remember her."""
Spread to US Treasury,"Original 2006 meme art sells for $5,100",2024-09-25,2019-12-18,By Tom Gerken,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50817558,"A 13-year-old pencil drawing which became a worldwide meme has been sold on eBay for $5,100 (£3,850). The sketch features Johnny Fiveaces, a character who entered internet folklore before Facebook and Twitter took hold. Originating on the Something Awful forums, the character was drawn alongside two others as ideas for a ""low-quality"" video game. Despite the game being abandoned, Fiveaces has continued to feature on the website as an in-joke since 2006. Johnny Fiveaces is a bearded man reclining at a table while holding an ace playing card, with four more spread before him.  He was drawn by James Kunert-Graf, from Seattle, Washington, and was intended to be a character for a game called The Zybourne Clock, which had been brainstormed by Something Awful members. Something Awful has contributed many influences, good and bad, in online culture - being the start of British journalist Eliot Higgins' work as Brown Moses and Bellingcat and having birthed the Slenderman urban myth in 2009 - but Zybourne Clock was not one. ""This was late 2006,"" says James. ""It was like every project on [Zybourne Clock] turned out to be an unmitigated disaster. There was a lot of enthusiasm. ""There was a rule: People couldn't be too critical or too negative. That meant basically anybody who had any skills or talent got fired. Everybody was left making extremely low-quality content."" James says he was an excited teenager who wanted to be involved, and initially heard no response to his contributed drawings until people started making fun of it on Something Awful. ""I was absolutely horrified. People kept posting about it and posting about it. I was completely earnest, I didn't understand at first what was funny about it."" But the mockery slowly turned into appreciation, as Johnny spawned fanart, fanfiction and cosplays, spilling over to YouTube and Reddit. ""After a few years you had elaborate parody art, comics and paintings: Johnny as Napoleon crossing the alps, Johnny in the creation of Man.""  Upon uncovering the original sketch he had posted in 2006, James was swamped with requests to buy it. ""The first person who contacted me offered $75 for it! That was not enough for me to part with it as I still have a sentimental connection to it."" However, James tweeted that his credit card and student loan debts were enough to see what money he could get for the picture on eBay. ""It exploded from $900 to $4,000 in a couple of hours."" And although initially sceptical, he has confirmed to the BBC that the winning bid is legitimate. The auction was won by prominent YouTuber Freddie Wong, who called the drawing ""pure art"". James attributes a lot of the attention paid to Johnny to Something Awful, and in 2010, the character made its way into a real-life video game, hidden in Fallout: New Vegas. ""For some reason these forums seem to be at the hub of a lot of weird online cultural things, so I'm not surprised it's seeped out"".  The appearance in Fallout ""was probably the biggest surprise, or the first moment it was actually something not directly connected to a forum"". ""It's something that on the one hand seems incredibly well-known,"" says James of his creation. ""Yet on the other hand I've never actually met a person who's ever heard of it."""
Spread to US Treasury,Hospitals 'could be overwhelmed without new tiers',2024-09-25,2020-11-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-55112078,"Hospitals in England could become ""overwhelmed"" with Covid cases if MPs do not back new restrictions, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has said. Many Tory MPs oppose the tougher tier system, which begins on 2 December. But writing in the Times, Mr Gove said MPs - who will vote on the measures next week - need to ""take responsibility for difficult decisions"".  Labour is yet to decide whether it will support the new restrictions. It has warned, however, that areas in tier three will be stretched to ""breaking point"" without further financial support from the Treasury. It comes as a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030. There were also a further 15,871 positive cases registered in the past 24 hours. When England's four-week national lockdown ends on Wednesday, regions will be placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high. In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier. Some MPs say the new system imposes tight restrictions on numerous areas with low cases, and are calling instead for a more localised approach. But Mr Gove has defended the new system, saying that, unless action to slow the spread of coronavirus is taken, the NHS could be ""broken"" and hospitals ""physically overwhelmed"". ""The tiers we had in place before the lockdown had not suppressed [Covid] sufficiently: they were neither strong enough to reduce social contact sufficiently, nor applied widely enough to contain the virus's spread,"" he wrote. He added that, across the UK, about 16,000 beds are filled with Covid-19 patients, compared to a peak in April of almost 20,000 and a low of 740 on 11 September. ""When the country is facing such a national crisis, the truth is that all of us who have been elected to Parliament, not just ministers, must take responsibility for difficult decisions,"" he said. Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotland each area has been placed in one of five tiers. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter restrictions - which are not yet finalised - in the run up to Christmas. They will come into force from Friday, 4 December. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith is among those questioning England's approach. On Friday, he asked ""what was the point of lockdown"" if England ends up with tighter restrictions than it had before the four-week national restrictions came into force. Several Conservative MPs have asked to see the data the government based its decision on. Tory MP Tobias Ellwood told the BBC's Newsnight programme: ""Here in Dorset, we entered lockdown with pretty low figures. We're coming out of it with even lower figures.  ""This last week we've gone down by a third. So we're really surprised to find ourselves in tier two."" Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay, who represents South Thanet, which has the second highest rate of infection in the UK, said he will vote against the new ""draconian"" tiered restrictions. He told BBC Breakfast: ""I think once areas see themselves going in the wrong direction, that actually has a very, very distinct affect on people's behaviour."" ""They almost self-regulate, they actually do take those space, hands, and all of those good things far more seriously."" But epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson, whose advice led to the decision to go into the first lockdown, told Today: ""I know people argue: 'well why are we going into more intensive measures now after lockdown than we were before?'  ""And it's because we don't want to repeat the same mistakes made before this current lockdown and allow cases to rise exponentially again coming into Christmas - particularly in the context that we are going to have a relaxation over Christmas, which does pose some risks."" NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson told BBC Breakfast those who run hospitals are ""worried about the fact that if those rules are too loose and if people go beyond them"" that ""could trigger a third phase"". He said the MPs making policy decisions are ""not epidemiologists, they're not experts about exactly what is the balance between loosening the restrictions and what might then follow - that's for the scientific experts, the epidemiologists"". ""The real problem is January is always the NHS' busiest time of year and therefore it is really important that people not only observe the rules,"" he said. On staffing in hospitals, he said it only takes a ""very, very small amount of sickness in particular areas"" among health workers to result in a ""pretty major problem"". ""If you have a single anaesthetist who is off, then that means 15, 20 other people who are meant to be doing an operation for somebody - that affects their work,"" he said. The new coronavirus tier restrictions will mean 55 million people will be banned from mixing with other households indoors. The tiers areas are in will be reviewed every 14 days, starting 16 December. Differences between the new tiers include restrictions on where households can meet up: Gyms and close-contact beauty services like hairdressers will be able to open in all tiers. People in all tiers who can work from home, should continue to do so. Pubs in tier two can only open to serve ""substantial meals"", while those in tier three can only operate as a takeaway or delivery service. Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds will urge Chancellor Rishi Sunak to extend the Additional Restrictions Grant (ARG) in tier three areas following concerns the new rules will force some local authorities to stretch the grants further than others. Leaders in Lancashire have written to the PM's interim chief of staff saying it is ""unfair"" that areas facing four weeks of restrictions under the lockdown received the same amount as they did for seven weeks. The one-off ARG funding equates to £20 per person in an area and is designed to help closed businesses that do not directly pay business rates, as well as those that do not have to close but are affected by restrictions. Ms Dodds is due to tell the party's online regional conference - Connected North West - on Saturday afternoon: ""It is completely irresponsible for the government to leave tier three areas in the lurch like this again."" A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said ""a host of other support measures"" have been made available. "
Spread to US Treasury,Firms plead for help as customers cancel bookings,2024-09-25,2021-12-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59675031,"Business groups are increasing pressure on the government to assist firms suffering from the rise in Covid cases. The CBI urged ministers to provide support ""in lockstep with future restrictions"", while UK Hospitality called for business rates to be deferred and VAT discounts extended. The spread of the Omicron variant has hit consumer confidence and seen hospitality bookings cancelled. Labour urged further support for firms, but the government has so far declined.  But the chancellor will meet with representatives from the hospitality sector on Thursday to discuss their concerns. The UK government and devolved administrations have not placed any additional restrictions on businesses, such as lockdowns or reduced group sizes for restaurants or bars, but many firms have seen a collapse in customers at a time when they hope to recoup lost earnings. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised people to ""think carefully before you go"" out to socialise. The UK's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty also urged people not to ""mix with people you don't have to"".   The hospitality industry has estimated December takings will be down by 40% - with the damage up to twice that in London. This has prompted UK Hospitality to ask for an extension of the discounted 12.5% VAT rate to stretch beyond its scheduled end in March 2022, and for business rates due in the first quarter of next year to be deferred.  Celebrity chef Tom Kerridge told the BBC one of his restaurants had 654 cancellations in the past six days, during a time of year for the industry which is trying to ""claw our way back to some sort of normality"". He said bar and restaurant owners ""wouldn't have a problem"" if they had to close from a ""government and scientific point of view"" because of Covid, as long as financial support was put in place. But, he added: ""It feels like there's a reactive approach to the situation rather than thinking of being proactive. ""If you're telling people to work from home, which I get and I understand, there's a knock-on effect on many businesses that are reliant on lunch trade... the coffee shop round the corner, the newsagent in the city, hairdressers and nail bars. ""There are so many different places that will be unable to cope. Getting shut down without financial support, a lot of places will close their doors and will not re-open in the new year."" Patrick Dardis, chief executive of pub chain Youngs, said that widespread cancellations and no extra government support would mean hospitality closures in January.  ""I think people are terribly confused and it's certainly having a significant impact,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.  These Christmas weeks were critical for businesses ""hanging on by their fingernails"", he added.  Youngs, which has 80% of its pubs in London, was helped by the reduction in VAT last lockdown and Mr Dardis called on the government to hold VAT for the hospitality sector at the reduced rate of 12.5% and lower business rates. Sam Morgan, who owns restaurants Craft and 8, said his businesses had seen a ""rapid decline"" in bookings, with more than 600 cancellations. ""We've got a perfect storm,"" he said. ""Consumer confidence is low, meaning future bookings or bookings to replace current cancellations are low.  ""Corporate customers are cancelling Christmas and New Year bookings due to nervousness around exposing customers to risk, and staff having members of their parties becoming ill, meaning they must isolate."" Mr Morgan said the situation was ""extremely worrying"", with revenue earned from the festive period used to cover less busy times in the first months of the year. The CBI has called for an instruction from the government to tell councils to immediately release unused grants and rates relief to businesses in need. Conservative MP Anne Marie Morris tweeted that if the government was ""effectively telling people not to visit hospitality venues this Christmas"", then financial support should be provided. Baroness Ruby McGregor-Smith, president of the British Chambers of Commerce, said businesses faced a ""two-punch combination of serious issues with staff absence and plummeting consumer confidence"". ""Not even a rationale has been provided for why it believes no new support is required. They deserve better. ""Many of these firms, who have survived nearly two years of challenging trading conditions, are now seeing their vital festive income melt away in front of their eyes."" Nick Farr, co-owner of Hertfordshire brewery Farr Brew, which owns six pubs, says it has been hit with around 450 cancellations in the past seven to 10 days and this has had a ""devastating"" impact. ""Yesterday one of our pubs - The Bull in Whitwell - we had a table of 15 booked, they were booked in for 12 o'clock, they literally cancelled at 9 o'clock. So that's a lot of turkey going to waste, a lot of prep done undertaken by the chefs the night before. All of that money goes to waste really."" He said if the government was asking people to limit socialising then they had to step in. ""Unless they are OK with literally dozens of thousands of pubs going under then they just simply have to put a very extensive package of financial aid back into place,"" he told the BBC. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said implementing Plan B measures was ""the right thing to do"", but added it had ""dented"" demand and consumer confidence and further support for struggling firms would be needed in future measures were brought in. ""The Omicron variant is unlikely to be the final challenge the coronavirus poses the economy or the country. So, the question is: how do we learn to live confidently not just with the virus, but with its variants?""  In parliament on Thursday, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, questioned why further government support measures had not been approved given the chief medical officer's advice to ""de-prioritise social contact"".  He also criticised the chancellor for proceeding with a ministerial trip to California on Tuesday while the country faced a ""tidal wave"" of Omicron.  The chancellor is due to speak to hospitality leaders by video link today, and again tomorrow upon his return to the UK.  A Treasury spokesman said: ""As we have done throughout the pandemic, we are closely monitoring the impact of the virus on the economy - and particularly the hospitality sector which is why the Chancellor is meeting with representatives from the industry today. ""Our £400bn Covid support package will continue to help businesses well into spring next year and of course we will continue to respond proportionately to the changing path of the virus.""

The monthly report from the US Labor Department found US employers added 273,000 jobs in February - significantly beating expectations - while the jobless rate fell back to near a 50-year low of 3.5%. The report also revised up estimates of job gains in January and December, finding 85,000 more than previously understood. The surveys, however, reflect data collected before the outbreak intensified. In recent weeks, global travel has plunged, while work, school and shopping has been disrupted in many countries. Despite the strong data, markets were focused on the impact of the virus. ""Today's jobs report is old news,"" said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo. The economic strength signalled in the report is a ""little like the saying, the car was in fine condition before being involved in a collision"", said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst for Bankrate.com. ""The new reality, amid tremendous uncertainty, is the world has experienced a seismic shift,"" he said. Earlier on Friday, markets in Asia had seen big falls, with Japan's Nikkei share index dropping by 2.7%. The 3.6% drop in the FTSE 100 wiped out the gains seen earlier this week on the index. Shares in travel companies again saw some of the steepest falls.  Banks also took a hit, as investors anticipate that interest rates might be cut in order to make borrowing cheaper for companies and consumers to keep the economy buoyant.  Energy firms were under pressure as well, after the collapse of a proposal by major oil producers to keep oil supply in check sent oil prices tumbling more than 8%. ""The markets didn't even bother with the pretence of a calm start on Friday, bringing another rough week to a close,"" said Connor Campbell, analyst at financial spread better Spreadex. ""The week's various central bank rate cuts only served to reinforce the seriousness of the situation."" Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve, the US's central bank, cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to a range of 1% to 1.25% in an attempt to ease investor concerns.  Many analysts predict it will cut rates again - perhaps as soon as its meeting this month. As traders seek less risky investments, they are turning to government bonds, sending prices higher. The bond market - which is many times larger than the stock market - includes tradable loans to governments and businesses. Yields - how much investors will recoup in interest from the loans - drop as the price of the loan rises.  Benchmark 10-year UK government debt now only offers a 0.24% return - a record low. In the US, the yield on a 10-year Treasury also fell to a record low, falling below 0.7%. ""With the 10-year Treasury yield slumping to a new record low and stock markets under pressure again today, it is questionable whether the Fed can wait until its scheduled meeting mid-month to deliver the next rate cut,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.

Spread to US Treasury,Coronavirus: Morning update,2024-09-25,2022-02-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60344601,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. The UK economy grew by 7.5% last year - ahead of forecasts - despite a slowdown in December caused by restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the Omicron variant, according to the Office for National Statistics. Last year's rebound came after a 9.4% collapse in 2020 as the Covid pandemic spread and lockdown rules were imposed. The law in Wales requiring people to wear face masks could be scrapped by the end of March, First Minister Mark Drakeford says, as his government relaxes restrictions. Covid passes for entertainment venues will no longer be needed from 18 February. Pupils will not have to wear masks in class from February 28, when the law requiring face coverings in public places, including places of worship, cinemas and museums will be relaxed. They will still be required in shops, hairdressers, salons, health and social care settings and on public transport. Durham University's biggest donor has withdrawn his financial support over ""ridiculous and ineffective"" Covid-19 restrictions. Mark Hillery, who donated £7m between 2015 and 2021, called a decision to reintroduce online teaching for two weeks in January due to a high number of Omicron variant cases in England's north-east ""a disgrace"". The university said it appreciated his support and added that health, safety and wellbeing were a priority. UK beer sales plunged during the pandemic as people avoided pubs and drank wine and spirits at home instead, industry analysis suggests. Pubs, bars and restaurants lost £5.7bn of revenue from beer sales in 2021 alone, according to the British Beer and Pub Association, which is calling for a cut in beer duty to help it recover. The Treasury says it froze beer duty for a fourth year, saving brewers £900m. Many British sports fans will be hunkering down for a late night watching American football's Super Bowl this weekend. But the US Department of Homeland Security is warning police forces the game could be disrupted by a convoy of truckers - similar to that in Canada - planning to block main roads in major cities, by way of protest against Covid-19 vaccine mandates.

Spread to US Treasury,Calls for clarity over furlough extension,2024-09-25,2020-11-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-54768330,"The Treasury has been asked to provide clarity over the furlough scheme extension following the announcement of a four-week lockdown in England.  The scheme, which pays up to 80% of wages of people unable to work, will now run until December. Both First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said support should be available if Scotland goes into a full lockdown later on. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said such a move could not be ruled out.  Latest figures reveal there were 1,148 new Covid cases - 7% of those tested - and a further six deaths in the last 24 hours. Of the total, 443 cases were recorded by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, 253 by NHS Lanarkshire and 140 by NHS Lothian. Scotland is currently adopting a regional approach to restrictions, with a new five-level system coming into effect on Monday. Ms Sturgeon said she believed tougher measures introduced in late September were starting to have an impact.  However, she added: ""We are monitoring the spread of the virus in all parts of Scotland on a daily basis to assess if, to what extent and at what speed the slowdown is continuing. We will not hesitate to increase the level of protection either locally or nationally if required."" The four-week lockdown in England, which begins on Thursday, will see the closure of pubs, restaurants, gyms, non-essential shops and places of worship although schools, colleges and universities can stay open. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the measures, despite his previous opposition to a new national lockdown, after modelling suggested the spread of the infection could overwhelm the NHS and see the number of deaths rise possibly as high as 4,000 a day across the UK.  Nicola Sturgeon is unlikely to be bounced into an immediate lockdown for Scotland because Boris Johnson's decided there will be one in England.  Aside from the political optics, the first minister has already imposed weeks of tough restrictions in Scotland and there are signs they are working.  Banning visits to other people in their own homes and shutting pubs and restaurants across the central belt seems to be slowing the growth in coronavirus cases.  The new levels system, which only takes effect from 06:00 on Monday, will ease hospitality restrictions in much of the country, with the notable exception of Dundee.  It would be odd to confirm the details of that system one week and switch to lockdown the next.  The Scottish government wants to carefully monitor the spread of the virus and adjust the protection level for each local authority as required, rather than rushing to new national action.  However, Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly made clear that if that doesn't work, she is prepared to consider another lockdown.  What she wants is maximum flexibility to decide if and when that's needed.  That means securing a guarantee from the Treasury that the furlough extension made available UK-wide during the lockdown for England would also be there if Scotland locked down at a later date.  She's backed in that call by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross.  Without that assurance, the Scottish government would face a serious dilemma - to stick with its current plan and hope it works or impose more restrictions than it was planning, in case it cannot access the financial support to do so in future.  While the furlough scheme is UK-wide, Ms Sturgeon said there would be discussions on the details of how it would work in Scotland.  ""A crucial point for us is whether support on the scale announced for English businesses is available for Scottish businesses now or if we needed to impose further restrictions later - or if it is only available if Scotland has a full lockdown at the same time as a lockdown in England,"" she said. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross tweeted that the same level of UK government job support must be available if Scotland needs to impose a national lockdown in future.  In a speech tomorrow, he will argue the furlough scheme is a ""tangible reminder of the economic security of the Union"". ""Now that the scheme has been extended to cover the impact of a second lockdown in England, how could a Unionist government not restart the scheme if a second lockdown is required in Scotland?"" he is expected to say.  Deputy First Minister John Swinney told BBC's Politics Scotland that household and hospitality restrictions have put the country in a ""stronger position"" than England. But Mr Swinney told the programme: ""I cannot rule out the possibility of further measures or indeed a national lockdown being required should the circumstances arise."" The deputy first minister said he had ""high confidence"" in the new level system. He continued: ""The time that we have taken to bear down on the virus over the course of the last two months has put us into, in general, a stronger position compared to the situation that prevails in England today."" Mr Swinney added that there is also ""significant differential"" in the virus in different parts of the country and also early signs that it may be ""flattening out"".  On the issues of furlough, the deputy first minister said ""urgent clarity"" was needed on the circumstances in which it will be made available. He said: ""Are they only going to be available when England has got a problem? Or are they only going to be available at all times, in all parts of the United Kingdom when we all, at different stages, face difficulties and have to apply restrictions?"" Talks will take place on Sunday between the Scottish government and the Treasury to determine how the scheme will work. Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said Scotland was right to stick with the new five level system for now. He told Politics Scotland: ""Of course, we should never rule out a lockdown on a national basis but I hope we can avoid that because I think it is so restricting in terms of peoples' freedoms, opportunities and jobs."" Mr Rennie also welcomed the furlough scheme but urged the Treasury to be flexible and allow businesses to ""pick and choose"" when they use it. Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer argued the lockdown should apply across the whole of the UK. Asked about the prospect on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show he said: ""Ideally, yes, and I have said for months that it ought to be a four nations approach. ""It is for the prime minister to lead on that and get people round the table."" Ms Sturgeon has repeated her advice to avoid non-essential travel to and from England, as well as other parts of the UK.  She also urged people follow the new rules that come into force in Scotland at 06:00 on Monday.  She said: ""I encourage everyone to find out what level their local authority is in and to stick to the rules in their area.   ""I also urge everyone to follow two key national restrictions by not mixing with other households inside our homes, and not travelling to or from any part of the country in level 3 unless it is absolutely essential."""
Spread to US Treasury,Living with Covid plan to restore our freedom - PM,2024-09-25,2022-02-21,By Mary O'Connor & Malu Cursino,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60455943,"Boris Johnson is due to set out his plans to scrap all remaining Covid legal restrictions in England, including the requirement to isolate.  The BBC understands cabinet ministers have agreed to the PM's ""living with Covid plan"" after a delayed meeting. There were reports of tensions between the Treasury and the Department of Health over how parts of the plan will be funded. Some experts have urged caution and Labour queried plans to reduce testing. Mr Johnson is expected to update MPs in the Commons at about 16:30 GMT. The prime minister will then lead a televised No 10 news conference at 19:00 GMT alongside England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser. Speaking before Monday's announcement, Mr Johnson said his plan would bring society ""towards a return to normality"". No 10 said the Covid vaccination programme had put England in a ""strong position to consider lifting the remaining legal restrictions"". It added that the plan for living with Covid would take a ""cautious approach"" retaining ""some surveillance systems and plans for contingency measures"". The legal requirement to self-isolate for a fixed period after testing positive in England has been in place ever since mass testing was rolled out.  Currently positive or asymptomatic people have to isolate for up to 10 days, but can end their isolation earlier if they register negative lateral flow tests on both days five and six. Mr Johnson has said that Covid testing would take place at a ""much lower level"" after revealing £2bn was spent on the system in January alone. Community PCR testing for people with symptoms is expected to stop under the new plan, but it is unclear whether the availability of free lateral flow tests will be reduced. On the issue of changes to testing arrangements, a Welsh government spokesperson said any decision to alter them ""would be premature and reckless"". Earlier, Stormont ministers held talks with Michael Gove, minister for intergovernmental relations, about future funding to fight the Covid pandemic ahead of the PM's announcement. It follows a joint letter from Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford and Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robin Swann warning of the need to keep existing testing in place. Covid is no longer an exceptional threat. Despite the huge wave of infections, the numbers dying in recent months has been similar to what you would expect during a normal winter. Most agree some scaling back is warranted, but it needs to be done carefully. During the pandemic £37 billion has been set aside for test and trace. This is a huge sum - more than has been spent on GP care. Mass PCR testing in the community is almost certain to go. But these gold standard tests will be kept in hospitals to diagnose patients who are seriously ill and to keep an eye out on variants. Many believe the Office for National Statistics surveillance survey can be done on a smaller scale, but it is essential to have something to keep a check on how the virus is spreading.  Read more analysis here. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, who helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, told the BBC's Today programme that ""there isn't a right or wrong answer"" to when restrictions change.  He said: ""If restrictions change this week, next week, or the week after, in six months' time the number of transmission events will likely be very similar."" He added that having a surveillance system - ""an early warning system"" - in place whenever restrictions are eased will be ""critical"".  The government is expected to urge people to exercise their own judgement.  But Prof Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL, told the BBC: ""The worry about lifting the legal restrictions is that we are telling not only our population, but the world, that there is really nothing to worry about, that it's all over when it isn't."" Just over 91% of people in the UK aged 12 and over have had a first dose of a vaccine, 85% a second jab, and 66% a booster or a third dose, according to official data, which has been collated daily since the vaccine rollout began in December 2020. The UK's vaccine advisory body has recommended that an additional Covid booster vaccination should be offered to all adults over the age of 75 and the most vulnerable over-12s this spring. England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are set to accept the advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).  The government has announced it will offer a low-dose Covid vaccine to children aged between five and 11 in England during April. Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have also said they will be offering young children the same vaccine. The prime minister's announcement will come a day after Buckingham Palace revealed the Queen, 95, had tested positive for Covid. The new Covid plans would also see councils in England become responsible for managing outbreaks using existing powers. The Office for National Statistics infection survey, which randomly tests a sample of the population, is also expected to be replaced with a slimmed down surveillance programme. On Sunday, the UK recorded another 25,696 new infections and a further 74 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test - although Sunday figures do tend to be among the lowest of any typical week. Amid concerns that payments for people off sick due to Covid will come to an end, Wes Streeting said ""now is not the time to start charging for tests or weaken sick pay"". He said he was ""particularly concerned"" about the end of free testing and described such a move as ""like being 2-1 up with 10 minutes left of play and subbing your best defender"". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, said infections need to fall further before the rules were relaxed. ""It does appear as if the government is trying to pretend that Covid doesn't exist in the day-to-day lives of so many people,"" he told the BBC. Several scientists and clinicians - including Prof Anthony Costello, Dr Kit Yates and Prof  Christina Pagel - have signed an open letter to Sir Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance, urging them to ""clarify the extent to which the planned policies are consistent with scientific advice and what specifically that scientific advice contained"".  Plan B measures - introduced in December to stem the spread of the Omicron variant - including the requirement to wear masks in public places and the use of Covid passes for large events, were abolished in England last month.  Throughout the pandemic, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have moved at different speeds in introducing or relaxing restrictions. In Northern Ireland, all remaining Covid measures - such as certificates in nightclubs, face coverings, and limits on gatherings in homes - stopped being legally binding on Tuesday. Wales is currently at alert level zero, its lowest level of Covid rules.  In Scotland, legislation covering face coverings and vaccine passports had been due to expire next Monday but earlier this month ministers extended it for another six months.

Spread to US Treasury,Mutant virus 'test blitz' and scientists' warning,2024-09-25,2021-02-02,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-55896956,"The Daily Mail declares ""it's a race to trace"" the South African variant of coronavirus as the paper reacts to the news that tens of thousands of people are being offered door-to-door tests in hotspots.   The Mail talks of a ""frantic bid"" to contain the virus amid fears that a more contagious variant may be spreading and that the mass vaccine drive could be at risk.  ""Test Blitz"" is Metro's headline while the Guardian describes a ""sprint"" to curb the spread of the disease. It reports that squads of health officials, firefighters and volunteers have been drafted in to help deliver the testing kits. ""The hunt is on to stop the South African bug,"" says the Daily Mirror. The Mirror and the Daily Express have pictures of preparations getting under way, with bags of home testing kits being lined up by firefighters in Surrey.  For the Sun, it's a case of ""The good, the jab and the ugly"". ""Good"" because Covid cases are at the lowest level since Christmas, ""the jab"" refers to one in seven people being vaccinated and ""the ugly"" it says is the South African variant which is being blitzed. The Times leads with a claim that the government ignored warnings about the South African variant of coronavirus from experts on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, or Sage. According to the paper, scientists told ministers that they had to close the borders altogether or impose mandatory quarantine measures for everyone arriving in the country to prevent the new strain from spreading.   The Times says Boris Johnson announced limited hotel quarantine measures last week - a week after being told that ""geographically targeted travel bans"" would not be enough. The Daily Telegraph leads with a claim that Boris Johnson is ""pushing"" to reopen schools after being told that Britain is past the peak of the current wave of coronavirus. Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox The paper believes his optimism is built on the success of the vaccination programme and says that from next week the over-65s will be invited to make an appointment.  But the Guardian accuses Boris Johnson of being burdened by optimism and preferring the sunny to the sombre.  Instead of getting schools open or hotels back on their feet, it argues, the prime minister wonders whether the public can have a summer holiday this year. Mr Johnson, it says, needs to get serious.  Another story featuring on the front pages is the coup in Myanmar. The Financial Times has a picture of a soldier and a tank blocking a road leading to the country's parliament while the Guardian shows demonstrators holding up images of Aung San Suu Kyi. The Guardian believes Myanmar is on a knife edge amid fears of a further clampdown.  Online, the Independent talks of a ""global outcry"" at the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi. The Politico website says events in Myanmar mean that just days into his tenure, President Biden is grappling with a foreign policy crisis and how he reacts could affect how the new US administration is viewed on the global stage in the months ahead. The Financial Times reports that the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has agreed to tie his own hands in next month's Budget by sticking with the Conservatives' ""triple tax lock"" - which stops him raising the rates of income tax, national insurance or VAT.  The paper claims that Treasury officials had hoped Mr Sunak would ditch the Tories' manifesto commitment so that he could begin to curb the huge deficit caused by the pandemic.  The FT says the move could force Mr Sunak to consider other increases - possibly in corporation or capital gains tax. The Telegraph talks of a deepening civil war in the SNP after Joanna Cherry was dismissed from her role as justice and home affairs spokesman.  It says the move is being seen as a purge designed to sideline increasingly vocal critics of the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon.  The Scottish edition of the Times says Ms Cherry had been seen as a potential successor to Ms Sturgeon.  the Guardian describes Joanna Cherry as one of the First Minister's fiercest internal critics.   The Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph reveal that the actress, Angelina Jolie, is selling Winston Churchill's only wartime painting after splitting up the art collection she shared with her former husband, Brad Pitt. Churchill created more than 500 works, but the only one he painted during the Second World War was a Moroccan landscape.  According to the Telegraph, Tower of the Koutoubia Mosque is expected to sell for £2.5m - a record for a Churchill work."
Spread to US Treasury,Coronavirus spreading in NY like 'a bullet train',2024-09-25,2020-03-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52012048,"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has pleaded for medical supplies, warning Covid-19 is spreading in his state faster than ""a bullet train"". ""The apex is higher than we thought and the apex is sooner than we thought,"" Mr Cuomo told reporters on Tuesday. He said the federal government was not sending anywhere near enough lifesaving equipment to confront the crisis. New York now has over 25,000 confirmed virus cases and at least 210 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday the US has the potential to become the new epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic.  The warnings come as President Donald Trump said he hoped the US would reopen for business next month. ""We need federal help and we need the federal help now,"" Mr Cuomo, a Democrat, said.  ""New York is the canary in the coal mine, New York is happening first, what is happening to New York will happen to California and Illinois, it is just a matter of time.""   The governor blasted the 400 ventilators sent to New York from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.  He said: ""You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators.""  New York currently has 7,000 ventilators, but needs 30,000, the governor said.  Mr Cuomo continued: ""The [infection] forecaster said to me, 'We were looking at a freight train coming across the country.' ""'We're now looking at a bullet train.'"" The state is also looking into creating more healthcare areas, possibly by turning college dormitories and hotels into makeshift hospitals.  With 25,665 cases in New York, the state accounts for more than half of all US infections. The number of new cases in the state is doubling every three days, the governor said, and showing no sign of slowing down.   Mr Cuomo said the rate of infections could overwhelm the healthcare system. New York may need up to 140,000 hospital beds in a worst-case scenario, he said. The governor also said he would not ""put a dollar amount on human life"", in what was seen as an implicit criticism of Mr Trump's concerns that measures to contain the virus could wreck the US economy. ""My mother is not expendable and your mother is not expendable,"" said Mr Cuomo.  On Tuesday afternoon, Donald Trump sat in the verdant White House grounds for a Fox News ""virtual town hall"" and said he hoped to get US businesses reopened by Easter, in just over two weeks. ""A great American resurrection,"" the Fox host suggested. A few hours earlier, Governor Cuomo held a much more sombre press conference at the Javits Center in Manhattan. The building, which three years ago hosted Hillary Clinton's ill-fated election-night party, is now a makeshift field hospital. The president and the governor - two New Yorkers with a long history - clashed over the state's shortage of ventilators to treat the most serious cases.  Mr Trump blamed Mr Cuomo for not purchasing more in 2015, citing a conspiracy-mongering website. Mr Cuomo said the administration should use its emergency powers to order more machines manufactured. When it comes to easing the recent shelter-in-place orders, governors like Mr Cuomo, not the president, will have the final say.  If there's disagreement, however, the American public could be left wondering what to believe. On Tuesday, President Trump told Fox News he hoped the country could get back to normal by Easter, which is 19 days away. Mr Trump, a Republican, said: ""We're going to be opening relatively soon... I would love to have the country opened up and just rearing to go by Easter."" He added: ""Easter is a very special day for me... and you'll have packed churches all over our country."" Mr Trump also warned that otherwise the country could suffer ""a massive recession or depression"". The president said: ""You're going to lose people. You're going to have suicides by the thousands. You're going to have all sorts of things happen.  ""You're going to have instability. You can't just come in and say, 'Let's close up the United States of America, the most successful country in the world by far.'"" Speaking at a White House briefing later, Mr Trump said ""our decision will be based on hard facts and data as to the opening [of our country]"". According to the latest Gallup poll, his approval rating has risen five points this month to 49%, the best of his presidency. There are over 53,000 confirmed cases and more than 700 deaths attributed to Covid-19 in the US.  Dr Deborah Birx, of the White House coronavirus taskforce, said the New York City metro area was the source of 56% of all cases and 60% of all new cases in the country. She advised anyone leaving the region to self-quarantine for two weeks. On Tuesday, Wisconsin, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Mexico, West Virginia and Indiana were introducing stay-at-home orders, bringing the total number of US states under such lockdowns to 17.  Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been debating the details of an economic stimulus package that could total over $2 trillion (£1.7 trillion).  Democrats and the White House indicated negotiations could conclude on Tuesday, with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin saying ""the president wants us to get this done today"". In other developments:"
Spread to US Treasury,Businesses call for help amid NI's new Covid rules,2024-09-25,2021-12-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-59762029,"Trade bodies have called for immediate financial help for businesses that will be affected by new Covid-19 rules coming into effect after Christmas. Stormont ministers have decided that from 27 December hospitality venues must only offer table service and no more than six people will be allowed to sit together at a table. Nightclubs will close from 06:00 GMT on 26 December. But some business groups have said the rules will cost money and jobs. Hospitality Ulster called the lack of detail around financial support ""contemptible"", while Belfast Chamber said it was ""unforgivable"". The Stormont executive imposed restrictions in an attempt to stem the sharp rise in the number of coronavirus cases. On Wednesday Northern Ireland recorded 3,231 new coronavirus cases, the highest daily number since the pandemic began. It's understood that Omicron is now the dominant strain of Covid in Northern Ireland and makes up almost 60% of cases. First Minister Paul Givan said industry representatives were right to call for support from the executive. ""We are developing a package to support nightclubs and the wider hospitality industry as well,"" the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""We have £195m, there is work taking place with the Department of Finance, with the Department for the Economy, and both ministers spoke about this yesterday at the executive."" Mr Givan said the executive was looking at what support it could provide in grants to businesses, however he added: ""I readily accept that that isn't going to go far enough."" ""That's why we need the UK Treasury to step up and to put in place those schemes that can directly support workers in terms of their payroll.""  Mr Givan also acknowledged the pressure to workforces, including the health service, caused by periods of isolation for those who test positive. People in England are now able to end quarantine after seven days instead of 10 by providing negative lateral flow results on day six and day seven. ""I anticipate that [isolation] will become a increasing problem, that's why England has moved from 10 days isolation to seven days,"" Mr Givan said. ""I think that is a place where Northern Ireland is going to have to move as well to help us address those workforce shortages."" Belfast club and events promoter Joe Dougan said the nightclub industry would be hit extremely hard.  ""We have about 100 staff over Christmas and they will now all be out of work,"" he told BBC News NI. Mr Dougan said the closures also had a knock-on effect on those people involved in supply chains for the sector.  ""I think the alternative over Christmas is that people will be mixing over unregulated settings and I think that's inevitable,"" he added. Nightclubs in Northern Ireland have only been open for seven weeks after previously being closed since March 2020.  Hospitality Ulster, which represents pubs and restaurants, said that without details of what cash would be available owners and staff would be ""left worrying over Christmas"". The body's chief executive, Colin Neill, said the industry was ""crying out for support"". ""Business owners and staff have been left high and dry about their future over Christmas,"" said Mr Neill. Janice Gault of the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation called for a better financial support system for the sector and warned that jobs and businesses were being put at risk. ""A number of people will be facing into a position now where they've had a considerable amount of cancellations making certain aspects of their business perhaps unviable. ""Other people will be sitting thinking: 'Should I go ahead? What should I do?' And this is making people increasingly nervous."" Simon Hamilton, a former Stormont minister, who is now the head of the Belfast Chamber, which represents businesses in the city, said the lack of financial help on offer was ""simply unacceptable and unforgivable"". ""As well as having to deal with the impact of additional measures, businesses haven't been offered a single penny in financial support,"" he added. On Wednesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis tweeted criticism of the executive's decision to close businesses without providing financial support. But Mr Givan said Mr Lewis was in a position to ""help the executive"" by calling for the Treasury to ""put in place the wage subsidy scheme"". Before the rules were announced, many hospitality businesses had already been hit by a collapse in bookings and reduced footfall due to people's fears about the spread of the Omicron variant. Some restaurateurs took the difficult decision to close in an effort to save money.  Bob McCoubrey, owner of Mourne Seafood and The Shack, decided to close his restaurants earlier this week.  ""This week in a normal year we would have done about £50,000 in business,"" he told BBC News NI.  ""We need some urgent financial support, I saw a scheme from the UK chancellor where businesses can apply for up to £6,000, but it's based on rateable value.  ""For example here, we would get £2,700 from a grant, but our wage bill every week is £7,000 so that doesn't even touch the sides."" That scheme applies to businesses in England only. Mark Caithness, owner of The Exchange bar and restaurant in Londonderry, said public confidence had been ""decimated"". ""It's like death by a thousand cuts, people are just not coming out and it isn't a normal Christmas at all,"" he explained.  ""We would usually host so many Christmas parties at this time of year, but bookings we had taken earlier in the year have essentially fallen off a cliff,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle.  Mr Caithness said they have already had to let staff go and that with footfall down, they were ""not currently trading in a profitable way"". He fears this is ""just the start"" of further restrictions to come down the line.

Spread to US Treasury,Work-from-home guidance reintroduced in England,2024-09-25,2021-12-13,By Dulcie Lee,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-59632424,"People in England should now work from home if they can, as part of the government's Plan B guidance to curb the spread of Omicron. The change brings England in line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But some businesses in city centres fear the move means they will lose customers in the run up to Christmas. Rules on face masks have already been tightened, and Covid passes will be required to get into nightclubs and other large venues from Wednesday. Despite the new rules, Boris Johnson said on Sunday the UK faced an ""Omicron emergency"", with a ""tidal wave"" of the new variant coming. In a televised address, he said boosters would be offered to everyone over 18 in England from this week, with the aim of giving a jab to everyone who wants one by the end of the month. Extra measures - known as Plan B - were announced last week amid growing concern over Omicron, which is spreading rapidly and is expected to become the dominant variant in the UK this week. MPs are expected to vote on the new measures on Tuesday. One of the three votes will be on Covid passes, and could be opposed by about 60 Tory MPs. However, all three votes are expected to pass as Labour is backing the government. It comes after a tough fortnight for Boris Johnson, who faced questions about several Christmas parties reportedly held by Downing Street last Christmas, despite Covid rules banning them. An inquiry has been launched into four alleged gatherings, including one in the Department for Education. Today's change of advice will frustrate some companies keen to keep their staff in the offices and many city centre businesses may also despair that they will lose customers in the build up to Christmas.  With hospitality still open, many restaurants, bars and pubs will hope that they can still persuade the public to make the trip to town.  Other companies will find the change less jarring, returning to at home ways of working that are already tried and tested; many workers were not back full time in the office anyway.  The question that's likely to be in many people's minds as they commute the few paces to their laptop today will be how long will they be working from home this time.  Just under 36% of staff in Britain did some work from home in 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics. By the last week of November, many people were yet to go back to the office full-time - but seven in 10 travelled to work at least once. The Treasury said it was acting early to control the spread of the virus while avoiding unduly damaging economic and and social restrictions - and that measures like business rates relief would help companies into next year. But British Chambers of Commerce director Shevaun Haviland has warned that retail and hospitality businesses, which she says are the most exposed to the new measures, are not being sufficiently supported by the government. Ms Haviland has written to the chancellor to request a return to charging a reduced 5% rate of VAT for hospitality and tourism businesses, 100% business rates relief for the retail sector, and grant funding to help the hardest hit firms. And Sir John Timpson, chairman of the shoe repair and key-cutting chain, also warned the survival of city centre businesses was being threatened by the government's work-from-home guidance. Sir John told the BBC the arrival of Omicron had already led to a 5% drop in business over the last couple of weeks, and said that could easily turn into a 10% fall by the new year, when people would normally return to work after a Christmas break, but may now stay at home. ""Once we get beyond Christmas, you're going to find that city centre businesses go back to where they were at the beginning of the Covid problem in March 2020,"" he said.

Spread to US Treasury,Are we addicted to the ‘like’ button?,2024-09-25,2019-06-18,By Tim Harford,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48364817,"Leah Pearlman draws comics about ideas like ""emotional literacy"" and ""self-love"". When she began posting them on Facebook, her friends responded warmly.  But then Facebook changed its algorithm - how it decides what to put in front of us. When social media is a big part of your life, an algorithm change can come as a shock.  Leah's content was being shown to fewer people, and her comics started to get fewer likes.  ""It felt like I wasn't getting enough oxygen,"" she told Vice.com. ""It was like, 'Wait a minute, I poured my heart and soul into this drawing, but it's only had 20 likes.'""  It's easy to empathise. Social approval can be addictive, and what's a Facebook ""like"" if not social approval distilled into its purest form?  Researchers liken our smartphones to slot machines, triggering the same reward pathways in our brain. Prof Natasha Dow Schull argues that slot machines are addictive ""by design"", and that casinos aim to maximise ""time on device"". They want to keep people in front of their screens, admiring the pretty lights and receiving those dopamine hits.  Social media firms have taken note. More likes, new notifications, even an old-fashioned email - we never know what we'll get when we pick up our phone and pull the lever.  Faced with a sudden drop in likes, Leah is embarrassed to say she began buying ads on Facebook ""just to get that attention back"". There's an irony behind her discomfort.  Before she was a comic artist, Leah was a Facebook developer, and in July 2007, her team invented the ""like button"".  50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast. The concept is now ubiquitous across the web, from Facebook to YouTube to Twitter.  The benefit for platforms is obvious. A single click is the simplest way for users to engage - much easier than typing out a comment.  But the idea took a while to refine. As Leah Pearlman remembers, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg took some convincing.  Should it be called the ""awesome"" button? Did the symbol work? While a thumbs-up means approval in most cultures, in others it has a much cruder meaning.   Eventually, in February 2009, the Like button was launched. ""The stats went up so fast. Fifty comments became 150 likes, almost immediately, Leah Pearlman recalls.  ""People would start making more status updates, so there was way more content, and it all just worked.""  Meanwhile, at Cambridge University, Michal Kosinski was doing a PhD in psychometrics - the study of measuring psychological profiles.  Another young research, David Stillwell had written a Facebook app to test the ""big five"" personality traits: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism.  Taking the test gave the researchers permission to access your Facebook profile, with your age, gender, sexual orientation and so on. The test went viral.  The dataset swelled to millions of people, and the researchers could see everything they had ever ""liked"", as well as the public data of their friends. Kosinski - now a professor of organisational behaviour at Stanford University - realised this was a treasure trove of potential insights.  For example, it turned out that a slightly higher proportion of gay men than straight men ""liked"" the cosmetics brand MAC. That's only one data point, since Kosinski couldn't tell if someone was gay from a single like.  But the more likes he saw, the more accurate guesses he could make - about sexual orientation, religious affiliation, political leanings, and more.  Kosinski concluded that if you'd liked 70 things, he'd know you better than your friends. After 300 likes, he'd know you better than your partner.   Facebook has since restricted which data gets shared with app developers. But one organisation still gets to see all your likes and more besides: Facebook itself.   And it can afford to employ the world's brightest machine-learning developers to tease out conclusions.  What can Facebook do with its window into your soul? Two things.  First, it can tailor your newsfeed so you spend more time on Facebook - whether that means showing you cat videos, inspirational memes, things that will outrage you about Donald Trump, or things that will outrage you about Donald Trump's opponents.  This isn't ideal - it makes it harder and harder for people with different opinions to conduct a sensible conversation. Second, it can help advertisers to target you. The better the ads perform, the more money it makes.  Targeting adverts is nothing new.  Long before the internet and social media, if you were opening a new bicycle shop in Springfield, say, you might have chosen to advertise in the Springfield Gazette or Cycling Weekly, rather than the New York Times or Good Housekeeping.  Of course, that still wasn't very efficient. Most Gazette readers wouldn't be cyclists, and most subscribers to Cycling Weekly wouldn't live near Springfield. But it was the best you could do.  You could say that Facebook simply improves that process.  Who could object if you ask it to only show your ads to Springfield residents who like cycling? That's the kind of example which Facebook tends to cite when it defends the concept of ""relevant"" advertising.   But there are other possible uses which we might not like.  How seller feedback helped build eBay, Uber and AirBnB  How the smartphone became so smart  Just Google it: The student project that changed the world  The surprising ways video games have shaped the economy  How about offering a house for rent, but not showing that advert to African Americans? Julia Angwin, Madeleine Varner and Ariana Tobin from the investigative website ProPublica wondered if that would work, and it did.  Facebook said oops, that shouldn't have happened, blaming a ""technical failure"".  Or how about helping advertisers reach people who have expressed interest in the topic of ""Jew hater""? The same ProPublica team showed that was possible, too. Facebook said oops, it wouldn't happen again.   This might worry us because not all advertisers are as benign as bicycle shops - you can also pay to spread political messages, which may be hard for users to contextualise or verify.  The firm Cambridge Analytica claimed it had swung the 2016 election for Donald Trump, in part by harnessing the power of the Like button to target individual voters - much to the horror of Michal Kosinski, the researcher who had first suggested what might be possible.  What about helping unscrupulous marketers to pitch their products to emotionally vulnerable teenagers at moments when they're feeling particularly down?  In 2017, the Australian reported on a leaked Facebook document apparently touting just this ability.   Facebook said oops, there'd been another ""oversight"", insisting it ""does not offer tools to target people based on their emotional state"".   Let's hope not, especially as Facebook has previously admitted to manipulating people's emotional states by choosing whether to show them sad or happy news.  In a widely-quoted Facebook post from December 2018, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg apologised for mistakes made by the company. ""Prior to 2016, we were not as focused on preventing harm as we should have been,"" she says. ""And we did not do enough to anticipate other ways our platform could be misused."" She acknowledges that many people have lost trust that Facebook would ""respect and protect the personal information of our users"" or ""always operate with integrity"", and insists the company is listening and learning. But in reality, it seems Facebook's potential for mind control is far from perfect. Some experts who've looked into Cambridge Analytica question how effective it really was. And for all the targeting, analysts report that the click-through rate on Facebook adverts still averages less than 1%..   Perhaps we should worry more about Facebook's undoubted proficiency at serving us more adverts by sucking in an inordinate amount of our attention, hooking us to our screens.  How should we manage our compulsions in this brave new social media world?  We might cultivate emotional literacy about how the algorithm affects us, and if social approval feels as vital as oxygen, maybe more self-love is the answer.  If I see any good comics on the subject, I'll be sure to click ""like"". Correction: This article was amended on 25 June to say that the Facebook personality app was written by David Stillwell.

Spread to US Treasury,'Once-in-a-lifetime' find of rare Iron Age coins,2024-09-25,2021-07-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-57833958,"Hundreds of rare Iron Age coins have been discovered during a dig on the HS2 route in west London. The hoard of 300 potins, which are an early version of a coin, were found in Hillingdon, following a storm which helped reveal their position. Archaeologists have dated them to the 1st century BC, at a time when the Romans were beginning to establish themselves in Britain. The discovery has been described as a ""once-in-a-lifetime find"". Each of the potins are about 3cm (1.2 in) in diameter and are based on coins struck in Marseille, France, about 2,175 years ago. On one side they show a stylised image of the head of Greek god Apollo, while a charging bull is on the other. Emma Tetlow, historic environment lead for HS2's main contractors Skanska, Costain and Strabag, explained how her team had been ""coming to the end of our archaeological work... when we found a patch of soil that was a very different colour"" following a storm which had altered the ground conditions. ""The patch of soil was dark greeny-blue, which suggests oxidised metal, and when we checked more closely, we could see loosely packed metal discs."" She described the discovery as ""a once-in-a-lifetime find"". The potins, which have been named the ""Hillingdon Hoard"", were taken to Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery to be cleaned and preserved so specialists to investigate them further. Coins were not thought to have been used for the exchange of goods and service at the time and archaeologists believe the hoard may have been used to mark the boundary of a property or was an offering to the gods. Hoards are also thought to have been buried in isolated locations as emergency savings for times of crisis. Potins like these from the late Iron Age like have been found previously but in much smaller quantities meaning this find is considered very significant. The value of the hoard has yet to be determined and a coroner is to decide whether they can be considered ""treasure"", meaning they can be acquired by a museum. Helen Wass, HS2's head of heritage, said the discovery ""provides us with more information about how our ancestors lived and settled in London""."
Spread to US Treasury,The panics of the Fed,2024-09-25,2017-12-01,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42146214,"What do US central bankers do during a financial crisis? On a typical day, central bankers in the US spend their time monitoring bank activity and trying to understand economic data, adjusting interest rates to assist price stability and employment.  But every so often, the economy faces a financial panic that forces the Federal Reserve to take additional action. During the financial crisis of 2007-2009, that meant launching loan programs, brokering takeovers of faltering companies, and pumping trillions of dollars into the economy in a bid to stave off economic collapse.  The aggressive response marked a major shift. Remember - just a century earlier, the US didn't have a central bank at all. Here is a look at how the Fed's approach to financial crises has evolved. Panic of 1907 Panics flare when there is suddenly a rush of demand for cash - creating a credit crunch for banks and other financial institutions that have loaned out the money.  In the 1800s, without a central bank to monitor the money supply, such episodes were frequent. Even the regular harvest cycle could cause problems, since farmers needed cash all at once to pay their workers. Until the panic of 1907, however, the US was politically resistant to the idea of a central bank. That year - when cash was already tight - word spread about the failure of a financial gamble by prominent bankers.  Investors hurried to pull money from firms associated with the bankers, worried - not necessarily rationally - their own funds might be at risk. Without a central bank, a group of businessmen led by JP Morgan coordinated the response to the run, which included shoring up firms with money from the Treasury Department.  The panic stopped, but the economy took a severe hit anyway. In the aftermath, bankers and lawmakers concluded the US needed a federally-backed institution that would control the currency and serve as a lender of last resort to banks, forestalling future panics. Congress created the Federal Reserve in 1913. The Great Depression The Fed soon faced an episode that tested its ability to ward off problems.  In the late 1920s, a credit-fuelled stock market rally collapsed, and the economy entered a global recession, triggered in part by a move back to the gold standard. Thousands of banks collapsed, the unemployment rate topped 20%, and US GDP contracted by more than a third.  The Fed took some steps to try to address the crisis, but many economists say the institution should have gone further. They argue that officials were too concerned that more aggressive action would fuel risky, speculative behaviour. Some say not intervening to stop bank collapses was particularly harmful, since it led others to become cautious about lending and spending, further slowing economic activity. Eventually Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt entered the picture, creating new central banking powers, such as authority for broader lending programmes and a guarantee of most bank deposits. In some ways, however, it took the industrial boom spurred by World War II to really get the economy going again. A Meltdown Avoided On occasion, however, a lighter touch has appeared to be enough. In 1998, officials at Long Term Capital Management contacted the Federal Reserve.  The hedge fund, which counted Nobel laureates among its stars, had more than $100bn (£74.2bn) in assets, and enjoyed close ties with most major financial companies. But losses in Asian markets had brought it to the brink of failure. Worried about the consequences of a meltdown for other firms, the Fed convened a group of companies to arrange a bailout. Eventually 14 firms injected $3.6bn and took ownership stakes. The episode was resolved without bigger market problems and without using Fed funds.  But a decade later - as the US faced another crisis - some would cite it as an example of a missed opportunity when regulators should have imposed stricter rules for risky financial instruments. Financial crisis of 2007-2009 In 2007, US housing prices started to falter - a sign of cracks forming in the US economy, which would later be declared in recession.  The chair of the Fed was Ben Bernanke, a professor who had studied the Fed's response to the Great Depression and was determined to avoid its mistakes. The Fed put its traditional tools to use, slashing interest rates and injecting money into the economy with bond purchases. Then officials went further.  They convinced Congress to launch lending programmes, and engineered the takeover of failing firms, proving willing to take on bad assets to get deals done. And for the first time in decades they used the Fed's lender-of-last-resort powers to provide loans to financial companies that were not banks, including insurer AIG. The moves drew fierce backlash, and fuelled a political movement angry about a banker bailout. But supporters said it stopped financial problems from spurring a bigger recession. These days, with strong economic growth and low unemployment, the Fed has stopped or is reversing those programmes. Some analysts, however, joke that officials also want room to manoeuvre, as they are already anticipating the next panic. "
Spread to US Treasury,HS2 rail project to be reviewed,2024-09-25,2019-08-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49420332,"The government is launching a review of high-speed rail link HS2 - with a ""go or no-go"" decision by the end of the year, the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. It will consider whether and how the project to connect London, the Midlands and northern England should proceed. Billions have already been spent, but Mr Shapps refused to rule out scrapping it entirely. He said it was ""responsible"" to see whether the benefits really ""stack up"".  Phase 1 of the development between London and Birmingham is due to open at the end of 2026, with the second phase to Leeds and Manchester scheduled for completion by 2032-33. It is designed to carry trains capable of travelling at 250mph.    When asked about the money already spent on the project, Mr Shapps said: ""Just because you've spent a lot of money on something does not mean you should plough more and more money into it.""   He said ministers were asking the reviewers ""just give us the facts"".   ""Go and find out all the information that's out there… genuinely what it would cost to complete this project, and then we'll be in a much better position to make that decision - go or no-go by the end of the year."" The review will be chaired by Douglas Oakervee, a civil engineer and former chair of HS2 Ltd. Lord Berkeley, another civil engineer who worked on the construction of the Channel Tunnel, will act as his deputy. The Labour peer has previously been critical of the project.  A final report will be sent to the government in the autumn.  During the Conservative Party leadership campaign Boris Johnson said he would not scrap plans for the new rail link, but did express ""anxieties about the business case"". In July, the current chairman of the project reportedly warned that the total cost could rise by another £30bn - up from the current budget of £56bn. Labour peer Lord Adonis, a former transport secretary who worked as an infrastructure adviser to Theresa May, said the review was ""as stupid as you can get"" and would ""screw Birmingham and the North"". He tweeted that it would become ""a massive bun fight, while the transport department runs for cover and HS2 Ltd is paralysed by indecision"".  The review will look into: Former Transport Secretary Chris Grayling argued that new rail links were needed to take pressure off a system which was ""bursting at the seams"".  And in June this year, more than 20 business leaders urged the government to deliver HS2 in full, arguing it would ""spread the flow of investment across the Midlands, the North of England and into Scotland"". The Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, who will sit on the review panel, said HS2 was ""vital"" for the West Midlands and was ""already creating jobs and building new homes"".  But Conservative MP Dame Cheryl Gillan, whose constituency HS2 will run through, told BBC Radio 4's World at One its costs had risen ""astronomically"" and it was ""now completely unviable in terms of value for money for the British taxpayer"". In May, a committee of peers argued the project risked ""short changing"" the North of England.  Their report said the scheme put too much emphasis on cutting journey times and not enough on the economic impact on regions. It also called for the Northern Powerhouse Rail scheme - a separate scheme connecting towns and cities in the region - to be completed alongside HS2. Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, who supports HS2, complained that the review panel included two elected representatives from the West Midlands but none from the North. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said Labour supported investment in new rail capacity, adding that ""improved governance of railway expansion is needed, not least over the HS2 project."" One Conservative MP, Bob Seely suggested the ""top half"" of HS2 - the section covering the North of England - should be built, but not the Birmingham to London route, which he described as ""a monumental white elephant"".  The key question is, is HS2 value for money? One former senior figure at the Treasury said to me recently that in terms of that it scores much lower than many other projects, so the government is taking quite a big risk putting so much money into it.  The government could cancel it - but, of course, the main caveat to that is the amount that has already been spent and would be lost. For all the opposition to it, HS2 also has a lot of passionate supporters too and they would be unhappy. Rather than scrapping it altogether then, perhaps the more plausible option is altering the plans in some way.  Trust me though, even doing will not be straightforward for financial or legal reasons. Joe Rukin, from the Stop HS2 campaign, said: ""If this is a genuine review, they must stop work now, because irreparable damage is being done right now to unique habitats, ancient woodlands."" He accused HS2 of ""sending out possession orders like there is no tomorrow"", referring to the compulsory purchase of properties in the path of the line. He also raised concerns that the review chairman, Mr Oakervee, was being given a chance to ""mark his own homework"" given his previous role on the project."
Spread to US Treasury,Buy Now Pay Later: 'I'm stressed over debt',2024-09-25,2021-09-02,By Tom Espiner,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58423924,"Jordan has been chased by debt collection agencies after falling behind on payments for clothes. The 23-year-old bought a winter coat using Buy Now Pay Later when employed, but then lost his job. According to Citizens Advice, one in 10 shoppers who use this type of credit end up being pursued by debt collectors. The Treasury said it was ""stepping in and regulating"" the market so people ""are treated fairly"". Jordan started using Buy Now Pay Later after seeing it advertised on social media apps and on the iPhone app store. He decided to use it to buy a coat for £200. ""It was quite cold, it was the winter, and at that point I didn't have a lot of clothes,"" he said. ""I was in a job, and I was able to pay it, but I ended up being quite unfortunate and losing that job."" He bought some other items including a hat, but fell behind with the payments to firms including Laybuy and Klarna. ""It was quite difficult for me to keep on top of it. I went through a lot of anxiety and depression,"" he said, and began to be chased by debt collection agencies. ""They don't give any leeway or ease with it at all,"" he says. ""They call up quite a bit [and email]. It does make me stressed when I'm being constantly called and badgered about it."" ""I think [Buy Now Pay Later] is quite dangerous, to be honest,"" Jordan says. ""Especially on the advertising. They make it out to be such a good thing... but that's only condoning debt."" Jordan has recently moved to Bristol to start a new job, and will be in a position to pay off the debt. Laybuy said: ""Laybuy only refers a customer to a debt collector as a last resort, and only after other attempts to collect the outstanding payment have been exhausted. ""When a debt is referred to a debt collector, we only ever refer outstanding purchase price of the product. ""Late fees, which are limited to a maximum of £24 for a single order, are never passed to a debt collector. Laybuy also pays all the cost for debt collection."" Alex Marsh, head of Klarna UK, said: ""At Klarna we only ever use debt collection agencies to help us contact customers we are unable to reach and we do this on fewer than 1% of orders. ""The debt collection agencies we work with are all Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)-authorised and will only contact customers by telephone or email and do not use bailiffs. ""We encourage any of our customers whose circumstances have changed, to please get in touch so we can help you with a plan to get back on track."" Buy Now Pay Later options often appear at checkouts on retailers' websites, and can help spread the cost of purchases, interest-free, potentially avoiding expensive credit. But Citizens Advice said that for many people Buy Now Pay Later can be ""a slippery slope into debt"". It added that it ""fears shoppers have been left unprotected and ill-informed during the rapid expansion of the sector"". ""Not one of the BNPL checkouts on leading retailers' websites warned people they could be referred to debt collectors for missed payments,"" the advice service said. Shoppers were charged £39m in late fees in the past year, it estimated. Of those who were referred to a debt collector for missed payments, 96% said there had been negative consequences. Millions of online shoppers have being clicking the buttons to spread the payments, but as the number of users has grown, so have the criticisms.  Buy Now Pay Later arrangements aren't viewed as a normal loan by credit reference agencies and other lenders.  It becomes a kind of invisible debt to the safety net system, so people with lots of little Buy Now Pay Later debts can get in a mess trying to juggle those payments alongside other loans and interest at the same time. Fears are growing that younger people are being saddled with unnecessary debt, and that those who are already vulnerable are slipping further down the debt spiral.  Although the government said in February that they will regulate the sector, they haven't done so yet.  These included sleepless nights, ignoring texts, emails and letters in case they were about debts, avoiding answering the door, borrowing money to repay the debt, or deteriorating mental health. Citizens Advice said that a woman aged in her 60s was trying to buy plants online, but struggled to find the postage cost at the checkout and decided to abandon her purchase. The keen gardener was surprised to receive an email saying she had signed up to a buy now pay later agreement, and tried to cancel her order. She told Citizens Advice: ""I really don't understand how I ended up paying for my plants through buy now, pay later. ""I didn't understand what it was. Then I get these threatening emails saying they're going to contact debt collectors, and then I got a letter from a debt collector. ""I couldn't sleep, I lay awake worrying that someone was going to turn up to my house and start taking things. I have a number of health issues and I was worried this was going to make me ill again. It was eventually resolved, but at great stress to me."" Millie Harris, a debt adviser at Citizens Advice East Devon, said: ""My concern is that people aren't processing the fact that buy now pay later is credit. They don't realise there are going to be consequences if they don't pay - it gives them a false sense of security. ""I've seen people using it for their kids' clothes and shoes that they would otherwise never be able to afford. They are taking out what is effectively a loan, but they don't see it as one. ""For example, I helped someone who has tens of thousands of pounds of debt, but they don't see buy now pay later as part of that total. ""It's almost under-the-radar debt."" Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, agrees: ""A seamless buy now pay later checkout process should not mean shoppers have to dig around in the small print to find out they're taking out a credit agreement, and could be referred to debt collectors if they can't pay. The warnings should be unmissable."" Citizens Advice is urging anyone who has been contacted by debt collectors to get free, independent debt advice. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""Buy Now Pay Later can be a helpful way to manage your finances but it's important that consumers are protected as these agreements become more popular.

Spread to US Treasury,New rules proposed for buy now pay later,2024-09-25,2022-06-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-61784020,"Rules on so-called buy now pay later (BNPL) loans will be tightened up, the government says - including new guidelines on advertising and checks to ensure customers can afford to pay. Apple has said it plans to launch a buy now pay later option for users of Apple Pay, initially in the US. But critics say BNPL schemes encourage people to spend beyond their means. The loans - used by 15 million people in the UK in 2021 - are typically spread over a number of payments. Although the instalments are interest free - BNPL companies make money from the retailer, usually taking a cut from sales - there may be additional charges if customers miss payments. The main operators offering the service in the UK are Klarna, Clearpay, Laybuy and PayPal. In September 2020, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) commissioned a review of BNPL schemes, which recommended the industry should be regulated. A recent survey by Citizens Advice suggested many consumers were using credit cards and other forms of debt to make payments. The charity heard from 2,288 people who had used buy now pay later during the past 12 months. It found that 52% made repayments from their current account, but 23% used a credit card, 9% used a bank overdraft and 7% borrowed from friends and family. In March it found that that young people, people in debt and people claiming Universal Credit, were at least twice as likely to have used BNPL to cover essentials such as food and toiletries, than other groups. Under plans set out by the government:  The government said other forms of short-term interest-free credit, such as those used to pay for dental work or larger items like furniture, will be required to comply with the same rules. In a statement accompanying the proposals, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, John Glen said: ""We are protecting consumers and fostering the safe growth of this innovative market in the UK."" But the proposals will not come into force for at least a year, with legislation scheduled for mid-2023, after which the FCA will consult on new rules. Alex Marsh, Head of Klarna UK, said he welcomed the new rules - telling the BBC the company already checked customers could afford to pay - and called for them to be brought in sooner. ""We urge the Government to move quicker than planned to implement regulation which gives additional protections to consumers from both irresponsible, unregulated BNPL providers and traditional banks disguising high interest products as 'BNPL'."" Citizens Advice also called for faster action: ""The buy now pay later sector continues to grow at a meteoric rate, but it could now remain unregulated for years,"" Dame Clare Moriarty, its chief executive wrote. She called on the government to ""turbo-charge"" its plans, and protect consumers sooner."
Spread to US Treasury,Coronavirus: Morning update,2024-09-25,2022-02-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60344601,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. The UK economy grew by 7.5% last year - ahead of forecasts - despite a slowdown in December caused by restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the Omicron variant, according to the Office for National Statistics. Last year's rebound came after a 9.4% collapse in 2020 as the Covid pandemic spread and lockdown rules were imposed. The law in Wales requiring people to wear face masks could be scrapped by the end of March, First Minister Mark Drakeford says, as his government relaxes restrictions. Covid passes for entertainment venues will no longer be needed from 18 February. Pupils will not have to wear masks in class from February 28, when the law requiring face coverings in public places, including places of worship, cinemas and museums will be relaxed. They will still be required in shops, hairdressers, salons, health and social care settings and on public transport. Durham University's biggest donor has withdrawn his financial support over ""ridiculous and ineffective"" Covid-19 restrictions. Mark Hillery, who donated £7m between 2015 and 2021, called a decision to reintroduce online teaching for two weeks in January due to a high number of Omicron variant cases in England's north-east ""a disgrace"". The university said it appreciated his support and added that health, safety and wellbeing were a priority. UK beer sales plunged during the pandemic as people avoided pubs and drank wine and spirits at home instead, industry analysis suggests. Pubs, bars and restaurants lost £5.7bn of revenue from beer sales in 2021 alone, according to the British Beer and Pub Association, which is calling for a cut in beer duty to help it recover. The Treasury says it froze beer duty for a fourth year, saving brewers £900m. Many British sports fans will be hunkering down for a late night watching American football's Super Bowl this weekend. But the US Department of Homeland Security is warning police forces the game could be disrupted by a convoy of truckers - similar to that in Canada - planning to block main roads in major cities, by way of protest against Covid-19 vaccine mandates.

Spread to US Treasury,Stocks rebound as US and UK seek to calm investors,2024-09-25,2023-03-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64985356,"Stock markets around the world have bounced back after the US and UK governments again reassured markets about banks' stability. Investors have recently been unnerved by a string of bank failures. But US stock markets were higher after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen signalled the US government would protect people's deposits if another bank collapsed. In the UK, the FTSE closed 1.79% higher after gains in top bank shares. NatWest, Prudential and Barclays shares gained about 5%, while Standard Chartered and Lloyds also traded higher. Ms Yellen said ""the situation is stabilising, and the US banking system remains sound"" in a speech on Tuesday. This follows the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank earlier this month. The failures were triggered by depositors rushing to withdraw money after anxiety over the banks' health. And last week, a group of the biggest US banks raised $30bn (£24.5bn) in funds for regional lender First Republic Bank, but its share price still crashed by more than 45% on Monday. Ms Yellen said the US intervention in the two bank collapses was necessary to ""protect the broader banking system"", after promising that all depositors in both banks would be protected. She added that similar action could be taken if if the same happens to other smaller banks, indicating that savers would not lose their money if another bank were to collapse. Meanwhile, in the UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told MPs that the UK's financial system is ""fundamentally strong"" after facing questions from Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves. Ms Reeves asked whether the system is ""adequate to protect taxpayers and depositors"" and if the government can be confident that no other UK banks are vulnerable to failure after Silicon Valley Bank UK's collapse. There has also been further instability, including Swiss bank Credit Suisse having to be rescued by rival UBS. Mr Hunt said that markets are unsettled, but the UK financial system is ""fundamentally strong"" and UK banks are have enough money - much more than before the 2008 financial crisis. ""We continue to monitor the situation carefully,"" he added. The Bank of England along with six central banks around the world, including the US Federal Reserve, joined forces on Monday to help contain the spread of the crisis by boosting dollar flows into the financial system. It means that banks can borrow dollars from the central bank through the course of the seven-day-a-week facility. But so far, no banks have used the so-called swap line, suggesting that stress levels in the UK banking system are currently low. "
Spread to US Treasury,Politicians praise Queen's warmth and wisdom,2024-09-25,2022-09-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-62842010,"Politicians from across the UK have paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth II who has died at the age of 96. Leading the mourning, the new Prime Minister Liz Truss said the Queen had been ""the rock on which modern Britain was built"". ""Britain is the great country it is today because of her,"" she added. Ms Truss met the Queen earlier this week in Scotland when she was appointed prime minister. Speaking from Downing Street, she said the Queen had been ""determined"" to continue carrying out her duties. She said the nation should now come together to help the new monarch King Charles III ""bear the awesome responsibility that he now carries for us all"".  ""God save the King,"" she concluded. Ms Truss was informed of the Queen's death at 16:30 BST by senior civil servant Simon Case while she was working in Downing Street, her official spokesman has said She spoke to the King shortly after making her statement. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the country would ""always treasure Queen Elizabeth II's life of service and devotion to our nation and the Commonwealth"". ""Above the clashes of politics, she stood not for what the nation fought over, but what it agreed upon. ""So as our great Elizabethan era comes to an end, we will honour the late Queen's memory by keeping alive the values of public service she embodied."" House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said the Queen had ""exercised a calm and steadying influence over our country"". He added that she had given people's lives a ""sense of equilibrium"" during her 70 years on the throne and maintained ""unwavering devotion to the UK"". He also said she had provided ""advice and the benefit of long experience to 15 prime ministers during her reign"". Parliament is expected to meet on Friday from midday and Saturday from 14:00 to pay tribute to the Queen. All six living former prime ministers have also sent their condolences and shared memories of the Queen. Ms Truss's predecessor Boris Johnson tweeted that the Queen would be remembered for her ""deep wisdom, and historic understanding, and her seemingly inexhaustible but understated sense of duty"". ""Relentless though her diary must have felt, she never once let it show, and to tens of thousands of events - great and small - she brought her smile and her warmth and her gentle humour - and for an unrivalled 70 years she spread that magic around her kingdom. ""She seemed so timeless and so wonderful that I am afraid we had come to believe, like children, that she would just go on and on."" Theresa May tweeted: ""On the 75th anniversary of VE Day, Her Majesty reminded us to 'never give up, never despair'.  ""It was an address that captured not just the national spirit, but Queen Elizabeth's spirit - a sense of quiet determination, of courage, of faith and of hope in the future."" During her 70-year reign, Queen Elizabeth held weekly meetings with the prime minister of the day.  Recalling these conversations during an interview with the BBC, Mrs May said the Queen was ""immensely knowledgeable"" adding: ""Many people don't realise how much work the Queen put into her red boxes, to understand the issues of the day, what was going on in government and around the rest of the world."" Sir John Major - who served as prime minister between 1990 and 1997 - echoed Mrs May's thoughts describing the Queen as ""exceptionally well briefed"".  ""On foreign affairs, she would often say if there was a difficulty of a foreign leader 'Well, I met him many years ago' or even 'I knew his father'."" Sir John said the meetings were not always serious and often filled with ""a great deal of gossip... those meetings with the Queen were always the better part of a prime minister's week"". David Cameron described the Queen as ""the world's most experienced diplomat"" and said he was ""fortunate"" to have been able to call on her knowledge during his time in office.  Gordon Brown said the Queen was a ""compassionate, dedicated, wonderful public servant and nobody will ever forget the contribution she made to our country. ""She was a peacemaker, she brought people together, she listened to people."" Sir Tony Blair - who was prime minister between 1997 and 2007 - said: ""We have lost not just our monarch but the matriarch of our nation, the figure who more than any other brought our country together, kept us in touch with our better nature, personified everything which makes us proud to be British."" He recalled his last meeting with the Queen when he said she had been on ""sparkling form"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the Queen represented ""duty and courage, as well as ""warmth and compassion"".  Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon praised the Queen's life as ""one of extraordinary dedication and service"". The Queen died at her Balmoral estate in Scotland and Ms Sturgeon said she hoped it would be ""a source of comfort to her family that she spent her final days in a place that she loved so much"".  Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said the Queen had ""firmly upheld the values and traditions of the British Monarchy"" and offered his ""deepest condolences""."

Aberystwyth University had told students of its decision by email late on Sunday evening after 12 students tested positive for Covid-19. But the university has announced some in-person postgraduate study will start this week, with in-person undergraduate teaching to begin from Monday. Vice-chancellor Elizabeth Treasure said it had been sanctioned by authorities. The university had originally said its decision was based on ""uncertainty"" about the spread of the virus. But Prof Treasure said she was ""extremely pleased"" to get the ""unanimous support"" of Public Health Wales, Hywel Dda University Health Board and Ceredigion County Council to resume in-person teaching. ""This is excellent news for us and our students,"" she said. ""We will continue to ensure that the safety of our students, staff and the wider community is our priority, and we're very grateful for the way local, regional and national partners have worked swiftly with us to recognise that the best thing for our students to be doing right now is taking a full part in their learning activities."" Prof Treasure said the university would ""continue to impress on everyone"" the importance of observing Welsh Government restrictions and guidelines. ""We recognise this is a difficult and unprecedented time for students, and we have a range of support services available to help them,"" she added. ""We need restraint and restrictions on social activity in particular - every student must remain with their own student household and not mix with other households in a social setting."" Eifion Evans, Ceredigion council's chief executive, said the council was ""pleased"" face-to-face teaching could resume. ""These measures will be kept under constant review as the days progress,"" Mr Evans added."
Spread to US Treasury,"Scrap tax on sunscreen, say cancer charities",2024-09-25,2023-05-15,By Michelle Roberts,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-65557091,"Value added tax - better known as VAT - should be scrapped on sunscreen to make it more affordable, say several UK cancer charities.  Sunscreen is classified as a ""cosmetic"" product and carries a 20% tax, adding around £1.50 to the cost of a bottle.  Charities want high-factor protective creams to be VAT exempt, citing the cost-of-living crisis which has seen many struggling to buy essential items.  Most skin cancers are caused by sun damage. There are several types of skin cancer, and melanoma is the most dangerous, as well as the most common type among young people in the UK - with cases on the rise.  If untreated, the cancer can spread to other areas of the body. Sunbeds also increase the risk of skin cancer, with some delivering greater doses of UV rays than the midday tropical sun. ""Few realise that getting painful sunburn just once every two years can triple your risk of skin cancer,"" said Dr Louise Soanes, Chief Nurse, Teenage Cancer Trust. ""Preventing skin cancer by using an effective sun cream is essential - and sun cream shouldn't be a luxury that only some can afford."" Cruise ship dancer Kass Barker, who says she used to be ""really into sunbathing"", was diagnosed with melanoma in October 2020, at the age of 22.  She had gone for a check-up of a mole on her wrist that had been worrying her.  ""I just had a gut-feeling something was wrong,"" says Kass, from Tyne and Wear. Kass wants to warn others about how serious melanoma can be. ""If there was a cream that people said could prevent breast cancer, then everyone would be buying it - but for some reason people do not see skin cancer as such a threat.  ""I'm a dancer and I love being tanned, but is it worth your life? I see people on social media joking about getting sunburnt, but it's no joke. Melanoma can kill."" A mole that has changed shape, or colour, or looks and feels unusual. Or skin that: See a doctor if you are concerned. Scottish National Party MP Amy Callaghan is running a campaign and petition urging government to act. She was diagnosed with melanoma at 19.  ""More people wearing sunscreen means fewer people getting melanoma,"" said Ms Callaghan. ""But when 52% of people in my constituency can't afford to turn on the heating, it's unlikely they'll take on extra expenses like sunscreen.  ""That's why we must make sunscreen more affordable, by removing VAT.""  What is VAT? The charity Melanoma Focus surveyed 2,000 people in the UK aged 16 and over. Around half of them thought sunscreen was too expensive.   One in 10 said they didn't use it at all because of the cost.  Other reasons given for not using it included a desire to tan, a belief their skin won't burn, or a feeling that sunscreen is too messy - and unpleasant to apply or wear. Tanning itself is actually a sign of skin damage; people don't have to burn to be at a higher risk of skin cancer.  Claire Knight, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""While price may be a barrier for some, it's worth remembering that you don't need to spend a lot on a sunscreen to get good protection - what matters is an SPF of at least 15, and a star rating of 4 or 5.  ""There may be other reasons people don't use sunscreen - for example, not realising that you can burn on a cloudy day, or mistakenly thinking make-up with SPF in is sufficient.  ""But when it comes to sun safety, sunscreen is only part of it. Spending time in the shade and covering up with clothing are the best and cheapest ways to protect yourself against damage from too much of the sun's UV rays."" The 20% standard VAT rate applies to most goods and services, including sunscreen products purchased over the counter at pharmacies.  The exemption the campaigners are requesting would be for proven sun protection, but not foundation or other make-up containing SPF.  An HM Treasury spokesperson said: ""We recognise the impact that rising prices are having at home which is why we are providing significant support worth on average £3,300 per household. This includes holding down energy bills, uplifting benefits and delivering direct cash payments.  ""High-factor sunscreen is on the NHS prescription list for certain conditions and is already provided VAT free when dispensed by a pharmacist to these patients."" How does sunscreen work? "

The figure, released on Monday, is an increase of 1,068 cases since Sunday.  A total of 2,148 total cases of Covid-19 were recorded in Northern Ireland on Tuesday. The executive is due to meet on Wednesday to discuss the current restrictions in place and decide next steps. However, a leading virologist has said people need to decide ""what they're willing to risk"" in certain situations. ""I think we've seen a lot of that recently with people deciding to stay safe before Christmas so they don't have to isolate, instead of going to the pre-Christmas parties and events,"" Dr Lindsay Broadbent told BBC News NI. ""I think those kind of decisions, along with things like regular lateral flow testing, will help to keep families safe this Christmas."" While Omicron cases rise, other seasonal viruses like colds and flu are continuing to circulate. GP Dr Frances O'Hagan urged people to get a PCR test ""if you have any symptoms related to Covid"". ""When you ring the doctor...the doctor will ask you to get a PCR test,"" said Dr O'Hagan. ""Go ahead and do it, you don't have to wait for us to ask."" Dr O'Hagan said Omicron cases were doubling ""about every two days"". She added that testing was ""so, so important to try and calm the spread"". The executive is considering a range of restrictions - from doing nothing, to imposing lockdown. In reality, it's likely to be something in between, including restricting the number of households mixing and imposing an early closure on hospitality. Considering that Covid numbers in hospitals are falling, as too are the numbers of those dying from the virus, at present Northern Ireland is in a much better place. But the challenge now facing the executive is assessing the health warnings from the medical experts and deciding what, when, and if, they need to move. In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government needs to ""reserve the possibility"" of bringing in new Covid rules as cases of the Omicron variant there surge ahead of Christmas. However, no new restrictions were announced after a meeting of the cabinet on Monday afternoon. Pub owner Fergal Shannon said businesses ""need to know today"" if new restrictions are going to be announced in Northern Ireland. ""We might not be open, by the way they're talking, by the end of the week,"" said Mr Shannon. ""Telling us on Wednesday or Thursday is no good, we need deliveries in and try and get staff sorted and everything now."" He added: ""The uncertainty is getting us."" As of Monday, the number of positive Covid-19 cases confirmed in the past seven days in Northern Ireland was 14,632. There were 276 patients with Covid-19 in hospitals in Northern Ireland on Monday, down from 312 on Friday, when figures were last updated."

The Treasury says the targets for the reductions are still being discussed.

He described the welfare budget as ""completely out of control"". Labour said the plans would hit the poorest in society, including pensioners and disabled people, rather than the ""work-shy"". The combined £4bn and £11bn cuts represent about 6% of total spending on welfare. The BBC understands discussions are continuing in Whitehall about whether it is possible to limit pensioner benefits - such as the winter fuel allowance, bus pass and free TV licence - without breaking Prime Minister David Cameron's election promise that he would preserve them. The Conservatives have described as ""lies"" Labour's warnings those benefits would be scrapped. The Treasury is currently holding meetings with individual ministers ahead of the October's spending review, likely to be the toughest in a generation. Mr Osborne said: ""There are five million people living on permanent out-of-work benefits. That is a tragedy for them and fiscally unsustainable for us as a country - we can't afford it any more. ""Of course, people who are disabled, people who are vulnerable, people who need protection will get our protection, and more. ""But people who think it's a lifestyle choice to just sit on out-of-work benefits - that lifestyle choice is going to come to an end. The money won't be there."" For Labour, shadow work and pensions secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""We don't know how the cuts are going to fall. But the reality is that the £11bn of benefit cuts they've already announced are hitting the poorest, such as pensioners and the disabled, hardest - not the work-shy.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said the attack on the royals was ""very shocking"" and they should be commended for their fortitude. He also said the route was ""thoroughly recced"" in advance, including several minutes beforehand, and that his officers had shown ""commendable restraint"". He said: ""The unpredictability of the - I was going to say demonstrators but I'd rather describe them as thugs - and how they moved about the capital meant that the protection officers were placed in a very difficult position. ""Yesterday was a thoroughly disgraceful incident and there will be a very full and detailed criminal inquiry into how that attack happened."" London Mayor Boris Johnson said it was regrettable the heir to the throne could be surrounded by agitators and that people's first instinct was to blame the police. And Universities Minister David Willetts said the attacks on the police were ""shocking"" and the officers caught up in the violence should be supported. ""The police were in very difficult circumstances and they were being tested over hours, often of abuse and attack. I don't think it's for us who were not on the front line like they were to criticise them,"" he told the BBC.  The National Union of Students (NUS), meanwhile, said the violence had overshadowed the story it wanted to see in the newspapers.

The Commons vote mean fees will almost treble to £9,000 a year. The government's majority was cut by three-quarters to 21 in a backbench rebellion. Three ministerial aides resigned. Only 28 Lib Dem MPs - fewer than half - voted for the government's plans for tuition fees. Six Conservative MPs voted against. Students from around the UK gathered in London for a day of protests and a rally - with police expecting about 20,000 demonstrators. In angry scenes, protesters battled with police in Parliament Square. Hundreds were contained on Westminster Bridge for a time by officers. There were angry clashes as protesters - some throwing missiles - fought to break through police lines.  Riot police had to force back protesters who were smashing windows of the Treasury and the Supreme Court. Earlier, protesters had largely taken over Parliament Square and pressed against lines of police in front of the Houses of Parliament. Mounted police were used to control crowds, at one point charging a group of protesters. Scotland Yard said 12 officers and 43 protesters were injured, and 34 people were arrested. Supt Julia Pendry said officers had come under sustained attack and condemned ""acts of wanton vandalism, wanton violence"" by protesters. Police said there were attacks using ""flares, sticks, snooker balls and paint balls"". The Metropolitan Police Authority chairman, London Deputy Mayor Kit Malthouse, defended the tactic of holding of demonstrators in a small area, known as ""kettling"". He said: ""You either go for dispersal of the crowd, and we've seen that in London in the past, what you then get is groups of protesters ranging through London. ""The other alternative is to contain, and that often calms the crowd down. ""Now, obviously these crowds can be very volatile and people can break away, and that seems to be what's happened.""

One of the girls was about four feet high. They hadn't come with any adults.  ""We want the MPs to hear our voices,"" said one of the protest organisers, as the hordes of protesters converged on Parliament Square, after a breathless scramble of a march through the pre-Christmas streets of the capital.  Once again, university and further education students, trade unionists and school pupils formed a mass below a sea of placards. Their anger is aimed not only at the raising of tuition fees to up to £9,000, but also major cuts to university teaching budgets and the removal of education allowances for low-income 16-19 year olds. There were youths clutching hard hats and cards with advice on what to do if they got arrested.  There were heavily made-up girls in hot pants, mini-skirts and leopard print coats, as well as protesters dressed as a Storm Trooper, Superman, and Father Christmas.  Business Secretary Vince Cable was lambasted by the protesters as a ""gibbering wreck"" and the Lib Dems as the ""Tories' poodles"". ""We will fight on! We will overcome!"" The speeches went on as the protesters gathered, the organisers keen to wait until the march reached its maximum size. ""We haven't got a Clegg to stand on"", read one banner. ""My toilet's Clegged"", said another, as the Liberal Democrat leader tries to face down his beck-bench rebellion.  But not everyone was convinced. ""That's just ridiculous,"" commented English student Steph Dickinson, 21, from Liverpool, as one speaker called on activists to ""bring down the neo-liberal state"".  And then the marchers were off.  As the march started out past shoppers and tourists in Bloomsbury, police spread across the road and set a sedate pace at the front of the column of protesters. This followed the fast-paced chase for several miles around London last week. But groups of protesters soon surged ahead and a few scuffles broke out as police tried to form new lines.  Protesters and police have been injured One officer was led away limping. Protester Gordon Maloney, 20, who had travelled 12 hours by coach from Aberdeen to attend the demonstration, said a policeman had punched him in the chest, and he'd seen another protester being hit with a stick.  A breakaway march poured through Covent Garden, trotting to shouts of ""Whose streets? Our streets"", while the main protest stayed on the agreed route along The Strand.  Harrassed-looking protest marshals in fluorescent yellow bibs shouted at protesters to slow down. One told me the aim was to hold the crowd together, at least until the march reached Parliament Square.  ""Then whatever happens after that happens,"" he said.  And despite a few scuffles, headlong dashes and shouts of ""no-one's kettling me"", the crowd arrived at Parliament Square and the wait began.  And as the sun dropped, some angry clashes broke out in the shadow of Westminster Abbey.  Protesters say the police tried to move their line forward. Mounted police charged the crowd. Protesters hurled sticks from wooden placards and a chair. A couple of fireworks cracked, while the crowd pushed forwards shouting ""no ifs, not buts, no education cuts"".  A young protester struggled back through the crowd with blood running down his face. Another, Hero Austin, 20, who works for the LSE students' union, said she'd been crushed by a barrier, and police had carried on pushing as she had tried to help another protester who had been knocked to the ground.  Bonfires of placards and a park bench blazed, and then burned out.  The police stopped allowing protesters to leave. A woman pleaded to be let out to collect her child from nursery.  As the temperature dropped and the vote neared, a hut was set on fire. Thick clouds of black smoke billowed across the square, as the protesters sang ""build a bonfire, build a bonfire, put the Tories on the top..."".  The storm-trooper clambered on to the top of a hut and performed a striptease - down to the waist - in front of Big Ben. Protesters anxiously fiddled with mobile phones, waiting for word from inside the chamber.  Then it came. ""The vote's passed,"" a woman bellowed through a loud hailer, sparking chants of ""Tory scum, Tory scum"".  Some protesters used placards as weapons But they were short-lived. Face to face with thick metal barriers and lines of black-clad riot police, the protesters in front of parliament seemed to be waiting for something to happen. ""If someone could find the anarchists..."", said one, glancing around.  ""I'm gutted,"" said Jonathan Cotton, 20, an economics student who had travelled from Manchester. ""We knew it was coming but it's still a kick in the teeth.""  ""I feel angry,"" said John Dodds, 27, from London South Bank University. ""They've voted away our futures, and the futures of our brothers and sisters.""  But both said the closeness of the vote was testament to the power of the wave of student protest in recent weeks.  And it wasn't long before anger turned to violence in another corner of the square.  Groups of youths raised large metal barriers aloft and rushed towards the police at the entrance to Whitehall. Police charged back, with riot shields and batons.  Protesters burned placards and park benches ""We're just chucking them at the police,"" said one. ""We're trying to put them as a shield between the police and the protesters,"" said another. ""But it's not really working, they're just coming right back at us. There's people bleeding an' everything.""  And there were.  A few minutes earlier, a group had rushed back into the square carrying a young man with blood pouring from a head wound.  Someone grabbed a metal bar, and systematically smashed each pane of a window on the Treasury, to cheers from the crowd.  Elsewhere, shivering students munched bags of crisps and tubs of hummus, hovering by the police cordons in quieter corners, hoping to be allowed to leave.  Everyone vowed the protests would go on. And as the youths grabbed yet more metal barriers, it was clear the battle on the streets was far from over. Royal car attacked in fees demo"

Spread to US Treasury,The black market coins that rewrite English history,2024-09-25,2023-04-27,By Adam Clarkson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-tyne-65401761,"The recovery of 44 Anglo-Saxon coins that were hawked on the international black market has helped reshape historians' understanding of English history. As two men are convicted of conspiring to sell criminal property, BBC News examines the tangled tale that begins back in the 9th Century.  Collectors Craig Best and Roger Pilling thought they were on to a winner. They had in their possession dozens of silver coins, some of which they knew were extremely rare. They also knew the coins were part of an undeclared Viking hoard, discovered in 2015, and therefore illegal to own. Best hawked what he called ""big money"" coins to potentially interested parties but so rare were some of the items he was trying to peddle that suspicions grew. Those suspicions eventually led to the involvement of the police. The conviction of Best, 46, and 75-year-old Pilling is just the latest chapter in a tale that began somewhere in the AD 870s. Alfred the Great, ruler of Wessex, was leading the Anglo-Saxon resistance against Viking invaders in the struggle that would eventually lead to the creation of a unified Kingdom of England. The history pages speak of a contemporary, the lesser known Ceolwulf II, King of Mercia. He has been painted as a somewhat insignificant player, a Viking ""puppet"" ruler, a minor nobleman held in power by the intruding army. Ceolwulf is described in unflattering terms in Saxon records, then vanishes altogether, with no clue as to what became of him. All we know is that Alfred the Great withstood conquest and eventually became ruler of a large part of Ceolwulf's kingdom. But what if this long-established narrative, penned by Alfred's court chroniclers, is incorrect - or merely part of the story? This is where two men with metal detectors come in to play... Fast forward to 2015, George Powell and Layton Davies uncover a long-lost stash of 300 coins in a field in Eye, near Leominster, Herefordshire. Had they declared the find and handed it over to the Crown, as required by law, the men are likely to have made a lot of money. One expert claims finders of such hauls could become ""millionaires with no criminal record"" if they abide by the rules. Instead, Powell and Davies concealed their find in the hope of maximising their gains and they were eventually jailed in 2019. The coins were almost certainly buried by a Viking, but the majority of the £3m hoard remained missing. Just 29 coins were recovered. Four years later, Durham Police arrested two men in an undercover sting following a ""lengthy and complex investigation"". Best, of Bishop Auckland, was arrested in a hotel in Durham while Pilling, of Loveclough, Lancashire, was arrested in his home. Between them they had 44 of the coins, since valued at £766,000. In 2018, Best had made contact with US-based coin collector Prof Ronald Bude and had tried to interest him in buying some, including an ""Alfred penny"". Unsure of the coins' legitimacy, Prof Bude asked Best where they came from. In an email Best replied, ""near Worcester"". Worcester is about 30 miles from the scene of the 2015 find. Word spread about the availability of extremely rare coins, the authorities were contacted and the undercover operation was mounted. Among the dozens of coins recovered by the police were two extremely rare examples of two-headed coins bearing images of both Alfred and Ceolwulf. But why would these two be sharing two sides of the same coin? Back to the late 9th Century.... According to experts, the coins suggest that the two kings were much more closely aligned than historians had been led to believe. Their existence sheds new light on Alfred's reign and transforms our understanding of the allegiances of power during that period. Two sets of coins featuring both rulers shows they had a ""prolonged alliance"", according to Dr Gareth Williams, curator of Early Medieval Coins and Viking Collections at the British Museum. ""The coins show beyond any possible doubt that there was a political and economic alliance between Alfred and Ceolwulf II,"" he said. ""Together the two kings carried out a major reform of the coinage, introducing high-quality silver coins, with the 'two emperors' design symbolising this alliance, followed by a second joint coinage. ""As more coins emerge, it is clear that this monetary alliance lasted for some years. ""The alliance was airbrushed out of history."" The ground-breaking coins are now permanently held at the British Museum where work will continue to unearth more details about the previously unknown relationship between the two kings. And with the majority of the Viking hoard from 2015 yet to be recovered, who knows what other secrets from history are still out there.

Spread to US Treasury,Lloyd Webber calls off Cinderella until February,2024-09-25,2021-12-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-59742071,"Andrew Lloyd Webber has said he is ""devastated"" to have halted his latest musical Cinderella for seven weeks as Omicron plays havoc with live events. The West End show will return ""as soon as this wave is licked"", the composer and producer said, with a return currently scheduled for 9 February. It is the first major production to be put on ice for such an extended period. Cinderella is one of many plays to have already had UK performances cancelled because of Covid among cast and crew. It has been off the Gillian Lynne Theatre stage since Thursday. ""Once again, this wretched virus has put paid to the joy of entertaining audiences, something that I hold so dear,"" Lord Lloyd Webber wrote on Twitter. ""Sadly this is the right thing to do, not just for the safety of our cast, musicians and backstage crew, but for the quality of the show we give our audiences who travel long distances and make significant investments to come and see us. ""Rest assured, Cinderella will re-open as soon as this wave is licked and we know we can give our audiences the fantastic time they deserve."" The opening of the show was also disrupted earlier this year. A separate statement said: ""Like so many theatres up and down the country, day after day, we are forced to make decisions (often at short notice) based on the latest round of test results."" It added that producers were ""passionately committed to returning sooner if the circumstances improve and we will keep the situation under constant review"". Over the weekend, half of London's major theatres were forced to cancel performances because of outbreaks. Many more around the country have also suffered the same fate in recent days, including at the Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse, the Manchester Royal Exchange, the Lowry in Salford, the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff and Newcastle's Theatre Royal. Some have suspended shows until the New Year. Wendy and Peter Pan at the Leeds Playhouse and Shakespeare's Globe's Measure For Measure will not return until 4 January, while the curtain will stay down on the National Theatre's festive show Hex 5 until January. On Broadway, the Alanis Morrissette musical Jagged Little Pill has closed for good, blaming ""the drastic turn of events this week with the rapid spread of the Omicron variant"". Lord Lloyd Webber's decision came despite Chancellor Rishi Sunak's announcement on Tuesday of an extra £30m for the Culture Recovery Fund to help English venues and arts organisations between now and March. The Theatres Trust said the funds must be ""distributed as quickly as possible to help protect theatres"". The charity's director Jon Morgan said: ""Theatres across the country are already struggling with shows being cancelled due to infections and falling ticket sales as audiences follow government advice to be cautious, so this support is very much needed."" The Society of London Theatre added: ""This is a clear signal that the chancellor and HM Treasury understand the challenges facing our theatres and other cultural businesses."" The Equity and Bectu unions called for more help for individual workers, who Equity said were ""staring into a winter of cancelled shows, bookings and performances"". Bectu added that the Culture Recovery Fund was ""focused on buildings not people, is too cumbersome and too slow"". Meanwhile, in Scotland, the government has ordered capacities for seated indoor performances to be cut to 200 from from 26 December and a return of social distancing for at least three weeks. Those measures ""will have a devastating impact on theatres"", according to the Theatres Trust. ""We therefore welcome the additional financial support announced by the first minister and hope this will be distributed quickly,"" a statement said. Several Scottish theatres had already cancelled their Christmas shows, according to The Stage."
Spread to US Treasury,The sound way out of the Covid-19 crisis,2024-09-25,2020-04-20,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-52360616,"The old ""dog 'n' bone"" is back. For decades use of the phone was in long-term decline but the lockdown has sparked a boon in, socially distant, conversations.  It's been a good few weeks for telecoms in general, as terabytes of data have kept us working and entertained.   Companies like Zoom have found a ready and eager new audience for its conference call software. But the art of conversation relies on quality of sound.  And it's one of the curiosities of modern telephony that the thing that seems to work least reliably, or least clearly, is the speaking and listening bit. Help may be on its way along with some good news for the Scottish technology sector. A Chinese company, called AAC Technologies, has announced that Edinburgh is to be the site of its new research centre.  The firm is talking only six Scottish jobs to start with, but they might push that up to 20. As with so many of the small tech operations, this one is tapping the ecosystem of skills in and orbiting around Edinburgh University.  That institution spun out Wolfson Microelectronics, a listed company bought over six years ago by Cirrus Logic. And now, AAC is recruiting from the pool of talent that worked at Wolfson, starting with the boss of the new Edinburgh centre, Colin Jenkins. Their mission is to improve the Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) that function as microphones in a modern smart phone. As explained to me by David Plekenpol, AAC's chief strategic officer, a smart phone now has five or six of these systems embedded in it.   Some do the conventional job of picking up sound, but more are busily tracking sound in order to deaden it, or to cancel out background noise with clever sound wave technology. The applications are widespread.   The autonomous car of the near future will be loaded with such MEMS, as a means of interacting with the passengers, and as a way of controlling sound and soundproofing the interior.  The days of the computer keyboard may be numbered, at least in its current form, as voice controls become more common. As a broadcaster, I am regularly astonished at the quality of sound that can be captured by a basic smart phone, sometimes when you're not even aware where the microphone can be found. I asked Mr Plekenpol whether the phone experience will improve as a result of the effort AAC is putting into MEMS, which it then sells on to the major phone manufacturers. ""That's down to the consumer,"" he said.  It'll improve when phone users demand it. In recent, years, they have demanded ever improving functionality with cameras. If they make the same fuss about the quality of microphone, then the manufacturers will be sure to respond. So why mention this now? For one thing, it's a pleasant and rare experience to be able to report on something positive happening in the economy of April 2020. It's also because, amid the vast outpouring of borrowed government funds to get Britain through the Covid-19 crisis, something quite significant has happened. AAC Technologies is too big and international to benefit directly, but that eco-system from which it now draws is getting a £1bn injection of rescue cash, in loans and grants, to address the needs of start-up firms in bio-science and technology. Because they are often too far from the market to be able to turn to banks for funding, and because they are usually some way from making profit, the emergency government schemes to help business with grants and loan guarantees have not been reaching them. So two elements have been announced by the UK government: one to back up larger tech firms which are already established in raising venture capital. Some £250m has been committed there, with £250m private sector matching funds ( though some sceptics think it should have achieved more private buy-in).  A further £750m is to help smaller firms: those already being backed by Innovate UK (as the name suggests, the government's innovation agency) and grants for those research-rich start-ups that haven't yet come within its orbit. The obvious significance of this is that these companies are the seedbed for future growth and technology developments.  At least as significant is that the government is stepping up its use of risk funds in the sector, in tune with the rhetoric we've been hearing from the prime minister. If loans aren't paid back, they're to be convertible into equity. Innovate UK has already established its role in this, in 13 years investing £2.5 billion, alongside private investors.  Although much of the Boris Johnson agenda - levelling up the regions of England, an infrastructure bonanza, and trade deals post-Brexit - could be blown off course by the health crisis, here is another part of what he wants to achieve, getting some funding that should have an impact long after the crisis is over. There's widespread agreement on that. Those free market Conservatives who thought government has no role in backing and picking winners seem to be silent.  But is it enough? The Scottish government's economy secretary, Fiona Hyslop, has broken with the co-operative vibes coming out of those Cobra meetings, to question the support Downing Street is offering business. While there are criticisms of the way the Scottish government business grants are working, this Holyrood minister has concerns that the new scheme for technology start-ups may fail to work alongside Scotland's economic development agencies. They ought to know many of those firms better than Innovate UK.  She has written to the Chancellor, pushing also for more flexibility on the furlough scheme, to plug gaps in his offer made to the self-employed, and to ""accelerate"" the roll-out of loans to business - so far only reaching 12,000 companies. There is pressure on the Chancellor to increase the extent of government loan guarantees from 80% to 100%. This would remove banks' concern that their loan book could be impaired if those loans turn sour.  But Rishi Sunak has said he is not persuaded. In trying to save the economy from going over the Covid cliff, such rules keep moving, and the costs keep rising."

The paper says it is ""no wonder that public compliance is falling"" when ""no evidence is produced to justify"" pubs and restaurants having to close at 22:00 BST.  It's a view shared by the Daily Telegraph, which says the curfew is failing in its objective of keeping people apart and slowing the growth of the virus. In its editorial pages, the paper says it's ""exasperating"" for many of Boris Johnson's supporters that there is no sign that the government is about to change course.  ""Time to axe 10pm curfew"" is the headline in the Daily Mail, which says pressure is growing to ditch a policy that simply forces crowds onto the streets. Police, scientists and politicians have joined forces to call for Mr Johnson to rethink it, the paper says. It reports that only 3% of coronavirus outbreaks investigated by Public Health England were due to people gathering in bars and restaurants. The Sun says it ""wouldn't mind so much if there was solid evidence"" that the curfew and other ""draconian curbs"" were cutting infections. It says what these ""freedom-destroying edicts do most successfully is induce panic, seen in the idiotic stripping of loo roll from supermarket shelves"". Mr Johnson is facing a ""Red Wall revolt"" by Conservative MPs in traditional Labour constituencies over the latest measures, according to the Daily Mail.  It says with 16 million Britons now under ""draconian"" restrictions, his own MPs are calling it a ""national lockdown by default"".  Even if the government placates its backbenchers in the short term, it is unlikely to quell broader anxiety about its coronavirus strategy, according to the Spectator. The magazine detects growing unease about the direction in which ministers are going with lockdowns. It says usually supportive MPs have made it clear the government needs to subject itself to more scrutiny if it is to maintain the backing of its MPs.  The Times says Tory backbenchers have accused the prime minister of ""ruling by decree"" with the creation of new coronavirus offences - prompting comparisons with George Orwell's dystopian novel, 1984.  It is also calling for an ""overhaul"" of government structures to improve long-term decision-making for the duration of the pandemic - including the appointment of a minister with specific responsibility for test and trace. The Times's leading article says the government ""keeps getting caught out by problems that ought to have been foreseeable"". A test and trace minister, it argues, could ""mobilise"" resources across departments and ""ensure that sufficient testing capacity is made available where and when it is needed"". Affluent millennials and holidaymakers are ""driving the second wave"" of coronavirus infections, according to the latest data reported in the Daily Telegraph.  The analysis - by the Office For National Statistics - found cases were rising fastest among wealthy under-35s whose infection rate has more than quadrupled since the end of July.  The paper says the figures suggest the introduction of the so-called ""rule-of-six"" may do little to stop the spread of the virus.        The paper leads with the shortage of flu vaccine across parts of the UK, raising fears that pensioners may face delays in getting the jab this winter. It says the shortfall leaves ""swathes of the most vulnerable with no immediate prospect of a jab, despite a government promise that they would be at the front of the queue"". The Guardian is one of the papers to carry a photograph of Su Bushby and her late partner Matt Ratana - the police officer who was killed at a custody suite in south London - who she described on Monday as a ""gentle giant"".  On its front page, the Sun carries a photograph of the suspected gunman, Louis De Zoysa, taken some years ago as he posed with a 5ft medieval sword. There are signs that European negotiators are inching closer to agreeing a trade deal with the UK, according to the Times.

The Los Angeles Times is of the view that they won't have a huge impact on a race that has remained ""remarkably stable despite numerous developments that might have altered it - a worldwide pandemic... a recession, wildfires consuming the West and widespread protests for racial justice"". The paper says the revelations ""may not dampen enthusiasm for Trump among his most ardent supporters, who have brushed off outrage after outrage for years"". Nearly three-quarters of US voters plan to watch the first debate between the presidential rivals Donald Trump and Joe Biden tomorrow, according to a poll reported in the Washington Post. The paper says that up to 11% of the electorate are either still unsure of how they will vote or might yet switch sides - suggesting the debates could play a pivotal role in the election.  And finally, the Times is among a number of papers to report that Britain is facing another potential diplomatic row over the return of a cultural treasure. This time though, it's not a dispute over the Elgin Marbles, but a fossilised shark's tooth. It was given to Prince George last week by Sir David Attenborough who came across the fossil on holiday in Malta in the 1960s. Under Maltese law, fossils are considered objects of ""cultural heritage"" and the country's culture minister now wants to see its return. "
Spread to US Treasury,Calls for hospitality support after 'bleak Friday',2024-09-25,2021-12-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-59710432,"Talks on further support for Scottish businesses are set to take place as firms feel the pinch on what should be their busiest weekend of the year. The UK government is due to hold a Cobra meeting including leaders of the devolved administrations, who want more money for measures to tackle Omicron. The Scottish government has already said bars and restaurants will receive a £66m support package. But hospitality bosses say this would not cover even a few days' losses. The sum was a share of a £100m package from the Scottish government's budget, which also covered the food and drink supply chain, the cultural sector and the wedding sector. Stephen Montgomery, of the Scottish Hospitality Group, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme he had visited a number of hospitality venues on Friday night, and there was a noticeable drop in footfall. He said: ""It was a bit unreal, it was quieter than what we'd expect for what would traditionally have been 'black Friday' - which we're calling 'bleak Friday'.  ""This is the time of year when we would normally take 30-35% of our annual turnover to see us through January-February time and the last reports we've had in since the Public Health Scotland message came out on Thursday of last week, we're probably seeing a big impound of turnover lost in Scotland through this."" On the £100m funding from the Scottish government, Mr Montgomery said the hospitality industry's share was ""a lot short"" as they had expected an 80:20 split. He said: ""It wouldn't even cover one or two days of loss of turnover for some people, it certainly wouldn't cover the wages for one week.  ""We'll take it, of course we will, but there has got to be some ongoing talks between the UK and Scottish governments - put all political differences aside and get this sorted out."" The Scottish government has made repeated calls for more money from the UK government - a phone call involving Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson took place on Friday. Earlier this week the Treasury announced £220m of immediate funding, but Scottish ministers say this had been brought forward from next year and had already been budgeted for. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes told the BBC that ""tentative"" conversations were being held with the Treasury and she was making the case for funds ""on every front"". Ms Forbes said she has quoted £500m in the Scottish government's request, a figure based on the monthly costs of furlough and grants. She said: ""The UK government can make the substantial funds available almost over night because they access borrowing from the market and ultimately we need the UK government to deliver on the requests made by the Welsh and Scottish governments. ""Ultimately this is about helping businesses right now that are struggling, but also knowing that when we need more support - because none of us can absolutely for definite know how this variant is going to play out - we know that we can access additional support for businesses."" On Friday, the UK government's Chancellor Rishi Sunak met business leaders for crisis talks, as firms warned of lost bookings. Mr Sunak has said that it is ""a difficult time for the hospitality industry"" but there were existing support measures in place to help the industry. Dr Christine Tait-Burkhard - an expert in infection and immunity at Edinburgh University - told the BBC that Omicron could be slowed down but not stopped.  She pointed to advice from the UK government's scientific advisory group, Sage, which said if we want to stop the spread we should go back to limiting indoor hospitality and indoor meetings. She said nightclubs and other large events could be shut down after Christmas to slow the spread. Nightclubs were closed in Scotland for 16 months at the start of the pandemic and reopened in August.  Dr Tait-Burkhard said: ""What we've seen with Omicron is it's very good at spreading in close-contact, large settings… that means certain businesses such as nightclubs are indeed a really good place where the virus can spread easily.   ""We have seen Wales closing down nightclubs after Christmas. It is a good potential that that might happen in Scotland as well alongside large events."" Live music venues have already warned they risk permanent closure if no bailout is forthcoming. On Saturday, 5,917 new cases of Covid were reported - accounting for 12.2% of PCR tests - however, Public Health Scotland said results were being reported more slowly due to the high volume of tests being taken, meaning the true number of Covid cases was likely to be higher. Nicola Sturgeon warned on Friday that Omicron was now the dominant strain of the virus and a ""tsunami"" was beginning to hit Scotland. New guidance for shops, hospitality venues and other businesses was introduced on Friday, in a bid to stem the transmission of Covid. David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said there were ""early and worrying indications to suggest shopper footfall has plunged even further in Scotland's city centre locations over recent days"" following the first minister's advice for the public to stay at home as much as possible.  He said it was a ""crucial"" trading time for shops, and that if the further downturn persisted then the government should be prepared to support the retail sector with further financial aid.  ""The sector provides 230,000 jobs directly in Scotland and is vital to the health of our high streets and city centres,"" he added.  On Saturday, Braehead shopping centre in Renfrewshire said the malls had been ""busy"", with ""a stream of socially-distanced shoppers"" taking advantage of the last weekend to shop before Christmas.

Spread to US Treasury,'No plans' for universal self-isolation payment,2024-09-25,2021-01-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-55760467,"There are no plans to pay everyone in England who tests positive for Covid £500 to self-isolate, No 10 has said. The PM's official spokesman said there was already a £500 payment available for those on low incomes who could not work from home and had to isolate. A universal £500 payment was among suggestions in a leaked Department of Health document. There are fears the current financial support is not working because low paid workers cannot afford to self-isolate. But a senior government source said the idea of extending the £500 payments to everyone who tests positive had been drawn up by officials and had not been considered by the prime minister.  BBC Newsnight's Katie Razzall said ministers were aware self-isolation was crucial for stopping the spread of coronavirus and the ""options paper"" had been drawn up by civil servants at the Department of Health. She said it would be discussed soon by the Covid operations committee chaired by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, adding the move suggested there was an admission in government that too many people were not staying at home and a decision needed to be made quickly. The story was first reported by the Guardian which said the options paper suggested the proposal could cost up to £453m per week - 12 times the cost of the current payouts. Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC he had not seen the leaked document but said the issue of financial support for people self-isolating was ""always kept under review"".  ""We've got to consider all sorts of policies in order to make sure that people abide by the rules, are able to abide by the rules and we get the infection rate down,"" he said.  But the prime minister's official spokesman denied the government was planning to introduce the new payment, telling reporters: ""We've given local authorities £70m for the scheme and they are able to provide extra payments on top of those £500 if they think it necessary. ""That £500 is on top of any other benefits and statutory sick pay that people are eligible for."" Asked about document, the spokesman said he would not comment on a leaked paper.  By Ben Butcher, BBC Reality Check It's impossible to say exactly what proportion of people stay at home for the full 10 days after being in contact with someone who has tested positive, however some evidence suggests the minority of people do. A government-backed study from September 2020 suggests that just 10.9% of people remained indoors for the full time.  Labour has often cited this report when arguing that people cannot afford to miss work, but a closer look at it suggests that, of those who break the rules, just 8.9% do ""to go to work"".  Most people reported going out for things like shopping or exercise, but also because they didn't think they needed to quarantine as they didn't develop symptoms.  This research is quite old (done before self-isolation grants came in) and has a relatively small sample size of just 400 people.  However, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has also highlighted research that shows that most people don't completely follow the rules. This research also suggests that those on lower incomes felt they were three times less able to self-isolate than those better off.  BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said there was concern in government about the huge cost of the proposal for the Treasury.  However, he said the issue of financial incentives and trying to get people to self-isolate was clearly a live discussion within government.  It became a legal requirement last September for anyone in England testing positive for coronavirus to self-isolate. The £500 grant already available in England is funded by the government but administered by local authorities. The same level of payment is available in Scotland and Wales with similar conditions attached. Northern Ireland offers a discretionary self-isolation grant that covers expenses, such as the cost of groceries.    There is a list of specific criteria applicants must meet for the grant, but those who do not qualify for this payment and who are on a low income or may face financial hardship as a result of self-isolating can apply for a discretionary payment. However, there have been high rejection rates for this discretionary grant in England, figures obtained by Labour and reported by the BBC this week suggest.  Between October and December last year, three-quarters of the 49,877 applications were rejected, the data showed.  Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish government would welcome the introduction of a £500 payment, as the additional funds it would generate for Scotland could allow for a similar scheme to be set up. Speaking at her regular coronavirus briefing, she said: ""We will see whether that transpires or not, but any extra resources for self-isolation we would use to support self-isolation."" In other developments: Prof Susan Michie, an adviser on the government's Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme just 18% of people with symptoms were self-isolating for the full 10 days they were meant to. She said financial support currently offered to people having to self-isolate was a ""key weakness"" of the government's pandemic strategy. Sharon, a cleaner from Kent, told the BBC if no money were to come in for two weeks she would not be able to afford to self-isolate.  ""I have a mortgage to pay,"" she said. ""I can't even afford to heat my property at the moment because my wages were cut and that £500 payment would make all the difference. I would be able to self-isolate.  ""It wouldn't be enough money, but it would help."" The DoH said it would not comment on a leaked paper but stressed it was incumbent on everyone to help protect the NHS by staying at home and following the rules at ""one of the toughest moments of this pandemic"". A spokesman said £50m was invested at the time the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme launched and it was providing a further £20m to help support people on low incomes who need to self-isolate. People who have tested positive for coronavirus and those considered at risk of having been exposed to it must self-isolate.

Spread to US Treasury,New rules proposed for buy now pay later,2024-09-25,2022-06-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-61784020,"Rules on so-called buy now pay later (BNPL) loans will be tightened up, the government says - including new guidelines on advertising and checks to ensure customers can afford to pay. Apple has said it plans to launch a buy now pay later option for users of Apple Pay, initially in the US. But critics say BNPL schemes encourage people to spend beyond their means. The loans - used by 15 million people in the UK in 2021 - are typically spread over a number of payments. Although the instalments are interest free - BNPL companies make money from the retailer, usually taking a cut from sales - there may be additional charges if customers miss payments. The main operators offering the service in the UK are Klarna, Clearpay, Laybuy and PayPal. In September 2020, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) commissioned a review of BNPL schemes, which recommended the industry should be regulated. A recent survey by Citizens Advice suggested many consumers were using credit cards and other forms of debt to make payments. The charity heard from 2,288 people who had used buy now pay later during the past 12 months. It found that 52% made repayments from their current account, but 23% used a credit card, 9% used a bank overdraft and 7% borrowed from friends and family. In March it found that that young people, people in debt and people claiming Universal Credit, were at least twice as likely to have used BNPL to cover essentials such as food and toiletries, than other groups. Under plans set out by the government:  The government said other forms of short-term interest-free credit, such as those used to pay for dental work or larger items like furniture, will be required to comply with the same rules. In a statement accompanying the proposals, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, John Glen said: ""We are protecting consumers and fostering the safe growth of this innovative market in the UK."" But the proposals will not come into force for at least a year, with legislation scheduled for mid-2023, after which the FCA will consult on new rules. Alex Marsh, Head of Klarna UK, said he welcomed the new rules - telling the BBC the company already checked customers could afford to pay - and called for them to be brought in sooner. ""We urge the Government to move quicker than planned to implement regulation which gives additional protections to consumers from both irresponsible, unregulated BNPL providers and traditional banks disguising high interest products as 'BNPL'."" Citizens Advice also called for faster action: ""The buy now pay later sector continues to grow at a meteoric rate, but it could now remain unregulated for years,"" Dame Clare Moriarty, its chief executive wrote. She called on the government to ""turbo-charge"" its plans, and protect consumers sooner."
Spread to US Treasury,£320m coronavirus rescue package for business,2024-09-25,2020-03-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-51889013,"Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has announced a £320m rescue package for businesses. The cash is being made available to support business through the Covid-19 outbreak. She also revealed that a £50m hardship fund will be made available to people who lose their jobs as a result of a downturn caused by the virus.  The action has been taken to try to limit the impact of the pandemic on Scotland's economy. The first Scots fatality was confirmed on Friday after an elderly patient with underlying health issues died in the NHS Lothian area. During the 2020-21 financial year, business will be boosted with:  The finance secretary will also write to all local authorities urging them to respond positively to requests from ratepayers for payment deferrals for a fixed period.  Ms Forbes said: ""Covid-19 will have challenging implications for businesses and the economy over the coming weeks and months.  ""As well as following the latest health and travel advice, it's also crucial we consider the latest economic analysis and listen carefully to what the business community is telling us. We know that the tourism and hospitality sectors are facing immediate pressure, which is why we have directed support to them in particular."" She said that all ratepayers would benefit from a relief that effectively reversed the planned inflationary uplift that was due to come into effect in April. She also said the Scottish government was preparing a £50m fund for people who lose their jobs as a result of measures taken to limit the spread of the virus. This makes up the rest of the £360m-plus grant given by the Treasury in last week's budget.  She told BBC News: ""£50m will go to a hardship fund which will be announced shortly. That will look at, for example, people who are self- employed or people who have lost their jobs. ""We have allocated every consequential penny we have received towards business support but I would believe and hope that further support comes to help us meet business needs."" David Lonsdale - Scottish Retail Consortium ""In dealing with this unprecedented scenario the Scottish government has listened to business and has taken steps which should improve cashflow and confidence for those impacted by the virus. These are the right decisions for the present, albeit both the UK and Scottish government may have to take further steps as this very unpredictable and unprecedented situation evolves."" Andrew McRae - Federation of Small Businesses Scotland ""While the shape of this help is slightly different to the support being offered to businesses south of the border, it is a substantial attempt by ministers in Edinburgh to help perfectly sound businesses facing severe short-term cashflow problems. Time is of the essence, so this new money must be easy to access. This is no time for bureaucratic hold-ups. Further, should this initial package of measures prove insufficient, we must not hesitate in delivering a further expansion."" Liz Cameron - Scottish Chambers of Commerce ""The Scottish government have outlined an initial number of measures that will be welcomed by businesses - particularly in the most affected sectors such as retail, hospitality and tourism - following on from the measures introduced in the UK Budget earlier this week. This is a positive initial response by the Scottish Government, but the situation needs to be reviewed on a daily basis to identify what additional support is required, particularly around how business can retain employees and the cost of businesses changing their operating models, for example to flexible working practises. Tracy Black - CBI Scotland ""These are substantive steps from the Scottish government that will be hugely welcomed by business. Sector-specific support is vital in hospitality, leisure and retail.  Freezing rates and introducing direct grants are also important elements - and more may be needed, as knock-on effects are emerging daily in sectors and businesses of all sizes. So the scale of response must keep pace with the impact. Agility is essential."" Gail Macgregor - Cosla ""We recognise that the Scottish government is taking action to mitigate the impacts of coronavirus and the measures announced today will help local businesses and communities. Cosla will continue to work closely with the Scottish government and other agencies to ensure our businesses and communities across Scotland are supported during this exceptionally challenging period."""
Spread to US Treasury,US jobs creation surges as recovery gains steam,2024-09-25,2021-04-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56616636,"The US economy saw a surge in hiring in March as vaccination increased, officials eased restrictions and people pushed to return to their pre-pandemic activities. Employers added more than 900,000 jobs driven by re-openings at restaurants, bars, construction sites and schools. The gains were the biggest since August and helped lower the unemployment rate to 6% from 6.2% in February. However, overall employment remains far lower than before the Covid pandemic. Speaking on Friday, US President Joe Biden said people must remain vigilant when it comes to taking precautions against coronavirus. He said that millions have not yet been vaccinated and that many parts of the economy hit by closures remain weak. ""I plead with you, don't give back the progress we've all fought so hard to achieve,"" Mr Biden said. ""We need to finish this job. We need every American to buckle down and keep their guard up."" ""That's how we're going to beat the virus and cast off the weight of the pandemic that's holding our economy back."" The US lost more than 20 million jobs last spring as the virus led to widespread lockdowns. It has regained more than half, but the number of jobs is still more than 8 million down from February 2020, the US Labor Department said. In response to the crisis, Washington has approved trillions of dollars in recovery aid, including a $1.9tn (£1.4tn) package last month that contained $1,400 stimulus cheques for many Americans, extended unemployment benefits, and funded the re-opening of schools. Analysts are expecting a strong rebound later this year, as families emerge from lockdowns with pent-up demand and, in many cases, savings put away during the pandemic. Estimates suggest the growth rate in 2021 could hit 6% or higher. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said she is hopeful that near full employment could return next year. ""The better than expected 916,000 rebound in non-farm payrolls in March still leaves employment 8.4 million below its pre-pandemic peak from just over a year ago, but with the vaccination program likely to reach critical mass within the next couple of months and the next round of fiscal stimulus providing a big boost, there is finally real light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. The jobs report showed nearly every sector in the economy adding positions in March.  More people entered the labour force, encouraged by the signs of rebound, and jobless rates fell for most groups.  Officials also said employers added 156,000 more jobs in January and February than previous estimated. ""The broader re-opening of the economy, growing optimism that the end of the pandemic is in sight and a reversal of last month's unseasonably cold weather generated broad gains in hiring,"" Wells Fargo economist Sarah House said.  ""While there is still a lot of ground to make up, the labour market is on track for a relatively quick recovery,"" she added."
Spread to US Treasury,Sack Tory MP who criticised Whitty - Labour,2024-09-25,2021-12-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-59680908,"Labour says Conservative MP Joy Morrissey should apologise or face the sack as Dominic Raab's parliamentary aide after criticising Chris Whitty. In a tweet, which has now been deleted, the MP accused England's chief medical officer of exceeding his authority as an unelected official.  It came after Prof Whitty advised people to ""prioritise"" activities ahead of Christmas, amid rising Covid cases.  Another Tory MP said advisers were now ""running the show"". But Prof Whitty said chief medical officers ""have always given advice to the general public"" and ministers do not feel he is ""treading on their toes"". Asked if Boris Johnson agreed with Ms Morrissey, a No 10 spokesperson said: ""No - the chief medical officer is a hugely trusted public servant who produces expert advice. It's up to politicians to decide what to do."" On Wednesday, Prof Whitty said it would be ""very sensible"" for the public to prioritise ""the social interactions that really matter to them and, to protect those ones, de-prioritising ones that matter much less to them"". His advice came as Covid cases hit a record high in the UK - partly driven by the new Omicron variant.  In response MP for Beaconsfield Ms Morrissey, said ""Perhaps the unelected Covid public health spokesperson should defer to what our ELECTED members of Parliament and the prime minister have decided.  ""I know it's difficult to remember but that's how democracy works. This is not a public health socialist state"". Appearing in front of the health and social care committee, Prof Whitty said he had always been ""extremely clear on what I think the role of an adviser is"" and that ministers make the decisions.  But he said: ""From the very beginning, the very first chief medical officer in the 1850s, chief medical officers have always given advice to the general public."" Prof Whitty said the advice he gave on Wednesday ""is advice that I think any chief medical officer would have given"", adding: ""I don't actually think that any minister is feeling I am treading on their toes on this one. This is my job. ""But I also consider that questions about things like further measures - those are very much for ministers, so it's drawing a line between those two."" Labour's shadow justice secretary Steve Reed said the comments from Ms Morrissey were ""unacceptable and dangerous"" adding: ""As the Omicron variant spreads rapidly through Britain, there must not be any sign of the government censoring or intimidating our leading scientific experts."" He said Justice Secretary Mr Raab should fire the MP as his parliamentary private secretary unless she apologised for her comments.  Asked if the prime minister agreed with Ms Morrissey's comments, his official spokesman said: ""No. Professor Whitty is a hugely respected and trusted public servant who provides independent, evidence-based advice."" Other Conservative MPs have also questioned Prof Whitty's role during the pandemic - particularly raising concern that his advice to reduce social activities was damaging businesses.  Steve Brine said his comments had put ""hospitality into effective lockdown"" and that businesses were now facing ""complete ruin"".  He added that advisers were now ""running the show"".  Fellow Tory MP Steve Baker asked a Treasury minister to give him reassurance that ""when officials speak at particular podiums at press conferences, that they are staying within the bounds of the policy that ministers have decided"". He warned that officials' advice had the power to ""herd the public into particular behaviours"" and that ""while the government has formally allowed hospitality businesses in particular to stay open, the reality in my constituency is that fantastic businesses... have seen massive cancellations"". And another Tory, Greg Smith, said advisers had ""pressed the panic button way beyond what this House voted for a couple of days ago"". On Tuesday, MPs voted to approve stricter coronavirus measures, including making proof of double-vaccination or a negative test a requirement for accessing large venues.  Defending Prof Whitty, former Conservative chief whip Julian Smith said it was ""completely unacceptable"" for politicians to take part in ""personal attacks"" against members of the civil service. ""The UK civil service  supports the government, works flat out and needs to be encouraged and defended in its role of offering impartial and confident advice,"" he added."
Spread to US Treasury,Coronavirus: Morning update,2024-09-25,2022-03-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60593003,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. Government work to tackle fraud of Covid loans during the pandemic was like a ""Dad's Army operation"", according to a former Treasury minister. Lord Agnew, who stepped down in January over the government's performance on fraud, has told MPs the pandemic created ""a happy time to be a crook"". The Treasury says it struck the right balance between issuing loans quickly and guarding against fraud. Read our report on Lord Agnew's evidence. An NHS Test and Trace call handler resigned after a member of the public reported getting a voicemail that ""sounded like two people having sex"", the UK Health Security Agency has confirmed. The recipient, who had tested positive for Covid, says he was ""disgusted"" by the message, which was left in December. A care home in Douglas has closed to visitors amid a near-50% weekly rise in Covid cases on the Isle of Man. Salisbury Street Care Home was shut following an outbreak affecting residents and staff, although some visits will be permitted on compassionate grounds. More than 185 new cases were reported on the island on Wednesday, bringing the total to 944 - up by 300 in the last seven days. With the Covid testing regime winding down, analysis of sewage will play a bigger role in detecting outbreaks and new variants, scientists say. Queen's University Belfast's wastewater surveillance programme is analysing samples from 31 sites across Northern Ireland. ""We can still learn about how the virus is circulating in the community, where the hotspots are, without the need for individual testing,"" says programme co-lead Dr Deirdre Gilpin. Children have been helping to create the air purifiers being used to prevent the spread of coronavirus in classrooms. Carmarthenshire doctor Dr Rhys Thomas teamed up with colleagues in the US to create a simple but powerful device that can remove virus particles from the air. And Ysgol Gymraeg Ffwrnes Llanelli decided to buy materials - a fan, filter card and tape - for the DIY machines, rather than shelling out on pre-made purifiers. Several schools in the county are now using them. ""I have been amazed by the excitement and enthusiasm of the children who want to learn how to keep each other safe by cleaning the air and go build the machines themselves,"" says Dr Thomas.

Spread to US Treasury,Chancellor to hold Omicron crisis talks with firms,2024-09-25,2021-12-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59681829,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is set to meet business leaders for crisis talks on Friday as firms warn of lost bookings. Fears about the Omicron variant of coronavirus have prompted many people to cancel Christmas dinners and parties, hitting businesses. Hospitality firms and business groups have told the chancellor their trading situation was deteriorating rapidly. Mr Sunak said the government would do ""whatever it takes"" to support jobs, but that funding was already available. This includes £250m that has been provided to local authorities for grants to support businesses. It is understood that Mr Sunak will meet with major UK business groups including the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), the Institute of Directors, Make UK and the Federation of Small Businesses on Friday afternoon. The BCC said it will ask the chancellor to revert VAT for hospitality and tourism business back to the emergency rate of 5%. It also wants the government to reinstate 100% business rates relief for retail ""to give businesses the financial headroom to weather this challenging period"". In addition, it will ask the Treasury to ""make additional grant funding available which can then be administered locally and distributed on a needs basis"". On Thursday Mr Sunak was in California but held a hastily convened call with representatives from business groups and companies including Greene King, Nandos and Whitbread, which owns Premier Inn. Attendees described the chancellor as being in ""listening mode"" and said Mr Sunak appreciated the situation was deteriorating rapidly. The chancellor asked what kind of assistance they were looking for, and there were specific requests for an extension of the discounted VAT rate of 12.5% beyond its scheduled end on 1 April. The participants also requested a deferral of any business rates due in the first quarter of 2022, and grants to businesses in most dire need. After Thursday's meeting, Mr Sunak flew back to the UK a day early from his US trip where he was meeting technology firms to try to encourage inward investment. Before flying, he said the situation in the UK with Omicron ""is very different to what we've done and encountered before"". ""The government is not telling people to cancel things. It's not closing down businesses."" Mr Sunak said that it is ""a difficult time for the hospitality industry"" but he said there were existing support measures in place to help the industry. ""Until spring of next year, most businesses in the hospitality industry are only paying a quarter of their normal business rates bill. They are benefiting from a reduced rate of VAT all the way through to next spring. ""And thirdly, there is about quarter of a billion pounds of cash sitting with local authorities that's been provided by government to support those businesses who need it."" He added that his immediate priority is to make sure that £250m ""gets to those businesses as quickly as possible"". The hospitality industry has warned of a devastating effect of public concern over the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. UKHospitality said pubs, bars and cafes had already seen trade drop by a third, and ""are expecting a further 22% drop in bookings for December"". Kate Nicholls, UKHospitality's chief executive, said: ""Christmas trade is always crucial for the hospitality industry, making up as much as a quarter of the year's profit for many businesses. ""Last year Christmas was cancelled and so much rested on this December period for businesses already staggering under a burden of debt incurred from the pandemic and facing rising costs across the board. ""If operators are unable to trade profitably over the next month, many will simply not survive - and those that do make it through face a return to 20% VAT in April."" She called for the government to keep VAT at 12.5%, suspend business rates payments for the first quarter of 2022, and reinstate recovery grants. The British Beer & Pub Association warned on Thursday that pubs would sell 37 million fewer pints over Christmas, losing out on £297m."
Spread to US Treasury,Nursing and home care cost models to be debated,2024-09-25,2023-06-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-65966966,"Proposals have been put forward to create a ""fairer"" system for accessing and paying for nursing, residential and home care. In July, Tynwald will be asked to support further research into two models that would either remove direct charges or cap the amount paid. The issue has been looked at by the Health and Care Transformation Team.  Health and Social Care Minister Lawrie Hooper said it was time to rethink how the care should be paid for. He said the two models being put forward were a ""mixed model"", which would see a threshold and cap on care fees paid and a ""free personal care model"" without any specific charges. Both would require people to meet their own accommodation and living costs. Under the current system, those with assets must pay for their care and much of the support offered is in a residential home setting, rather than home care. The models were originally included in a report in 2018 which outlined six potential models. Mr Hooper said although introducing a new model would cost ""tens of millions of pounds"", the current burden on individuals who needed care was ""disproportionate"". He said the proposals would see the cost ""better spread more fairly across all of us"", similarly to the approach to GP appointments and hospital care. ""Just because you get old, it doesn't mean you should be treated any less fairly,"" he added. Treasury Minister Alex Allinson, who is also on the transformation team, said now was the time to ""go forward with quite a significant reform of the way that social care is funded once we've determined that pathway"". ""Then we can see how much it will cost to get that balance between what the individual pays and what the state pays or the taxpayer pays to help them,"" he added.

Spread to US Treasury,Stock markets plunge as virus becomes a pandemic,2024-09-25,2020-03-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51841648,"Share markets in the US plummeted on Wednesday, with losses accelerating after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. The Dow Jones plunged nearly 1,500 points or more than 5.8%, while the S&P 500 fell 4.9% and Nasdaq fell 4.7%. The declines pushed the Dow more than 20% below its recent high, a threshold that often accompanies a recession. The falls come as the virus's spread has the global economy reeling. Concerns about the disease have disrupted manufacturing, prompted widespread closings and cancellations, and kept people at home. On Wednesday, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a £30bn package, while the Bank of England delivered an emergency cut in interest rates. However, the White House and Congress have yet to reach a deal for economic relief after President Donald Trump's proposal of a tax cut for workers failed to garner widespread support. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday said that the administration hoped to extend deadlines for tax payments, cover the cost of sick leave for staff forced to stay home and provide loan guarantees for affected industries, such as airlines. ""We are not only focused on the health issues, but the economic issues,"" he said. The New York branch of the US central bank also said it would inject money into the financial system by making more overnight loans available to banks, its second such move this week. The Fed last week made its first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis in an effort to keep money flowing. The moves come as the spread of the virus, despite hopes of containment, has rapidly reset expectations for global growth this year. On Wednesday, economists at IHS Markit said global growth was likely to slow to 1.7% this year, down from the 2.5% it forecast last month. The firm warned that the outbreak was likely to push Europe, which was already experiencing low growth, into recession and reduce US growth to 1.8%. ""The global spread of the COVID-19 epidemic is the single biggest risk facing the world economy in early 2020,"" the firm said. Earlier, London's FTSE 100 slid 1.4%, while European indexes saw more modest declines. Those falls follow several weeks of market turmoil. The 20% decline of the Dow has pushed it into bear market territory, ending a streak of gains that started in 2009. ""It is not the virus itself, but rather the fear and panic related to the virus and the associated altered economic behaviour that could be a damaging tipping point, forcing the global economy onto a darker path,"" said Katrina Ell, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics. Markets have also been slammed this week by a plunge in oil prices, after oil exporters said they would increase output rather than make coordinated cuts. On Wednesday, oil prices were down more than 3%. On the Dow, the biggest drag was US planemaker Boeing, which fell more than 18%.  The firm has been in crisis since the crashes of two of its 737 Max planes, which have since been grounded globally for about a year. On Wednesday, it reported 46 cancellations, which were not made up by new orders.  It is also reportedly freezing hiring and being forced to draw on a $13.8bn (£10.7bn) loan, in part because of the coronavirus."
Spread to US Treasury,Wagner - built by blood and treasure in Africa,2024-09-25,2023-08-26,By Dr Alex Vines,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-66614766,"Cradling a rifle, dressed in a military uniform and with a desert in the background, Yevgeny Prigozhin had a message for Africa. His Wagner group of mercenaries was ""making Russia even greater on every continent - and Africa even more free"". ""Justice and happiness for the African nations,"" he declared.  The video, thought to be recorded in Mali, was released on Monday. Two days later, the Wagner leader was reported to have died in a plane crash in Russia. What now for his purported mission in Africa? Wagner has been active in several countries on the continent - most notably the Central African Republic (CAR) and Mali. But for many African governments, Prigozhin's announced death is a relief. I would argue that his operatives did not spread freedom, and foreign mercenaries are an embarrassment for many states - Prigozhin was a reminder of a painful past.  At the height of the Cold War, and especially shortly after independence on the continent, mercenaries were regularly used to influence the civil wars and violence that followed.  Col Callan in Angola; Bob Denard in Congo's Katanga and later the Comoros; ""Mad"" Mike Hoare in Katanga and later the Seychelles; American Robert Mackenzie in Sierra Leone and British Simon Mann's failed ""organised regime change"" mission in Equatorial Guinea in 2004: all these are uncomfortable history. When I discussed Prigozhin with Russian African analysts in Moscow in late 2019, they reminded me that for them, he was less of the above, but more akin to the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes, who was out to make a fortune, and that I should not be judgmental, given the UK's history.  Prigozhin's Wagner footprint in Africa was built on blood and treasure - contracts giving access to valuable resources were made in payment for military support. I had witnessed similar Private Military Companies (PMCs) in action some 20-plus years ago: Sandline International in Sierra Leone and Executive Outcomes in Angola.  They provided security and training in exchange for payment in management of mines, oil and other natural resource endowments.  Their success dramatically varied, depending on the client and the contract.   There is nothing unique about Wagner and its operational behaviour in Africa.  When I met with some of its operatives in Moscow in 2019, they were traumatised and seeking compensation for a mission in Mozambique that went badly wrong.  This was the antithesis to the Prigozhin-funded movie Granit that premiered on the pro-Kremlin NTV channel in December 2022. It depicted a group of Russian hero ""military instructors"" invited to Mozambique to fight Islamic State-linked insurgents in the country's north. Its operations in Libya, Sudan, Mali and CAR have produced mixed results.  Wagner's greatest military success is probably acting as a Praetorian guard for the presidency and foiling a military coup in CAR's capital, Bangui.  Its greatest failure: possibly in Mozambique. Wagner deployed there in September 2019 for counter-insurgency operations, but the killing of seven of its personnel and 20 Mozambican special forces in October in a friendly fire exchange resulted in their withdrawal in early 2020.  Wagner's investments in fake news and trolling, encouraging deeper anti-Western sentiment in West Africa, have been more successful than its efforts to win elections in Madagascar, Mozambique or Zambia. It is currently most militarily active in Sudan and Mali.  Wagner has had a presence in Sudan since 2017, providing security services and overseeing gold mining concessions.  The US Treasury Department alleges that Wagner has also been supplying Sudan's Rapid Support Forces with surface-to-air missiles recently.  In September 2021, the Malian junta struck a security agreement with Wagner for the deployment of 1,000 personnel at a monthly cost of $10.8m (£8.6m). The Wagner Group's counter-terrorism performance has been underwhelming and there are allegations of serious human rights abuses by them, especially in central Mali.  Although the group's deployment in Mali has provoked criticism from the region and the African Union (AU), Wagner still sought to expand its operations to Burkina Faso.  An offer in late 2022 was rejected, but Russia continues to woo the junta, whose leader Captain Ibrahim Traore attended the second Russia-Africa summit in St Petersburg in July this year. Burkina Faso is one of six African countries to receive free grain from Moscow.  Soon after the September 2022 coup in Burkina Faso that resulted in Capt Traore taking over the military government, Prigozhin described him as ""a truly courageous son of the motherland"".  The Wagner leader also hailed Niger's military coup in July this year as good news and offered his fighters' services to bring order. But in the wake of his failed uprising in Russia in June, Wagner's grip on its African operations was under threat. According to President Vladimir Putin, Prigozhin had returned to Russia from Africa on the day of his death and had gone to meet Russian officials in Moscow. It seems he may have been trying to preserve his Wagner Africa portfolio from full Kremlin takeover.  Mr Putin described Prigozhin as a talented person.  ""[He] worked in our country, but also abroad, in Africa. He worked with oil, gas, with precious metals,"" the president said. Pan-African dismay about mercenaries began as soon as they became active in the decolonisation conflicts of the 1960s. In 1977, the African Convention on Mercenarism was signed in Libreville and took effect in April 1985.  In February 2022, the African Union's commissioner for political affairs, peace and security, Bankole Adeoye, called for the ""complete exclusion of mercenaries from the African continent"". These conventions may be ineffective, but an increasing number of African governments do not want a repeat of the use of foreign mercenaries on African soil to pursue geopolitical rivalries of external powers that occurred during the Cold War.  Mozambique discovered that the use of private military contractors was not so effective and turned to Rwanda for assistance.  Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi concluded that an effective, disciplined military was needed to assist his own armed forces, and the Rwandan Defence Forces (RDF) has been successful, significantly reducing the insurgency.  The worsening security situation across the Sahel also resulted in Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, along with West African allies, drawing up plans for the strengthening of a regional standby force - in effect, a regional counter-terrorism and anti-coup force.  The African-led and designed security initiatives are an explicit rejection of mercenaries. But for those military governments in the region, in Mali, Burkina Faso and now Niger, the Russian operatives may be an attractive alternative. Wagner, if it survives, or other emerging Russian mercenary groups, will increasingly find the market limited to putschist regimes using them as the security partner of last resort.  The Kremlin, which will not desert the likes of CAR and Mali, is likely to try to take over operations, but its ability to seriously take on new clients, as Prigozhin had envisioned, will be difficult.  This is the moment for African leaders to truly implement African solutions to African problems, by implementing its conventions and building up institutions and credible, accountable security forces. Alex Vines directs the Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank."
Spread to US Treasury,Tory MPs demand answers on Christmas Covid plans,2024-09-25,2021-12-21,By Jennifer Scott,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-59739695,"Tory MPs are demanding answers from Boris Johnson over whether he plans to introduce new Covid restrictions ahead of the Christmas holidays. The PM held a two-hour meeting with his cabinet on Monday to talk about the spread of the new Omicron variant. But after the lengthy discussions, he did not reveal any new measures. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said on Tuesday that the government was ""keeping the situation under constant review, but can't rule anything out"". Many in the Conservative Party have been voicing their frustration over the lack of detail from Downing Street, alongside their scepticism of the need for tougher restrictions.  Tory MP Mark Harper, a former government chief whip, said it was ""unacceptable"" not to tell the public what was going on. It is also understood that many in cabinet remain unconvinced that new measures are needed without further evidence on the impact of Omicron. But the UK is facing record Covid cases and some scientists are warning the government needs to act early to prevent a wave of infections in the coming months.  MPs from across the House of Commons will be briefed on the latest data by England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance at 18:00 GMT.  For once it was a ""genuine discussion"" at cabinet about what to do next.  Several ministers made it clear they're not convinced the data currently justifies closing businesses and inflicting another hit on the economy. They want to wait for more evidence that Omicron is as severe as previous variants. Some would accept more guidance on social distancing, rather than changes in the law, and point to recent behavioural change that proves people can be trusted to make their own choices.  They emphasised that with a successful vaccine programme the country isn't in the same situation as it was last year, and they want to set an ""incredibly high bar"" for more restrictions.  On the other side are those like the health secretary who feel it's time to look beyond the modelling at what's actually happening in London's hospitals.  What does the PM think? He chose not to act immediately, but that might not last long.  There could come a moment quite soon when Boris Johnson will have to confront his cabinet and his party.  The PM would not say on Monday if any action would be taken ahead of Christmas, but told reporters the government ""reserve the possibility of taking further action to protect the public"".  Pushed again over whether there would be new restrictions this week, Mr Sunak said: ""I absolutely appreciate people's frustration with all of this [but] I refer people to the prime minister's words."" He added: ""Unfortunately we're just dealing with an enormous amount of uncertainty at the moment."" Labour has joined the calls for more clarity, with shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, saying ""public health has to be the top consideration"", not ""internal political considerations inside the Conservative Party"". He told the BBC: ""The big question on people's minds is can the PM take the decisions necessary... or is he now such a prisoner of Tory divisions that he can't put public health first because he's too worried about what will get past his cabinet and what will get past his backbenchers?"" On Monday, a further 91,743 Covid cases were reported across the UK - the second highest daily total on record. The high case numbers have meant many people are now off work and self-isolating, while others have cancelled bookings or events to try to avoid becoming infected in the run-up to Christmas The government has urged people to be ""cautious"" as infections rise, but stopped short of introducing tougher restrictions since it passed its Plan B measures last week - including Covid passes for certain large venues.  Those measures, however, led to a lot of anger in the Conservative Party and 100 backbench MPs rebelled on the vote, which only passed after Labour supported it.  Now some of those same MPs are concerned the government is planning to introduce even tougher restrictions and are frustrated with the wait to find out.  Mr Harper tweeted: ""Not telling the public what's going on is unacceptable. These are big decisions affecting everyone's lives, people's livelihoods and mental wellbeing across the country. ""We all deserve to see the data Ministers see. Show us your workings."" His Conservative colleague, Dehenna Davison, also called for answers, tweeting: ""In the last two days, I've had pubs and restaurants contact me asking if they should place food and drinks orders.  ""I've had emails from people asking if they should postpone their wedding for the [fifth] time, or if they can see their mum on Christmas. ""We really need some certainty."" Veteran backbencher Peter Bone said Parliament should be recalled at this ""critical time"" for MPs to ""scrutinise the government over the current Covid situation and whether there are to be new restrictions or not"".  Cabinet Office Minister Steve Barclay said the PM had ""given a commitment"" that if new regulations were needed, Parliament would be recalled, but he told BBC Breakfast: ""We are not at that stage."" Mr Barclay was asked repeatedly whether new measures could be introduced in before Christmas, but while he accepted there was ""uncertainty"", he would not say either way.  Instead, he said: ""We are looking very closely [at the data], particularly at the London hospital admissions. ""But at the same time we have got to recognise there are very severe economic consequences to further restrictions. ""There is a balance to be struck between protecting lives and livelihoods and that is why we are looking so closely at this data."" Mr Barclay also urged businesses to ""continue to plan for the bookings they have"". And Mr Sunak announced additional support for UK firms to get through the uncertain period, including one-off grants of up to £6,000 per premises and £30m of additional cash for the Culture Recovery Fund."
Spread to US Treasury,FTSE 100 surges after US stocks bounce back,2024-09-25,2020-03-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51713271,"European markets have climbed for a second day on hopes that governments and central banks will intervene to tackle the economic hit of coronavirus. The FTSE 100 climbed more than 2% in London and there were similar gains on other European markets.  The Dow Jones in New York surged by 5.1% on Monday, although Japanese shares closed 1.2% lower on Tuesday. The rebounds follow the worst week for major stock markets since the 2008 financial crisis. The G7 is expected to release a statement later today or tomorrow as policymakers struggle to respond to the global spread of the  virus, but there are concerns that it may not mention any new government spending or coordinated interest rate cuts. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, likened the group to a ""fiscal version of the Avengers"" superheroes. He said even that the announcement of the G7 action plan ""was enough to point markets in the right direction"". Investors have been worried about the impact of the coronavirus as it spreads outside of China. Already, the outbreak has led to travel restrictions, manufacturing shortages and reduced shopper demand in some countries.  On Tuesday, Australia's central bank cut interest rates to record lows, in what is expected to be the first in a spate of stimulus measures around the world to fight the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe said: ""The board took this decision to support the economy as it responds to the global coronavirus outbreak."" US President Donald Trump seized on the opportunity to encourage the US Federal Reserve to ""cut rate big"".  The Bank of England said on Monday that it continued to monitor developments and is assessing its potential impacts on the global and UK economies and financial systems. ""The Bank is working closely with HM Treasury and the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) - as well as our international partners - to ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability,"" a Bank spokesman said. The European Central Bank said it was ""closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economy, medium-term inflation and the transmission of our monetary policy. We stand ready to take appropriate and targeted measures, as necessary and commensurate with the underlying risks.""  The US Federal Reserve put out a similar statement last week. The comments come as economic groups revise growth forecasts to account for the virus. On Monday, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) also said it expected growth of just 2.4% in 2020, down from 2.9% in November and warned that a longer ""more intensive"" outbreak could halve growth to 1.5%."
Spread to US Treasury,UK research chief 'will not direct science',2024-09-25,2017-07-04,By Pallab Ghosh,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40484776,"Britain's new research chief has said that he won't centrally direct scientific research. Prof Sir Mark Walport will be responsible for all public research spending in Britain next year. In an exclusive interview with BBC News, Prof Walport said that he wants to be a ""powerful voice for science"" in dealing with government. In the first interview in his new role, he sets out his vision for the new research agency he heads. Currently, UK research is funded by nine separate organisations. Each body specialises in specific fields, such as environmental research, the physical science and the biosciences.  The system has contributed to Britain leading the world in many areas of research. The government is replacing it with the United Kingdom Research and Innovation agency (UKRI), which will oversee and co-ordinate the work of the research organisations when it formally takes control on 1 April 2018.  But as its new chief executive, Prof Walport - currently the government's chief scientist - is already working to ensure that the new agency hits the ground running. Critics of the reform fear that the ""super research council"" will direct research centrally and be driven by economic priorities and the whims of ministers - rather than support the best curiosity-driven research as the current system allows and encourages. Prof Walport told me that these fears were ""completely wrong"". ""We are going to continue to support the brightest minds to tackle the problems as they see them,"" he told BBC News.  ""Our job quite simply is to help the scientific community tackle the whole range of fundamental questions. It simply wouldn't be to anyone at the top of UKRI to pose the questions."" Prof Walport said the individual councils will stay and have a high degree of autonomy. And he pledged to appoint ""the strongest people"" to lead them.  So if the research councils are going to be left to get on with what they already do so well, why add an extra layer of bureaucracy? Quite simply, it was because the Treasury was sceptical of what it saw as an uncoordinated research funding system with no strategic oversight or coordinated planning.  The creation of UKRI has already been a success in this respect. Reassured by the restructuring, the Prime Minister announced an extra £4.7bn for research spread over four years. In 2020, Prof Walport will have a total of £8bn to spend.  But he will be under pressure to deliver, so the investment from the Treasury continues. He tells me his aim is to make the UK funding system ""the best in the world"", one fit for purpose in the 21st Century. ""By bringing it all together under the umbrella of UKRI we can have a powerful voice for research and innovation at a time when we really need that voice with the global challenges the world faces,"" he said. ""It's about having a strong voice representing those (research) communities that have so much to offer to society in terms of solving societal problems."" A key role for UKRI will be to get researchers out of their silos and encourage scientists from different fields to work together. Another is to help deliver the government's industrial strategy which aims to focus efforts on areas of scientific and technological strength for the benefit of the economy. And one of the main challenges Prof Walport will face is the impact of Brexit. British universities employ about 30,000 scientists from EU countries and in collaboration with small businesses, receive £850m in research grants each year from the European Union.  Prof Walport says that he takes heart from the fact that the Prime Minster has on several occasions said that she appreciates the importance of UK science. ""There is no doubt about the vitality of our future research and innovation infrastructure depends on having the most skilled people from wherever they come,"" he told BBC News. ""I think that that is a message that is well recognised by government. Our job is to provide the support and the leadership and the mechanisms to enable us to remain at the forefront which we will do by remaining very global in our outlook. ""We have to have the confidence that there will be a solution that recognises that research and innovation are international activities."" Prof Walport was also keen to stress that the new agency includes the Arts and Humanities Research Council whose ideas he hopes the other research councils will draw on. The acronym ""Stem"" is used to describe activities in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics. Prof Walport said: ""The Industrial Revolution was driven by the steam engine. And I think that this industrial revolution is driven by ""Steam"" as well by which I mean science, technology, engineering arts and mathematics.  ""And if you think what it is that makes modern technology usable is the sort of design element. So if you put all that together, then the opportunity [exists] to strengthen what's already a very strong research and innovation mechanism in the UK. That means getting the synergies and making the whole greater than the sum of the parts."" Follow Pallab on Twitter"
Spread to US Treasury,How furlough can you go?,2024-09-25,2020-05-05,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-52541640,"It's proving quite easy to spend a gobsmacking amount of money to keep the economy from collapse.  It's more problematic to lend it by the tens of billions. It will almost certainly prove more difficult again to stop splashing government moola. Applying the brakes to the spending, while firing up the boilers on the battered British economy, is now where the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has turned his attention. He's looking at the bills for the Job Retention Scheme, or furloughing, which now covers nearly quarter of employed workers. That's 6.3 million pay packets the Treasury is having to flood, in reverse, through the PAYE system. The number of self-employed people, on a different income support scheme, is yet to become clear. And 1.8 million more people have applied for Universal Credit since the health and economy crisis began. Furloughing is, by a long way, the element of support for both firms and individuals that has been most welcomed. But it's still got problems and holes in it.  The Scottish Tourism Alliance has just published a survey showing half of its respondents are using it, and only 22% of firms in the sector say it works well for them. Yet however critical they are of the dates for qualifying or any complexity in admin, they know there would and will be a lot of pain without it. Asked last month, and looking to the removal of furlough payments, the tourism survey by TRKR found 47% of firms won't be able to employ any staff at all.  One question that raises: if the future is bound to involve redundancy, is it good use of borrowed government funds only to be putting off that date? But such expectations could be confounded if the exit from furlough is well designed and implemented. With business and trade unions asked to comment on draft plans for the ways in which businesses can reopen, one theme running through their responses is that spending taps cannot simply be turned off at the end of June, when the furlough and self-employed schemes are currently due to end. And Mr Sunak gets what they're saying. On Monday, he told ITV News: ""There will be no cliff edge to the furlough scheme. I am working to figure out the most effective way to wind down the scheme and ease people back into work in a measured way.  ""But some scenarios have suggested we are potentially spending as much on the furlough scheme as we do on the NHS, for example. Now clearly that is not a sustainable situation."" (The Chancellor did not say this to ITV's partner on Channel 3, STV News. Had he linked to the Glasgow newsroom, he would have found that John MacKay, its lead anchorman and the face of the station has... been furloughed. Strange times.) So exit from furlough will have to be tapered, and for several reasons. One is that people are being asked to take a leap off the rescue boat, and back into some extremely choppy waters. To go from 80% of usual income into a dark void of income uncertainty is a big ask. Workers do not know the health risks they may face back at work. They may face future illness as infection continues to spread. With contact tracing now being put in place, we may get a call from a stranger, telling us to go into isolation for 14 days. How is our boss going to feel about that? Those who rely on contracts from other businesses will find many of those clients shell-shocked and unwilling to commit to new spending.  Where customers are the public, they are being told to be very cautious until there's a vaccine, and that's probably a long way off. The other reason for tapering the furlough is to allow employees to do some work. Unlike the self-employed, those on furlough payments are barred from doing anything for their employer. When the time comes to crank up the office, numerous changes will be required to manage the use of space and impose social distancing.   A lot of yellow tape will be applied to workplace floors to manage one-way flows and keep people two metres apart. Personal protective equipment will have to be sourced in advance, with supply chains stretched tight. None of that can be done in advance of a restart by staff who are not allowed to work. And there's another risk of furlough being withdrawn too quickly: some companies will move from furlough straight to redundancy. A careful government policy should seek to minimise that, with tapering and perhaps other incentives to employers. Can and will it be done differently in Scotland and England? That question betrays the default position of a pre-Covid-19 mindset. Yes, it could be done differently. Nicola Sturgeon has said there are good ideas in Whitehall's draft guidelines for easing people back to work, but the first minister also raised trade union concerns that should be addressed: about workplace health precautions being ""considered"" rather than mandated. The Scottish government will consult on the guidelines/rules, and can adapt them as necessary. But this is not merely familiar tension between Holyrood and Westminster. ""Unlockdown"", as the prime minister is reported to call the process, could also be done differently around the regions of England. In a paper published in London last week, the Institute for Government pointed out that a regional approach has been tried in South Korea and Japan, and now in Italy. By lifting restrictions in different regions and nations, it allows the path of infection to be tracked, to see what works best. But the institute also points out the risk of confusing the public with a more complex message. There will have to be some thought given to travel restrictions between high-restriction and low-restriction areas. And a big complication is how continued support for furlough costs in one part of the UK would be funded, while there's withdrawal from another part. The divergence will likely be between sectors of the economy. Outdoor work has been flagged up as being at the front of the queue, while hospitality looks likely to be among the last to start trading under the ""new normal"". And there could be demographic divergence. Can all those aged over 70 continue to face incarceration when the state of their health varies so much? Can children - who may yet be proven to have lower infection rates, and less dire escalation of symptoms - be given the opportunity to choose a ""bubble"" of friends for play as well as learning, so long as they stick to the same bubble members? As young adults may be at less risk from the virus and at more risk than other groups from the economic impact on their finances and job prospects, can they be given priority for relaxed rules? And if it's true that women are less susceptible to the life-threatening complications from Covid-19 that afflict men, could there be an easing of restrictions on women without men? I wouldn't bet on it. It's clear that whichever route is taken - and there could be several such divergences around the UK at one time - the increased complexity risks not only confusion, but a sense of unfairness. And if people don't feel the application of rules is reasonable or fair, that's where the surprisingly high levels of compliance in phase one could be undermined in subsequent phases. The Institute for Government points out that it will not be sufficient simply to withdraw restrictions, as if economic activity will naturally and quickly flow back into the space occupied by constraints. It won't. For those reasons of stickiness of purchasing decisions by both business clients and consumers, there will also be a requirement on Rishi Sunak to stimulate activity. As well as spending, there are tax levers available. Companies could be incentivised to invest in anti-infection measures around workplaces, which will be an added cost to cash-strapped firms.  Or consumer choices can be stimulated. VAT cuts targeted at specific sectors of consumer goods, for instance?  In Germany, there's already been an announcement that VAT will have a temporary cut for restaurant meals starting in July. It gives customers and restaurateurs something to book and look forward to. To boost rehiring of people, one controversial idea from the Institute of Government report is holding back on further increases to the legislated minimum wage, though this would be at a time when low-paid key workers have won a lot of public sympathy. And could there be a car scrappage scheme, similar to the one we had 11 years ago to help jump-start the economy out of the financial crunch, but weighted heavily towards low-emission vehicles? In the USA, it was known as ""cash for clunkers"". This could hit the twin objectives of stimulating the economy while lowering emissions from the nation's fleet of vehicles. Relaxing the rules will have to be complex as well as cautious. It will require encouragement and incentives, and the continuation of a very large bill for government."
Spread to US Treasury,Cult musician Daniel Johnston dies,2024-09-25,2019-09-12,By Mark Savage,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-49673013,"Daniel Johnston, whose guileless, homemade recordings inspired dozens of musicians from Kurt Cobain to Lana Del Rey, has died at the age of 58. The songwriter and artist ""passed away of natural causes"" at his home in Texas, said his family in a statement. He was mourned online by those he inspired, including musician Beck and film star Elijah Wood, who called him ""a gentle, beautiful treasure"". Producer Jack Antonoff praised the way Johnston had ""shared fearlessly"". Born in California in 1961 and raised in West Virginia, Johnston became known as a songwriter after moving to Austin, Texas.  His reputation in the city grew after he started handing out cassette tapes of his no-frills home recordings to people in the street. A cult figure on the local music scene, he gained wider exposure when MTV filmed a programme on the Austin music scene in 1985 for its series The Cutting Edge.  Johnston's performance brought him almost overnight acclaim, and his early home recordings received a belated vinyl release on the indie label Homestead. He was never an accomplished player, and his pinched, high tenor vocals ensured he would never be a mainstream star - but the aching emotional sincerity of songs Life In Vain and True Love Will Find You In The End, earned him a fiercely loyal fanbase. Kurt Cobain once described him as ""the best songwriter on earth,"" and famously wore one of Johnston's t-shirts to the 1992 MTV Awards. Other musicians who have covered Johnston's songs include Pearl Jam, Tom Waits, Wilco, Death Cab for Cutie, Sufjan Stevens and Yo La Tengo. In 2013, Lana Del Rey and rapper Mac Miller each contributed $10,000 to fund a short film about the singer, with Del Rey recording a version of his song about heartbreak, Some Things Last A Long Time for the soundtrack. Johnston was also known as an artist and comic-book writer, and his magic marker cartoon drawings were an inspiration for The Simpsons' creator Matt Groening.  In 1993, he was asked to turn Jeremiah the Innocent, the alien frog featured on the cover of his album Hi, How Are You, into a mural in Austin.  In 2006, his artwork was featured in a major exhibition at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art. But Johnston was plagued by mental health problems, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, that hindered his career and endangered his life - including one incident where he attempted to crash a plane being piloted by his father. A harrowing documentary, The Devil and Daniel Johnston, released in 2005, showed how fragile he had become, while bringing his music and story to a new audience. ""It sure was embarrassing,"" Johnston reflected in an interview with the Austin Chronicle. ""Every terrible dilemma, every fabled mistake. Nothing I can do about it now, though. I wish they'd added a laugh track to it, because it sure is funny"". Johnston's own musical output had slowed in recent years and, following a farewell tour in 2017, he was largely confined to the family home. His brother, Dick Johnston, told the New York Times he had been treated for kidney issues shortly before his death.  ""He was still productive, writing songs and drawing, and was just annoyed by his health more than anything,"" he said. ""It was just one thing after another."" In a statement posted on Facebook, Johnston's family remembered him as ""a friend to all"".  ""Although he struggled with mental health issues for much of his adult life, Daniel triumphed over his illness through his prolific output of art and songs.  ""He inspired countless fans, artists, and songwriters with his message that no matter how dark the day that ""the sun shines down on me"" and ""true love will find you in the end."" As news of his death spread, fans laid flowers and cassettes at the foot of his mural in Austin, while musicians and fellow creators spoke of Johnston's impact on their life. ""There are not enough words I can say about the vitality of Daniel Johnston's musical spirit,"" said musician Zola Jesus. ""He was a huge inspiration to me, to follow my creative impulses no matter how messy or simple."" Indie band Death Cab For Cutie, who covered Johnston's song Dream Scream, wrote that their ""hearts were heavy"". ""His unique songwriting voice, so pure and so direct, spoke to us deeply,"" they continued. ""It is quite safe to say there will never be another like him and thankfully, his music will play on."" David Bowie's son, Duncan Jones, tweeted: ""My dad introduced me to Daniel Johnston's music... Once I'd listened to a few songs, I heard the DNA of so many others' work. A unique and special human being. Rest peacefully, Daniel."" ""Rest in peace... Living your broken dreams forever,"" added Avengers star Mark Ruffalo on Twitter. ""Thank you for your art."" Johnston's family said plans for a memorial will be announced soon. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
Spread to US Treasury,Parties in final campaign push as election nears,2024-09-25,2019-12-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50701824,"The main political party leaders are continuing to push their election pledges to voters, as the campaign enters its final few days. Conservative leader Boris Johnson says in an open letter that Thursday's poll is ""historic"" and a choice to ""move forwards"" after Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was a ""chance to vote for hope"" and he had ""the most ambitious plan to transform our country in decades"". The UK goes to the polls on Thursday. Ahead of this, the candidates are travelling around the country in a bid to spread their election messages. Among the manifesto pledges being highlighted by the main UK parties on Sunday are: Meanwhile, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is warning that ""the very future of Scotland"" is at stake in the election. She is appealing to voters to back her party ""to escape Brexit, protect the NHS, and to put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands"". And Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson told Sky News her party was looking to make ""real progress"" by increasing its number of MPs on Thursday. She added: ""We will be absolutely working to stop Brexit, doing so in a co-operative way with others who share our values and share that goal."" In his letter to voters published in the Mail on Sunday, Mr Johnson says the election will be one that ""shapes future decades"", urging voters to create a ""working Conservative majority government that will get Brexit done, end the uncertainty and allow Britain to move on"". The Conservatives have released some details about how their points-based immigration system would work.  Writing in the Sunday Express, Home Secretary Priti Patel, said it would start in January 2021 and aimed to ""attract the best talent that our country and economy needs, while reducing overall numbers"". There would be fast-track entry to the UK for entrepreneurs and some people working for the NHS, and sector-specific schemes for low or unskilled workers to meet labour market shortages. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Johnson declined to say if he would resign if he failed to win a majority in the House of Commons. He said: ""What I'm going to do is concentrate on the five days before us, because that is what I think the people of this country would expect."" In the same interview, the prime minister insisted there would not be any checks for goods travelling from Northern Ireland to Great Britain under his Brexit deal. A leaked Treasury analysis document was ""wrong"" to suggest this would be the case, he said. And in a short speech at the Conservative Party's headquarters, Mr Johnson warned his supporters that the ""horses can still change places"" in the final week of the campaign, saying: ""This is a close-fought election."" Meanwhile, Labour is restating its plan to help alleviate pressure in social care through the introduction of free personal care for older people.  The party says its new funding will help working-age adults and pensioners with care costs, which will also be capped under the proposals. According to the King's Fund, providing free personal care would require an additional £6bn on top of planned spending by 2020-21, taking the social care budget to roughly £26bn. Labour is also talking about its own research on the issue, which it says shows 9,290 people have approached their local authority since April 2017 for help with care costs after draining their savings. At a rally at Bangor University in north Wales, Mr Corbyn attacked ""cruel"" Universal Credit - which his party has said it would scrap. He also repeated his pledge to compensate so-called Waspi women, who lost out on years of state pension payments when the retirement age was raised under the coalition government. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that Labour would ""transform our economy"" if it won a parliamentary majority at the election. He added: ""I want to make sure our economy works for everybody... It means transforming capitalism into a new form."" Mr Johnson says he wants to focus on people's priorities, including urgent investment in the NHS and action on the cost of living. Speaking ahead of the last stretch on the campaign trail, Mr Corbyn said Mr Johnson ""cannot be trusted to deliver Brexit, or anything else"". He said Labour would ""rescue"" the NHS and ""get Brexit sorted"". Elsewhere, the Lib Dems said their plans would ""address the historic investment disparities between our nations and regions"". Its plans would boost railway electrification, increase the availability of charging points for electric vehicles and improve broadband access, the party added. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Ed Davey said: ""Neither Labour or the Tories can square their spending promises today with the cost of Brexit. They are writing promises on cheques that will bounce. ""Every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Brexit so we can invest billions across the UK, helping to tackle ingrained inequality."" On the campaign trail in Sheffield, Liberal Democrat leader Ms Swinson also encouraged her supporters to make a final push for votes, telling them: ""When you wake up and deliver those 'good mornings' when there's frost on the ground, I want you to know that everything that you do will make that difference."""
Spread to US Treasury,Wales' first minister urges caution at Christmas,2024-09-25,2021-11-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-59454824,"The first minister has urged people to ""think carefully"" about whether to meet vulnerable relatives over Christmas. Mark Drakeford said people must ""take precautions"" amid concerns over the Omicron variant of coronavirus. A senior official said it was inevitable it would be found in Wales. It comes as Welsh ministers are considering whether further restrictions are needed, but Mr Drakeford said there were no plans to close businesses.  On Monday he and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for everyone arriving in the UK to have to isolate for eight days. But that was rejected by Downing Street. Six Omicron cases were found in Scotland on Monday, taking the UK total to 11. Four of the cases in Scotland were identified in Lanarkshire, as well as two in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde areas. Two cases in Nottingham and Essex have been linked to travel to southern Africa.  The third person confirmed to have the new variant is no longer in the UK, but had visited Westminster. Early evidence suggests Omicron has a higher re-infection risk than previous variants, but it is not yet known how it impacts the effectiveness of vaccines. Boosters should be offered to over-18s to help stop a possible Covid wave driven by the Omicron variant, UK government advisers have said. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) wants the minimum gap between the second dose and booster to be cut to three months. It said boosters should be given to the most vulnerable first. The JCVI wants those aged 12-15 to be invited for a second jab three months after their first. It recommended severely immunosuppressed people should be offered a fourth dose of the vaccine as a booster. They are currently receiving three jabs. In a statement Health Minister Eluned Morgan backed the advice. ""All individuals who are eligible for a booster will automatically receive an invitation to attend an appointment when it is their turn,"" she said, adding that there will be a ""significant number of vaccination appointments issuing over the coming weeks"". Recent Covid figures in Wales show a continuing downward trend, with cases at 490 per 100,000 people over the past seven days. Nine more deaths were reported on Monday, bringing the total to 6,391. There were 567 patients with Covid in hospital beds in Wales on Friday, down from 653 the previous week, with 47 patients being ventilated in critical care beds - down from 57.  Ms Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford wrote to the prime minister on Monday calling for an emergency Cobra meeting as soon as possible. ""The emergence of Omicron poses a potential threat to the UK,"" they said. ""We need to work collectively - and effectively - as four nations to take all reasonable steps to control the ingress of the virus to the country and then to limit its spread."" They said the day eight PCR test for travellers arriving in the UK should be reinstated, ""requiring isolation for that whole period"". The pair also called for business support schemes to be funded by the UK government's Treasury ""in the event more interventionist measures are required"". ""We do not want to be in a position again where our public health interventions are negatively impacted by a lack of financial support, but can be switched on as required for England,"" they said. Downing Street responded saying it does not have plans to introduce the requirement for passengers to take a PCR test on day eight as well as day two on their return to the UK. The prime minister's spokesman said: ""We believe the approach we've taken is the proportionate one to the evidence we currently have available. ""Introducing further isolation and testing requirements would have a detrimental effect on the travel industry and those planning to go travelling.""  He added ministers were not planning to change their approach with regards to the furlough scheme either.  Health Minister Eluned Morgan told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme that ministers would discuss whether Wales will need stricter measures ""over the next few days"", including whether to close schools earlier for Christmas. Mark Drakeford later said that there are no plans to close businesses - despite the call for financial support from the Treasury. He said people should approach Christmas ""in the way that we've advised all the way through"". ""Christmas should be different this year. Christmas should be better this year. ""That doesn't mean that people should neglect those simple things that we can do in our own lives, that still help to protect ourselves and others. ""Those simple precautions: think about vulnerable people, if members of your family are particularly likely to suffer from coronavirus - think carefully about whether you visit them or involve them in your plans. ""Take a lateral flow test if you're going to visit somewhere where you might be at risk or others are at risk wear masks in crowded public places."" Dr Atherton said it is a ""matter of buying time"" with the new variant, saying it was a case of when not if the variant will be identified. ""Our best line of defence against this still is vaccines and social distancing, those things that we know keep us safe because they can reduce the transmission of this new variant in the community whilst we understand the implications of it."" ""My expectation is that this will probably take off, we will see cases in Wales - we haven't seen any yet but I do expect us to see cases, they will probably increase. ""And my anxiety is also about January and February next year, because it does take time for these things to take off."" ""The Omicron variant does give us further cause for concern and the reason for that is that there's so much that's unknown.  ""We don't know whether it will lead to more harm than the Delta variety and if it does then hospital rates could go up. So we just need to be cautious for the moment, not to throw caution to the wind"". Ten countries in southern Africa are now on the UK's travel red list, meaning that until further notice, any British or Irish residents arriving in the UK after recently visiting any of those countries will have to quarantine in an approved hotel for 10 days.  Residents from the countries themselves will not be allowed into the UK until the red list status changes. Under new measures, which came into force at 04:00 GMT, everyone entering the UK from abroad must take a PCR test and isolate, pending a negative result.  Masks will also be made compulsory again in shops and on public transport in England.  Face coverings are already mandatory in shops, health and social care settings and on public transport in Wales."
Spread to US Treasury,Indian Prime Minister Modi Twitter account hacked,2024-09-25,2020-09-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54007995,"Twitter has said that an account for the personal website of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been hacked. A series of tweets were sent from the account asking followers to donate cryptocurrency to a relief fund. Twitter said it was aware of the activity and had taken steps to secure the compromised account. This is the latest high-profile Twitter security breach after similar attacks in July on US presidential hopeful Joe Biden and Tesla founder Elon Musk. The account, with more than 2.5m followers, is the official Twitter handle for Mr Modi's personal website. His personal Twitter account, which was unaffected by this incident, has more than 61m followers. ""We are actively investigating the situation. At this time, we are not aware of additional accounts being impacted,"" a Twitter spokeswoman told the BBC in an emailed statement. The tweets, which have now been taken down, asked followers to donate cryptocurrency to the PM National Relief Fund. Less than two months ago Twitter said 130 accounts had been targeted in a major cyber-attack of celebrity accounts. But only a ""small subset"" of those 130 accounts had control seized by the attacker. The security breach saw accounts including those of Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Kanye West and Bill Gates tweet a Bitcoin scam to millions of followers. The FBI was called in to investigate. The apparent scam spread to mainstream celebrity accounts such as Kim Kardashian West and those of corporations Apple and Uber. Attackers were able to bypass the accounts' security because they had gained access to Twitter's own internal administration tools. Twitter said: ""Since the attack, we've significantly limited access to our internal tools and systems to ensure ongoing account security while we complete our investigation."" Despite it being obvious to many that it was a scam, the hackers received hundreds of transfers, worth more than $100,000 (£75,000). Cryptocurrencies are extremely hard to trace and the account the cyber-criminals used had quickly been emptied."
Spread to US Treasury,£1.2bn for Scotland in government's spending plans,2024-09-25,2019-09-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-49582275,"Chancellor Sajid Javid has announced an extra £1.2bn for Scotland in the UK government's spending plans. The departmental budgets are for one year, rather than the usual three years, due to uncertainty over the impact of Brexit. The chancellor promised he was ""turning the page on austerity"" as he embarked on a pre-election spending spree. But Scotland's finance secretary Derek Mackay said the funding package did not ""undo the damage"" of austerity. The funding in Scotland includes £160m for farmers to settle a  long-running row over the redistribution of Common Agricultural Policy payments.  The extra spending - primarily aimed at health, schools and the police - will be funded by borrowing rather than tax rises. Mr Javid outlined £13.8bn of extra investment across the UK, which equates to about £1.2bn for Scotland under the devolved nation funding model called the Barnett formula, in what he said is the fastest spending increase for 15 years. Mr Javid said: ""No department will be cut next year. Every single department has had its budget for day-to-day spending increased at least in line with inflation. ""That's what I mean by the end of austerity."" But Mr Mackay said: ""Despite promises of additional funding from the UK government, the fact remains this announcement gives us no greater certainty, does not undo the damage of austerity, fails to protect us from Brexit and simply gives just some of the money owed to Scotland. ""Scottish public services have been constrained by a decade of UK austerity during which we have lost out on over £12bn of real-terms investment.  ""This announcement does little to address the damage caused by UK austerity or the multi-billion funding disputes we have outstanding with the Treasury."" The £160m farming payout resolves a row over the way the EU paid subsidies. In 2013, the EU announced moves to redistribute Common Agricultural Policy payments more fairly, on the basis of average euros per hectare. The EU paid the uplift money to bring Scottish hill farmers up to the average per-hectare payments of all the other EU countries. However, the decision was made by the UK government to spread the payments across the whole farming sector, based on historical distributions. The National Farmers' Union Scotland president, Andrew McCornick, said the announcement meant a ""fundamental wrong has finally been corrected"". He added: ""For the past six years, we have argued long and hard for the convergence funding injustice to be addressed and the £160m represents the biggest single uplift in agricultural funding in memory."" Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: ""I have doggedly argued for this money to be repatriated to Scotland's farmers and pressed the UK government to right this historic injustice, which has deprived farmers, crofters and land managers of vital support."" The chancellor laid out the spending plans against the possibility that the UK is heading for another general election - the country's third in five years. The chancellor's spending plan is based on forecasts published in March by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent fiscal watchdog. Under those predictions, the government had around £15bn to borrow within its self-imposed overdraft limit of 2% of the value of the national economy. The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, also warned that the current weakness in the UK economy could weigh on the government's declaration of the end of austerity. He said: ""We of course live in a time of extreme economic uncertainty and I think the big risk in saying that austerity is over is that the economy starts to do significantly worse, which it might if we have a no-deal Brexit. ""Then the deficit and debt will start rising and we are in danger of having another dose of austerity to get that over with for a second time."" Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said the UK government's spending announcement was ""great news for Scotland"". He added: ""An extra £1.2bn that should be used to grow the economy and invest in vital public services across Scotland.  ""It's clearer than ever that Scotland benefits from being part of a strong United Kingdom and I urge the Scottish government to work with us as we invest in Scotland to deliver jobs, opportunities and sustainable growth.  ""It's particularly a great day for Scottish farmers with the prime minister delivering on his promise to right the wrongs of unfair funding by providing them an extra £160m."""
Spread to US Treasury,'Huge challenges' for NI recovery from Covid-19,2024-09-25,2020-05-20,By Jayne McCormack,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-52745797,"There will be ""huge challenges"" for Northern Ireland's economy in the future because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Arlene Foster has warned. The first minister cited recent unemployment figures in NI, which rose by almost 90% in April. Mrs Foster said she has ""real concerns"" about what will happen to workers when the government's furlough scheme ends. It was due to run until June, but has since been extended to the end of October. The scheme allows employers to temporarily lay off staff while the government pays 80% of their wages during the crisis. Appearing before Stormont's Executive Office committee, Mrs Foster said if NI businesses had not been able to avail of the furlough scheme, unemployment figures would have been ""much worse"". She said: ""What happens to some of those jobs when the scheme comes to an end and is tapered away, how can we support those people?"" ""We're in the response phase, when we move to the recovery and renewal phase, there will be huge challenges."" Her comments came as the Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey revealed more than 2,500 staff in Northern Ireland's 11 councils are being furloughed. Her department is providing emergency funding of £20.3m to councils, as some of them are at risk of becoming insolvent. Sinn Féin councillors are challenging a Causeway Coast and Glens Council Borough Council decision to place some staff entirely onto the job retention scheme. That local authority voted to furlough 60 workers, but Sinn Féin wants the council to pay them the other 20% of their wages. The DUP has said the challenge could lead to jobs and services being cut because the council is in a precarious financial position. In other developments on Wednesday: Ms Hargey also gave more details about her department's scheme to distribute food parcels to vulnerable people. By the end of this week, more than 100,000 parcels will have been distributed in Northern Ireland since the start of April.  The minister said she recognised that Treasury funding to mitigate the effects of the pandemic was not limitless. ""While we are all focused on moving out of this crisis situation and embarking on a phased approach to recovery, it is very clear that we will have a... very different society at the end of this process,"" said Ms Hargey. She warned there could be programmes in some departments that ""may not come to fruition"" this year. ""Of course, we will look at other ways we can generate income, we had already been looking at these options ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic,"" she added. The executive will have discussions with Treasury to see if additional powers to raise revenue could be transferred back to Stormont, the minister said. Earlier on Wednesday, a Sinn Féin assembly member urged the executive  to consider creating a ""permanent memorial"" to mark the loss felt by people in Northern Ireland due to Covid-19. Pat Sheehan told the Executive Office committee that funerals, and the grieving process for many people, had been disrupted and that those who had died should not ""end up as statistics somewhere"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill described it as a ""very good suggestion"" for the executive to explore. ""We'll all remember it - a lovely memorial would be positive for us to do when we get to the other side of this,"" she said. Mrs Foster added that it was important to have the conversation about marking the pandemic in a sensitive way. ""Many people have suffered throughout this period of time and people haven't been able to grieve properly,"" she told the committee."
Spread to US Treasury,Top US Democrat rounds on virus chief Birx,2024-09-25,2020-08-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53631341,"US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has attacked the White House coronavirus task force's Deborah Birx, linking her to ""disinformation"" spread by President Donald Trump. Dr Birx responded that she always based her decisions on scientific data. She is a leading member of the task force, working alongside infectious diseases chief Anthony Fauci. Mr Trump has regularly drawn criticism for his claims about Covid-19, many of which have been proved to be false. Ms Pelosi made the comments on ABC's This Week programme, in response to a question about a report on the Politico website that she had criticised Dr Birx in a meeting with other administration officials. ""I think the president has been spreading disinformation about the virus and she is his appointee, so I don't have confidence there, no,"" Ms Pelosi told ABC. According to Politico, the House speaker used stronger words in her meeting last week with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. ""Deborah Birx is the worst. Wow, what horrible hands you're in,"" she is quoted as saying to them. She also described Dr Fauci as a ""hero"". Dr Birx told CNN's State of the Union she respected Ms Pelosi, and thought the criticism was triggered by a New York Times article which suggested she was too ready to embrace overly optimistic assessments about the pandemic. ""This was not a pollyannish view. I've never been called pollyannish, or non-scientific, or non-data driven,"" she said. ""I will stake my 40-year career on those fundamental principles of using data to implement better programmes and save lives."" In the same interview, Dr Birx said the US had entered a ""new phase"" in its fight against the pandemic, with the disease being ""extraordinarily widespread"". She cautioned people living in rural areas that they were not immune and must take precautions such as wearing face-coverings and social distancing. She also urged Americans returning from holiday to assume that they were infected and to self-isolate - and she said people living in multi-generational households should consider wearing a mask while at home. Dr Fauci has clashed with Mr Trump over the use of the drug hydroxychloroquine, which the president has promoted as being effective in fighting the virus. There is no evidence of this, and regulators warn the drug may cause heart problems.  Mr Trump has also discussed irradiating the bodies of coronavirus patients with ultraviolet light, a concept which Dr Birx said could not be applied as a treatment. The US continues to have the highest number of cases of coronavirus in the world - more than 4.6 million - and more than 150,000 people have died with the virus there, more than in any other country."
Spread to US Treasury,Government may U-turn on mandatory NHS staff jabs,2024-09-25,2022-01-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60193410,"Ministers will meet later to decide whether or not to scrap mandatory Covid vaccinations for NHS staff in England. Front-line NHS workers in England must be fully vaccinated by 1 April, meaning they need a first dose by Thursday. If they are not jabbed by April, they will be redeployed or dismissed. Around 77,000 have had no jab at all. Last week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the jabs requirement was being ""kept under review"" but that it was the ""duty"" of NHS staff to get vaccinated. The policy was proposed when Delta was the dominant variant that was circulating and evidence showed being vaccinated significantly cut the risk of catching and spreading the virus.  Since then, a more contagious and slightly milder variant called Omicron has emerged. It has led to an increase in breakthrough infections among people who are vaccinated, although the jabs are still doing a great job at preventing severe cases.  Mr Javid told the Health and Social Care Select Committee on Tuesday that it was right to ""reflect"" on the policy now Omicron was dominant. But it is understood no final decisions have been made. The government has been under pressure from some within the health service to scrap the mandate, arguing that it would lead to a staffing crisis. The Royal College of Midwives warned the policy could have a ""catastrophic impact"" on maternity services, while the Royal College of GPs and Royal College of Nursing called for the deadline to be delayed. But the Department of Health and Social Care has previously insisted the policy was ""the right thing to do to protect patients"". The UK Health Security Agency says vaccines have proven to be effective against hospitalisation, mortality, infection and transmission. ""Several studies have provided evidence that vaccines are effective at preventing infection,"" a recent report said. ""Uninfected individuals cannot transmit; therefore, the vaccines are also effective at preventing transmission."" Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke told BBC Breakfast that while any change to policy would be a decision for the health secretary, he said ""fundamental facts"" had changed due to Omicron and so any decision would take that into account. There are practical and ethical reasons why the mandatory vaccination policy may go. On a practical level the NHS in England can ill-afford staff to be forced out - there are already nearly 100,000 vacancies. And then on an ethical level - as some staff are pointing out - is it right to insist on vaccination when the benefits are not overwhelmingly clear cut with the rise of the Omicron variant? Vaccination against hepatitis B is a condition of employment for some staff, but that is more than 90% effective against infection and immunity last for years. By comparison immunity against Covid infection after two doses has largely gone after 20 weeks. A booster can initially increase protection to around 70% but by 10 weeks that has started to wane significantly too. It certainly helps to reduce spread, but is it enough to over-ride freedom to choose? And if staffing levels drop further because of the mandate could the risks that pose outweigh the benefits the vaccine brings? Protests against the policy have been held in cities across the country - and some NHS staff have said they are even considering moving to work in the UK nations where vaccination is not compulsory. There are no plans in Scotland and Wales to make Covid jabs mandatory for NHS workers or care home staff, while there will be a public consultation on the issue in Northern Ireland. Patricia Marquis, the Royal College of Nursing's director for England, said that while the college would urge all nursing staff to get vaccinated, it ""makes no sense"" to risk losing thousands of workers when there were already many vacancies. She told BBC Breakfast that losing nurses and care staff ""actually puts patients at more risk than not having nurses at all"". Nadra Ahmed, chairwoman of the National Care Association, said she was ""saddened for all the people who may have lost their jobs needlessly"", with mandatory vaccination already in place in that sector since November. She said the policy had had a ""devastating impact"". Government figures suggest 40,000 care staff had not been vaccinated by the deadline - but it is unclear how many of these lost their jobs because of medical exemptions and redeployment to roles away from the frontline. ""The people who we've lost, we hope they'll think about coming back and we will do everything we can to try and encourage them to come back, but they will have found other roles and they may be happier in their other roles now and not want to move again,"" she said.  While the mandatory vaccinations policy is due to come in to force for NHS workers on 1 April, Thursday is the final day on which workers could get their first dose with time to be fully vaccinated by that date due to the separation needed between first and second doses. The latest figures show that almost 95% of NHS staff have had at least one Covid jab, leaving about 77,000 who have not. That compares to around 91% of the general population in England who have had at least one jab, although that includes people aged 12 and over. Speaking to MPs on the select committee last week, Mr Javid said not all of them were in patient-facing roles. He said that while it was the ""professional duty of every NHS worker to get vaccinated"" it was ""reasonable to assume"" that not everyone would do so. Mr Javid said the jabs requirement would be ""kept under review"". When pressed on whether that meant the government was considering scrapping it he added: ""We're reflecting on it because we do have to accept that the virus has changed."" One of those who has said he is prepared to lose his job over mandatory vaccines is specialist paramedic Matt Taylor, 42, who is unvaccinated.  He works in primary care in Cumbria and said that he found the argument for the vaccine ""a bit weak"" as the vaccine has not eradicated Covid as some jabs have done with other diseases in the past.

Spread to US Treasury,Ferries 'need financial help to survive pandemic',2024-09-25,2020-04-04,By Katy Austin,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52166995,"The trade association that represents ferry companies transporting goods in and out of the UK has called on the government to provide financial support quickly to keep services running. The UK Chamber of Shipping said a steep drop in passenger numbers due to the coronavirus pandemic meant it was fast becoming cheaper to stop using ships.  Services are just days away from being severely reduced, the group said. The Department for Transport said it will continue to engage with companies. The majority of the UK's trade in goods is transported by sea, and up to 50% of the nation's food is imported. The UK Chamber of Shipping warned if businesses severely cut back services, then supplies of food, medical equipment and other imported goods would be put at risk.  The group added it was cheaper to cease using ships, rather than keep them running at a loss. However, ferry companies such as P&O, Brittany Ferries and Stena need income from passengers too to stay profitable. A number have already reduced services as that income has dropped off.  P&O Ferries, which carries around 15% of the UK's imported goods, including food and medicines, announced it was suspending its passenger business. It is furloughing more than 1,000 staff, using the government's job retention scheme. P&O Ferries told the BBC that the company needs £257m to keep going. The BBC understands the company wants £150m of that to come from the government. Most passengers have also vanished from buses and trains, and the government has intervened to ensure they keep running. The ferry industry argues it too needs bespoke financial support to stay viable. Bob Sanguinetti, chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping, told the BBC: ""We have a number of companies explaining how much money they're losing - we're talking millions every day.  ""What we're asking for is not a wholesale bailout, it's for the government to share and underwrite some of the risk and the costs to allow the ferry companies to continue providing that vital, lifeline service to the country."" He said it was unclear how the furlough scheme could be applied to seafarers. It is not yet clear exactly what form any support could take, and different companies will have different needs. But it's thought the industry as a whole could ask for hundreds of millions of pounds to stay afloat, effectively asking for supply routes to be subsidised. Another sector requesting a support package is temperature-controlled storage and distribution of fresh and chilled food and drink.  The Cold Chain Federation's chief executive Shane Brennan said businesses involved in warehousing and transporting products had been rocked by a bottleneck in storage - as customers, such as restaurants, no longer need goods to be delivered. They usually make money from goods being moved around. The Department for Transport says it recognises the challenges currently facing transport businesses.   But having already announced emergency rescue packages for the economy worth hundreds of billions of pounds, the headache for the Treasury will be deciding how many stricken industries to individually assist, and which are in most urgent need.

Spread to US Treasury,Energy and food drive US inflation to 40-year high,2024-09-25,2022-06-10,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61762131,"Prices in the US rose faster than expected last month, as rising energy and food costs pushed inflation to the highest rate since 1981. The annual inflation rate rose to 8.6% in May, the Labor Department said, after easing in April. The rising cost of living has been squeezing households and putting pressure on policymakers to bring the issue under control. The US central bank has been raising interest rates since March. Analysts had hoped that the moves were starting to work to cool economic activity, easing the price pressures. But the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has driven up the price of oil and commodities like wheat as it disrupts exports from the two countries, has made tackling the problem more difficult. Food prices were up more than 10% last month compared to May 2021, while energy surged more than 34%. But Friday's report showed the increases continue to spread throughout the economy, pushing the cost of everything from airline tickets and clothing to medical services higher. ""So much for the idea that inflation has peaked. Consumer prices blew past expectations - and not in a good way with the 8.6% annual increase the fastest in more than 40 years,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.  ""Worse the increases were nearly ubiquitous. Just no place to hide."" The US has been grappling with rising prices since last year, when an unexpectedly strong economic rebound from the shock of the pandemic - driven by large doses of US government spending, including direct cheques to households - overwhelmed supplies, prompting companies to raise prices. Now the war in Ukraine has spread the problem around the world, with Covid-related shutdowns in China this spring contributing. As the rising costs hit household purchasing power and prompt a pullback in spending, officials are warning that growth in many countries is at risk of a sharp downturn. ""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" World Bank President David Malpass said this week. US stock markets fell in the wake of the inflation reports, with all three major indexes dropping more than 2%. The falls added to weeks of declines in US shares, as investors become nervous about the path for the economy. ""Even if inflation peaks soon, it's unlikely to decelerate quickly."" said Richard Flynn, managing director of Charles Schwab UK. ""High prices may put pressure on consumer spending into the medium term.  ""Add ongoing supply-chain problems and the economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine to the threat of inflation, and it's easy to see why fears of a downturn have risen swiftly.""  For now, the US labour market has continued to add jobs, a sign that growth is continuing. But wages have not kept pace as prices climb. The rising cost of living has especially hit lower income households, for whom basics like food and energy make up large portions of spending. Polls show a majority of Americans see inflation as the top problem facing the country. Consumer sentiment has plunged and US President Joe Biden's approval ratings have sunk as Republicans criticise him over the issue. Over the month, prices gained 1%, driven by the rising cost of petrol, which has hit new records in the US, approaching an average of nearly $5 a gallon. In hearings in Washington this week, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said bringing down prices was the ""number one priority"". In a statement, Mr Biden said ""we must do more - and quickly - to get prices down here in the United States"". ""I'm doing everything in my power to blunt Putin's price hike, and bring down the cost of oil and food,"" the president later pledged at a speech at the Port of Los Angeles in California. Roberto Perli, head of global policy research at Piper Sandler investment bank, said he expected prices to come under control as America's central bank, the Federal Reserve, increases interest rates. But he warned that raising borrowing costs will hurt economic growth. ""For now, the US economy is very healthy and you see it reflected in the fact that there is such a strong demand for pretty much everything, goods and services. But the Fed has to take care of the problem,"" he said.  ""The result will be not now but in the quarters ahead a significant slowdown in the US economy, induced in large part by the Fed."""
Spread to US Treasury,NI health service to access private sector beds,2024-09-25,2020-03-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-51999065,"Northern Ireland's health service is to access all hospital beds across the private sector. In documents seen by BBC News NI the health board proposes to contract the use of the hospital sites for a period of ""not less than 3 months"".  It's part of health authorities' surge planning for Covid-19.   Meanwhile health care staff are urging the government to test more workers as soon as possible. In a statement the Department of Health (DoH) said officials are now working with the private sector to identify how the additional resources can be best used.  A public health emergency calls for dramatic and decisive action and with a shortage of hospital beds, equipment and staff likely in the coronavirus fight - the three major independent hospitals say they want to help and have offered their services.   The hospitals involved are the Ulster Independent Clinic, the Kingsbridge and North West Independent Hospital. Negotiations are underway, but potentially it could mean around 100 additional beds, 12 operating theatres, 15 anaesthetising machines and over 400 staff.  BBC News NI understands that all have stated that they don't wish to make any profit but only to cover costs.  In a statement the Department of Health said: ""Private sector hospitals in Northern Ireland have come forward to offer help to deal with the impact of the pandemic. The Health and Social Care Board is working with them to identify how these additional resources can be put to best use."" Talks between the independent sector and health board officials took place towards the end of last week. They were instigated by the independent sector.  Sources told BBC News NI that they urged the officials to formalise the arrangement as soon as possible so those in the independent sector can begin to plan ahead.   The sector is keen to be involved as it is aware of how much pressure health trusts are going to be under.  It's understood that negotiations stalled during the week as the health board wanted a fortnight to think about fees and contracts.  Dr George Cardiner, an intensive care consultant at Belfast City Hospital, told BBC NI's The Nolan Show the health service was in the ""lull before the storm"". He said it may not take long for Northern Ireland's intensive care capacity to be exceeded. He said: """"In the Belfast Trust, we have an intensive care unit in the City Hospital, in the Mater Hospital, in the Royal Victoria Hospital and cardiac intensive care. ""Within a couple of weeks of the virus really starting to show its presence, all of those units will be full."" Meanwhile there is growing concern among health care workers that not enough of them are being tested for the coronavirus.  In the Republic of Ireland 50 test centres have been set up. The largest centre is at Pairc Ui Chaoimh in Cork, will be able to test 1,000 people each day.   A spokesperson for the Department of Health in Northern Ireland said: ""Following the Health Minister's announcement on Thursday that testing would be expanded as part of health service surge plans to deal with Covid-19, the number of tests carried out has increased. ""It is expected that testing capacity will be expanded to about 800 tests per day by the beginning of April. This will enable the HSC to test more frontline health and social care staff, ensuring that they can continue to deliver vital services."" Chief Medical Officer Michael McBride reiterated calls for people to practice social distancing. He said: ""There's no point any of us looking back in two weeks and thinking I wish we had done more. ""We need to take steps now."" In a letter to all GPs, Dr Alan Stout, chairman of the Northern Ireland GP Committee, said 'Covid centres' would soon be established in each health trust area. They will be staffed by GPs and support staff to manage the ""anticipated large numbers of patients requiring medical intervention"". On Monday, Economy Minister Diane Dodds called for the chancellor to announce support for self-employed people who have seen their incomes hit by the crisis. Last week Rishi Sunak announced a £350bn lifeline for the economy and said the government would pay up to 80% of the wages of employees unable to work due to the pandemic. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Mrs Dodds said: ""That is a hugely significant intervention in the economy at this time. ""But he has not gone the whole way and he  has not addressed the issue of the self employed."" She said she had written to the Treasury about the issue. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the government would not be found wanting in support for people and businesses. He said: ""While we cannot guarantee that no-one will suffer hardship, we will do our utmost to support individuals, families and businesses."" At a press conference on Sunday evening, Boris Johnson warned the public to take seriously the social distancing advice to stop the spread of coronavirus, saying it is ""absolutely crucial"". According to the latest figures, there are more than 5,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK. The number of people with coronavirus who have died is now 220 in England, seven in Scotland, five in Wales and two in Northern Ireland. There have been four deaths in the Republic of Ireland."
Spread to US Treasury,Travel industry anger as Germans flock to Majorca,2024-09-25,2021-06-16,By Simon Browning,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57504082,"The bosses of Jet2, Easyjet and Manchester Airport have criticised the government for not putting the Balearic Islands, including Majorca, on the green travel list.  The boss of Jet2 said he was ""bewildered"" over why they couldn't fly to those destinations. While UK travel is limited, Germans are flocking to popular holiday spots. The government said it would continue to explore how to open international travel safely. Currently very few countries are on the government's green list, which means they are approved for leisure travel, requiring less testing and no quarantine on return. ""When you take the UK government's own criteria for deciding where holidaymakers can travel to, and apply it to the Balearics, we are left bewildered as to why we cannot fly there,"" said Jet2 and Jet2 Holidays' chief executive Steve Heapy. Charlie Cornish, chief executive of Manchester Airport Group (MAG) said EU countries were taking a more positive approach to resuming international travel. ""Hundreds of thousands of people from places like Germany are travelling freely and safely to low-risk holiday destinations,"" he said. MAG has joined with low cost airline Ryanair to launch a legal action against the government over its traffic light system, particularly focusing on the lack of transparency over how countries are classified. The Spanish island of Majorca, a favourite of British tourists for decades, is currently on the amber list; travel there is not advised and quarantine is required on return to the UK. But rates of the virus are lower there than in the UK and in recent weeks, German tourists have started arriving in Majorca in large numbers. German travellers need just a digital pre-registration and either an antigen test or proof of vaccination. Dutch and Belgian tourists are also flying to the Balearics but in fewer numbers than those travelling from Germany. Palma de Majorca Airport confirmed to the BBC that during May, 397,931 tourists arrived from Germany on 3,363 flights. In contrast 5,813 UK tourists arrived on 333 flights from UK airports. Local businesses in the Balearics that usually rely on British tourists and their holiday spending, are feeling their absence for a second summer. Mark Steenson owns Francey O'Connor's, an Irish pub in Ca'n Picafort, a Majorca resort that usually welcomes thousands of British holiday-makers. But with Brits still advised not to travel there, he has begun to gear his trade to those who can.  ""I went and got a Borussia Dortmund shirt and had the bar sign redone in German to get the German football fans in,"" said Mr Steenson. ""If it weren't for the Germans, we'd be broke. Ca'n Picafort is rammed with Germans,"" he said. ""It is a joy to see."" But rapid adjustments have had to be made, he says: ""I've gone out and bought German beers and I've started trying to learn some German words so I can chat to them."" The Germany and France game in the Euro 2020 tournament earlier this week was a big pull and for the first time this summer, the terrace at Francey O'Connor's filled up. But while German visitors are a lifeline for Mark Steenson, the absence of their British counterparts has angered Manchester Airport Group boss, Charlie Cornish.  The UK's current traffic light system had not recognised the progress many countries have made in reducing rates of the virus, he said. ""The government's lack of transparency is unacceptable and makes operating a business in the travel sector almost impossible after what has already been the most challenging year in our history."" Epidemiologists worry that mass travel before more people are fully vaccinated, both in the UK and at holiday destinations, will allow the virus to spread more rapidly. And if Covid cases spiral suddenly on holiday islands, it is not clear if healthcare systems there are in a position to manage their care. Added to this, there are now concerns amongst EU nations about the Delta variant now dominant in the UK. The EU has not added the UK to its ""white list"" permitting travel. But this list is only guidance and EU nations can make their own decisions. That's not a pressing issue for most EU governments yet, with the UK's largest tour operators almost completely grounded. But when UK tourists are eventually allowed to travel again, the delays may put them at a price disadvantage, according to Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of the Advantage Travel Partnership. ""We are closed for businesses, we really are,"" she said. ""Our counterparts in Germany and Europe are flocking to the Med.  ""What that will mean is a reduction in product for when we restart, and access to uncompetitive pricing, because everyone else will have picked best rates."" ""As an industry it demonstrates that you can't plan an operation at the last minute. But there is no comprehension in government of the complexity of this story."" Earlier this week, Easyjet announced it was increasing capacity from Germany to Majorca, to cope with swelling holiday demand.   ""We've just recently added 150,000 seats from Berlin into Palma to try meet the huge pent-up demand that has been released from those restrictions lifting,"" said Garry Wilson, chief executive of easyJet Holidays.  ""It is a shame we can't do the same for UK customers, because we know demand is there."" The government says it is looking at how to reopen international travel, including the idea that travellers who have received both doses of the vaccine would not have to quarantine when they return from amber list destinations.  Jesse Norman, financial secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News: ""We don't want to get left behind by countries who are adopting a two-jabs approach if it can be done safely."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""Our first priority is protecting the public and saving lives, and the traffic light system we have in place categorises countries and territories based on risk, using the latest data. ""As set out in the Global Travel Taskforce, we continue to engage with international partners to explore how we can open international travel safely."" Labour said it had repeatedly called for ministers to publish the data and criteria around their traffic light system, but they had refused to do so.  Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon added: ""When will they deliver on the sector-specific support promised for aviation 15 months ago? It's now clearer than ever that this government is actively choosing to turn its back on the industry at a time when thousands of jobs are on the line."" Steve Heapy, boss of Jet2 said the continued exclusion of UK tourists risked inflicting long-term damage on the travel industry. ""Other nationalities are going, German customers are arriving on jumbo jets that are being put into Majorca and hotels are filling up. ""Hotels will give rooms in the future to these other nationalities and British tour operators and customers could be squeezed out.   He said he hoped the government would review its decision after reexamining the data on 24 June. ""If that is the case, and Malta, Balearic and Canary Islands continue to have low infection rates, I expect them to be on the list. If they are not - I expect an explanation. """
Spread to US Treasury,The DNA viruses left in ancient remains,2024-09-25,2023-10-16,Jasmin Fox-Skelly,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231013-how-unearthing-diseases-ancient-origins-could-help-produce-modern-cures,"The DNA of bacteria and viruses that infected humans thousands of years ago is still trapped in their skeletal remains. Scientists are finding out what we can learn from them. In the 16th Century, in the country now known as Mexico, there was a sudden and dramatic drop in the population. Disease spread after Europeans conquered the territory and millions of indigenous people died as a result. Until recently, it was believed the Europeans had brought the illness with them from Europe - but the exact pathogen responsible was unknown. Now a team of scientists have extracted ancient viral DNA from the teeth of victims of the outbreaks, buried beneath a colonial-era hospital and chapel in New Mexico. The DNA reveals that the victims were infected with hepatitis B virus and human B19 parvovirus. Rather than a European origin as previously thought, the researchers found that the viruses likely originated in Africa. ""The viruses seem to have an African origin, and three of the humans we analysed were genetically African as well,"" says María C Ávila Arcos, assistant professor at the International Laboratory for Human Genome Research at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. At the time, European traders and colonists were forcibly enslaving Africans and transporting them thousands of miles to the Americas. The cruel conditions on ships allowed infections to spread rapidly. ""These humans were kidnapped and then placed in crowded, unsanitary ships in completely subhuman conditions,"" says Ávila Arcos. ""Once the virus arrived in the Americas, the indigenous people had never been exposed to it before, so they were extremely vulnerable. It wiped out a large fraction of the indigenous population."" Rewriting history The discovery is one of the latest in the field of paleomicrobiology, whereby researchers extract fragments of microbial DNA from centuries-old skeletons. The DNA is then reconstructed, allowing scientists to diagnose a disease or condition hundreds or even thousands of years after the person's death. The technique is changing how we view and understand our past. Take smallpox – a devastating illness that killed an estimated 300 million people in the 20th Century alone. The origins of the variola virus that causes smallpox have always been obscure. From anecdotal accounts, historians believed it may have been around since 10,000BC, but until recently there was no scientific proof, and the oldest confirmed case was dated to the 17th Century using DNA extracted from a Lithuanian mummy. However in 2020 that date was pushed back, when Barbara Muhlemann, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, and her colleagues extracted variola virus from the teeth of Viking skeletons dated to AD600. The skeletons were uncovered in 11 burial sites in Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the UK. Smallpox was also found in multiple human remains from Öland, an island off the east coast of Sweden with a long history of trade. The finding predates the earliest confirmed smallpox cases by 1,000 years. The study provides clear evidence that the Vikings, who travelled extensively around Europe and beyond, carried smallpox with them. Meanwhile ancient-DNA analysis has also shone a light on the origins of the plague. A 2015 study analysing microbial DNA from the teeth of 101 skeletons found that the bacteria that causes plague, Y. pestis, had been spreading amongst humans for at least 3,000 years prior to the first documented plague pandemic. The researchers found Y. pestis bacteria in the DNA of seven of the skeletons, the oldest of whom died 5,783 years ago. Although modern plague is usually spread via rats carrying infected fleas, the study showed that the plague bacterium didn't acquire the mutations necessary to infect fleas until the turn of the 1st millennium BC. Before then it likely spread through human-to-human contact, resulting in the less serious pneumonic plague. Once it acquired the ability to infect fleas it spread rapidly, leading to outbreaks of the bubonic plague (Black Death), a pandemic which wiped out half the population of Europe in the 14th Century.   Ancient DNA is changing the way we view another serious disease: syphilis. It was previously believed that the first outbreak of syphilis in Europe occurred in 1495 in Italy, just after Christopher Columbus returned from his first voyage to the Americas. The sexually transmitted disease ran rampant amongst the infantry of King Charles VIII of France, who at the time was planning to conquer the Kingdom of Naples. The debilitating disease then quickly spread around Europe. As the outbreak happened just after the return of Columbus and his crew from their first trans-Atlantic voyage, most historians believed syphilis spread to Europe from what was referred to at the time as the 'New World'. But support is growing for a different theory. In 2020, Verena Schuenemann, a professor of archaeological science affiliated with the University of Basel and University of Zurich, led a team which extracted DNA from nine individuals whose bones bore the characteristic lesions of syphilis. The remains were recovered from cemeteries in Finland, Estonia, and the Netherlands. The researchers detected at least three separate strains of Treponema pallidum, the pathogen that causes syphilis, as well as other diseases such as yaws – now found only in the tropics. Carbon-dating of the skeletons and coffins confirmed that the individuals died between the early-to-late 15th Century, suggesting that syphilis was already circulating in Europe before Columbus returned from his maiden voyage. Calculations based on the mutation rate of the syphilis bacterium also suggest that the origin of the disease predates the time of arrival of Columbus. ""We know that the spread of pathogens is connected to trade routes,"" says Schuenemann.   ""We see that with syphilis, the plague, and leprosy – whenever humans started to exchange travel and trade, they also brought opportunities for pathogens to travel.""   Conversely, that means that microbial DNA can only tell us so much about the history of ancient pandemics. The DNA itself isn't a problem. Although DNA does degrade over time, researchers have sequenced the genome of a woolly mammoth who lived one million years ago. However it's likely that before around 12,000 years ago when humans adopted agriculture and farming, people wouldn't have come into contact often enough to cause a pandemic.   ""You need a certain amount of humans to actually transfer diseases, so we tend to see these diseases appearing alongside the first cities. When people started settling down, that's when the pandemics struck,"" says Schuenemann.   Clues from teeth   A great place to look for ancient microbial DNA is dental plaque. This sticky residue, which builds up on your teeth if you don't brush properly, traps bacteria, eventually causing tooth decay and gum disease. Eventually plaque undergoes a mineralisation process whereupon it hardens, ‘trapping' the DNA of ancient oral bacteria and viruses inside. Decoding this microbial genome is giving scientists access to a treasure trove of information about the health of our ancestors. For example the multinational Medical project is using human dental plaque to piece together the history of how leprosy was treated during the Middle Ages in Europe. Led by Emanuela Cristiani from Sapienza University of Rome, the team have analysed the tartar of teeth excavated from the medieval cemeteries of St Leonard's in Peterborough, England, and Saint-Thomas d'Aizier, in France. You might also like:  The team found traces of ginger in some individuals, suggesting that attempts were made to treat the condition. For instance, Constantine the African, a famous 11th-Century AD physician, wrote about preparing oral treatments containing ginger and other herbs to alleviate stomach pain triggered by leprosy. Mercury was also found in some patients, which could have been used to cover skin imperfections and as a pain-relieving ointment. This suggests that rather than simply stigmatising sufferers, victims were cared for. Diagnosing heart disease and Alzheimer's Sequencing dental DNA can do more than tell us about what infectious diseases a person had when they died. In the future, the technology could also reveal what a person's oral microbiome – the huge and diverse assemblage of bacteria, archaea and fungi that live in and around your mouth – was like too. This information, in turn, could tell us about the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in ancient times. NCDs are chronic conditions that are not the result of a singular infectious agent. They include conditions like heart disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's Disease. ""There's studies going back decades showing how oral health and the oral microbiome are related to these conditions,"" says Abigail Gancz, a biological anthropologist at Pennsylvania State University. In a recent article, Gancz argues that as the links between the oral microbiome and NCDs are so well-established, we may be able to use ancient microbial DNA to infer whether ancient human populations experienced these conditions too. Although they are often thought of as modern diseases caused by unhealthy lifestyles, we actually have no idea to what extent they were prevalent in ancestral human populations, because the vast majority of NCDs leave no distinctive traces on the skeleton. However, there are signs that they were present, although not to the same extent as today. ""In ancient Egyptian literature in some of the earliest written records you have descriptions that look a lot like diabetes, for example accounts of the sweet-smelling nature of urine,"" says Gancz.   ""There is an assumption that people in the past lived short, brutal lives, but a lot of them did make it to older age and would have experienced these non-communicable diseases."" Gancz is leading the Ancient Systemic Disease project, which aims to uncover the link between ancient human microbiomes and the presence of NCDs. So far, she has analysed the skeletons of 192 British individuals dating from the medieval to industrial period. The project involves painstakingly decoding the microbial DNA found in dental plaque to find out what bacteria and viruses the person had when they died. This is then compared to, and correlated with, known markers of disease present in the person's skeleton. ""There are various lesions in skeletons that indicate disease,"" says Gancz. For example, cavities or abscesses in the person's teeth may suggest that the person was suffering from periodontal disease. You can also detect signs of systemic inflammation by looking at a person's bones. For example, arthritis can lead to a visual deformation in bone morphology.   Bones are living thing that change throughout the lifespan, so the bones will have different forms and textures depending on whether someone was actively experiencing stress,"" says Gancz. When complete, the research should allow scientists to look at a skeleton's oral microbiome and use that information to calculate the likelihood that they also suffered from a chronic disease. This will allow researchers to track how conditions like arthritis and obesity have changed over time, including what effect if any the agricultural revolution, industrialisation, and urbanisation had on these conditions. There's good reason to believe that major transitions such as these had a huge impact on human health. For example, a 2013 study by Gancz's supervisor, Laura Weyrich, associate professor of anthropology at Pennsylvania State University, found that the oral microbiome of our ancestors changed – and became more unhealthy – after we switched from hunter-gatherers to farmers. The finding underlines the role that pathogens have had in shaping human history. But research like this isn't just of historical interest. It could be used to improve the health of modern humans too. One of the aims of Weyrich's research is to develop microbiome transplantations – swapping an unhealthy oral microbiome for a healthy one. ""Imagine a day where you don't have to brush your teeth as you have microbes in your mouth that don't cause oral disease – that might be something we can get to by looking at what microbes people had prior to the widespread presence of these modern oral diseases,"" says Weyrich.

Spread to US Treasury,Where villages are built into cliffs,2024-09-25,2016-09-01,Jim O'Donnell,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20160602-mesa-verdes-surprising-story,"The culture that once thrived at Mesa Verde National Park was rich, complex and far-reaching – and it didn’t mysteriously disappear. Mesa Verde – est 1906 Colorado Ernie Atencio, anthropologist Read more about BBC Travel’s celebration of the US National Park Service’s 100th Anniversary. Most visitors peek into the towering masonry ruins of Mesa Verde National Park and imagine a society on the edge. Not Ernie Atencio. The 60-year-old Colorado native and anthropologist spent several of his formative years working in the park’s backcountry and most of his life exploring the Four Corners region of the American southwest, arguably the richest archaeological area in North America. “People who visit Mesa Verde generally expect stories of half-naked, primitive cavemen living a short subsistence lifestyle, remote and isolated out on the mesa,” he said. “The reality of what Mesa Verde was could not be more different.” Covering about 52,000 acres of southwestern Colorado, the park and Unesco World Heritage Site turns 110 years old this year (having been established 10 years before the National Parks Service). Mesa Verde is Spanish for “green table” and is the largest archaeological preserve in the US, protecting some 4,500 sites. Nearly 600 of those sites are cliff dwellings: villages built into the giant alcoves of the mesa walls. People have lived on the mesa for around 10,000 years but it wasn’t until about 600 that the Ancestral Puebloans (the common term “Anasazi” is a pejorative Navajo term meaning “enemy ancestors”) began their 700-year occupation of the area. Atencio grew up in Denver, Colorado. In public school during the 1970s, North America’s deep Native American history was a remarkably thin slice of the educational pie. Mesa Verde was an exception. “It was the only archaeological area we read about, and I was genuinely surprised to discover that it was right there in my own state,” Atencio said. Later, as an anthropology student at the University of New Mexico, Atencio led a group of school children on a trip to Mesa Verde. While there, a ranger encouraged Atencio to apply for a seasonal interpretive ranger position. He did, and 1984 marked the first of five summers working in the national park. “I was fascinated by the real story of Mesa Verde,” he said, “and also the opportunity to reflect on our own culture through the lens of archaeology.” Until recently, many archaeologists have disagreed with how the National Park Service has told the story of Mesa Verde. “When I started, I was disappointed in the narrow range of information given to the public,” Atencio said. For example, Mesa Verde is not an isolated island of archaeology floating in a vast wilderness. The communities of Mesa Verde were part of a densely populated regional society of tens of thousands of people spread throughout the American southwest. They had trade contacts reaching from the Pacific Ocean to the Appalachian Mountains and from southern Canada deep into modern Mexico. These Ancestral Puebloans lived a rich, highly developed and complex lifestyle. Their abundance allowed them to create art forms that Mark Varien, executive vice-president of research at Crow Canyon Archaeological Research Institute in nearby Cortez, Colorado, describes as “as aesthetically pleasing as anything ever made by any culture”. “We think of their lives as a constant struggle for survival,” Varien said. “But it wasn’t like that. The people of Mesa Verde had the time and leisure for cultural development.” The Ancestral Puebloans created stunning murals, advanced pottery types, intricate jewellery and complex architecture that still stand today. “Those objects themselves still have power simply because they are so beautiful,” Varien said. And the people of Mesa Verde didn’t mysteriously disappear. As a young ranger, Atencio was perplexed by the story that visitors were told. “Disappear? How could they have disappeared when I personally knew their ancestors?” Atencio asked. By about 1200, the population of Mesa Verde proper reached about 20,000 people, most of whom lived in huge, urbanized villages at the heads of the area’s canyons. But less than 100 years later, the vast majority of those people shifted south to villages in Arizona and New Mexico such as Hopi, Zuni, Acoma and the pueblos of the Rio Grande Valley. The Ancestral Puebloans didn’t disappear, they simply moved. “The abandonment of Mesa Verde was complex and it didn’t happen all at once,” Atencio said. With this knowledge, Atencio felt obligated to include ethnographic research and oral histories into the information he gave to visitors. “When modern, living Pueblo people came to the park, I followed them around and learned so much from them. Their culture is still very much alive so they could help interpret what we saw in the park.” After his time at Mesa Verde, Atencio continued to work at archaeology sites, including Bandelier National Monument and the Grand Canyon. Yet he returned to Mesa Verde time and time again. Today, he is the southwest regional representative for the National Parks Conservation Association. “My time at Mesa Verde gave me a life-long fascination with archaeology. It also gave me an openness to other cultures and to dialoguing with people different from myself,” he said. “It gave me a love for wildlands, national parks and public lands in general. We’ve got a treasure here that is unique.” If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

Spread to US Treasury,Wales right on Covid lockdown says ex-Johnson aide,2024-09-25,2023-11-01,By Catrin Haf Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67289154,"Wales' Covid ""firebreak"" lockdown in October 2020 was the ""correct decision"", according to Boris Johnson's former communications chief. Lee Cain told the UK Covid Inquiry that the Welsh government was right to impose the ""decisive"" and ""politically advantageous"" three-week action. During it people were told to stay at home and pubs, restaurants, hotels and non-essential shops had to shut. Gatherings, indoors and out, with those not in your household were also banned.  Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford called it a ""short, sharp, shock to turn back the clock, slow down the virus and buy us more time"". Without action the NHS would not be able to cope, Mr Drakeford told a press conference at the time. The Welsh lockdown, which would eventually be mirrored in England two weeks later, led to a clash with the UK Treasury. It saw then Chancellor Rishi Sunak decline to bring forward the new Job Support Scheme (JSS) to replace the furlough in time to top up Welsh wages, leaving many employees fearing redundancy. In a letter to Mr Drakeford he rejected implementing JSS - which would have covered 67% of wages - a month sooner because of ""limitations in HMRC delivery timescales"". In his witness statement to the inquiry, Mr Cain said a meeting in the Cabinet room in Westminster on 21 September 2020 heard ""overwhelming expert opinion that if the (UK) government did not take action in the form of a circuit breaker, Covid would once again spread rampantly across the UK"".  ""That would leave no other option than a longer more restrictive lockdown in the months ahead,"" he said. The statement then went on to say that ""by late October Covid rates had continued to rise and were at risk of getting out of control."" Eventually then Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a lockdown for England, which began on November 5, 2020 and lasted for a month. The UK-wide inquiry began in June, and could go on as long as three years, and will predominantly look at the UK government's approach to the pandemic. The Welsh government has refused calls for a Wales-only inquiry and has backed the UK-wide exercise."
Spread to US Treasury,"'I've had 3,200 bookings cancelled at my pubs'",2024-09-25,2021-12-14,By Beth Timmins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59649233,"As the hospitality industry reels from the impact of new Covid curbs, pubs and restaurants have reported a wave of Christmas cancellations. The Bar 44 chain, which has four outlets, told the BBC 3,200 people had scrapped bookings for December. Natalie Isaac, its operations director, said only a ""handful"" of people would have cancelled before the pandemic. Others say that although they face no new rules, public caution is causing lower footfall and a loss of trade.  The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has called for the government to provide financial support for businesses affected, but the Treasury has not unveiled any new measures. Bar 44, which has restaurants in Bristol and Cardiff, says 1,000 of the 3,200 lost bookings were down to the knock-on effects of cancelled concerts by Tom Jones and the Stereophonics. ""Having to stay open but not getting the business is our big worry,"" Ms Isaac explained.  ""This should be our bumper two weeks before Christmas, but the diary is worryingly empty. We're significantly impacted and without furlough, we won't be able to protect our staff."" Ms Isaac was unable to give a figure for the loss of trade across the month, as the venues are not operating at full pre-pandemic capacity.  They have also been opening just five days a week, because of staff shortages that started before the new Plan B restrictions.  ""We're slightly refilling with small groups, but people are worried to go out again as they don't want to catch Covid during Christmas."" The CBI said hospitality businesses and shops were facing a ""double whammy"" of collapsing demand and no financial help because of the government's Plan B, aimed at fighting the spread of the Omicron variant. CBI director general Tony Danker said the restrictions were ""balanced"", but ministers needed to clarify that they were temporary. ""Whilst we have measures to keep the economy open, we have messages that have ended up closing much of it down,"" he told the BBC. ""We saved these businesses in the last 18 months. We kept them flourishing,"" he said. ""We can't lose that now, to essentially if unintentionally close down the restaurant sector at this time of year. That's a huge cashflow hit,"" he added. ""We need to revisit cashflow measures to support those businesses. We can't pretend that the economy is still open when demand has been so suppressed for understandable reasons."" A Treasury spokesperson said that the government had ""acted early"" to help control the virus's spread while ""avoiding damaging economic and social restrictions by allowing businesses to remain open"".  ""To continue to protect the NHS, as well as jobs and livelihoods across the country, our priority is to ensure everyone who is eligible gets their booster jabs as quickly as possible. ""Our £400bn Covid-19 support package will continue to help businesses into spring next year and we will continue to respond proportionately to the changing path of the virus, as we have done since the start of the pandemic,"" the spokesperson added.  Clive Watson, boss of pub chain, City Pub Group, said every kind of booking was now in decline since the Plan B announcement.  ""In an nutshell, the big corporate parties have really started to be cancelled, which were really lucrative,"" he explained.   ""To a certain extent, these were being compensated by smaller groups still booking, but now they're starting to cancel as well.  ""What we're facing is a partial lockdown, but with no government assistance this time round."" Mr Watson said it was still worth staying open, but added that the impact would be sizeable if no further financial assistance came from the government.  Data for Monday to Sunday of last week from the trade body UKHospitality, for example, showed a 13% drop in business and a 15% increase in cancellations, compared with pre-pandemic levels. As people revise their Christmas plans, Marc Hornby, co-founder of the Caviar and Chips catering and hospitality group, says corporate event inquiries are now ""next to none"".    The country-wide external catering firm based in Birmingham has had to pivot to focusing on wedding events for 2022 and 2023 because of the impact of the current restrictions.  ""It's been a significant drop - we're seeing 25% of the business we'd usually see,"" Mr Hornby told the BBC.  ""The biggest challenge has been the mixed messaging and the government not realising how much it costs to cancel events.""  Recruitment has also been difficult for 18 months, but Mr Hornby said they had anticipated fresh restrictions, so had planned more small events.  The group owns a pub in Kenilworth, opened in March 2020, a week before lockdown. After moving to takeaways during lockdown, it has reopened, but has also seen very few corporate bookings.   Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said that Plan B restrictions had ""destroyed"" the crucial Christmas trading time for pubs.  ""Further restrictions such as limits on group sizes, or even closing pubs, would be disastrous,"" she explained.  ""Pubs need all the trade they can get this Christmas to make it through the quiet winter months ahead.  ""Without it, they will need a full financial package from the government, including support on VAT, business rates and a return of the local authority grants.  ""The chancellor needs to come to our rescue once more."" A spokesperson from restaurants operator Mitchells & Butlers, which runs brands such as All Bar One, O'Neill's, Harvester and Toby Carvery, said: ""We are deeply disappointed by the announcement of Plan B and the knock-on effect this will have on our industry as we continue to try to rebuild our businesses during the pandemic.   ""We will, of course, comply with the Plan B regulations.  Very few of our businesses will be affected by the Covid pass provisions, and face masks are not required in our pubs and restaurants under the new guidance.   ""We have no plans to introduce any additional restrictions unless required to do so."" Have you cancelled your Christmas booking? How have your plans changed due to the Omicron coronavirus variant?

Spread to US Treasury,The gooey 'biscake' eaten by millions,2024-09-25,2021-01-06,Shafik Meghji,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20210105-the-gooey-biscake-eaten-by-millions,"Alfajores are synonymous with Argentina – the biggest producer and consumer – where they are as central to the national culinary identity as steak and Malbec. Chocolatier Maria Romero's eyes gleamed as she drifted back to her childhood in Quilmes, a city in Buenos Aires province, and her first encounters with alfajores. “My first memory of eating them was when I was little,” she said. “We had these kioscos [small convenience stores] inside the school and would run over at breaktime to buy an alfajor. I have a very strong memory of standing and listening to the children shouting out the names of the different brands – Jorgito, Capitán del Espacio, Fantoche. If you were hungry, needed something sweet, felt sad, you bought one. Sometimes you just need an alfajor to survive.” In its most common form, an Argentine alfajor is a pair of soft, crumbly biscuits sandwiching a layer of dulce de leche (a thick, super-sweet caramel-like confection) and covered with chocolate or dusted with sugar or desiccated coconut. Romero describes alfajores as “biscakes” – a cross between a biscuit and a cake – and has turned them into a career. After working for the likes of the Savoy in London, luxury chocolate-makers Artisan du Chocolat and Rococo and the Hilton in Buenos Aires, she now runs UK-based Sur Chocolates, which produces gourmet alfajores. Romero places alfajores alongside Malbec wine, beef and yerba mate (an incredibly popular herbal tea) in Argentina’s culinary pantheon – and she’s not alone. Approximately one billion alfajores are sold in Argentina every year, according to the Buenos Aires tourist board, and hundreds of varieties are available in kioscos, supermarkets and bakeries across the country, from the icy realms of Tierra del Fuego in the far south to the high, arid plains of Jujuy in the extreme north. “You can find them everywhere,” said Buenos Aires-based food writer and Pick Up The Fork blogger Allie Lazar. “Every kiosco sells a great selection of alfajores. Most Argentines have quite the sweet tooth and dulce de leche is basically a national treasure, so alfajores have long been the perfect quick treat or snack. They’re also a great accompaniment to contrast yerba mate, which tends to be quite bitter.” You may also be interested in:  • The fried dough the world loves  • The remote ranch at the bottom of the world  • The dish that ended the plague Alfajores are an integral part of Argentine popular culture, appearing in works as diverse as Jorge Luis Borges’ short story The Aleph and the much-loved Mafalda comic strip. When he was a youngster, one of Lionel Messi’s coaches rewarded him with alfajores for every goal he scored. They are so central to Argentine life that the national constitution was reputedly written in an alfajorería (alfajores shop) in the mid-19th Century. Although they are a relatively simple product, alfajores have a long and complex history. Facundo Calabró, creator of the Catador de alfajores (Taster of alfajores) blog and author of the book En busca del alfajor perdido (In search of the lost alfajor), explains that they date to at least the 8th Century, when an Arabic biscuit featuring sugar, syrup, nuts and cinnamon arrived in the Iberian peninsula during the Moorish conquest. Versions from Andalusia and Murcia subsequently evolved, taking the name alajú or alfajor – derived, some linguists believe, from the Arabic word al-fakher (“luxurious”) or the old Arabic word al-huasu (“filled” or “stuffed”). Cylindrical in shape and made from ground almonds, hazelnuts, breadcrumbs, sugar, honey and spices such as cinnamon, these versions are still traditionally eaten in parts of Spain at Christmas  and in some areas are available year-round. But alfajores really came into their own in Latin America. “In the 16th Century, during the [colonial period], the alfajor arrived from the south of Spain and spread throughout the Americas, mostly through the convents. It began to hybridise, taking the ingredients of each region and losing others,” said Calabró. Alfajores in Puerto Rico are typically made from ground cassava, for example; while Chile, Peru and Mexico – among others – use their own versions of dulce de leche. But although they are now found across Latin America, they are synonymous, above all, with Argentina, the biggest producer and consumer of the product. Today, alfajores in Argentina are far removed from their Spanish and Arabic predecessors. The most common home-made version – and the style generally found in bakeries – are known as alfajores de maicena, with a dulce de leche filling and a dusting of sugar or desiccated coconut. “But like most foods that came to Argentina, alfajores have been given provincial twists,” said Paula Delgado and Claudio Ortiz, chefs at Estancia Los Potreros, which will publish its first cookbook in 2021. “Our chefs go back to recipes they have been taught by their mothers, aunts, grandmothers. Here in Córdoba province, alfajores are typically filled with a sweet quince paste. All of our gauchos [cowboys], cooks, cleaners and staff sit down in the afternoon to discuss life and politics over alfajores and mate tea. They’re a big part of Argentine culture.” The most famous type of shop-bought alfajor is the marplatense, which is filled with dulce de leche and covered with chocolate. It takes its name from the coastal city of Mar del Plata, birthplace of leading brand Havanna, which opened its first bakery in 1947 and now has shops and cafes across Argentina. But there are countless variations beyond the classic marplatense. Rummage through the shelves of a kiosco and you’ll find ones covered with a sugar glaze, meringue or yoghurt; filled with jams, ganache, mousse or peanut butter; and flavoured with coffee, fruits, nuts or spirits such as rum or whiskey. There are vegan, gluten-free, rice-cake and even triple-decker versions. People form deep attachments to particular brands, according to Romero’s husband Emanuel: “Argentinians need to belong to one side or the other. Like in football, for example, you support Boca or River. With alfajores, it’s kind of the same – you belong to a brand and you defend them.” Despite their popularity in Argentina and elsewhere in Latin America, alfajores are relatively little known in the rest of the world, though this is starting to change. Havanna opened a shop in Florida, its first in the US, in 2017. “There are also Havanna stores in Spain, and over 100 in the rest of Latin America,” said Mariano Oliva, CEO of Havanna USA. “We sell about half a million alfajores a year in the US, and have a plan – on hold for now [because of Covid] – to open more locations. Alfajores have phenomenal potential.” In the UK, Romero’s creative alfajores – yerba mate, Malbec, and dark chocolate and mint are just some of the flavours – have also proved a hit. “Our dream is to take [alfajores] everywhere,” she told me. Yet while alfajores expand globally, the question of why exactly they are so popular in Argentina remains unanswered. Delgado and Ortiz put it down to the national sweet tooth; Oliva suggests a strong emotional attachment that develops in childhood; and Romero believes it is due to a “shared passion”. For Calabró, the reasons behind the Argentine love of alfajores remain a “great mystery”. “It is obvious that they are part of our collective identity,” he said. “[But] do we love alfajores because they are part of our identity or are they part of our identity because, for some strange reason, we decided to love them? There is still no answer.” --- Recipe: Mar del Plata-style alfajores By Maria Romero of Sur Chocolates Ingredients: 110g unsalted butter 80g icing sugar Zest of half an orange 40g eggs 1tbs honey 200g self-raising flour 5g cocoa powder 500g dulce de leche (ideally dulce de leche repostero) 600g 70% dark chocolate Makes 20 alfajores Method: Using a food processor or mixer, blend the butter, orange zest and icing sugar. Then add the egg and honey and continue mixing until pale and creamy. Finally, add the flour and cocoa powder and mix together without overworking the dough. Cover the dough in clingfilm or parchment paper and chill in the fridge for at least two hours. Roll out the dough to 2mm thick and cut out rounds with a 6cm cutter. Place the biscuits on a tray lined with baking paper, leaving a bit of space between each one, and bake for six minutes at 190C. Once the biscuits are cool, fill a piping bag with dulce de leche and use it to cover one side of the first biscuit. Turn a second biscuit upside down (to ensure the outer sides of the alfajores are both as flat as possible), place it on top of the first one and press down gently. Repeat with the rest of the biscuits. For the best results, leave for 24 hours, but if you can’t wait, it’s fine to go straight to the coating. Temper the chocolate and then submerge the alfajores one at a time. Make sure each one is fully coated with chocolate, using a palate knife to remove excess from the top and smoothing the base on the rim of the bowl, and then place carefully on a tray lined with greaseproof paper or cellophane. Once the chocolate dries, the alfajores are ready to eat. Culinary Roots is a series from BBC Travel connecting to the rare and local foods woven into a place’s heritage.

Spread to US Treasury,The indigenous recipe for living well,2024-09-25,2021-02-08,Dimitri Selibas,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20210207-buen-vivir-colombias-philosophy-for-good-living,"Chef Anibal Jose Criollo is helping to spread the indigenous idea of ""Buen Vivir"", that one’s wellbeing is intimately connected to that of the environment and community. 50 Reasons to Love the World - 2021 Why do you love the world? “Because there is a lovely moment [in Nariño, Colombia] when the potato or the arracacha is ready to be harvested and you go past in the morning or at night, and you have the smell of the flowers, and they are special because when they don't have pesticides this aroma leaves you wanting to stay there.” – Anibal Jose Criollo, chef and environmentalist More Reasons to Love the World It's 16:00 near lake La Cocha in Colombia's southern department of Nariño, and the kitchen staff at Naturalia are busy at work. Long light rays of an overcast afternoon mingle with smoke wafting in from the trout being prepared in the scullery next door. Indigenous Colombian chef and environmentalist Anibal Jose Criollo presides over the team inside the humble cabin, pausing to greet a neighbour delivering a basket of fruit while his six-year-old niece Helen sits in a corner, playfully sifting blackberries. Between stoves and an immense square table in the middle of the cabin’s creaky wooden centre, Criollo prepares a mix of local and ancient specialities – herido de frutas rojas silvestres (a warmed alcoholic drink made with a mix of wild red berries), trucha ahumada (smoked trout) from the lake, quinoa arepas and a pork caldo (broth) from a pig that formerly resided in Criollo’s shagra (an ancestral indigenous food garden). This region of Colombia, with its cool climate and high-altitude plains, is known for being different to the rest of the nation, culturally far closer to other Andean countries like Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador, which it borders. Here in the furthest reaches of the Incan empire, the Pasto indigenous people stood firm against Emperor Huayna Cápac, leading him to give them the name ""past awá"" or ""people of the scorpion"" because he supposedly said he ""wanted to step on their heads and they bit me with their tail"". After resisting the Incan imperial advances, the Pastos were later overwhelmed by the Spanish colonial invasion and successive waves of Catholic missionaries. ""[The Spanish] took away our culture... and in the process annihilated us,"" said Criollo. ""But one thing they cannot annihilate is the feeling of ownership of a territory, and that attribute of the territory which is food."" Today, Pasto communities still live in what is now Ecuador and southern Colombia, and they are still fighting to maintain their cultures, which is epitomised by the philosophy of Buen Vivir (""Living Well""). ""Buen Vivir in a few words, is learning to value myself as a human being... learning to value the other and learning to value and care for the environment in which one develops themselves,"" said Criollo. Buen Vivir is a pluralistic worldview that's prevalent among indigenous communities across Latin America and whose principles are shared by different cultures around the world. Similar to the concept of ubuntu from South Africa, it holds that an individual’s wellbeing can only be achieved through harmonious relationships with the wider community – including people, the environment, other living beings, their ancestors and the cosmos. Practically speaking, it encompasses themes like food sovereignty, land rights, environmental justice, economic solidarity and the protection of local biodiversity. According to Criollo and other environmental activists, in an era of coronavirus and climate crisis uncertainty, there has been a global awakening that our way of life need to become less individualistic and more sustainable. Now, the guiding social and environmental principles of Buen Vivir are being considered by outside communities. The philosophy resonated powerfully for Criollo when his restaurant Naturalia closed for seven months during the Covid-19 lockdown. Without his primary income, Criollo sustained his family and himself by growing broad beans, potatoes and arracacha (an Andean vegetable that resembles a cross between a carrot and celery root), among other crops in his shagra. He also made yoghurt from his cows and traded with others in his community through a cooperative-sharing system called mindala. You may also be interested in: • The chef preserving Canada's indigenous identity • Michael Pollan talks about food and identity • The indigenous communities that predicted Covid-19 Fellow Pasto Nancy Margoth Estación Puenayan is part of the Shagreros of Panam Association, whose 26 participating families use their shagra gardens to cultivate traditional seed varieties through growing food and medicinal plants. Puenayan describes the mindala system as, ""the things that we don’t consume ourselves we share, also sharing knowledge about planting and gastronomy."" The UN's Food and Agriculture Association worked in the Nariño department with Pasto communities like Puenayan’s and in 2013 prepared the Mindala and Shagra guide, showing to outside communities the viability of these ancestral models to construct and promote autonomy, sovereignty, security and biodiversity. Protecting the environment is also a central mission for the Shagreros of Panam Association, and in 2018 it won an award from the Nariño government, in conjunction with the Global Environment Facility and United Nations Development Program, for its work in planting native trees which helped to protect the area’s water sources. “If I plant a tree, it then takes care of me. It provides me with seeds, it gives me water, clean air. Each tree is an ecosystem, one supporting insects and biodiversity,” said Criollo, who also works with neighbouring families to reforest areas with native plant species. Working with indigenous and peasant farming families, he has helped to ensure that La Cocha lake – which is considered sacred to indigenous communities – received Ramsar status as a protected wetland, and expanded the area's network of around 100 civil society nature reserves – a Colombian conservation model where private individuals devote part of their land to environmental protection. “What are we connecting? Conservation, clean food production, caring for seeds and looking at culture through the lens of food,” said Criollo. And with Covid-19, this interconnectedness has enabled many more people to revaluate their relationship with the planet. “One of the impacts of the pandemic has been to work towards integral health, highlighting the importance of recuperating the balance between man and nature,” said Luis Eduardo Calpa, who works with the Basque Mundukide Foundation to support Criollo and Puenayan by promoting agroecology, community self-management and responsible consumption by connecting small-scale producers with traditional chefs. “Now the proposal of the indigenous communities has much more validity,” Calpa added. Like other indigenous communities, the Pastos’ traditional ways of life have historically been marginalised, first by Spanish colonialists and then by indifferent national governments. But Colombia’s 1991 Constitution recognised indigenous people’s rights to their own territories and legal and economic systems. Additionally, Colombia’s Constitutional Court’s jurisprudence notes how indigenous land is not only the basis for subsistence, but it is also a living entity that is intimately entwined with indigenous communities' cultural and spiritual practices. Now indigenous and farming communities in southern Colombia are increasingly mobilising to grow healthy food, promote supportive local economies, use ancestral seeds and protect the environment, with shagras and the mindala system forming the cornerstones of this revival. Alba Portillo is the founder and coordinator of the local Guardians of the Seed Network, which currently shares and cultivates more than 2,500 traditional, heirloom and non-genetically modified food species with rural farmers and urban consumers. She says seeds are a sacred part of understanding Buen Vivir, and that the spiritual relationship people have with food is nurtured through cultivating and caring for what you eat. Portillo says that a large part of what the network does is to fight the crisis brought about by big agriculture that relies on chemical fertilisers, herbicides, pesticides and genetically modified seeds instead of those whose unique traits were carefully bred over thousands of years. ""We have lost more than 80% of our agro-biodiversity, which means for each one gone, we have lost a story, an inheritance, an identity in the territory,"" said Portillo. The philosophy of Buen Vivir is also gaining wider recognition among non-indigenous Colombians. In November 2020, the Colombian government created a Buen Vivir fund to finance entrepreneurial projects in indigenous communities. Last May, the ground-breaking documentary series El Buen Vivir (“The Good Life”) launched on YouTube and Colombian television. The series showcased how nine Colombian indigenous communities incorporate, live and embody the concepts of Buen Vivir, with each film created and directed by indigenous filmmakers. And while Colombia is regularly ranked by Gallup as one of the happiest countries in the world, Buen Vivir researcher Martin Calisto Friant, says this seems to speak more about how people there have strong community and family structures and are not dependent on the state or a capitalistic market. In a research paper, Fraint notes that Buen Vivir is the opposite of capitalistic consumerism. Those who follow it aspire for a democratic society where happiness is not bound by material accumulation. It focuses on solidarity, reciprocity and citizenship, thus sharing many elements with recent concepts like degrowth and slow economy. In Friant’s native Ecuador, the government of former president Rafael Correa took radical steps to popularise the principles of Buen Vivir, making it a fundamental pillar of the country’s new 2008 constitution and creating a short-lived secretariat in 2013 to support its implementation.

Spread to US Treasury,The legend of Ireland’s ‘Highwaymen’,2024-09-25,2020-10-29,Ronan O'Connell,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20201029-captain-gallagher-the-legend-of-irelands-highwaymen,"As Ireland prepares for its 100th anniversary of independence, a little-known bandit – and rumours of his buried treasure – are remembered in a remote corner of the country. My mother first told me the tale when I was three years old. Somewhere, in a forest near her hometown of Swinford, Ireland, lay the buried treasure of a folk hero who gave power to the powerless. More than 200 years ago, while Ireland’s County Mayo was patrolled by British soldiers, controlled by English gentry and riven by poverty, one group of Irish men launched an unconventional revolt. They didn't seek to end British rule, or even take back their families’ land. Instead, armed with blunderbusses and an intimate knowledge of Mayo’s mountains, bogs and rivers, these outlaws used surprise and force to reappropriate the wealth of Ireland's British landlords. Like England’s Robin Hood before them, they robbed the rich and gave to the poor. Irish legends soon developed about their ferocity, ingenuity and generosity. None of these highwaymen was bolder than Mayo's Roger “Captain” Gallagher. As a young boy growing up in Australia, I cheered as my mother recounted the stories of him ambushing Ireland’s privileged British occupiers, winced when he was fired upon by soldiers, held my breath as he charged them on horseback and exhaled when he left them in his wake. Now, as an adult, I’ve realised these stories revealed how my ancestors were subjugated by the British, and the way acts of rebellion gave hope to this downtrodden corner of western Ireland. As the Republic of Ireland prepares to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Irish Free State and a century of independence from Britain in 2021, Gallagher’s tale offers a little-known example of Irish dissent against the occupying British. With my 72-year-old mother by my side, I recently followed in Gallagher’s footsteps through Mayo. From Attymass to Barnalyra, Roosky to Lough Talt, we visited locations where Gallagher and his gang of bandits tormented affluent British landowners from the late 1700s until his death in 1818. It was a fascinating excuse to explore the verdant forests, pristine lakes and craggy hills of a county where I’d lived on and off for eight years. More importantly, it allowed me to bond with my mother and absorb her passion for Mayo’s wild landscape and rich history before I had to fly back to Australia. Our pursuit of Gallagher’s ghost began in a place my mother and I knew well. Hemmed by mountains, the glassy lake of Lough Talt long is one of our most cherished locations in Mayo. It is a place where we walked and laughed with my late father, whose passing four years ago drew us even closer. Gallagher was also partial to this lake. As we sat on its shore, with the Ox Mountains peering over our shoulders, my mother explained how Gallagher and his men emerged from nearby trees, firearms cocked, and held up mail coaches laden with the valuables of local British gentry. Suddenly, the bandit was brought back to life. Gallagher was a character so large that, as a child, I could see him clearly from 15,000km away in Perth. My mother used his tales to connect me with my Irish heritage and, when she felt marooned in her new home of Australia, to transport herself back to the wilderness of Mayo. Despite being a lead character of so many historical Mayo legends, there’s surprisingly little public recognition of Gallagher today. There are no statues of him anywhere in Ireland. Printed records of his life are limited. I contacted almost every university history department in Ireland and found that no-one knows much about the man’s life. One of the very few experts who does is Stephen Dunford, a historian and writer from Killala, a tiny Mayo village about 15km north-west of Gallagher’s old stomping grounds. Dunford wrote The Irish Highwaymen, the definitive book on these bandits, so named because the robbers typically assailed their victims as they travelled the roads. To understand Gallagher and his colleagues, Dunford told me, you must first know the environment and era that birthed them. By the time Gallagher first raised a weapon, Ireland had been occupied by the British for 600 years. Recollections were fresh of the atrocities of the mid-1600s, when English general Oliver Cromwell invaded Ireland, quelled an Irish rebellion and his troops likely slaughtered thousands of civilians – including women and children – in the process. You may also be interested in: • A shipwreck undiscovered for 47 years • Is this the world's most dangerous sea route? • A father-and-son pilgrimage on the Tour du Mont Blanc Under Cromwell’s direction, many Irish landowners were dispossessed. Their farms were given to well-off Brits, who acted as landlords, charging the Irish to live on the same land that had been in their families for centuries. Income generated from these properties, through rent and agriculture, went into British pockets. Captain Gallagher’s trail Follow in the bandit’s footsteps on a trip through County Mayo Start your journey at one of County Mayo’s most beautiful lakes, Lough Talt, before driving south to Aclare. Then head west into the Ox Mountains to Roosky, where Gallagher often hid. On the other side of this range, you’ll reach Attymass, where Gallagher met his demise. Then head south to his birthplace of Ballycong. From here, it’s a 20-minute drive south-west to Lough Conn and Glass Island, and then a 30-minute drive south-east, through the historic towns of Foxford and Swinford, to the Barnalyra Forest, where you can hunt for Gallagher’s hidden treasure. “The Irish people knew why they were destitute, they knew exactly who to blame,” Dunford said. “The British were villains. People in Mayo, who had nothing [and] couldn’t even feed themselves properly anymore, were looking at their old homes and old land and then seeing Brits living in them. Then along came Gallagher and his boys, plundering the rich Brits and everyone loved it. Ireland desperately needed some heroes at that time, they needed something to believe in, and the Highwaymen gave them that.” Robbing powerful Brits was, of course, a dangerous occupation. It earned the attention and wrath of police, British soldiers and armed mercenaries hired to protect these landlords. While being hunted, Gallagher needed somewhere to hide, to regroup, to plan his next heist. “That’s a great spot to avoid detection, isn’t it,” my mother said to me, pointing at Glass Island in Lough Conn, which served as one of Gallagher’s safe havens. These days, the narrow, 13km-long lake is a popular swimming destination on the odd occasion it exceeds 20C in Mayo. A smile broke across my mother’s face as she recalled me wincing from the cold when I bathed here as a boy on holiday. While Gallagher relied on refuges like Glass Island, he wasn’t intimidated by his pursuers, Dunford said. Gallagher had the skills, motivation and courage to survive his perilous trade for two decades. He and his cohorts had extensive military training and, crucially, the support of locals who related to Gallagher’s impoverished upbringings in Ballycong, a tiny farming community in the shadows of the Ox Mountains. But according to Dunford, what really earned the respect and loyalty of locals was the generosity of Gallagher’s gang. After robbing mail coaches, they spread their spoils through the community. They also tried to protect Irish peasants bullied by British landlords. “Gallagher made a British landlord eat his eviction notices right here,” my mother said, as we drove into Killasser, the tiny town where this bandit stood up for dozens of Mayo tenement farmers who were being unfairly tossed out of their homes. Ringed by gently sloping green pastures and boasting little more than a church and a pub, Killasser is indicative of dozens of quaint, idyllic villages sprinkled across County Mayo. While Killasser itself may not be remarkable, according to Dunford, what Gallagher did here was extraordinary. When he and his men raided the plush home of this ruthless landlord, they discovered a stack of eviction notices, gathered them up, and demanded the Brit consume them. He was convinced to comply by the gun pressed to his temple. The Highwaymen had dual motivations, Dunford said. First and foremost, they were driven by a desire to help the county’s impoverished residents. But they also knew this charity earned the allegiance of Mayo locals, who would warn them of pursuing authorities and offer them safe haven. Eventually, though, Gallagher’s fortune ran dry in a perpetually rain-soaked land. In 1818, he was hiding in a cabin in Attymass, a picturesque village in the foothills of the Ox Mountains, when he was spotted by a local man with British loyalties who tipped off the soldiers hunting him. Soon, Gallagher was surrounded by 200 British fighters. As he faced execution, Dunford said that Gallagher made one final play. He told the soldiers of a haul of valuables he’d buried in the nearby Barnalyra forest and promised to reveal its location in exchange for freedom. It didn’t work. As soon as Gallagher had been killed, soldiers descended upon Barnalyra, combing the land for days to no avail. Many a treasure hunter has since entered those woods with lofty hopes and exited with vacant hands. The lure of this concealed fortune continues to propel the legend of Gallagher. Yet, more than a cartoonish hero or a colourful folk character, Gallagher is a symbol of Irish defiance. That’s what my mother reminded me as we drove beyond Attymass, through the mountain gap at Roosky, flanked by lakes, ridges and meadows so glorious it’s no wonder Mayo people didn’t want them occupied. “This is your land, too – your past,” she said to me, her tone and expression so earnest that I received it as a plea to keep Mayo with me when she’s gone. I grasped her hand and allayed her fears. Mayo might not be my full-time home, but its imprint on me is permanent. So, too, is Gallagher’s legacy. Forever this county’s sharp winds will carry the tale of an outlaw who challenged the British, galvanised Mayo and enthralled an Australian boy sitting on his Irish mother’s knee.

Spread to US Treasury,The gold mine beneath London's streets,2024-09-25,2016-04-19,Pádraig Belton,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160419-the-city-with-248-billion-beneath-its-pavement,"Under London’s streets lies a hidden gold mine. It stretches across more than 300,000 square feet under the City, the finance quarter in the heart of Britain’s capital. There, beneath the pavement and commuters of Threadneedle Street, lies a maze of eight Bank of England gold vaults – each stacked with gold bars worth a total sum of around £141 billion ($200 billion). The bars sit on rows of blue numbered shelves. Every bar weighs precisely 400 troy ounces (about 12kg), making each currently worth some £350,000 ($500,000), comfortably more than the average price of a house in the UK. Each bar looks subtly different depending on where it was refined. Some bars have sloping edges to make them easier to pick up; others look more like a loaf of bread. There is no smell here: metal has none. There is no noise, either, on account of the vaults’ thick concrete walls. What there is, however, is one of the world’s most important traded assets. Deals are still done in gold in almost every country in the world. Its price is a crucial barometer for consumer confidence. Prices rise when markets are uncertain, and before US elections – like now. “Gold is a hedge against uncertainty,” says Jonathan Spall, a long-time gold trader and now managing director of G Cubed Metal. These vaults lie right at the heart of this volatile, incredibly important market. About one-fifth of all the gold held by the world’s governments is in London. In total, 6,256 tonnes of gold are stored in vaults in and around London – collectively worth about £172 billion ($248 billion). The Bank of England vaults alone hold 5,134 tonnes, including the official reserves of the UK Treasury and the vast majority of the physical gold traded in London. Gold owned by 30 other countries is also in these vaults along with the hoards of about 25 banks. So much gold is kept in Britain’s capital partly to keep it near where the metal is traded. It’s also a reflection of the security of London’s vaults. Hiding your stash The Bank of England vaults were built in the 1930s. During World War II, when Britain’s bullion was secretly moved to Canada to continue the war effort if Britain was overrun, one vault was used as a staff canteen for Bank of England employees. Vintage advertisements for the P&O cruise line, enticing Bank employees away to holiday, are still plastered across the walls. Later, in the 1940s, the vault was used as a bomb shelter. But since 1945, the vaults have been used primarily for gold. Storing your assets in a huge safe might seem more fitting for a Tudor monarchy than a modern central bank. But the Bank of England still uses not only vaults, but several 3ft-long keys for access. Insiders believe that electronic access alone could be more prone to abuse. (You do still have to speak a password into a microphone and a computer matches your voice against a saved sample). The bars arrive in London by surprisingly traditional methods, too. Some come by sea, shipped from refineries like PAMP in Switzerland or Rand Refinery outside Johannesburg in South Africa. Gold is also moved on regular passenger aeroplanes. “In the cargo hold of commercial passenger planes, you often find gold, fresh flowers, and dead bodies,” says Ruth Crowell, chief executive of the London Bullion Market Association. But more difficult than finding transport can be finding a place to house it. Because much of the City of London is on clay ground and because gold is such a dense substance, you can only stack the bars so high before the vault starts sinking into the clay, Crowell says. (The weight of a City skyscraper is spread over a larger footprint, which makes that risk less likely). This is less of a problem in other cities. In Manhattan, which sits on bedrock, the Federal Reserve Bank can stack bars from floor to ceiling. As a result, there are restrictions on how much gold can be stacked in the Bank’s vaults. On the top level, the gold bars can only be stacked four pallets high. On the lower, they can only be stacked up to six. This means London needs to spread out its gold more to stop it sinking, and needs more vaults of smaller sizes. As a result, it isn’t just the City’s streets that are paved with gold. There are seven smaller vaults inside the M25 (the motorway that encircles Greater London) owned by banks like JP Morgan and HSBC, including three at transport companies around Heathrow Airport. Each owner attempts to keep their vault’s location secret. When CNBC journalists visited JP Morgan in 2011, for example, they had to surrender their mobile phones and travel in a car with blacked-out windows. Getting your gold fix It isn’t just vault locations that are kept under wraps. The gold market itself is secretive and steeped in tradition and ritual, particularly around the fixing system used for setting the price. The price setting meetings or “fixes” – in which there are now 12 direct participants hailing from the UK, US, Canada, China and France – take place twice a day. When a price matches supply and demand, the price is fixed. Until 2015, this was done verbally: a chairman would try different prices on the participants, each of whom would say if, at that price, they would be buyers or sellers. From 1919 until 2004 fixes were done in person in the City of London. Originally, if a participant wished to pause proceedings – to change between buying and selling, for example – he would raise a small UK flag. In 2004, the fixes were moved to a conference call. Only last year did the system change to a more modern electronic auction platform run by the Intercontinental Exchange, which also owns the New York Stock Exchange. “If everyone knows there are two key points in the day to show up, you get the best liquidity balance between buying and selling,” says Matthew Glenville, chief operating officer of the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration. This ‘spot’ price is then used as a benchmark for people buying and selling gold around the world, a market where transactions total around £85 billion ($120 billion) a day. Portable assets During good times, gold is less in demand. But when the economy is tough, the metal is highly prized as a safe haven asset – not quite like storing cash under the mattress, but still a way to hedge against risk in other markets. As a result, gold increases in value when markets are volatile. Since the 1,000-point Dow Jones plunge of August 2015, the average price of the morning fix has increased each month, rising from £705 ($1,000) in December to £870 ($1,250) in March. When stock markets slump, governments and private investors ditch equities and buy gold – like Russia and China are doing now. Even so, only 32% of the world’s yellow metal is actually held by governments, banks and investors under lock and key. About 12% is used industrially, such as in electronics circuits. And more than half is used for jewellery. China and India are particularly significant markets for jewellery, together accounting for half of world demand. In India alone, an average of 30 to 40 grams of gold are purchased for each of the country’s 10 million weddings each year. “China and India, between the two of them, accounted for less than 10% of global demand in 2000,” says Ross Norman, chief executive of the bullion dealer Sharps Pixley. “Now it’s north of 90%.” With the current volatility of major currencies and stock markets, it’s little surprise that gold has returned to fashion. One sign? The opening of London’s first high street gold showroom in January. Sharps Pixley is located directly across from the private clubs White’s and Boodle’s in the heart of the upmarket St James’s neighbourhood. The building, which is owned by The Apprentice star Lord Sugar, has an exclusive and club-like interior with dark timber, brass and a large chandelier. If you want to get your hands on some bullion today, Sharps Pixley sells gold over the counter, in bars ranging from a kilogram (£28,058) down to one gram (£33.89). But with prices on the increase, you’d best bring your gold card. This story is a part of BBC Britain – a series focused on exploring this extraordinary island, one story at a time.

Spread to US Treasury,How the Plague made the rich richer,2024-09-25,2020-07-02,"Eleanor Russell, University of Cambridge and Martin Parker, University of Bristol",https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200701-how-the-black-death-make-the-rich-richer,"When a third of Europe’s population was lost, wealth concentrated into tiny groups. Could Covid-19 trigger something similar? This article originally appeared on The Conversation, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence. In June 1348, people in England began reporting mysterious symptoms. They started off as mild and vague: headaches, aches, and nausea. This was followed by painful black lumps, or buboes, growing in the armpits and groin, which gave the disease its name: bubonic plague. The last stage was a high fever, and then death. Originating in Central Asia, soldiers and caravans had brought bubonic plague – Yersina pestis, a bacterium carried on fleas that lived on rats – to ports on the Black Sea. The highly commercialised world of the Mediterranean ensured the plague’s swift transfer on merchant ships to Italy, and then across Europe. The Black Death killed between a third and a half of the population of Europe and the Near East. This huge number of deaths was accompanied by general economic devastation. With a third of the workforce dead, the crops could not be harvested and communities fell apart. One in ten villages in England (and in Tuscany and other regions) were lost and never re-founded. Houses fell into the ground and were covered by grass and earth, leaving only the church behind. If you ever see a church or chapel all alone in a field, you are probably looking at the last remains of one of Europe’s lost villages. The traumatic experience of the Black Death, which killed perhaps 80% of those who caught it, drove many people to write in an attempt to make sense of what they had lived through. In Aberdeen, John of Fordun, a Scottish chronicler, recorded that: This sickness befell people everywhere, but especially the middling and lower classes, rarely the great. It generated such horror that children did not dare to visit their dying parents, nor parents their children, but fled for fear of contagion as if from leprosy or a serpent. These lines could almost have been written today. Although the death rate from Covid-19 is far lower than that of the Black Death, the economic fallout has been severe due to the globalised, highly-integrated nature of modern economies. Add to this our highly mobile populations today and coronavirus, unlike the plague, has spread across the globe in a matter of months, not years. While the Black Death resulted in short term economic damage, the longer-term consequences were less obvious. Before the plague erupted, several centuries of population growth had produced a labour surplus, which was abruptly replaced with a labour shortage when many serfs and free peasants died. Historians have argued that this labour shortage allowed those peasants that survived the pandemic to demand better pay or to seek employment elsewhere. Despite government resistance, serfdom and the feudal system itself were ultimately eroded. But another less often remarked consequence of the Black Death was the rise of wealthy entrepreneurs and business-government links. Although the Black Death caused short-term losses for Europe’s largest companies, in the long term, they concentrated their assets and gained a greater share of the market and influence with governments. This has strong parallels with the current situation in many countries across the world. While small companies rely upon government support to prevent them collapsing, many others – mainly the much larger ones involved in home delivery – are profiting handsomely from the new trading conditions. The mid-14th Century economy is too removed from the size, speed, and interconnectedness of the modern market to give exact comparisons. But we can certainly see parallels with the way that the Black Death strengthened the power of the state and accelerated the domination of key markets by a handful of large companies. Black Death business The sudden loss of at least a third of Europe’s population led to a redistribution of wealth for everyone else. In the longer term, however, people responded to the devastation by keeping money within the family. Wills became highly specific and wealthy businessmen, in particular, went to great lengths to ensure that their patrimony was no longer divided up after death, replacing the previous tendency to leave a third of all their resources to charity. Their descendants benefited from a continued concentration of capital into a smaller and smaller number of hands. At the same time, the decline of feudalism and the rise of a wage-based economy following peasant demands for better labour conditions benefited urban elites. Being paid in cash, rather than in kind (in the granting of privileges such as the right to collect firewood), meant that peasants had more money to spend in towns. This concentration of wealth greatly accelerated a pre-existing trend: the emergence of merchant entrepreneurs who combined trade in goods with their production on a scale only available to those with significant sums of capital. For example, silk, once imported from Asia and Byzantium, was now being produced in Europe. Wealthy Italian merchants began to open silk and cloth workshops. These entrepreneurs were uniquely positioned to respond to the sudden labour shortage caused by the Black Death. Unlike independent weavers, who lacked the capital, and unlike aristocrats, whose wealth was locked up in land, urban entrepreneurs were able to use their liquid capital to invest in new technologies, compensating for the loss of workers with machines. In southern Germany, which became one of Europe’s most commercialised areas in the late 14th and 15th centuries, companies such as the Welser (which later ran Venezuela as a private colony) combined growing flax with owning the looms on which workers span that flax into linen cloth, which the Welser then sold. The broad trend of the post-Black Death 14th and 15th centuries was a concentration of resources – capital, skills, and infrastructure – into the hands of a small number of large companies. The age of Amazon Rolling forward to the present, there are some clear similarities. Certain large organisations have stepped up to the opportunities provided by Covid-19. In many countries across the world, entire ecologies of small restaurants, pubs and shops have suddenly been closed down. The market for food, general retail and entertainment has gone online, and cash has pretty much disappeared. The percentage of calories that restaurants provided has had to be rerouted through supermarkets, and much of this supply has now been taken up by supermarket chains. They have plenty of large properties and lots of staff, with the HR capacity to recruit more rapidly, and there are many underemployed people who now want jobs. They also have warehouses, trucks and complex logistics capacity. The other big winner has been the giants of online retail – such as Amazon, who run a “Prime Pantry” service in the US, India and many European countries. High street shops have been suffering from price and convenience competition from the internet for years, and bankruptcies are regular news. Now, much “non-essential” retail space is closed, and our desires have been re-rerouted through Amazon, eBay, Argos, Screwfix and others. There has been a clear spike in online shopping, and retail analysts are wondering whether this is a decisive move into the virtual world, and the further dominance of big companies. Keeping us distracted as we wait at home for our parcels is the streaming entertainment industry – a market sector which is dominated by large companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime (again), Disney and others. Other online giants such as Google (which owns YouTube), Facebook (which owns Instagram) and Twitter provide the other platforms that dominate online traffic. The final link in the chain is the delivery companies themselves: UPS, FedEx, Amazon Logistics (again), as well as food delivery from Just Eat and Deliveroo. Through their business models are different, their platforms now dominate the movements of products of all kinds, whether your new Toshiba branded Amazon Fire TV, or your stuffed crust from Pizza Hut (a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, which also owns KFC, Taco Bell and others). The other swing to corporate dominance has been the move away from state-backed cash towards contactless payment services. It’s obviously a corollary of online marketplaces, but also means that the money moves though large companies that take their slice for moving it. Visa and Mastercard are the largest players, but Apple Pay, PayPal, and Amazon Pay (again) have all seen increases in their transaction volume as cash sits unused in people’s purses. And if cash is still imagined to be a vector for transmission, then retailers won’t take it and customers won’t use it. Small business has taken a really decisive hit across a wide range of sectors as Covid-19, like the Black Death, results in big companies gaining market share. Even those working at home to write pieces like this are working on Skype (owned by Microsoft), Zoom and BlueJeans, as well using email clients and laptops made by a small number of global organisations. Billionaires are getting richer while ordinary people lose their jobs. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s CEO, has increased his wealth by US$25 billion since the start of the year. But this is not the whole story. The other big trend in the response to the virus has been the strengthening of the power of the state. Governing pandemics At a state level, the Black Death caused the acceleration of trends towards centralisation, the growth of taxation, and government dependence upon large companies. In England, the declining value of land and consequent falls in revenue prompted the crown – the country’s biggest landowner – to attempt to cap wages at pre-plague levels with the 1351 Statute of Labourers, and to impose additional taxes upon the populace. Previously, the government was expected to fund itself, only imposing taxes for extraordinary expenses such as wars. But the post-plague taxes set a major precedent for government intervention in the economy. These governmental efforts were a significant increase in the crown’s involvement in people’s daily lives. In subsequent plague outbreaks, which occurred every 20 years or so, movement began to be restricted through curfews, travel bans, and quarantines. This was part of a general concentration of state power and the replacement of the previous regional distribution of authority with a centralised bureaucracy. Many of the men running the post-plague administration, such as the poet Geoffrey Chaucer, were drawn from English merchant families, some of which gained significant political power. The most outstanding example of this was the de la Pole family, who in two generations went from being Hull wool merchants to earls of Suffolk. With the temporary collapse of international trade and finance after the Black Death, Richard de la Pole became the crown’s greatest lender and an intimate of Richard II. When Italian mega-companies re-emerged in the late 14th and 15th Centuries, they also benefited from the crown’s ever-growing reliance upon merchant companies. The Medici family, who eventually came to rule Florence, are the most striking example. Merchants also gained political influence by purchasing land, the price of which had fallen after the Black Death. Land ownership allowed merchants to enter the land-based gentry or even the aristocracy, marrying their children to the sons and daughters of cash-strapped lords. With their new status, and with the help of influential in-laws, the urban elites gained political representation within parliament. By the end of the 14th Century, the government’s extension of state control and its continued ties to merchant companies drove many nobles to turn against Richard II. They transferred their allegiance to his cousin, who became Henry IV, in the (vain) hope that he would not follow Richard’s policies. This, and the subsequent Wars of the Roses, generally depicted as a clash between the Yorkists and the Lancastrians, were actually partly driven by the nobility’s hostility towards the centralisation of government power. Henry Tudor’s defeat of Richard III in 1485 ended not only the war but also quashed any further attempts by the English baronage to regain regional authority, paving the way for the continued rise of companies and central government. The state we are in The power of the state is something that we largely assume in the 21st Century. Across the world, the idea of the sovereign nation has been central to the imperial politics and economy of the last few centuries. But from the 1970s onwards, it became common among intellectuals to suggest that the state was less important, its monopoly of control within a given territory contested by multinational corporations. In 2016, of the largest 100 economic entities, 31 were countries and 69 were companies. Walmart was larger than the economy of Spain, Toyota larger than India. The capacity of these large companies to influence politicians and regulators has been clear enough: consider the effects of oil companies on climate change denial. And since Margaret Thatcher, prime minister of the UK from 1979 to 1990, pronounced that she intended to “roll back the state”, more and more parts of previously state-owned assets now operate as companies, or as players in state engineered quasi-markets. Roughly 25% of the UK’s National Health Service, for example, is delivered through contracts with the private sector. Across the globe, transport, utilities, telecommunications, dentists, opticians, the post office and many other services used to be state monopolies and are now run by profit-making companies. Nationalised, or state owned, industries are often described as slow, and in need of market discipline in order to become more modern and efficient. But thanks to coronavirus, the state has come rolling back in again like a tsunami. Spending on a level which was mocked as “magic money tree” economics only a few months ago has been aimed at national health systems, addressed the problem of homelessness, provided universal basic income for millions of people, and offered loan guarantees or direct payments to a host of businesses. This is Keynesian economics on a grand scale, in which national bonds are used to borrow money backed by future income from taxpayers. Ideas about balancing the budget appear to, for now, be history, with entire industries now being reliant on treasury bailouts. Politicians the world over have suddenly become interventionist, with wartime metaphors being used to justify gigantic spending. Less often remarked is the astonishing restriction on personal freedoms. The autonomy of the individual is central to neoliberal ideas. “Freedom loving peoples” are contrasted with those who live their lives under the yoke of tyranny, of states that exercise Big Brother surveillance powers over their citizens behaviour. Yet in the last few months, states around the world have effectively restricted movement for the vast majority of people and are using the police and armed forces to prevent assembly in public and private spaces. Theatres, pubs and restaurants are closed by fiat, parks have been locked, and sitting on benches can get you a fine. Running too close to someone will get you shouted at by someone in a high vis vest. A medieval king would have been impressed with this level of authoritarianism. The pandemic seems to have allowed the fiscal and administrative powers of big government to bulldozer arguments about prudence and liberty. The state’s power is now being exercised in ways that haven’t been seen since the second world war, and there has been widespread public support. Popular resistance To return to the Black Death, the growth in wealth and influence of merchants and big business seriously aggravated existing anti-mercantile sentiment. Medieval thought – both intellectual and popular – held that trade was morally suspect and that merchants, especially wealthy ones, were prone to avarice. The Black Death was widely interpreted as a punishment from God for Europe’s sinfulness, and many post-plague writers blamed the church, governments, and wealthy companies for Christendom’s moral decline. William Langland’s famous protest poem Piers Plowman was strongly anti-mercantilist. Other works, such as the mid-15th Century poem the Libelle of Englysche Polycye, tolerated trade but wanted it in the hands of English merchants and out of the control of Italians, whom the author argued impoverished the country. As the 14th and 15th Centuries progressed and large companies gained a greater share of the market, popular and intellectual hostility grew. In the longer term, this was to have incendiary results. By the 16th Century, the concentration of trade and finance into the hands of large companies had evolved into a near-monopoly upon royal and papal banking by a small number of companies who also held monopolies or near-monopolies over Europe’s major commodities – such as silver, copper, and mercury – and imports from Asia and the Americas, especially spices. Martin Luther was incensed by this concentration and especially the Catholic Church’s use of monopolistic firms to collect indulgences. In 1524, Luther published a tract arguing that trade should be for the common (German) good and that merchants should not charge high prices. Along with other Protestant writers, such as Philip Melancthon and Ulrich von Hutten, Luther drew upon existing anti-mercantile sentiment to criticise the influence of business over government, adding financial injustice to their call for religious reform. The sociologist Max Weber famously associated Protestantism with the emergence of capitalism and modern economic thought. But early Protestant writers opposed monopolistic companies and the commercialisation of everyday life, drawing upon anti-mercantile sentiment that had its roots in the Black Death. This popular and religious opposition eventually led to the break from Rome and the transformation of Europe. Is small always beautiful? By the 21st Century we have become used to the idea that capitalist firms produce concentrations of wealth. Whether Victorian industrialists, US robber barons or dot com billionaires, the inequalities generated by business and its corrupting influence over governments have shaped discussion of commerce since the industrial revolution. For critics, big business has often been characterised as heartless, a behemoth that crushes ordinary people in the wheels of its machines, or vampirically extracts the profits of labour from the labouring classes. As we have seen, the arguments between small business localists and those who favour corporations and the power of the state date back many centuries. Romantic poets and radicals bemoaned the way that the “dark satanic mills” were destroying the countryside and producing people who were no more than appendages to machines. The idea that the honest craftsman was being replaced by the alienated employee, a wage slave, is common to both nostalgic and progressive critics of early capitalism. By the 1960s, the idea that there was some fundamental difference between small and large forms of business added environmentalism to these longstanding arguments. “The man” in his skyscraper was opposed to the more authentic artisan. This faith in local business combined with a suspicion of corporations and the state have flowed into the green, Occupy and Extinction Rebellion movements. Eating local food, using local money, and trying to tilt the purchasing power of “anchor institutions” like hospitals and universities towards small social enterprises has become the common sense of many contemporary economic activists. But the Covid-19 crisis questions this small is good, big is bad dichotomy in some very fundamental ways. Large scale organising has appeared to be necessary to deal with the huge range of issues that the virus has thrown up, and the states that appear to have been most successful are those which have adopted the most interventionist forms of surveillance and control. Even the most ardent post-capitalist would have to admit that small social enterprises could not fit out a gigantic hospital in a few weeks. And though there are plenty of examples of local businesses engaging in food delivery, and a commendable amount of mutual aid taking place, the population of the global north is largely being fed by large supermarket chains with complex logistics operations. After coronavirus The long-term result of the Black Death was the strengthening of the power of big business and the state. The same processes are happening much more rapidly during the coronavirus lockdown. But we should be cautious of easy historical lessons. History never really repeats itself. The circumstances of each time are unique, and it simply isn’t wise to treat the “lesson” of history as if it were a series of experiments that prove certain general laws. And Covid-19 will not kill a third of any population, so though its effects are profound, they will not result in the same shortage of working people. If anything, it has actually strengthened the power of employers. The most profound difference is that the virus comes in the middle of another crisis, that of climate change. There is a real danger that the policy of bouncing back to a growth economy will simply overwhelm the necessity of reducing carbon emissions. This is the nightmare scenario, one in which Covid-19 is just a prequel to something much worse. But the huge mobilisations of people and money which governments and large companies have deployed also shows that big organisations can reshape themselves and the world extraordinarily rapidly if they wish. This gives real grounds for optimism concerning our collective capacity to re-engineer energy production, transport, food systems and much else – the green new deal which many policy makers have been sponsoring. The Black Death and Covid-19 seem to have both caused concentration and centralisation of business and state power. That is interesting to note. But the biggest question is whether these potent forces can be aimed at the crisis to come.

Spread to US Treasury,European mission approved to detect cosmic ripples,2024-09-25,2024-01-25,By Jonathan Amos,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68096794,"What will be one of the most ambitious and most expensive space missions ever mounted by Europe has just been given the formal green light. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (Lisa) will try to detect ripples in the fabric of space-time generated when gargantuan black holes collide. These gravitational waves will be sensed by three spacecraft firing lasers at each other over a distance of 2.5 million km (1.5 million miles).    The cost will run into the billions. Scientists believe that studying gravitational waves will help answer important questions about the workings and history of the Universe. Officials at the European Space Agency (Esa) forecast a budget of €1.75bn (£1.5bn; $1.9bn), with additional contributions coming from member states including Germany, France, Italy, the UK, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The US space agency (Nasa) will be a major partner, too. While this sum is considerable, it does represent a life-time cost - and the complexity of the mission means it will not launch before 2035 at the earliest. Esa's director of science, Prof Carole Mundell, likened the cost to each European citizen to that of a cup of coffee, and she hoped they would agree with her that this represented great value for money. ""We're trying to solve some of the big mysteries of physics,"" she told BBC News. ""How do we go beyond Einstein's theory of general relativity (his theory of gravity)? How do we probe the nature of space-time? How do we understand the most violent collisions in the Universe, between supermassive black holes? So, you bring together what is almost science fiction and the science engineering, and we make it a science reality."" Gravitational waves are a prediction of Einstein's equations. They are the ripples of energy that spread across the cosmos at the speed of light when masses accelerate. The waves were first detected in Earth laboratories in 2015. They were produced by the coming together of black holes that were a few times the mass of our Sun. Going into space with detectors will allow researchers to sense much longer wavelength phenomena. ""It's all about size. With Lisa we're talking about sensing the coming together of black holes that are millions of times the mass of our Sun,"" said Prof Harry Ward from Glasgow University, UK. Scientists are particularly keen to study these supermassive objects because their creation and evolution seems to be tied inextricably to that of the galaxies that host them, and probing their properties would therefore reveal details about how the great structures we see on the sky took shape through cosmic history. On Earth, gravitational waves are detected from the perturbations they induce in the path of laser light as it is fired down 4km-long, L-shaped tunnels.  Lisa will use the same principle but fire its beams over a much greater distance, and between three identical spacecraft arranged as an equilateral triangle.  Astonishing measurement precision is needed because although the waves come from colossal sources, their signal is tiny - just fractions of the width of an atom.  Scientists talk about picometres, which are a trillionths of a metre. ""If you scale it up, it's the equivalent to measuring the change in distance to Alpha Centauri to about the thickness of a piece of paper,"" said Dr Ewan Fitzsimons at the UK Astronomy Technology Centre (UK ATC). Alpha Centauri encompasses the closest star system to Earth and is more than four light-years away. Lisa has already been in development for decades, and has gone through various ups and downs, not least with the participation of the Americans. They've been in and out, but are now fully back on board, and will bring important technologies, including the lasers. Esa's Science Programme Committee (SPC) selected Lisa as a candidate mission in 2017. Since then the agency's technical staff, with support from European industry and academia, have been studying whether the mission is actually feasible. A positive assessment has now allowed Esa delegations to formally ""adopt"" the project.  The UK Space Agency has given its support although this has the reservation that a business case still needs to be made to His Majesty's Treasury. This will be submitted shortly and a decision is expected before the end of the year, after which Esa will look to place the major industrial contracts across Europe. Britain is set to provide what are called the optical benches in the spacecraft. These are the mirror systems that corral the laser light beams so their behaviour can be precisely monitored. One of the main data distribution centres will also be hosted in the UK. Thursday's SPC meeting also adopted the Venus mission concept called Envision."
Spread to US Treasury,Wales awaits Christmas Covid rules decision,2024-09-25,2021-12-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-59682599,"Wales is waiting to find out if ministers in Cardiff will reimpose tougher restrictions on businesses and social contact. The Welsh government cabinet met twice on Thursday to decide how to tackle the new Omicron variant, amid alarm at its growing spread in the UK. It is not clear whether they will issue advice, impose new legal restrictions, or do both. The number of Omicron cases in Wales rose by 33 to 95 on Friday. But a ""rapid increase over the coming days and weeks is expected"", according to Dr Meng Khaw, national director for health protection and screening services for Public Health Wales. There will be a press conference, led by Mark Drakeford, on Friday, but more details may be released on Thursday night. Wales' most senior doctor, chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton, advised the public to ""prioritise"" who they see at Christmas. He said the Welsh NHS has been asked to consider cancelling some types of care, which could include planned surgery. It comes as overall UK cases have hit a record for the second day running. First Minister Mark Drakeford predicted Omicron will hit Wales ""very quickly and very steeply"" in January. He said a number of services - from the NHS to bin collections - could be affected if lots of workers are off sick. At a Welsh Parliament committee meeting he warned of estimates indicating the coming wave could see ""half of the population of the United Kingdom will fall ill with coronavirus"". ""That is the most enormous number and it will be compressed in to a much shorter number of weeks than was the case with either Alpha or Delta,"" he said. He said ""fresh assistance"" for parts of the economy most affected by Coronavirus are among the things being considered by the Welsh government. Dr Frank Atherton estimated Wales's Omicron rate was just a ""few days"" behind other parts of the UK. He told BBC Wales the country's health boards had been given ""advice and instructions"" on ways to freeing up capacity in the NHS. ""You can work very closely with social care to make sure that patients who are ready and fit for discharge can get back to where they should be, which is in the community, and you can look to how you can relieve pressure on emergency care by using other ways of providing frontline care to patients."" He advised people to reduce their social contacts. ""We absolutely need to prioritize what we want to do at Christmas, for me it's about seeing family. It's not about going to the pub, it's not about going to a nightclub, it's not about going anywhere that's crowded or indoors."" Could Wales become the first UK nation to reimpose coronavirus restrictions on social contact since they were scrapped in the summer? The mood music from the first minister on Thursday was gloomy, with worries stretching not just from the impact on the Welsh NHS, but to the provision of services themselves given high levels of sickness absence expected. There is no Treasury support in the form of furlough, restricting the support for businesses available if the Welsh government decides some may need to be closed, or restricted. The question is - do ministers feel the situation is so bad they feel they have to act? Plans for possible remote learning in schools have also been announced. A letter from Education Minister Jeremy Miles calls on headteachers to plan for some classes, year groups or the whole school to move online. Schools will have two days at the start of term to plan for pupils' return, meaning some schools will return to class later than planned after the Christmas break. On Thursday the Ministry of Defence announced 98 armed forces personnel have been made available to support the booster programme, working in 14 teams of vaccinators. The UK has been experiencing record high daily Covid cases as the Omicron variant of coronavirus spreads rapidly, with Wales expected to deal with huge numbers of infections in the coming days and weeks. People in Scotland have been asked to limit socialising to three households at a time in the run-up to Christmas, with shops and hospitality venues being told to bring back physical distancing and screens. Welsh ministers will be hoping their plans will be sufficient to cover the festive season and into the New Year, but will keep the option of making further changes during that period should they feel they are needed. Wales' overall Covid rates have fluctuated slightly since November. The latest seven-day rate stands at 500.7 per 100,000 people. Public Health Wales (PHW) reported 2,889 cases on Thursday, and no deaths. The total number of deaths it has reported stands at 6,501. There were warnings that some Welsh firms are already seeing a significant impact on trade. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said Labour ministers ""must use the £500m of unallocated Covid support sitting in government coffers to help firms and protect jobs.  ""It's clear ministers of all colours across the UK are facing a challenging public health picture in an uncertain period. ""However, any consideration and implementation of restrictions must be evidence-based and have an impact on tackling the virus, unlike vaccine passports."" Dr Roland Salmon, a former PHW director, said there was not much evidence that restrictions work. ""Will they do any more than bring a lot of economic harm and long-term health harm to the people who are on the receiving end of those measures?"" he said. ""I'm afraid our best defence is immunisation,"" Dr Salmon told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. Welsh ministers are ramping up Wales' Covid booster campaign, aiming to offer all adults a third jab by the end of this month. But an assistant director at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board warned emergency services may ""possibly not be able to cope"" if Covid cases surge. Wyn Thomas, assistant area director for primary care at the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, was asked by BBC Wales how much leeway there was in capacity, if predictions of a ""tidal wave"" of omicron hospitalisations proved true. He said: ""I don't think there's a lot of leeway.  ""It's not just the hospitals, primary care is very busy, social care is very busy, so I think actually the more people protect themselves and avoid the need to go to A&E or to be admitted to hospital, is going to take pressure off the system, because as we're seeing, this rapid increase means that some people [will] undoubtedly be hospitalised and I think the system is very full at present."" The health board is concentrating its booster jab efforts online and a booking website went live for the first time on Wednesday afternoon attracted 225,000 hits in the first 24 hours."

Spread to US Treasury,"Omicron cases increase by 1,068 in a day",2024-09-25,2021-12-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-59735855,"There are now 2,349 confirmed cases of the Omicron Covid-19 variant in Northern Ireland, the UK Security Agency has said.  The figure, released on Monday, is an increase of 1,068 cases since Sunday.  A total of 2,148 total cases of Covid-19 were recorded in Northern Ireland on Tuesday. The executive is due to meet on Wednesday to discuss the current restrictions in place and decide next steps. However, a leading virologist has said people need to decide ""what they're willing to risk"" in certain situations. ""I think we've seen a lot of that recently with people deciding to stay safe before Christmas so they don't have to isolate, instead of going to the pre-Christmas parties and events,"" Dr Lindsay Broadbent told BBC News NI. ""I think those kind of decisions, along with things like regular lateral flow testing, will help to keep families safe this Christmas."" While Omicron cases rise, other seasonal viruses like colds and flu are continuing to circulate. GP Dr Frances O'Hagan urged people to get a PCR test ""if you have any symptoms related to Covid"". ""When you ring the doctor...the doctor will ask you to get a PCR test,"" said Dr O'Hagan. ""Go ahead and do it, you don't have to wait for us to ask."" Dr O'Hagan said Omicron cases were doubling ""about every two days"". She added that testing was ""so, so important to try and calm the spread"". The executive is considering a range of restrictions - from doing nothing, to imposing lockdown. In reality, it's likely to be something in between, including restricting the number of households mixing and imposing an early closure on hospitality. Considering that Covid numbers in hospitals are falling, as too are the numbers of those dying from the virus, at present Northern Ireland is in a much better place. But the challenge now facing the executive is assessing the health warnings from the medical experts and deciding what, when, and if, they need to move. In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government needs to ""reserve the possibility"" of bringing in new Covid rules as cases of the Omicron variant there surge ahead of Christmas. However, no new restrictions were announced after a meeting of the cabinet on Monday afternoon. Pub owner Fergal Shannon said businesses ""need to know today"" if new restrictions are going to be announced in Northern Ireland. ""We might not be open, by the way they're talking, by the end of the week,"" said Mr Shannon. ""Telling us on Wednesday or Thursday is no good, we need deliveries in and try and get staff sorted and everything now."" He added: ""The uncertainty is getting us."" As of Monday, the number of positive Covid-19 cases confirmed in the past seven days in Northern Ireland was 14,632. There were 276 patients with Covid-19 in hospitals in Northern Ireland on Monday, down from 312 on Friday, when figures were last updated."
Spread to US Treasury,The sound way out of the Covid-19 crisis,2024-09-25,2020-04-20,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-52360616,"The old ""dog 'n' bone"" is back. For decades use of the phone was in long-term decline but the lockdown has sparked a boon in, socially distant, conversations.  It's been a good few weeks for telecoms in general, as terabytes of data have kept us working and entertained.   Companies like Zoom have found a ready and eager new audience for its conference call software. But the art of conversation relies on quality of sound.  And it's one of the curiosities of modern telephony that the thing that seems to work least reliably, or least clearly, is the speaking and listening bit. Help may be on its way along with some good news for the Scottish technology sector. A Chinese company, called AAC Technologies, has announced that Edinburgh is to be the site of its new research centre.  The firm is talking only six Scottish jobs to start with, but they might push that up to 20. As with so many of the small tech operations, this one is tapping the ecosystem of skills in and orbiting around Edinburgh University.  That institution spun out Wolfson Microelectronics, a listed company bought over six years ago by Cirrus Logic. And now, AAC is recruiting from the pool of talent that worked at Wolfson, starting with the boss of the new Edinburgh centre, Colin Jenkins. Their mission is to improve the Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) that function as microphones in a modern smart phone. As explained to me by David Plekenpol, AAC's chief strategic officer, a smart phone now has five or six of these systems embedded in it.   Some do the conventional job of picking up sound, but more are busily tracking sound in order to deaden it, or to cancel out background noise with clever sound wave technology. The applications are widespread.   The autonomous car of the near future will be loaded with such MEMS, as a means of interacting with the passengers, and as a way of controlling sound and soundproofing the interior.  The days of the computer keyboard may be numbered, at least in its current form, as voice controls become more common. As a broadcaster, I am regularly astonished at the quality of sound that can be captured by a basic smart phone, sometimes when you're not even aware where the microphone can be found. I asked Mr Plekenpol whether the phone experience will improve as a result of the effort AAC is putting into MEMS, which it then sells on to the major phone manufacturers. ""That's down to the consumer,"" he said.  It'll improve when phone users demand it. In recent, years, they have demanded ever improving functionality with cameras. If they make the same fuss about the quality of microphone, then the manufacturers will be sure to respond. So why mention this now? For one thing, it's a pleasant and rare experience to be able to report on something positive happening in the economy of April 2020. It's also because, amid the vast outpouring of borrowed government funds to get Britain through the Covid-19 crisis, something quite significant has happened. AAC Technologies is too big and international to benefit directly, but that eco-system from which it now draws is getting a £1bn injection of rescue cash, in loans and grants, to address the needs of start-up firms in bio-science and technology. Because they are often too far from the market to be able to turn to banks for funding, and because they are usually some way from making profit, the emergency government schemes to help business with grants and loan guarantees have not been reaching them. So two elements have been announced by the UK government: one to back up larger tech firms which are already established in raising venture capital. Some £250m has been committed there, with £250m private sector matching funds ( though some sceptics think it should have achieved more private buy-in).  A further £750m is to help smaller firms: those already being backed by Innovate UK (as the name suggests, the government's innovation agency) and grants for those research-rich start-ups that haven't yet come within its orbit. The obvious significance of this is that these companies are the seedbed for future growth and technology developments.  At least as significant is that the government is stepping up its use of risk funds in the sector, in tune with the rhetoric we've been hearing from the prime minister. If loans aren't paid back, they're to be convertible into equity. Innovate UK has already established its role in this, in 13 years investing £2.5 billion, alongside private investors.  Although much of the Boris Johnson agenda - levelling up the regions of England, an infrastructure bonanza, and trade deals post-Brexit - could be blown off course by the health crisis, here is another part of what he wants to achieve, getting some funding that should have an impact long after the crisis is over. There's widespread agreement on that. Those free market Conservatives who thought government has no role in backing and picking winners seem to be silent.  But is it enough? The Scottish government's economy secretary, Fiona Hyslop, has broken with the co-operative vibes coming out of those Cobra meetings, to question the support Downing Street is offering business. While there are criticisms of the way the Scottish government business grants are working, this Holyrood minister has concerns that the new scheme for technology start-ups may fail to work alongside Scotland's economic development agencies. They ought to know many of those firms better than Innovate UK.  She has written to the Chancellor, pushing also for more flexibility on the furlough scheme, to plug gaps in his offer made to the self-employed, and to ""accelerate"" the roll-out of loans to business - so far only reaching 12,000 companies. There is pressure on the Chancellor to increase the extent of government loan guarantees from 80% to 100%. This would remove banks' concern that their loan book could be impaired if those loans turn sour.  But Rishi Sunak has said he is not persuaded. In trying to save the economy from going over the Covid cliff, such rules keep moving, and the costs keep rising."
Spread to US Treasury,Government may U-turn on mandatory NHS staff jabs,2024-09-25,2022-01-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60193410,"Ministers will meet later to decide whether or not to scrap mandatory Covid vaccinations for NHS staff in England. Front-line NHS workers in England must be fully vaccinated by 1 April, meaning they need a first dose by Thursday. If they are not jabbed by April, they will be redeployed or dismissed. Around 77,000 have had no jab at all. Last week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the jabs requirement was being ""kept under review"" but that it was the ""duty"" of NHS staff to get vaccinated. The policy was proposed when Delta was the dominant variant that was circulating and evidence showed being vaccinated significantly cut the risk of catching and spreading the virus.  Since then, a more contagious and slightly milder variant called Omicron has emerged. It has led to an increase in breakthrough infections among people who are vaccinated, although the jabs are still doing a great job at preventing severe cases.  Mr Javid told the Health and Social Care Select Committee on Tuesday that it was right to ""reflect"" on the policy now Omicron was dominant. But it is understood no final decisions have been made. The government has been under pressure from some within the health service to scrap the mandate, arguing that it would lead to a staffing crisis. The Royal College of Midwives warned the policy could have a ""catastrophic impact"" on maternity services, while the Royal College of GPs and Royal College of Nursing called for the deadline to be delayed. But the Department of Health and Social Care has previously insisted the policy was ""the right thing to do to protect patients"". The UK Health Security Agency says vaccines have proven to be effective against hospitalisation, mortality, infection and transmission. ""Several studies have provided evidence that vaccines are effective at preventing infection,"" a recent report said. ""Uninfected individuals cannot transmit; therefore, the vaccines are also effective at preventing transmission."" Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke told BBC Breakfast that while any change to policy would be a decision for the health secretary, he said ""fundamental facts"" had changed due to Omicron and so any decision would take that into account. There are practical and ethical reasons why the mandatory vaccination policy may go. On a practical level the NHS in England can ill-afford staff to be forced out - there are already nearly 100,000 vacancies. And then on an ethical level - as some staff are pointing out - is it right to insist on vaccination when the benefits are not overwhelmingly clear cut with the rise of the Omicron variant? Vaccination against hepatitis B is a condition of employment for some staff, but that is more than 90% effective against infection and immunity last for years. By comparison immunity against Covid infection after two doses has largely gone after 20 weeks. A booster can initially increase protection to around 70% but by 10 weeks that has started to wane significantly too. It certainly helps to reduce spread, but is it enough to over-ride freedom to choose? And if staffing levels drop further because of the mandate could the risks that pose outweigh the benefits the vaccine brings? Protests against the policy have been held in cities across the country - and some NHS staff have said they are even considering moving to work in the UK nations where vaccination is not compulsory. There are no plans in Scotland and Wales to make Covid jabs mandatory for NHS workers or care home staff, while there will be a public consultation on the issue in Northern Ireland. Patricia Marquis, the Royal College of Nursing's director for England, said that while the college would urge all nursing staff to get vaccinated, it ""makes no sense"" to risk losing thousands of workers when there were already many vacancies. She told BBC Breakfast that losing nurses and care staff ""actually puts patients at more risk than not having nurses at all"". Nadra Ahmed, chairwoman of the National Care Association, said she was ""saddened for all the people who may have lost their jobs needlessly"", with mandatory vaccination already in place in that sector since November. She said the policy had had a ""devastating impact"". Government figures suggest 40,000 care staff had not been vaccinated by the deadline - but it is unclear how many of these lost their jobs because of medical exemptions and redeployment to roles away from the frontline. ""The people who we've lost, we hope they'll think about coming back and we will do everything we can to try and encourage them to come back, but they will have found other roles and they may be happier in their other roles now and not want to move again,"" she said.  While the mandatory vaccinations policy is due to come in to force for NHS workers on 1 April, Thursday is the final day on which workers could get their first dose with time to be fully vaccinated by that date due to the separation needed between first and second doses. The latest figures show that almost 95% of NHS staff have had at least one Covid jab, leaving about 77,000 who have not. That compares to around 91% of the general population in England who have had at least one jab, although that includes people aged 12 and over. Speaking to MPs on the select committee last week, Mr Javid said not all of them were in patient-facing roles. He said that while it was the ""professional duty of every NHS worker to get vaccinated"" it was ""reasonable to assume"" that not everyone would do so. Mr Javid said the jabs requirement would be ""kept under review"". When pressed on whether that meant the government was considering scrapping it he added: ""We're reflecting on it because we do have to accept that the virus has changed."" One of those who has said he is prepared to lose his job over mandatory vaccines is specialist paramedic Matt Taylor, 42, who is unvaccinated.  He works in primary care in Cumbria and said that he found the argument for the vaccine ""a bit weak"" as the vaccine has not eradicated Covid as some jabs have done with other diseases in the past.

Spread to US Treasury,Coronavirus spreading in NY like 'a bullet train',2024-09-25,2020-03-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52012048,"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has pleaded for medical supplies, warning Covid-19 is spreading in his state faster than ""a bullet train"". ""The apex is higher than we thought and the apex is sooner than we thought,"" Mr Cuomo told reporters on Tuesday. He said the federal government was not sending anywhere near enough lifesaving equipment to confront the crisis. New York now has over 25,000 confirmed virus cases and at least 210 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday the US has the potential to become the new epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic.  The warnings come as President Donald Trump said he hoped the US would reopen for business next month. ""We need federal help and we need the federal help now,"" Mr Cuomo, a Democrat, said.  ""New York is the canary in the coal mine, New York is happening first, what is happening to New York will happen to California and Illinois, it is just a matter of time.""   The governor blasted the 400 ventilators sent to New York from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.  He said: ""You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators.""  New York currently has 7,000 ventilators, but needs 30,000, the governor said.  Mr Cuomo continued: ""The [infection] forecaster said to me, 'We were looking at a freight train coming across the country.' ""'We're now looking at a bullet train.'"" The state is also looking into creating more healthcare areas, possibly by turning college dormitories and hotels into makeshift hospitals.  With 25,665 cases in New York, the state accounts for more than half of all US infections. The number of new cases in the state is doubling every three days, the governor said, and showing no sign of slowing down.   Mr Cuomo said the rate of infections could overwhelm the healthcare system. New York may need up to 140,000 hospital beds in a worst-case scenario, he said. The governor also said he would not ""put a dollar amount on human life"", in what was seen as an implicit criticism of Mr Trump's concerns that measures to contain the virus could wreck the US economy. ""My mother is not expendable and your mother is not expendable,"" said Mr Cuomo.  On Tuesday afternoon, Donald Trump sat in the verdant White House grounds for a Fox News ""virtual town hall"" and said he hoped to get US businesses reopened by Easter, in just over two weeks. ""A great American resurrection,"" the Fox host suggested. A few hours earlier, Governor Cuomo held a much more sombre press conference at the Javits Center in Manhattan. The building, which three years ago hosted Hillary Clinton's ill-fated election-night party, is now a makeshift field hospital. The president and the governor - two New Yorkers with a long history - clashed over the state's shortage of ventilators to treat the most serious cases.  Mr Trump blamed Mr Cuomo for not purchasing more in 2015, citing a conspiracy-mongering website. Mr Cuomo said the administration should use its emergency powers to order more machines manufactured. When it comes to easing the recent shelter-in-place orders, governors like Mr Cuomo, not the president, will have the final say.  If there's disagreement, however, the American public could be left wondering what to believe. On Tuesday, President Trump told Fox News he hoped the country could get back to normal by Easter, which is 19 days away. Mr Trump, a Republican, said: ""We're going to be opening relatively soon... I would love to have the country opened up and just rearing to go by Easter."" He added: ""Easter is a very special day for me... and you'll have packed churches all over our country."" Mr Trump also warned that otherwise the country could suffer ""a massive recession or depression"". The president said: ""You're going to lose people. You're going to have suicides by the thousands. You're going to have all sorts of things happen.  ""You're going to have instability. You can't just come in and say, 'Let's close up the United States of America, the most successful country in the world by far.'"" Speaking at a White House briefing later, Mr Trump said ""our decision will be based on hard facts and data as to the opening [of our country]"". According to the latest Gallup poll, his approval rating has risen five points this month to 49%, the best of his presidency. There are over 53,000 confirmed cases and more than 700 deaths attributed to Covid-19 in the US.  Dr Deborah Birx, of the White House coronavirus taskforce, said the New York City metro area was the source of 56% of all cases and 60% of all new cases in the country. She advised anyone leaving the region to self-quarantine for two weeks. On Tuesday, Wisconsin, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Mexico, West Virginia and Indiana were introducing stay-at-home orders, bringing the total number of US states under such lockdowns to 17.  Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been debating the details of an economic stimulus package that could total over $2 trillion (£1.7 trillion).  Democrats and the White House indicated negotiations could conclude on Tuesday, with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin saying ""the president wants us to get this done today"". In other developments:"
Spread to US Treasury,US home repossessions suspended amid virus crisis,2024-09-25,2020-03-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51954557,"President Donald Trump has said the US government's housing agency will stop repossessing homes until the end of April amid the coronavirus emergency. Evictions will be suspended over the same time frame in a moratorium protecting eight million mortgages. Mr Trump also invoked a Korean War-era defence act in case the government needs to ramp up production of vital medical supplies. The US has nearly 8,000 cases of Covid-19 and has seen 138 deaths so far. Repossessions (foreclosures) and evictions will be suspended for at least 60 days, said the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The moratorium covers single-family mortgages backed by state-sponsored US mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Property analysts say the move is designed to avoid a repeat of the foreclosure glut seen during the 2008 financial crisis. In the US coronavirus task force's update on Wednesday, Mr Trump said the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which often has a starring role in disaster movies, had been activated at its highest level across the country. The president said two US Navy hospitals ships would be pressed into service to help alleviate an expected shortage of sick beds. The USNS Comfort is expected to be sent to New York Harbor, though defence officials said it is currently undergoing maintenance in Virginia. The other vessel, USNS Mercy, is being prepared to deploy to a location on the West Coast. Mr Trump also announced the US is working on a self-swab coronavirus test to expand diagnostic capacity.  He has directed the US government's drug agency to reduce regulatory barriers for testing. Dr Deborah Birx, co-ordinator for the US coronavirus response, said the caseload would soon soar as laboratories begin running ""tens of thousands of tests per day"".  ""To every American out there, it will be five to six days worth of tests being run in 24 to 48 hours,"" she said. ""So our curves will not be stable until sometime next week."" The White House is asking Americans to postpone any non-essential health or dental procedures to help relieve pressure on the US health system and avoid spreading the virus. Covid-19's spread across the US has caused many hotels, restaurants, bars, venues and other businesses to shutter. In his remarks on Wednesday, the president rejected Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin's warning to Republican senators that US unemployment could rocket to 20% because of the pandemic. Mr Trump said that was only the ""absolute, total worst case scenario"". The US Senate on Wednesday passed legislation 90-8 to provide free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave and expanded safety-net spending for Americans. It is estimated the sick leave and family leave provisions of the bill alone will cost $105bn (£90bn).  Congress and the White House are discussing additional stimulus measures that could cost more than $1tn. "
Spread to US Treasury,Uni to resume in-person teaching after suspension,2024-09-25,2020-09-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-54360834,"A Welsh university will resume in-person teaching after it was suspended due to a spike in coronavirus cases. Aberystwyth University had told students of its decision by email late on Sunday evening after 12 students tested positive for Covid-19. But the university has announced some in-person postgraduate study will start this week, with in-person undergraduate teaching to begin from Monday. Vice-chancellor Elizabeth Treasure said it had been sanctioned by authorities. The university had originally said its decision was based on ""uncertainty"" about the spread of the virus. But Prof Treasure said she was ""extremely pleased"" to get the ""unanimous support"" of Public Health Wales, Hywel Dda University Health Board and Ceredigion County Council to resume in-person teaching. ""This is excellent news for us and our students,"" she said. ""We will continue to ensure that the safety of our students, staff and the wider community is our priority, and we're very grateful for the way local, regional and national partners have worked swiftly with us to recognise that the best thing for our students to be doing right now is taking a full part in their learning activities."" Prof Treasure said the university would ""continue to impress on everyone"" the importance of observing Welsh Government restrictions and guidelines. ""We recognise this is a difficult and unprecedented time for students, and we have a range of support services available to help them,"" she added. ""We need restraint and restrictions on social activity in particular - every student must remain with their own student household and not mix with other households in a social setting."" Eifion Evans, Ceredigion council's chief executive, said the council was ""pleased"" face-to-face teaching could resume. ""These measures will be kept under constant review as the days progress,"" Mr Evans added."
Spread to US Treasury,Stocks rebound as US and UK seek to calm investors,2024-09-25,2023-03-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64985356,"Stock markets around the world have bounced back after the US and UK governments again reassured markets about banks' stability. Investors have recently been unnerved by a string of bank failures. But US stock markets were higher after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen signalled the US government would protect people's deposits if another bank collapsed. In the UK, the FTSE closed 1.79% higher after gains in top bank shares. NatWest, Prudential and Barclays shares gained about 5%, while Standard Chartered and Lloyds also traded higher. Ms Yellen said ""the situation is stabilising, and the US banking system remains sound"" in a speech on Tuesday. This follows the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank earlier this month. The failures were triggered by depositors rushing to withdraw money after anxiety over the banks' health. And last week, a group of the biggest US banks raised $30bn (£24.5bn) in funds for regional lender First Republic Bank, but its share price still crashed by more than 45% on Monday. Ms Yellen said the US intervention in the two bank collapses was necessary to ""protect the broader banking system"", after promising that all depositors in both banks would be protected. She added that similar action could be taken if if the same happens to other smaller banks, indicating that savers would not lose their money if another bank were to collapse. Meanwhile, in the UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told MPs that the UK's financial system is ""fundamentally strong"" after facing questions from Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves. Ms Reeves asked whether the system is ""adequate to protect taxpayers and depositors"" and if the government can be confident that no other UK banks are vulnerable to failure after Silicon Valley Bank UK's collapse. There has also been further instability, including Swiss bank Credit Suisse having to be rescued by rival UBS. Mr Hunt said that markets are unsettled, but the UK financial system is ""fundamentally strong"" and UK banks are have enough money - much more than before the 2008 financial crisis. ""We continue to monitor the situation carefully,"" he added. The Bank of England along with six central banks around the world, including the US Federal Reserve, joined forces on Monday to help contain the spread of the crisis by boosting dollar flows into the financial system. It means that banks can borrow dollars from the central bank through the course of the seven-day-a-week facility. But so far, no banks have used the so-called swap line, suggesting that stress levels in the UK banking system are currently low. "

Leading the mourning, the new Prime Minister Liz Truss said the Queen had been ""the rock on which modern Britain was built"". ""Britain is the great country it is today because of her,"" she added. Ms Truss met the Queen earlier this week in Scotland when she was appointed prime minister. Speaking from Downing Street, she said the Queen had been ""determined"" to continue carrying out her duties. She said the nation should now come together to help the new monarch King Charles III ""bear the awesome responsibility that he now carries for us all"".  ""God save the King,"" she concluded. Ms Truss was informed of the Queen's death at 16:30 BST by senior civil servant Simon Case while she was working in Downing Street, her official spokesman has said She spoke to the King shortly after making her statement. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the country would ""always treasure Queen Elizabeth II's life of service and devotion to our nation and the Commonwealth"". ""Above the clashes of politics, she stood not for what the nation fought over, but what it agreed upon. ""So as our great Elizabethan era comes to an end, we will honour the late Queen's memory by keeping alive the values of public service she embodied."" House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said the Queen had ""exercised a calm and steadying influence over our country"". He added that she had given people's lives a ""sense of equilibrium"" during her 70 years on the throne and maintained ""unwavering devotion to the UK"". He also said she had provided ""advice and the benefit of long experience to 15 prime ministers during her reign"". Parliament is expected to meet on Friday from midday and Saturday from 14:00 to pay tribute to the Queen. All six living former prime ministers have also sent their condolences and shared memories of the Queen. Ms Truss's predecessor Boris Johnson tweeted that the Queen would be remembered for her ""deep wisdom, and historic understanding, and her seemingly inexhaustible but understated sense of duty"". ""Relentless though her diary must have felt, she never once let it show, and to tens of thousands of events - great and small - she brought her smile and her warmth and her gentle humour - and for an unrivalled 70 years she spread that magic around her kingdom. ""She seemed so timeless and so wonderful that I am afraid we had come to believe, like children, that she would just go on and on."" Theresa May tweeted: ""On the 75th anniversary of VE Day, Her Majesty reminded us to 'never give up, never despair'.  ""It was an address that captured not just the national spirit, but Queen Elizabeth's spirit - a sense of quiet determination, of courage, of faith and of hope in the future."" During her 70-year reign, Queen Elizabeth held weekly meetings with the prime minister of the day.  Recalling these conversations during an interview with the BBC, Mrs May said the Queen was ""immensely knowledgeable"" adding: ""Many people don't realise how much work the Queen put into her red boxes, to understand the issues of the day, what was going on in government and around the rest of the world."" Sir John Major - who served as prime minister between 1990 and 1997 - echoed Mrs May's thoughts describing the Queen as ""exceptionally well briefed"".  ""On foreign affairs, she would often say if there was a difficulty of a foreign leader 'Well, I met him many years ago' or even 'I knew his father'."" Sir John said the meetings were not always serious and often filled with ""a great deal of gossip... those meetings with the Queen were always the better part of a prime minister's week"". David Cameron described the Queen as ""the world's most experienced diplomat"" and said he was ""fortunate"" to have been able to call on her knowledge during his time in office.  Gordon Brown said the Queen was a ""compassionate, dedicated, wonderful public servant and nobody will ever forget the contribution she made to our country. ""She was a peacemaker, she brought people together, she listened to people."" Sir Tony Blair - who was prime minister between 1997 and 2007 - said: ""We have lost not just our monarch but the matriarch of our nation, the figure who more than any other brought our country together, kept us in touch with our better nature, personified everything which makes us proud to be British."" He recalled his last meeting with the Queen when he said she had been on ""sparkling form"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the Queen represented ""duty and courage, as well as ""warmth and compassion"".  Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon praised the Queen's life as ""one of extraordinary dedication and service"". The Queen died at her Balmoral estate in Scotland and Ms Sturgeon said she hoped it would be ""a source of comfort to her family that she spent her final days in a place that she loved so much"".  Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said the Queen had ""firmly upheld the values and traditions of the British Monarchy"" and offered his ""deepest condolences""."
Spread to US Treasury,Ferries 'need financial help to survive pandemic',2024-09-25,2020-04-04,By Katy Austin,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52166995,"The trade association that represents ferry companies transporting goods in and out of the UK has called on the government to provide financial support quickly to keep services running. The UK Chamber of Shipping said a steep drop in passenger numbers due to the coronavirus pandemic meant it was fast becoming cheaper to stop using ships.  Services are just days away from being severely reduced, the group said. The Department for Transport said it will continue to engage with companies. The majority of the UK's trade in goods is transported by sea, and up to 50% of the nation's food is imported. The UK Chamber of Shipping warned if businesses severely cut back services, then supplies of food, medical equipment and other imported goods would be put at risk.  The group added it was cheaper to cease using ships, rather than keep them running at a loss. However, ferry companies such as P&O, Brittany Ferries and Stena need income from passengers too to stay profitable. A number have already reduced services as that income has dropped off.  P&O Ferries, which carries around 15% of the UK's imported goods, including food and medicines, announced it was suspending its passenger business. It is furloughing more than 1,000 staff, using the government's job retention scheme. P&O Ferries told the BBC that the company needs £257m to keep going. The BBC understands the company wants £150m of that to come from the government. Most passengers have also vanished from buses and trains, and the government has intervened to ensure they keep running. The ferry industry argues it too needs bespoke financial support to stay viable. Bob Sanguinetti, chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping, told the BBC: ""We have a number of companies explaining how much money they're losing - we're talking millions every day.  ""What we're asking for is not a wholesale bailout, it's for the government to share and underwrite some of the risk and the costs to allow the ferry companies to continue providing that vital, lifeline service to the country."" He said it was unclear how the furlough scheme could be applied to seafarers. It is not yet clear exactly what form any support could take, and different companies will have different needs. But it's thought the industry as a whole could ask for hundreds of millions of pounds to stay afloat, effectively asking for supply routes to be subsidised. Another sector requesting a support package is temperature-controlled storage and distribution of fresh and chilled food and drink.  The Cold Chain Federation's chief executive Shane Brennan said businesses involved in warehousing and transporting products had been rocked by a bottleneck in storage - as customers, such as restaurants, no longer need goods to be delivered. They usually make money from goods being moved around. The Department for Transport says it recognises the challenges currently facing transport businesses.   But having already announced emergency rescue packages for the economy worth hundreds of billions of pounds, the headache for the Treasury will be deciding how many stricken industries to individually assist, and which are in most urgent need.

Spread to US Treasury,New job starters 'petrified' over wage help scheme,2024-09-25,2020-03-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-52109284,"People who started jobs in March have been left ""petrified"" after discovering thousands are not eligible for government wage grants. Chancellor Rishi Sunak outlined a scheme where companies could apply for a grant worth 80% of their employees' salaries - up to £2,500 a month. But in order to qualify, workers would have had to start their new job by 28 February, meaning a significant number have fallen through the cracks. Many have called the cut-off ""unjust"". Companies are choosing to furlough staff as industries grind to a halt during the crisis, and support has been offered to people who are long-term self-employed. But workers who began working at companies on or after 1 March will not be able to receive a government grant, and some have been forced to take unpaid leave.  Natalie Greenway left a job in retail management to start a new job as a customer services manager at a call centre on 16 March.  The 24-year-old, from Burbage in Leicestershire, said: ""I got the call from my company saying 'we're so sorry, we can't furlough you'.  ""They were really sympathetic and offered to keep me on the books unpaid so I could have a job to go back to. ""I'm staying on the books, I'm not entitled to jobseekers as I am employed."" One man from Halifax in West Yorkshire said he and his family are having to make ends meet on his partner's £140-a-week statutory maternity pay.  They have a three-month-old baby and were intending to get married in Gibraltar in May.  But he has gone on unpaid leave after starting his new job at a car parts logistics firm on 9 March.  He said: ""My new employer's been really good, I've got assurances that I can go back to my role once things get back to normal, but there's no time frame."" ""Thousands of families could be at risk of losing their home, and they could be at risk of not being able to feed their family. ""It's unjust, it doesn't feel true and fair."" He is also on immunosuppressant drugs for a pre-existing condition, and is limited to working from home.  They have now taken a three-month mortgage repayment holiday on their new home. His partner said: ""I'm petrified, the fact that we could lose our home and we've got a three-month-old baby."" Zoe Badder, from Penrith in Cumbria, was due to start a new administrative role at a solicitors on 23 March, but her start date has now been delayed. The 26-year-old said: ""I rent with my partner, and he is working but he's just been furloughed. ""We're not in as bad a situation as some people, but money is going to be very tight.""  Her situation inspired the Twitter hashtag #newstarterfurlough, which has been used thousands of times. More than 12,000 people have signed an online petition asking the government to amend the cut-off date. Labour Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has called on the government to include workers who started new jobs after 28 February. According to finance expert Martin Lewis, some people can return to their old place of work to receive furlough payments. ""Sadly many employers won't do it,"" he said. ""However the fact it is confirmed to be legal and it can be done, may help persuade some."" A Treasury spokesman said: ""Our Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is protecting thousands of jobs up and down the UK - with the government covering 80% of the salary of furloughed workers.   ""Firms can re-employ staff made redundant after 1 March and those who do not qualify will be able to access a range of other support - including an increase in the Universal Credit allowance, income tax deferrals, £1bn more support for renters and access to three-month mortgage holidays.""

Spread to US Treasury,Nursing and home care cost models to be debated,2024-09-25,2023-06-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-65966966,"Proposals have been put forward to create a ""fairer"" system for accessing and paying for nursing, residential and home care. In July, Tynwald will be asked to support further research into two models that would either remove direct charges or cap the amount paid. The issue has been looked at by the Health and Care Transformation Team.  Health and Social Care Minister Lawrie Hooper said it was time to rethink how the care should be paid for. He said the two models being put forward were a ""mixed model"", which would see a threshold and cap on care fees paid and a ""free personal care model"" without any specific charges. Both would require people to meet their own accommodation and living costs. Under the current system, those with assets must pay for their care and much of the support offered is in a residential home setting, rather than home care. The models were originally included in a report in 2018 which outlined six potential models. Mr Hooper said although introducing a new model would cost ""tens of millions of pounds"", the current burden on individuals who needed care was ""disproportionate"". He said the proposals would see the cost ""better spread more fairly across all of us"", similarly to the approach to GP appointments and hospital care. ""Just because you get old, it doesn't mean you should be treated any less fairly,"" he added. Treasury Minister Alex Allinson, who is also on the transformation team, said now was the time to ""go forward with quite a significant reform of the way that social care is funded once we've determined that pathway"". ""Then we can see how much it will cost to get that balance between what the individual pays and what the state pays or the taxpayer pays to help them,"" he added.

Spread to US Treasury,Ukrainians tied to Biden probe face treason charge,2024-09-25,2023-11-15,By Phil McCausland,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67425906,"Three Ukrainians who aided the Donald Trump campaign's efforts to discredit the Biden family have been charged with treason. The 2019 drive was led by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was Mr Trump's personal lawyer at the time. It centred on unproven allegations that Joe Biden had corrupt dealings with Ukraine as vice-president. Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) said the three men charged were paid by Russian military intelligence (GRU).  It added that they had used a ""tense political situation"" to harm Ukraine's reputation abroad. The three men charged are understood to be current MP Oleksandr Dubinsky, former lawmaker Andriy Derkach and ex-prosecutor Kostyantyn Kulyk.  Mr Dubinsky has denied the charges. All three are said to be members of an agent network led by Russian Gen Vladimir Alekseyev, the deputy head of the GRU.  The charges allege they pursued ""information subversive activities"" related to the 2020 US election and were paid $10m (£8m). The men are accused of helping to spread the falsehood that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the recent US elections. The allegations against Mr Biden involved the business dealings of his son Hunter, who was a director of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma. Mr Trump and his allies suggested that Mr Biden, as Barack Obama's vice-president, encouraged the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, because he had been investigating Burisma. Hunter Biden has since filed a lawsuit against Mr Giuliani for ""the total annihilation"" of his privacy via the former New York mayor's search for damaging information related to the Biden family. Ukrainian authorities did not explicitly identify Mr Dubinsky, instead using his alleged Russian intelligence call sign ""Burtino"".  However, the lawmaker identified himself in a Telegram post, saying that a court in Kyiv had ordered his detention for 60 days on the basis of the charges.  Mr Dubinsky denied all wrongdoing in a series of posts on Telegram and alleged that he faced political persecution directed at him by President Volodymyr Zelensky's office.  He faces 15 years in prison and the forfeiture of his assets if convicted.  Mr Derkach and Mr Kulyk fled Ukraine after Russia's invasion in 2022, the SBU said. Mr Dubinsky, Mr Derkach and Mr Kulyk were previously sanctioned by the US government in the final days of Mr Trump's administration for their alleged efforts to undermine the 2020 election in the US.  The Treasury Department identified Mr Derkach as a Russian agent. He is named in the nearly 1,000-page report produced by the US Senate Intelligence Committee on Russia's interference in the 2016 US election.  Mr Derkach publicly met Mr Giuliani in Ukraine in 2019 as part of their effort to link Hunter Biden to corruption in Ukraine.   He also appeared with Mr Giuliani in right-wing US media ahead of the 2020 election, where they shared details of their alleged investigation. Separately, while serving as a Ukrainian deputy prosecutor general, Mr Kulyk wrote a 2019 memo that pushed for Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board.  It included unsupported claims that he had evidence President Joe Biden unlawfully enriched himself, which reportedly sparked Mr Giuliani's search for incriminating information in Ukraine. Mr Giuliani, like Mr Trump, faces numerous legal issues in the US related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.  Mr Trump also pushed for Ukrainian lawmakers to investigate Hunter Biden, most famously in a phone call with President Zelensky.  Congressional Democrats impeached the former US president as he had withheld military aid for Ukraine while pressuring Mr Zelensky. Mr Trump was later acquitted in the US Senate with Republican support. "
Spread to US Treasury,The Martians are coming!,2024-09-25,2013-10-30,Jordan Hoffman,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20131029-war-of-the-worlds-viral-radio,"Orson Welles’ vision of the apocalypse from Mars anticipated today’s Hollywood storytelling and our own doom-minded moment, writes Jordan Hoffman. We interrupt this article to bring you a special bulletin: the legendary radio broadcast of HG Wells’ The War of the Worlds, presented by Orson Welles on 30 October 1938, is celebrating its 75th anniversary. It catapulted its already notorious director to superstardom, sent radio listeners into panic (though to what degree is the subject of debate), and put Grover's Mill, New Jersey on the map. More striking, however, is just how current everything about the broadcast remains. Recent years have seen a barrage of mass destruction in film and television, from Cloverfield to The Walking Dead to the final battle of Man of Steel. Changes in technology, most notably mobile phone cameras, have also given birth to a new subgenre rooted in fooling its audience: the ‘found-footage’ horror film. We are not likely to be fooled by radio today, but The War of the Worlds set the stage for equivalent 21st-Century freak outs. Welles’ radio programme The Mercury Theatre on the Air began airing adaptations of classic literary works in July 1938. After 16 programmes including Treasure Island and The Count of Monte Cristo, Welles decided that for the night before Halloween he would try, as he put it, “the radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying ‘Boo!’” The result was a perfect marriage of content and form – a horrifying examination of the apocalypse presented in a new, and therefore frightening, medium. Apocalypse now Stories of humanity’s end go all the way back to Noah and the flood, but the kind of apocalyptic narrative that resonates most is often determined by the political and social factors of its time. In 1938 Americans were looking nervously toward Europe and the threat of fascism. Annalee Newitz, editor-in-chief of sci-fi website io9.com and author of Scatter, Adapt and Remember: How Humans Will Survive a Mass Extinction, believes that an ‘end-it-all story’ was just what radio listeners wanted. “[It was] very satisfying for an audience that doesn't know what to expect next and doesn't want to worry about the future,” Newitz says. She feels anxious people still reeling from World War I and the influenza pandemics that followed it, worldwide economic depression and the fear of further conflict in Europe found a tale of definitive destruction like The War of the Worlds to be “comfort food.” Similar anxieties about an uncertain future invade the minds of pop culture consumers today. The world has yet to catch its breath after the attacks on the World Trade Center, wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, housing bubbles, fiscal cliffs and a news culture breathlessly looking for a new threat. The number of recent films featuring unstoppable doom on the scale of The War of the Worlds has been vast. There have been aliens (Cloverfield, Skyline, Battle: Los Angeles) and viruses (the Resident Evil series, 28 Days/Weeks Later, Contagion). We have seen human biology stop working (Children of Men, Perfect Sense) and the Earth explode for no reason (2012, Knowing, Melancholia). Newitz cites the critical and popular success of Cormac McCarthy’s 2006 novel The Road, which, like Welles’ War of the Worlds, possesses very little in terms of backstory. The fear and uncertainty of government is blasted away [in The Road],” she says. “For an audience worried about unknowable terrorist enemies and confused by complex tax and health insurance policies, you strip that off and worry instead about the basics: food, shelter and broken legs.” Orson’s Martians The Mercury Theatre’s broadcast offered its similarly knotted-up listeners a heaped plate of the same fare. Loosely adapting HG Wells’ 1898 sci-fi novel, the programme was a fourth-wall-breaking peek at what a radio station would sound like giving an on-the-scene news report of an unstoppable interplanetary invasion. No one knows for certain to what extent Welles had intended to spread panic, but certain facts remain. CBS' Mercury Theatre on the Air was not the most popular programme during the 8 pm time slot on Sundays. That was NBC's Chase and Sanborn Hour, a variety show. But Welles knew precisely when Chase and Sanborn cut to a musical interlude, which was also when many people would spin the dial to see what else was on. That was when his War of the Worlds, which at the time was masquerading as a similar variety show gave its first heart-stopping “we interrupt this broadcast”. Since Mercury had only middling ratings, it was not a sponsored show. As such, it did not have regularly scheduled commercial breaks. So if you were somebody who switched over without hearing the introduction, you had a solid half-hour remaining of frenzied reporting from the frontline of the advancing apocalypse. “There were no other points of verification back then. You couldn't crowdsource on Twitter or check CNN.com,” says media consultant Max Dawson, a former professor of Radio, TV and Film at Northwestern University. The absence of conflicting reports may have had a greater psychological effect. The other networks might have been covering up what was happening or, considering that the machinations of large radio networks were still unknown to people, it could also be easy to believe that CBS had the only scoop. Indeed, the most terrifying moments in Welles' broadcast include the use of dead air – an intentional ‘technical difficulty’ – analogous to today's viral videos and found-footage movies shot using shaky mobile phone cameras. It is far more difficult to determine if something is fake if its form is imperfect. Fool me once “New technologies are magnets for our fears, and new media is a flashpoint because communication is so central to our experience,” Dawson adds. The Blair Witch Project, a spiritual grandchild of Welles' War of the Worlds, was the first to exploit the internet to spread misinformation in the name of entertainment. And no movie campaign since has pulled the wool over our eyes in quite the same way. It wasn't just the use of then ‘prosumer’ video but the false website that claimed the movie was actually stitched-together from uncovered raw stock. Still, if not actually fooling the audience, other found-footage movies, like Cloverfield and Paranormal Activity have had some success. And always these are movies meant to scare the pants off of people. “Technology changes, anxiety stays the same,” Dawson says. “It's somewhat endearing.” If we aren't going to be duped by radio or movies again, what is next? Perhaps social media. “I want to see the Orson Welles of Vine,” Dawson jokes. “I look forward to seeing creative people who understand how new platforms can confront our enduring anxieties.” While fears of terrorism and a fragile global economy remain, and new technology proliferates, there will be no lack of psychological demand for stories of the apocalypse. The most effective storytellers will understand how to translate – and exorcise – real-world fears into symbolic mythmaking, just like Welles did. What was the first mainstream movie to exploit 9/11 imagery for horror-entertainment catharsis, after a tacit agreement in Hollywood to pull back a bit? A certain film by Steven Spielberg in 2005: an adaptation of War of the Worlds.

Spread to US Treasury,The idea that shaped the world,2024-09-25,2016-10-06,Tom Hodgkinson,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160920-how-utopia-shaped-the-world,"In the nearly-500 years since its publication, Thomas More’s Utopia has influenced everything from the thinking of Gandhi to the tech giants of Silicon Valley, writes Tom Hodgkinson. An English lawyer, statesman, writer and saint, Thomas More was a strange character. Born in 1478, he was progressive in some ways (he educated his daughters to a very high level) while also clinging to archaic customs (he wore hair shirts). An establishment figure, he was also an enemy of the Protestant Reformation and is known today as a Catholic martyr, having been beheaded by King Henry VIII. Today, though, we may know More best for his invention of a word – and for his development of an idea that would be exported around the world. This concept would shape books, philosophies and political movements as varied as Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, Mahatma Gandhi’s doctrine of passive resistance and the founding of the state of Pennsylvania. The idea, of course, was ‘utopia’. More coined the word to describe an island community with an ideal mode of government. First published in Latin in 1517, the book Utopia means “no place” in Greek; some scholars have said that it may also be a pun on “happy place”. More’s Utopia was not the first literary work to play around with policy ideas: dreaming of a better life is an innate part of being human. In 380 BC, Plato wrote his dialogue The Republic, in which Socrates describes a communistic, egalitarian city-state ruled by philosopher-kings called guardians, made up of both men and women. Instead of procreating within a family unit, these leaders leave the city once a year for a wild sex orgy. The resulting children, happily ignorant of their real parentage and brought up by the state, become the new generation of guardians. Various medieval works also imagined what an ideal society might look like. The great writer Christine de Pizan, who worked for the royal court in France, published The Book of the City of Ladies in 1405. Illustrated by a gorgeous painting of medieval ladies building a city brick by brick, the book defends women’s accomplishments over the aeons and sets up a symbolic city populated by a pantheon of “all women who have loved and do love and will love virtue and morality” – a city meant to be a refuge from patriarchy. Written more than 500 years before Germaine Greer’s feminist milestone The Female Eunuch, it deserves a mention: for most of history, utopian ideas – at least those that made it to publication – have generally been written by men. A very different idea of utopia, meanwhile, also entered the mainstream by the mid-14th Century. This was the Land of Cockaygne, a utopia concocted by medieval peasants and preserved in the Kildare Poems, compiled around 1330 in Ireland. Memorably imagined by Pieter Brueghel the Elder in his 1567 painting, Cockaygne was a land of no work, equality between men and women and no authority figures. It shared one or two features with More’s Utopia – notably a lack of private property – but was a lot more fun. As the poem goes: There are rivers broad and fine Of oil, milk, honey and of wine Every man may drink his fill And needn’t sweat to pay the bill. A key feature of the Land of Cockaygne? Free love. Monks and nuns cavort freely. After prayers, the nuns throw their clothes off and jump into the lake: When the young monks see that sport, Straightway thither they resort, And coming to the nuns anon, Each monk taketh to him one, And, swiftly bearing forth his prey, Carries her to the Abbey grey, And teaches her an orison, Jigging up and jigging down. But though there may always have been fantasies of a communistic Golden Age stretching back through the Middle Ages to antiquity, Thomas More’s genius was to give it a name and create a handy philosophical idea. Man with a plan In part, Utopia was an attempt to cling to the medieval ideal of the contemplative life – an ideal that the Reformation, which privileged action and change, was ‘disrupting’, to use the modern coinage. Monkish life itself was under attack from the forces of the Reformation, and was soon to reach a climax with the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536. More writes of the Utopians: “They think that the contemplation of nature, and the praise thereof coming, is to God a very acceptable honour.” However, like a good modern politician, More also emphasises that Utopia is a land of hard-working families: “idleness they utterly forsake and eschew, thinking felicity after this life to be gotten and obtained by busy labours and good exercise.” More’s ideal state is puritanical. His vision of a perfect society was a long way from the sensual self-indulgence dreamt of by the peasants in Cockagyne. Forget free love and lying around doing nothing. Instead, in Utopia, there is a class of bosses – called the Syphograuntes – who look out for work-shy slackers. And citizens are constantly being watched. More writes: “You see how it is – wherever you are, you always have to work. There’s never any excuse for idleness. There are also no wine-taverns, no ale-houses, no brothels, no opportunities for seduction, no secret meeting-places. Everyone has his eye on you, so you’re practically forced to get on with your job, and make proper use of your spare time.” Utopia has communistic elements too. More had been influenced by the travel literature of the time, particularly Amerigo Vespucci’s accounts, which circulated widely. Vespucci had apparently met tribes of natives who lived in decidedly non-capitalist fashion, as the explorer describes in his memoirs: “They neither sell not buy nor barter, but are content with what nature freely gives out of her abundance. They live in perfect liberty, and have neither king nor lord. They observe no laws. They have their habitations in common, as many as six hundred sharing one building.” Like Plato’s Republic, More’s Utopia is the creation of a well-meaning member of the upper classes with a plan, rather than the live-for-the-moment dream of a peasant or worker. In Utopia, private property is abolished. “There is nothing within the houses that is private or any man’s own,” writes More. Every three months, the people pile up loads of stuff in the market place; anyone can come along and take what they need – like a recycling centre. Above all, Utopia was the earnest attempt to create a fair society, not one which benefited only the rich. “I can perceave nothing but a certein conspiracy if rich men procuring their own commodities under the name and title of commonwealth,” More writes. Designs for living More’s fantasy opened the floodgates for a new wave of utopian writing in the 17th Century. Most of these visions looked either backward or forward: they celebrated an old-fashioned ideal of community or envisioned a future paradise where the machines did all the work. In 1619 came Christianopolis, a Christian utopia by German theologian mystic Johann Valentin Andrea; and in 1623, Italian writer and Dominican friar Thomas Campanella published his City of the Sun. Then in 1627, polymath and Lord Chancellor of England Francis Bacon produced a book called New Atlantis, proclaiming science as saviour. Bacon argued that the state should endow a scientific college, which would invent machines to guarantee England’s pre-eminence on the world stage. His was a tech-based utopia and featured aeroplanes and submarines. As he wrote: “We imitate also the flights of birds: for we have some degree of flying in the air... we have ships and boats for going under water.” In the 17th Century, some attempted to move beyond theory and create living, breathing alternative societies. This was a turbulent period. In Britain, there was a Puritan revolution, the king was overthrown and Cromwell’s Leninist-style Commonwealth endured for 15 years – during which time Christmas, dancing, theatre and maypoles were banned. But rather like later communist governments, the natural tendency of the ordinary people to buy and sell products, celebrate pagan rituals and try to enjoy themselves overcame. Cromwell’s experiment came to an end with the Restoration of the popular libertine King Charles II. In the middle of all this ferment, a farmer called Gerrard Winstanley attempted to create an ideal colony. His followers were called Diggers – and they were the Occupy movement of their day. In 1649, they started digging the common land at St George’s Hill near Weybridge, Surrey, intending to cultivate it. In Winstanley’s pamphlets, he advocated a communistic philosophy: “The earth ought to be a common treasury to all.” The Diggers were attacked by both local men and landlords. Undeterred, Winstanley and his 20 or so followers moved to nearby Cobham Manor where they built four wooden houses. State troops pulled the houses down so the Diggers built “some few little hutches like half-cribs” and planted crops. But the local vicar paid a bunch of men – rather like when security guards are paid to remove protestors from road-building projects – to roust them and pull down any more houses or tents they made. The Diggers gave up that particular battle. But Winstanley went on to write books of utopian schemes and to join another movement with socialist overtones: the Quakers. The charismatic George Fox was the leader of the Quakers. He believed that he and his followers were returning to a pure form of Christianity based on the importance of charity. Unlike some utopian movements, therefore, he did not create a colony of like-minded individuals and escape to it. Instead, Quaker efforts were based around projects to help the poor and to educate people on the arts of self-sufficiency. In 1696, one of the Quakers wrote a pamphlet called Proposals for Raising a College of Industry of all Useful Trades and Husbandry – an idea closely related to More’s medieval notion that everyone should have a trade or craft in order to make an honest living. In fact, handicrafts and small-scale husbandry have been an enduring feature of utopian schemes to this day. (I myself attempted to create a little utopia, too: I lived on a farmhouse in Devon for 12 years and attempted some basic carpentry, kept chickens and pigs and grew vegetables, with varying degrees of success.) Romantic feelings Another charming production of this period was a book called The Isle of Pines by republican wit Henry Neville. Published in 1668, it was the Robinson Crusoe of its day: the hero is stranded on a beautiful island. This utopia is more Land of Cockaygne than tightly controlled socialist system. As Neville writes: “The country was so very pleasant, being always clothed in green, and full of pleasant fruits, and variety of birds, and ever warm, and never colder than in England in September; so that this place, had it the culture that skilful people might bestow on it, would prove a paradise.” A few years later, in the early 18th Century, Daniel Defoe wrote Robinson Crusoe and Jonathan Swift wrote Gulliver’s Travels. Both owed much to More’s Utopia – and both became far better known. Gulliver’s Travels is a journey round a series of utopias, some good and some bad. In it Swift, like previous utopists, rails against the injustice of the modern world in quasi-Marxist terms, complaining that: “The rich man enjoyed the Fruit of the poor Man’s Labour, and the Latter were a Thousand to One in Proportion to the former. That the bulk of our People was forced to live miserably by labouring every day for small wages to make a few live plentifully.” The later 1700s saw a marked decline in utopian writings and utopian experiments. But toward the end of the century came both a revolution in France and a Romantic backlash against the Industrial Revolution. The English Romantic William Blake complained about the “dark satanic mills” where men and women toiled to create enormous wealth for a few. He imagined a utopia called Jerusalem: The fields from Islington to Marylebone, To Primrose Hill and Saint John’s Wood, Were builded over with pillars of gold, And there Jerusalem’s pillars stood. The Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, for his part, hatched plans to sail away from England to America and create what he called a Pantisocracy: a place on the banks of the Susquehanna, Pennsylvania where he and his friends would combine buffalo hunting with philosophising. All property would be in common. The scheme got as far as a flat-share in Bristol and collapsed. One significant, and more successful, utopian figure of the 19th Century was Robert Owen. A progressive mill-owner from Wales, he improved conditions for workers at his Manchester mill, joining the Manchester Board of Health to improve sanitary conditions and in 1817 introducing an 8-hour day for his workers with the slogan “Eight hours labour. Eight hours recreation. Eight hours rest.” Owen launched a more ambitious scheme, though, in 1813, buying a school and ballroom with a group of Quakers in New Lanark, Scotland. It was the first of Owen’s “cooperative villages” – which spread, along with the idea of socialism, throughout Britain. The Victorian period was filled with earnest discussion among do-gooders and intellectuals on how to alleviate the conditions of the poor. In the mid-19th Century, dozens of Owenite experiments sprang up: small co-operative farms and communities, so-called ‘village colonies’ that provided every family with both a piece of land and farming lessons. Most of these schemes failed – or at least did not last long. They did, however, give birth to the co-operative movement which is still with us today and to organisations like Britain’s National Trust. We can even trace the roots of the trade unions back to Owen’s efforts. Also still with us are the model communities of Bournville near Birmingham and Port Sunlight near Liverpool, the first built with chocolate money by the Cadbury family, the second with soap money by Lord Leverhulme, founder of Sunlight Soap (now owned by Unilever). Both were capitalist attempts to build comfortable environments for workers. I went to visit Port Sunlight in the early ’90s and found it to be pretty and well cared for – though residents of the surrounding villages viewed the inhabitants of Port Sunlight as a bit dim and brain-washed. Less successful was a town called Pullman near Chicago, Illinois. In 1880, railroad entrepreneur George Pullman of Pullman Palace Car fame launched the ambitious model village, named after himself. He aimed for the town to run as a business and return a profit to investors. The whole town was carefully planned and built according to what were called “scientific principles” – which made for a number of very unappealing features. First off, like More’s Utopia, there were no wine-taverns or ale-houses and no booze was allowed – though an exception was made for wealthy visitors staying at the grand Hotel Florence. Second, there were no public gatherings of any size. Third, workers had to buy goods in the over-priced Pullman shops. And fourth, no blacks were allowed. In short, it was a disastrous mixture of the worst of centrally-controlled socialism and grasping capitalism – with racism thrown in for good measure. Following the great market collapse of 1893, Pullman hiked rents. The workers were so squeezed, one man paid $9 a month in rent and received a wage check for $9.07. In 1894, 4,000 Pullman residents, like thousands of workers across the US at that time, went on strike. The situation got violent; troops went in to quell the uprising. The government forced Pullman to sell his town. He died in 1897 so widely loathed, he had to be buried 12 feet underground for fear that his body would be dug up and desecrated by disgruntled employees. Pullman’s capitalist utopia demonstrated the fundamental problem in creating perfect worlds: people don’t like being told what to do. Everyone’s utopia is different. And since most utopias are inflexible, what happens to your ideal community when market conditions – which are outside your control – change? New patterns At around the same time in England, William Morris was concocting a far gentler version of paradise. The generously bearded Victorian hero wrote one of the great utopian fantasies, News from Nowhere – a book full of charm, wit and good ideas. Morris also created the company Morris & Co, which had the Thomas More-like aim of restoring medieval attitudes, in particular handicrafts, and providing enjoyable work for people. Morris himself was absurdly energetic, managing to pursue simultaneous careers as a poet, artist, novelist, printer, pamphleteer, painter, designer, typesetter, business man, socialist pioneer and rabble-rouser (he was thrown in jail for attending an anti-war rally). He had little tolerance for the lazy and memorably declared: “If a chap cannot compose an epic poem while he’s weaving tapestry, he had better shut up, he’ll never do any good at all.” Morris is dearly loved by the British left; the great Marxist historian EP Thompson wrote a long and adoring biography of him which emphasised his socialist principles. Unlike the big-headed Pullman, though, Morris never imposed his utopian visions on anyone else by actually creating a commune or village. He was a romantic who became a revolutionary. As he wrote of himself: Dreamer of dreams, born out of my due time, Why should I strive to set the crooked path straight? News from Nowhere was published in 1890. It is sub-titled “an utopian romance”, giving the reader a clear sign that it’s not meant to be interpreted as a blueprint for an ideal community. Really, Morris wanted all people to live what he called a refined life, to have the leisure time to read and play music and think and be poets. Morris’s utopia did not come out of nowhere: there was something of a medievalist fervour at that time. John Ruskin, another medievalist and fan of the guild system, was outlining projects for ideal village communities, while the Arts and Crafts movement also was inspired by the Middle Ages. Morris was attacking the sordid utilitarianism which dominated his own age. In his utopia, presented through a dialogue between an elder of the new world and a young man who finds himself transported there, green fields cover London’s Piccadilly Circus. Money has been abolished. There is no private property. Women of 40 look 20 and wear simple clothes are not “upholstered like arm-chairs, as most women of our time are”. Children get out into nature: when our hero notices that there are camps of feral children living in the woods of Kensington, his guide tells him that “the less they stew in houses the better for them.” Above all, the narrator says, the society reminds him of the 14th Century. Meanwhile, the Houses of Parliament are now used as “a storage place for manure” – quite a satisfying Victorian joke. In fact, Morris’s utopia, refreshingly, has elements of the Land of Cockaygne to it. It is not, like More’s Utopia, puritanical in nature. The inhabitants have a lot of fun: the narrator, for example, records with pleasure that dinner is served with a bottle of very good Bordeaux. Immediately following Morris came HG Wells, who wrote a dozen utopian and dystopian novels. They were generally technological in nature: Woody Allen’s Sleeper, with its giant vegetables, sex machines and robotic butlers, is a satire of Wells’s 1899 The Sleeper Awakes. Perhaps the most surprising reverberation of More’s utopia, though, was found in the towering figures of Leo Tolstoy and Mahatma Gandhi. It’s a little-known fact that the Indian nationalist corresponded with the aristocratic Russian novelist. Tolstoy, an anarchist and a Christian, held that the state was responsible for most of the bad stuff: taxes, wars and general irresponsibility. Tolstoy counselled passive resistance and non-violence instead. Communes based on Tolstoy’s version of Christianity sprang up in the UK. The familiar elements were there: a return to handicrafts and small-scale agriculture, partial rejection of the gewgaws of the modern world, communal dining and shared expenditure. Two of these communes still exist today in the UK. One is the Brotherhood Church of Stapleton, which, according to a recent New Yorker piece, is home to four humans, a deaf cat, a few hens and an enormous cow. The other is the Whiteway Colony in the Cotswolds, formed in 1898. More village than commune, Whiteway is a collection of 68 houses loosely bound by a monthly meeting. In 1909 a young Indian philosopher started to correspond with Tolstoy. He called himself the Count’s “humble follower”; the two men discussed Indian home rule, pacifism, passive resistance, freedom from toil and other utopian issues. In 1910, the young man – Gandhi –launched a cooperative colony in South Africa which he named Tolstoy Farm. It was Gandhi’s utopian thinking, inspired by Tolstoy, that led to his doctrine of passive resistance and his campaign for Indian home rule. Dark visions One of my favourite 20th-Century utopian societies, however, is the anarchist occupation of Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War. Here, from 1936 to the start of Franco’s reign in 1939, authority and rank were suspended, people called each other ‘comrade’ and an anarchist system ruled. It is described without sentiment by George Orwell, who fought for the anarchists, in his account Homage to Catalonia. Meanwhile, utopias continued to hatch from the imaginations of novelists. In 1915, American author Charlotte Perkins Gilman published her feminist utopia Herland. In this ideal society, there are no men at all, and the women prize education above all else. Women have learned to reproduce via parthenogenesis – no men required. Children are the responsibility of everyone, though during the first two years of life the child is closely attached to her real mother. There is no war or private property. At the same time, other novelists decided that it would be more fun to write dystopias than utopias – and hence science fiction began. EM Forster added to the swelling genre with his brilliant novel The Machine Stops. In this grim fantasy, the people live alone in underground cells, connected to everyone else in the world by screen... sound familiar? The machine is worshipped as source of all knowledge and freedom: “The Machine feeds us and clothes us and houses us; through it we speak to one another, through it we see one another, in it we have our being. The Machine is the friend of ideas and the enemy of superstition: the Machine is omnipotent, eternal; blessed is The Machine.” The genre ultimately gave birth to two of the most famous utopian experiments of the 20th Century, both of them literary. Aldous Huxley once said that he originally conceived Brave New World, published in 1931, as a gentle satire of Wells’s endless utopias. Huxley was also worrying about the increasing ‘Americanisation’ of Europe. And there are many of what you might call ‘American’ features in his brave new (and dystopian) world: pain, for example, has been destroyed; when life gets overwhelming, the citizens take the drug soma which is a kind of cross between ecstasy and Prozac. To read the book today is startling as so many of its predictions have come true – like the Philistinism of the state, the debasement of sex and the insistence on happiness. The book was a huge hit. So was George Orwell’s later dystopia 1984, published in 1949. Both books also were loathed by Oxbridge Marxists. One historian called AL Morton, writing in 1952, really believed that a real utopia was being built in Soviet Russia and that Orwell and Huxley’s negative views of a totalitarian state were decadent and counter-revolutionary. Huxley’s ideas, writes Morton, are “self-evidently false, and in practice they are being shown daily to be false before our eyes, in that third of the world which is now building socialism upon quite different postulates.” For good measure, he adds, 1984 “as an intellectual attack on Marxism... is beneath contempt”. Morton then goes on to claim that “the fantasies of Cockaygne... are now being translated into facts in the plans that are now beginning to change the face and climate of the USSR and other socialist countries.” Of course, at the time of writing, the USSR’s leader was Stalin. But such naive and blinkered optimism was typical of the socialist intellectuals of the 1950s. The late ’60s saw hippies pick up on the now-familiar elements of classical utopias like back-to-the-land ideals, small scale crafts, the end of private property, an undermining of bourgeois marriage restrictions and an attack on consumerism. If we have learned anything from surveying utopian writing and real-life experimentation, it is that the same ideals keep returning. Such communal living experiments don’t tend to survive very long. However – though sometimes invaded by violent drug-dealers and various other problems – the anarchist community of Freetown Christiania in Copenhagen has proved decidedly resilient. Founded in 1971 on an old military base, it is today home to 850 citizens and as a thriving bicycle business. Its mission statement reads: “The objective of Christiania is to create a self-governing society whereby each and every individual holds themselves responsible over the wellbeing of the entire community. Our society is to be economically self-sustaining and, as such, our aspiration is to be steadfast in our conviction that psychological and physical destitution can be averted.” Christiania is a car-free neighbourhood, and like other hippy-ish communities allows its residents to build their own houses. The result is a very beautiful architectural vernacular: the houses look like wooden Babapapa houses. A famous son of the village is lead singer of international pop band Lukas Graham, behind the mega-hit 7 Years. Future perfect Today, the utopian spirit is far from dead. Like their capitalist forebears in the 19th Century, Silicon Valley capitalists talk about building ideal societies. In a small way their workplaces – like the Google or Facebook campuses – aim to provide workers with a progressive working environment. More ambitiously, billionaires are planning libertarian colonies. One of the most powerful players in the Californian tech revolution of the last 20 years is Peter Thiel. He was a co-founder of Paypal, which he predicted would be “something big” in a 1999 speech. He also was the first serious investor in Facebook. He invested $500,000 in the company and later sold his shares for $1 billion. Thiel has recently invested over $1 million in a project called the Seasteading Institute. His concept: geeks will set up self-governing cities in the sea free from the interference of government. They look a bit like medieval city-states. The mission statement says that they aim “to establish permanent, autonomous ocean communities to enable experimentation and innovation with diverse social, political, and legal systems"". The back-to-the-land hippy-ish experiments continue, too. The writer David Bramwell recently published his Number Nine Bus to Utopia, his account of a year spent visiting eccentric communities around the world. And Tobias Jones, having written his own account of contemporary utopian experiments, set up one of his own in 2009, a farm-based refuge in Somerset for waifs and strays which he and his wife Fra still run today. His gruelling and frequently comical experiences are brilliantly related in his book A Place of Refuge: An Experiment in Communal Living, published in 2015. Another utopian experiment that survives today is the arts centre and open house colony Dial House, founded by artists Penny Rimbaud and Gee Vaucher in 1968. Situated on an acre of land in Essex, the house has given birth to a number of successful projects including most famously the anarchist punk band Crass, which introduced hundreds of thousands of working-class kids to utopian concepts like vegetarianism, pacifism, the end of wage slavery, feminism and animal rights. So Utopia isn’t dead. But what have we learned from these centuries of ideas, hopes and plans? It seems practically nothing. The communist ideal remains attractive but elusive. The 1% continue to indulge in warfare, government and money-lending. And the rest of us get along as best we can – with the occasional trip to the Land of Cockaygne on Friday nights.

Spread to US Treasury,The 20 greatest children's books ever,2024-09-25,2023-05-23,BBC Culture,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230522-the-20-greatest-childrens-books-ever-what-the-voters-say,"What do the global critics and experts who voted in our poll have to say about their top picks? 1. Where the Wild Things Are (words and illustrations by Maurice Sendak, 1963) With its perfect symbiosis of words and pictures, the classic Where the Wild Things Are topped our poll of 100 greatest children's books. First published in 1963, and still loved all over the world, Maurice Sendak's powerful, stunningly illustrated book tells the tale of Max as he goes on a journey of discovery, encountering the ""wild things"". It is a fable that is both dark and ultimately uplifting. ""If I was leaving for a desert island and there was only one book to take away, it would be this one,"" says Marie Wabbes of the Belgian Francophone section of the International Board On Books for Young People (IBBY). ""It understands childhood, the angry child, the attraction of power and the immensity of maternal love."" Quek Hong Shin, the Singapore-based children's author and illustrator, describes it as, ""a great children's book about anger, self-discovery, and a mother's love for a child"". While Rose Green, a US editor, says: ""No childhood is complete without a Wild Rumpus! The quintessential story of losing your cool, taming your monsters, and coming back home to find your supper is still hot."" Ireland-based author Clara Kumagai recalls how, reading the story as a child, the monsters scared her. ""But I still loved them,"" she writes, describing the book as ""an epic that manages to combine fear, courage, love, and loneliness in less than 350 words and 40 pages. It's lyrical and unexpected, and each page does exactly what a picture book should – it surprises and delights.""    2. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (words by Lewis Carroll; illustrations by John Tenniel, 1865)   Among the most iconic works of children's literature, Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (more widely known as Alice in Wonderland) tells the logic-defying story of a girl named  Alice who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world full of anthropomorphic creatures and surreal scenarios. The book has had a huge influence on popular culture, been translated into many languages, and adapted into ballets, operas, films and more. UK film and culture writer Lillian Crawford writes: ""We owe our dreams to Lewis Carroll. [It is] the book which made me curious about the world and imagination, to which I will never tire of returning no matter how old I am."" Ira Saxena, meanwhile, a children's author and book critic based in India, describes the book as ""a remarkable fantasy tale, [with] utterly amusing characters, capturing the senses forever"". Many voters commented on the book's enduring quality and universal appeal. The 1981 edition was illustrated by influential Slovak artist Dušan Kállay, points out Hana Krizanova of Slovakia's International House of Art for Children. Both the text and visuals are, she writes ""iconic and captivating"". And Theo Heras book reviewer and board member of IBBY, Canada,, sums the book up in two words: ""Still magical"".  Read more about BBC Culture’s 100 greatest children’s books: The 100 greatest children’s books  Why Where the Wild Things Are is the greatest children’s book  The 21st Century’s greatest children’s books  Who voted? #100GreatestChildrensBooks 3. Pippi Longstocking (words by Astrid Lindgren; illustrations by Ingrid Nyman, 1945) Pippi Longstocking is a legendary protagonist – a spirited, non-conformist girl with a sharp wit and super-human strength, she has had a powerful influence on several generations since Swedish author Astrid Lindgren created her in 1945. The book has been adapted to both TV and film and is known across the world. Pippi is ""anything but a saint"", says award-winning French children's author Marie-Aude Murail, and she is ""a breath of fresh air in the land of (overly) well-behaved children"". Sophie Casson, Canadian children's book illustrator, writes: ""As a child, I completely identified with the freedom this little girl carried out in every aspect of her being –  Pippi does what she wants, when she wants, in the way she sees fit, very unworried about how she looks. Totally empowering for the little girl from the 70s. Pippi has a strong sense of what is right or wrong and fights for her views, and I think that stays an enduring legacy."" French illustrator Pierre-Emmanuel Lyet says that the book's cover struck him as a child: ""Pippi carrying a horse at arm's length, I thought it was so great! "" And for culture journalist Cath Pound, Pippi was a role model: ""Funny, feisty and delightfully eccentric, Pippi Longstocking is the girl I longed to be as a child."" 4. The Little Prince (words and illustrations by Antoine Saint-Exupéry, 1943) The Little Prince (or Le Petit Prince) is an elegantly illustrated novella about a boy who goes on a journey to visit other planets, on the way considering themes ranging from love and loneliness to friendship and loss. The tale continues to be popular all over the world, appealing to both children and adults. ""This book is a classic that is still used in many education programmes,"" says Cameroonian children's author and playwright Joel Eboueme Bognomo. Monica Severs of Hackney Libraries, London, found the book eye-opening: ""How wonderful for a very bored child (like I was) to be transported to space and visit planets inhabited by such a variety of characters. It appealed to my humanity, the good bits and the not so good. As a child, it gave me a different perspective of people, relationships and myself."" Writer Gülsah Özdemir Koryürek, who is also the co-founder of Sifirdan publishing, Turkey, describes the fable as ""a book of intellectual planets"".  5. The Hobbit (words and illustrations by JRR Tolkien, 1937) The classic fantasy novel The Hobbit is set in Middle Earth, and follows the journey of hobbit protagonist Bilbo Baggins, wizard Gandalf and 13 dwarves. On their episodic quest to reclaim the dwarves' home and treasure, they encounter conflict and danger, and Bilbo gains a new level of maturity and wisdom. Bilbo Baggins is, says UK-based illustrator Jim Kay, ""an unlikely, diminutive protagonist in a beautifully realised world"" – the novel is ""still a joy to read, and it rattles along at a wonderful pace"".  Children's author and broadcaster Chris Smith credits The Hobbit with leading him to a whole new world of reading: ""Not only is this an amazing story for children, it's also the ultimate gateway book because it unlocks the enormous world of [sequel] Lord of the Rings. When my teacher read us this book in year nine it blew my mind,  and started me off on a reading journey that's still going strong, and still feels unexpected 40 years later."" US author Christopher Paolini, meanwhile, describes The Hobbit as ""a perfect fairy tale for young and old alike. Tolkien captured magic with this one"".  6. Northern Lights (Philip Pullman, 1995) The first of the trilogy His Dark Materials, the powerful Northern Lights is set in a parallel universe dominated by the Magisterium, where Lyra Belacqua – accompanied by her ""daemon"" – travels to the Arctic to search for her missing friend Roger and her imprisoned uncle Lord Asriel, who has been experimenting with a mysterious substance, ""Dust"". Pam Dix, chair of IBBY UK, recalls how the novel  ""exploded into the children's fiction world. Bringing together a multiplicity of concepts in a format that is more than fantasy, more than historical fiction, a new form"". Lisa Sainsbury of the University of Roehampton says: ""When Philip Pullman conceived of daemons and created a world for them, he conjured one of the potent metaphors of children's literature. Northern Lights (and His Dark Materials) offers the means through which to explore the mysteries of childhood and growing up, and renders these experiences through a bold expression of girlhood. Northern Lights makes childhood matter, long after we have moved into realms beyond it."" Writer and journalist Beverley D'Silva praises the novel as ""life-changing, cosmic storytelling"".  7. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (words by C S Lewis; illustrations by Pauline Baynes, 1950) CS Lewis's fantasy novel is the first – and the most celebrated – of seven novels in the Chronicles of Narnia. A land of talking animals and mythical creatures ruled by the evil White Witch, Narnia is the setting in which four English schoolchildren find themselves, after travelling there through a wardrobe in the country house where they are staying. Their adventures lead them to meet the lion Aslan. ""With the publication of this book, we learned that we could enter another world through the back of a wardrobe, and our world was never the same,"" says US-based writer Ellen Kushner. While US author Christopher Paolini  writes: ""Step through this door into a new world… Isn't that the basis of so many stories? Lewis perfectly captured that feel, and his characters are lively and memorable, as is the land of Narnia. As with all great stories, the ending is a bit bittersweet, and leaves one yearning for more."" The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is ""just a magnificent book"", says Tine Nielsen of Babel-Bridge Literary Agency, Denmark, ""with so many compelling characters, so many layers and so many memories that will stay with you for the rest of your life"".   8. Winnie-the-Pooh (words by AA Milne; illustrations by EH Shepard, 1926) Set in the fictional Hundred Acre Wood, the beloved Winnie-the-Pooh follows the adventures of anthropomorphic bear Pooh, and his friends Piglet, Eeyore, Owl, Rabbit, Kanga and Roo. Its sequel is The House at Pooh Garden. ""An unforgettable story of friendship"" is how Theresa Rogers, professor of education at the University of British Columbia, Canada, describes it. ""Winnie-the-Pooh, Eeyore, Piglet and the rest are affecting characters that young readers take with them throughout their lives (as have I)."" Katrin Lilija, editor-in-chief of Lestrarklefinn, Iceland, also has happy memories of reading the book as she grew up: ""Winnie the Pooh is a book I enjoyed with my father as a child. The innocence of Pooh bear has stayed with me since my childhood, along with some memorable solutions and misunderstandings he and the other animals in Hundred Acre Wood make. The story of Pooh is a book I read to my children."" UK author MG Leonard is also a fan: ""The humour [and] the perfectly observed idiosyncrasies of each character throughout these gentle stories about growing up are unsurpassed. I was read these stories, then read these stories, and have then gone on to read them to my own children."" 9. Charlotte's Web (words by EB White; Illustrations by Garth Williams, 1952) American author EB White's brilliantly told tale centres on a farm girl's pet pig Wilbur and his friendship with a barn spider named Charlotte. When Wilbur is under threat of slaughter, Charlotte weaves messages into her web praising Wilbur in order to persuade the farmer to let him live. Themes including innocence, change and mortality are all addressed as the story unfolds. ""This story struck my empathy cord very strongly in grade two when the teacher read it to the class,"" writes Canadian illustrator Sophie Casson. ""A sad story ending was so new to my imagination, it jolted me forward into a feeling of emotional maturity. A perfect book to introduce big questions about life and death."" Singapore-based author and illustrator Quek Hon also points to the grown-up subjects addressed in the book, describing it as ""a book filled with giant themes for little ones"". Kalpana Sunder, a journalist based in India, calls it ""one of the most magical books, that takes the reader into a world where children and animals rule"".   10. Matilda (words by Roald Dahl; illustrations by Quentin Blake, 1988) The iconic Matilda Wormwood is a precocious child with cruel parents, and Dahl's much-loved novel follows her time in school, run by the sadistic, authoritarian Miss Trunchbull. Along the way, Matilda's remarkable intelligence is nurtured by her teacher Miss Honey, and disregarded by her parents and the tyrannical headmistress, as the story unfolds with increasingly extreme scenarios. The book's illustrations by Quentin Blake have become synonymous with the story, and all of Dahl's work. Matilda has been successfully adapted for stage and screen, and, decades after it was first published, continues to attract devotees across the world. ""Is there a single bookish child in the world who wouldn't pick Matilda as one of their top 10?"" asks David Robson, science writer and author. ""Matilda teaches us that it's okay to feel different from the people who are closest to us, and the power of being true to ourselves."" Culture writer Lillian Crawford describes Matilda as ""the essential companion for bookish girls"". And for the Children's Laureate of Wales, Connor Allen, Matilda ""gives children hope, and above all lets their imagination run wild and enjoy a heartfelt story. One of the best stories and films for me as a child"". 11. Anne of Green Gables (LM Montgomery, 1908) Canadian author LM Montgomery's 1908 novel is blessed with one of children's literature's great heroines: red-headed, 11-year-old orphan girl Anne Shirley, who ends up living on a farm on Prince Edward Island, after being mistakenly adopted by a middle-aged brother and sister, when they had intended to adopt a boy. Headstrong, fearless, and highly intelligent, Anne is a figure that young readers have identified with through the ages, for the way in which she makes the best of everything in life, making mistakes but growing in strength and maturity as the story progresses. ""Any girl who feels like an outsider, like she doesn't fit in, will find herself in the pages of this book. I loved Anne deeply. To me this story wasn't inside a book, it was real,"" says MG Leonard. ""Anne's exuberance for life in spite of her difficult beginnings, her creativity and joy still inspire readers,"" agrees Theo Heras. It is also a book that has been ""read and recognised globally,"" says Karin Lesnik-Oberstein, professor of English Literature at University of Reading. ""A Canadian classic which has had a great influence on ideas of Canadian identity and Canadian landscape."" 12. Fairy Tales (Hans Christian Andersen, 1827) Are there any stories as seminal within children's literature as those of the 19th-Century Danish author? From The Emperor's New Clothes to Thumbelina to The Ugly Duckling, his imaginatively inspiring tales, perfect in their mix of light and shade, have gripped generations of children at bedtime and otherwise – transporting them to fantastical worlds while teaching them about ordinary human values like love, kindness and honesty. They've also inspired endless retellings in all artforms, right up to this month's loosely-inspired Disney live-action Little Mermaid blockbuster. ""I especially appreciate the volume translated into English by Tiina Nunnally, since I don't read Danish, and many of the previous versions were translations of translations,"" comments Mexican writer and activist Sandra Cisneros. ""Andersen's tales make me understand why he was so revolutionary in his day. I adore this book. I read it all the time as an adult, especially the marvellous The Snow Queen"".  13. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (JK Rowling, 1997) What more can be said about JK Rowling's tale of a boy wizard's adventures at magical boarding school Hogwarts, the beginning of an era-defining, internationally-beloved franchise? Published in 1997, with an initial run of only 500 copies – where its current sales stand at over 120 million copies worldwide – it has beguiled all ages with its parade of vividly-drawn characters and scintillating narrative twists and turns. Above all, what many readers have valued is Rowling's skill at immersing them in a world that was so fully-realised from the off. ""It's the most influential book for my generation for sure,"" comments Hana Krizanova. ""We grew up together with Harry, Hermione and Ron. Not so many books have left me in such despair that I can't be there with them."" ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone brought a new kind of magic to me as a young reader, and continues to reach new readers still today. The magical world of Harry Potter has expanded greatly, but the books will always contain the greatest experience,"" adds Katrin Lilija. Meanwhile US children's author Kathryn Erskine provides a personal touch in her commendation: ""There's good reason that Harry's fight of good against evil captured the world's attention – it is creative, imaginative, and utterly engaging,"" she says. ""And thank you, Jim Dale, for the audio books, so exquisitely done that you not only made the multi-day road trip doable, my family sat in our van in the hotel parking lot to hear the end.""    14. The Very Hungry Caterpillar (Eric Carle, 1969) ""How can a book so simple be so impactful?"" asks Portuguese literary agent and editorial consultant Racquel Mestre of Carle's classic picture book about a very peckish caterpillar who consumes his way through a whole variety of comestibles until, in the climax, he transforms into… a be-winged vision. Perhaps it's that its narrative of metamorphosis and change over time is such a potent one, or perhaps it's to do with the universal joy of eating (it even has holes in its pages to represent the caterpillar's gnawing through the book).  Ghanaian writer Nii Ayikwei Parkes has a particularly pleasing explanation for its appeal: ""I have a niece that calls this 'the book with the hole in it', and I think that is precisely its charm,"" he says. ""It allows every kid to find their place in it, which is what good books do."" And there's that ending ""which is fantastic, always surprising and full of joy,"" says Chilean author and illustrator Maria J Guarda, ""a wide spread of a beautiful butterfly blossoming. It is always a pleasure to observe Carle's images, with bits of paper cut to form shapes, and a great balance of white with vibrant colours and textures.""    15. The Dark is Rising (Susan Cooper, 1973) Fantasy writing doesn't come more evocative than Cooper's beguiling novel of magic and mystery, in which a young boy, Will Stanton, experiences a profound disturbance on the night of his 11th birthday – leading to his realisation that he is the last of the ancient Old Ones, and a key player in vanquishing the forces of the Dark. Indeed, Australian writer and illustrator Anna Zobel reveals that the book ""is on my desk right now, covered in post-its, because I'm using it as a mentor text for upper primary writing workshops. Cooper is a genius at evading exposition. Her language is so playful, too. She's the master of quiet metaphor, of personification, of inverted phrasing. In those same pages, the snow is 'thin and apologetic'; The lawn is 'a wide grey sweep'; the rabbits move 'twitch-nosed forward'. She's a brilliant writer to both read and study."" Thematically, meanwhile, it taps into something so fundamental that young readers can't help but be stirred by it. ""Profound is the word I would use to describe the impact this book had on me,"" notes MG Leonard. ""It enabled me to see darkness and light at work, through people's actions in daily life, and the courage to champion and fight for the light.""  16. The Arrival (Shaun Tan, 2006) The wordless graphic novel is one of 14 21st-Century books in the top 100, the power of its images appealing to voters around the world. According to Melanie Ramdarshan Bold, a senior lecturer in children's and YA literature at the University of Glasgow, Scotland, ""This gorgeous wordless graphic novel really distils the emigrating/immigrating/refugee experience – the fear, suffering, loneliness, anxiety, strangeness, hopefulness, cultural and communication barriers – in a powerful and unique way. I loved the magical realism – the strange fruits, animals, buildings and transport – which really show how bizarre and alien the experience of adapting to a new environment can be."" Donovan Bixley, a children's author and illustrator from New Zealand, calls The Arrival ""a tour de force"", praising the book for being ""endlessly re-readable for all ages and brilliantly executed to allow readers from any culture to empathise with the characters"". Kimberley Reynolds, Emerita Professor of children's literature at the UK's Newcastle University, says: ""A timeless fable for our times: families separated by poverty and oppression, reunited in new places where they can thrive. The images powerfully evoke the confusion, loneliness and uncertainty of starting in a new country whose language, conventions and cuisine are unfamiliar. Each detail has been carefully thought about. An uplifting and unforgettable book."" The images manage to convey a complicated story: ""Without words it portrays the struggle of the displaced, the lost, and the lonely trying to find a new life in foreign lands,"" says Jim Kay, while Nii Ayikwei Parkes ""fell in love with this book as a father, appreciating for the first time as an adult the incredible narrative power of illustration"". Clara Kumagai sums it up: ""This book has no words – and doesn't need them. In its wordlessness, young readers can create their own stories; for others it may mirror the experience of emigrating (or fleeing) to a country in which language and culture is strange and unknown. The art is gorgeous, sepia-toned and detailed, each page demanding to be lingered over."" 17. Little Women (Louisa May Alcott, 1869) ""I must've read and re-read Little Women countless times,"" says MG Leonard. ""I loved the relationships between the sisters, and saw myself in Jo. This was the first book I read to truly make me weep floods of tears. It is a wonderful book."" Lillian Crawford also returns to Little Women regularly, and identifies with Jo: ""Perhaps the children's book I come back to the most, as the March sisters grow older and I understand them more truly. Louisa May Alcott created the perfect book for little girls to grow into womanhood with. I will forever be a Jo."" Kalpana Sunder praises the ""strong female characters in a powerful tale"", and Karin Lesnik-Oberstein says that Little Women is ""another globally recognised and enduring classic, which is reflected in the many film versions made of it"". Emerita Professor of children's literature at Newcastle University Kimberley Reynolds similarly highlights its multiple adaptations, commenting: ""A genuine classic that is threaded through publishing and cinematic history. Powerful females managing at home in a wartime (civil war) context. Validation of creativity, but also of nurturing. Despite the wartime backdrop, men as well as women are shown to be empathetic and caring, and women to be courageous and strong. Life is unpredictable."" 18. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Roald Dahl, 1964) The wit and verve of Roald Dahl's classic are a big draw for poll voters, with children's book author and illustrator Quek Hong Shin from Singapore praising it for being ""a deliciously wicked story"", and US author Christopher Paolini commenting that the book is ""surreal, funny, and full of delightful wordplay"". ""All of Dahl's works are a delight in language,"" says children's book illustrator Sophie Casson from Canada. ""Although some of the characters' stereotypical depictions are to be discussed with the children, the story absolutely jolts children in an incredible fantasy land all children connect to. You can almost smell the chocolate with Charlie. This story literally blew my mind with imagination and I was so drawn in by the duality of the personality in Willy Wonka."" The illustrations are a big part of the appeal, too, as Hana Križanová says: ""It was almost impossible to choose just one book from Roald Dahl, he is one of the most talented storytellers of our times. Dahl and Quentin Blake managed to create iconic stories with very simple, funny visuals that made them an unforgettable power couple.""   19. Heidi (Johanna Spyri, 1880) The alpine classic is a hit with voters around the globe who appreciate its vivid evocation of landscape and compelling characters. Kalpana Sunder praises the book for being ""an endearing story that takes you to the Swiss Alps, with a gruff but loving grandfather, and a childhood spent in the outdoors"", while Nii Ayikwei Parkes says: ""This was a book I connected with as a kid, primarily because of the goats, but the friendship between Clara and Heidi is so moving that it became a favourite."" The book's rural setting draws in readers, as BBC Culture's Lindsay Baker comments: ""Heidi lives on a beautiful mountainside in an attic room – the ultimate escapist fantasy."" And for many, such as the British writer and arts critic Marianne Levy, that contrast with their own lives accounts for Heidi's enduring appeal. ""Growing up deep in English suburbia, I was enthralled by this book's alpine meadows, and in complete agreement with little Heidi on the stifling nature of the city,"" she says. ""Long after I was old enough to know better, it was my deepest desire to sleep in a hayloft and drink milk fresh from a goat."" 20. Goodnight Moon (words by Margaret Wise Brown; illustrations by Clement Hurd, 1947) This picture book – in which a bunny says goodnight to the objects and creatures in its bedroom – contains layers that aren't immediately apparent, according to the voters in the poll. ""Originally published in 1947, Margaret Wise Brown's knowledge of child development is behind the incredible simplicity of this book,"" says Pam Dix. ""Animate and inanimate objects play equally vital roles in the young child's world."" The book's pared-back approach is deceptive, according to Giorgia Grilli at the University of Bologna, Italy: ""A child's prayer. An apparently simple, yet deeply intense book on the courage it takes to close one's eyes when it is dark."" Joe Sutliff Sanders from the University of Cambridge believes the book places the reader into several different roles at the same time: ""A masterclass in understatement, Goodnight Moon tricks the adult reading the book into becoming a poet, a tour guide to the dwindling moments before sleep, and a naughty child, a gift for any grown-up."" A balm for all ages, ""it never fails to soothe and quiet a little one or a frazzled parent,"" says Theo Heras. And The Observer's picture book critic and News Review assistant editor Imogen Carter argues that Goodnight Moon is ""simultaneously a sort of sedative in book form, and one of the wackiest children's tales ever written: the words lull and charm while the wildly beautiful colours of the illustrations blow your mind with their delightful incongruity.""

Spread to US Treasury,The cost of making the Earth move,2024-09-25,2012-11-15,Gaia Vince,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20121115-the-cost-of-making-the-earth-move,"In the first of a two-part series, Gaia Vince explores our insatiable desire to plunder our planet’s resources, and asks whether the time has finally come to take action. We are the planet's greatest diggers and miners. For tens of thousands of years humans have chipped away beneath the soils of this vast rocky planet, plundering its hard surface for tools, building materials and sparkling jewels. The question is what’s driven our hunger to churn up more and more of our planet's rocks and sediments and spread it around the surface, and does it matter? We’re not the only species to recognise the value in strong, inert materials – chimps use stone tools and Neanderthals mined flint in Europe – but we’re the only creatures to have delved further to reach the metals and other minerals within. Whole civilizations have been based on this – some metals became so important that they defined cultural periods, the Iron Age and the Bronze Age, for example. Empires extended across the seas in search of precious metals, gems and fuels. The Romans invaded Britain for its metals, using hydraulic mining to harvest gold from deep within the rocks. Spain’s wealth 400 years ago is largely attributable to silver scraped from the hills of Potosi in Bolivia. Some of this unearthed treasure, such as iron, was created billions of years ago inside a star; others, such as coal, were more recently formed from living forests that were buried in bogs and compressed by sediments some 300 million years ago. Some of these mined materials, like iron, are common in the Earth’s crust, some are rare, but none of these are replaceable or renewable within a thousands-of-years timeframe. The industrial revolution, which made Britain the powerhouse of the world, catalysed a sharp increase in the volume of mining. Steam power, fuelled by coal, rapidly increased our capacity to delve for materials (including coal), as well as transporting and processing it. In 1700, more than 80% of the world’s coal was mined in Britain. Over the 18th and 19th centuries, as technologies improved, speculators explored new territory across Africa, Australia and the United States, looking for gold and other high-value metals and gems. But it is over the past 60 years that we’ve witnessed a truly global revolution in the scale of our mining and extractions. We now move more than three times as much sediment and rocky materials than all the world’s rivers, glaciers, wind and rain combined, according to sedimentary geologist James Syvitski of Instaar, University of Colorado, Boulder. “Every year, rivers move about 13 gigatonnes (billion tonnes) of sediment. To put that in perspective, 1 GT [gigatonne] is equivalent to 2 Great Walls of China,” Syvitski says. “We already mine around 9 GT of coal each year – by 2030, it will be 13 GT of coal. And we produce 13 GT of aggregate, 2 GT of iron ore each year….” We are sculpting the Earth’s surface and taking material away at rates not seen before in geological time, says Syvitski. “There are millions of holes and burrows through the rock – kilometres long – from our drilling expeditions,” he says. We’ve left 568,000 mines abandoned in the US alone, and many millions more throughout the world. Unchartered wealth We are even plundering some of the most inhospitable places on the planet, such as the freezing Arctic Ocean, the burning Atacama Desert and the deepest Atlantic, to reach oil and gas, diamonds and copper, uranium and rare metals that were unknown decades earlier but are now an indispensable part of the conveniences of modern life. New “finds” promise untold wealth to the territories they lie beneath – and to the speculating companies that dig and drill – so nations from Uganda to Brazil are eagerly pursuing all explorations. The world has already seen some of the poorest nations dramatically rise to prosperity after substantial finds. Saudi Arabia, for example, is now one of the wealthiest nations after vast oil and gas wells were drilled, and Botswana has rapidly risen from poverty to a functioning, economically healthy democracy after diamonds were discovered.  However, such wealth has not come without its problems. Mining is a dirty, dangerous business. The world watched in horror as dozens of miners were trapped for months below ground in Chile in 2010. They were rescued, but a few months later workers in a New Zealand mine were less fortunate. These incidents occurred in some of the world’s best-run mines operated by the biggest companies: every year, thousands of small-time miners, many operating in illegal shafts under terrible conditions, perish without publicity. In China alone, around 50 miners die each week. Mines are often plunged into land owned by poor local people with few rights, who have received little or no profit or compensation for their polluted fields, air, waterways or wildlands. Nigeria’s Niger Delta is a ruined slick of oil spills and leaks, which continues to poison the health of some of the world’s poorest people, infiltrates their drinking water and farmland, and kills fish. The ongoing environmental catastrophe there shows no signs of abating while one of the world’s richest oil companies pollutes with near-impunity and the poor continue to illegally tap the pipes, spilling and spreading the noxious liquid. Across the globe, from the Amazon to the Gulf of Mexico, oil formed from the burial, millions of years ago, of algae and plankton has been spilt and spread around the terrestrial surface with ecologically devastating consequences. Running out   Coal and oil are not the only buried pollutants we’re bringing to the surface. Mining involves huge amounts of energy – obtained from burning fossil fuels – and water, often in places where both are scarce, which increases environmental pressure, as well as producing greenhouse gases that are warming the planet. And the methods used to separate out desired metals from the rest of the rock are often poisonous – whole river systems have been contaminated with mercury from gold panning, for example.  In our haste to reach the buried materials, we have resculpted the landscape, carving the tops from mountains, boring and shattering the ground with fracking, creating new mountains of slag and rock, even making artificial islands where none have existed before. The palm-shaped island off the coast of Dubai was formed from some 400 million tonnes of geological material, says Simon Price of the British Geological Survey, who studied it. ""All the materials we use to build our modern world – our cities of glass and concrete and steel – are made from geological ingredients that are mined and put together in unnatural combinations,"" Price says. Our hunger to reshape the planet with Earth-moving machinery is inching us closer and closer to a troubling end-point: we are depleting some resources to the extent that they are in danger of running out, or at least becoming economically unviable to extract, and our mining is moving into ever-more environmentally fragile areas. In the next column, I'll be asking whether it's time to slow our planetary plundering, and I'll be looking at what happened in the last 60 years to produce such an escalation in our lust for Earthly materials. On Wednesday 21 November, you can hear my conversation with Simon Price and others, as we discuss the changes humans are making to the planet in the Anthropocene, on Frontiers, BBC Radio 4 at 2100 GMT.

Spread to US Treasury,The love song that became an anthem,2024-09-25,2022-11-24,Diane Bernard,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20221123-suavecito-the-chicano-national-anthem,"This year marks the 50th anniversary of the release of Suavecito, by the band Malo, which became a mainstream hit at a time when Latino people were just a small percentage of the US population. The love song became a powerful symbol for Latino-Americans, writes Diane Bernard. On Cinco de Mayo, 1980, Latino-American singer and songwriter Richard Bean joined Jorge Santana, Carlos Santana's younger brother, on stage at an outdoor concert in Los Angeles. Years before, Bean had written a song called Suavecito, and he never realised how iconic it had become until the two began playing it. As its slow groove flowed over the loudspeakers, the 20,000-person crowd in the city's Lincoln Park erupted in a roar. More like this: -        The US's first interracial love song -        The black composer erased from history -        Why J-Lo is Hollywood's most underestimated star ""As I was singing to the crowd, four huge Chicano (Mexican-American) guys marched behind the band on stage and unfurled a giant green, white and red Mexican flag,"" Bean tells BBC Culture. The flag was so large it took all four men to hold it, he explains. ""Get them off the stage,"" the roadies began shouting, according to Bean. ""Get them off."" But the four stood proud. ""No, not until the song is over,"" they said. ""Not until Suavecito is done."" When he looked behind him at the huge flag, and looked out at the all-Latino audience, Bean began to tear up. It wasn't until that moment, he said, that he knew Suavecito, informally called the ""Chicano National Anthem"" by some, lived up to that name as a true symbol of America's Mexican-Americans and Latino people. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the release of Suavecito, by the band Malo, which became a mainstream hit at a time when Latinos were just a small percentage of the US population. Played for half a century at weddings, funerals, quinceañeras, and low-rider car events, Suavecito made history as one of the most enduring classics of the Chicano rock era, symbolising Latinx pride and progress at a time when Mexican-Americans and other Latino people were fighting for equal rights in the US. Yet, despite the love song's widespread success, not many people know Bean, who wrote the song and sang lead vocals, but never gained national prominence and missed a chance at stardom. Bean wrote the song when he was in a high school algebra class at Mission High School in San Francisco. Influenced by 1960s R&B acts like Smokey Robinson, Sam and Dave, and Sam Cooke, he was striving for a soul classic. ""That music had a huge influence on my life,"" he says. It was the late 1960s and he thought he was in love. ""I actually flunked algebra class because I was writing poems to her,"" Bean says with a laugh. Things didn't work out with the girl, but his adoration spawned a hit song for Malo, reaching number 18 on the Billboard charts in 1972. Santana had opened the doors to the mainstream for Chicano musicians by appearing at Woodstock and having major hits like Oye Como Va and Everybody's Everything, which reached numbers 13 and 12 respectively in 1970 and 1971. With Suavecito, Malo was announcing Chicano rock was here to stay. Over the past 20 years major Latino acts like Bad Bunny, Pitbull and before them, Gloria Estefan and Los Lobos, have packed arenas and sold enormous amounts of records. But back in 1972, Santana was the only Latino band to chart in the US, despite the large worldwide population of Spanish-speaking people. ""It seemed like the industry could only handle one Latino act at the time,"" Los Angeles-based musician Ruben Amaro tells BBC Culture. ""Competition was fierce in Latino rock bands because they threw just bits and pieces for opportunity within the Latin rock world."" Malo included Bean, who wrote, sang and played timbales, and singer Arcelio Garcia, who died in 2020, a few months after Jorge Santana, who later joined the group in 1971. The band also featured Abel Zarate on guitar, Pablo Tellez on bass, jazz trumpeter Luis Gasca and trombone player Roy Murray, who died in October 2022. Malo was an outgrowth of The Malibus, a late 1960s San Francisco Mission District band that included Bean, Garcia and Santana. Heavily focused on R&B and soul, Bean played saxophone and sang lead vocals for The Malibus with Garcia, while Santana licked out riffs on guitar. 'A modern bolero' From the moment Suavecito starts, with its dreamy electric guitar chords easing into an ethereal trombone solo, you're propelled into a smooth, steady groove of congas, timbales and soul rhythms. ""It's a delicious song,"" Latino rock king Carlos Santana tells BBC Culture. Carlos's younger brother, Jorge, shared guitar duty on the song with Abel Zarate, sprinkling it with airy, lilting notes. ""Laaaah, aah-aah,"" Bean croons.""Never, no, no, yeah, I never met a girl like you in my life."" Bean's voice gives the single its romantic aura, with sentimental lyrics that actually add to its charm. It's reminiscent of the Young Rascals' 1967 hit Groovin', which features an Afro-Cuban beat. But Suavecito has a particularly Chicano-American sound, mixing San Francisco rock with Mexican flourishes and intricate horn arrangements, according to Felix Contreras, co-host of NPR's Alt.Latino show, which celebrates Latin music and culture. ""Suavecito is a modern bolero for our generation,"" Contreras tells BBC Culture, explaining that boleros are a kind of passionate love song that originated in Cuba in the 1800s and spread throughout Mexico and Latin America. Carlos Santana, who played the song live with his brother on tour, appreciates that passion and the song's romantic story. ""It's a certain moment between a lover and his beloved, kind of like Tony and Maria in West Side Story, but it's not Irish, it's not New York Puerto Rican,"" Santana says.""It's from the Mexican Mission district in San Francisco and is part and parcel of piñatas and low-riders and cruising."" It's also a reflection of the Chicano movement, led by farmworker union organizer Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huertes in California at the time, according to another Suavecito fan, Louis Perez, singer and songwriter for renowned Latino rock band Los Lobos, which formed in Los Angeles just a year after Suavecito's release. ""You didn't have to go on a picket line to absorb the impact of the Chicano Movement of the 60s and 70s,"" he tells BBC Culture. ""The Chicano crusade, from 1965 to 1975, fought to establish a union for farm workers not just for higher wages but also for a sense of dignity,"" says Mario Garcia, professor of Chicano Studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara and author of The Chicano Movement: Perspectives from the 21st Century. The farmworkers' struggle ""had a very significant impact, especially on the younger generation in the cities,"" he says. In 1968, Chicano students in East Los Angeles followed the farm workers' lead and led a city-wide boycott of public schools to combat the misperception by teachers that Mexican-American kids were physically and mentally inferior to white children. In 1970, the Chicano movement even led the largest anti-Vietnam War protest by any US minority in the nation, including black Americans. About 25,000 Latinx people gathered in East Los Angeles to protest against the war and were viciously attacked by LA County deputies. These actions spawned a resurgence in Latino representation in art, music and literature, and Suavecito was the ultimate symbol of that growth. ""We kind of climbed out of a melting pot and took pride in everything that was Mexican,"" Perez tells BBC Culture. Suddenly, by 1970, West Coast bands like Malo, Tierra and Azteca looked back to their Mexican heritage for inspiration and began incorporating Latin-American instruments and style into their US rock music. After Suavecito rose in the charts to become a true classic, Malo toured across the nation, appearing on TV shows including American Bandstand, building up a following throughout 1972. ""The band was musically more sophisticated than some of the other Latino bands that were out there at the time,"" says Contreras. ""The interplay between the rock and Afro-Caribbean music was more organic, less clumsy. And the horn arrangements reflected some of the music that was going on with bands like Chicago and Tower of Power, forming their own Latino funk sound."" 'We're not a niche' The song's success helped bring Chicano pride into the mainstream. But Richard Bean, who wrote the song and recorded it as the lead singer, never shared the limelight with Malo. The day after he recorded Suavecito, he was kicked out of the band by the manager. ""I was shocked, totally shocked,"" Malo guitarist Abel Zarate tells BBC Culture.""Because after we recorded the song, I said, 'This is really good'. And the next day, he was gone."" Bean thinks he was axed because his percussion playing wasn't top notch. ""They knew a better percussionist and I really only wanted to be a singer, that could have played a part"", he says. ""To get kicked out of the band, yeah, it hurt me,"" Bean continues. ""It was hard but it didn't break me."" Malo didn't follow Suavecito with more hit songs, according to Alan Hernandez, retired Bay Area professor and co-author with Jim McCarthy of the book Voices of Latino Rock. He says the costs of a large band and a traveling crew made it almost impossible for Malo to stay on the road, plus a constant change of musicians didn't help. In addition, the rock music industry wasn't willing to promote many Latino bands outside of Santana, he points out. ""I think if Bean had stayed in the group, they would have had more success,"" Hernandez tells BBC Culture. ""He was a hitmaker."" Bean went on to form the band Sapo with his brother, which gained popularity on the West Coast. When Jorge Santana left Malo, Bean worked on the guitarist's self-named 1978 solo album and toured with him from 1978 to the early 1980s. Then Bean continued with Sapo, which for a time in the 1980s also included Mike Judge of Beavis and Butthead fame on bass. In 1990, egos were put aside and Garcia reached out to Bean asking him to rejoin Malo, which still performed on the West Coast. ""It was a nice gesture,"" Bean says. So he agreed and has been playing with Malo and Sapo for the past 30 years. Bean still sings Suavecito in most concerts he performs for both bands. He has never revealed the girl's name Suavecito was written for. ""I'll carry it to my grave,"" he tells BBC Culture. Finally, in 1998 Bean got a glint of national recognition. The late-night TV talk show Vibe, hosted by comedian Sinbad and produced by music giant Quincy Jones, invited Bean to Los Angeles to appear on the show and sing Suavecito. Ruben Amaro accompanied the house band and harmonised with Bean on the song. He says Bean may have missed out on playing his national treasure on American Bandstand but finally had his moment 26 years later. ""The sound in the studio was incredible and when we harmonised on that beautiful song, it felt transcendent,"" Amaro says. For Contreras, the love song is important today because it reminds people about Latinos' place in mainstream society. ""It shows that we've always been here,"" he tells BBC Culture. ""We're not a sidebar, we're not a niche."" ""What was really cool about Suavecito was, it wasn't a protest song,"" Perez says. ""It was more about Chicano pride. It was a big, warm Mexican hug to all these young people, which made it a beautiful moment for us. It sounded like a song that had been around forever.""

Spread to US Treasury,System failure in cyber warfare?,2024-09-25,2012-06-08,Tom Chatfield,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20120608-system-failure-in-cyber-warfare,"The discovery of Flame and Stuxnet leaves security experts concerned there are similar malicious software attacks already underway that their systems cannot detect. It’s rare to hear someone admit to failure. Even rarer to admit that their company and the entire industry it represents is guilty of a “spectacular failure”. But that is just what Mikko Hypponen, “cyber-security Jedi” and chief research officer at anti-virus firm F-Secure, did recently. In a candid article for Wired published at the start of June, he admitted that the antivirus industry had been caught with its trousers down by what has been described by some as the most complex piece of malicious software ever created. Known as Flame, the software is an example of a “spyware” infection, designed surreptitiously to record and transmit a record of actions taking place on a compromised system – from video and audio to the individual strokes of a keyboard – as well as offering access to sensitive and supposedly private information. More striking than these capabilities, however, are two crucial factors: the sophistication of Flame’s targeting, and its ability to evade detection. Flame’s targets were almost certainly a handful of computers operating sensitive aspects of nuclear programs in the Middle East. And, as soon became apparent after its discovery, it had been spreading across the world towards these machines for over two years, undetected.  Until its purpose was due to be served, one of the most important pieces of malicious code in existence had to all intents and purposes been invisible. All of which marks out Flame as a tool not of mere criminality, but of cyber-espionage: one developed by a state-sponsored intelligence program with the intent of gathering technical information of the most sensitive kind. Hence Hyponnen’s remarkably frank assessment: “We really should have been able to do better. But we didn’t. We were out of our league, in our own game.” Sophisticated scams    Cyber-crime used to feel, if not like a game with rules, then at least like an arena of knowable motivations. Thanks to the internet, every petty criminal in the world suddenly had access to your front garden (metaphorically speaking) and would muster as much cunning as possible to break into your house – or at least your bank account. Just a day after Iran had announced the discovery of Flame, I was speaking at the Thinking Digital conference in northeast England, where I listened to Hypponen outline one of the more ingenious of such scams. Once infected by the malware in question, your computer produces an official-looking message on startup claiming to be from the FBI. It has been detected, the message says, that your hard drive contains a treasure trove of illicit materials, incriminating you in everything from terrorism to child pornography. Your entire system has been frozen, leaving you only two options: either click here to take the claim to “court” (a bogus dead end); or pay an instant fine to unlock your system. Some users, Hypponen went on to explain, actually paid the fine even though they knew it was a scam – because they couldn’t face the potential humiliation and suspicion of explaining what was going on. Such attacks can be destructive, disturbing and costly. Yet it is, at least, clear what’s going on once you see behind the deceiving veil: what the scammers want (money); how they aim to get it; and what your recourses may be (download a fix; contact the police or civilian digital security experts). Even when it effectively entails taking your computer hostage, financial gain remains a comprehensible motive. Raising alarms What, though, is to be done when the actors involved are states themselves; or digital aggressors acting with the resources of a state behind them? Shrouded by plausible deniability on all sides, it’s increasingly clear that a kind of silent war is beginning online: one whose battles even the experts may only recognize after they’ve been fought, and whose potential targets encompass almost every system or service plugged into a computer. Take Stuxnet, another complex piece of code thought to have targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities. Only now, a full two years after its discovery, are we beginning to get to the bottom of who launched the attack. And, as Hypponen warns, “it’s highly likely there are other similar attacks already underway that we haven’t detected yet.” If this sounds alarmist, well, that’s because it is. If your nuclear research programme is under covert digital attack, the police aren’t likely to be of much use – but it’s far from clear at the moment who else might do a better job. Hence the current global recruitment drive among military contractors for technology experts; and hence an online arms race that has seen Tehran alone spend a reported billion dollars on its offensive and defensive digital capabilities in recent months. Eugene Kaspersky, the man who owns the lab that first identified Flame, has called on nations to stop releasing these weapons “before it’s too late” – words echoed by the United Nations this week. The tools of cyber-espionage, he points out, are not like conventional weapons. Once released, they are free to spread beyond their original purpose or target. And when that happens, they can be analysed, tweaked, built upon and relaunched. They are “cyber boomerangs” that can come straight back at a nation with potentially devastating consequences. Even assuming Kaspersky’s warning is heeded, however, “too late” remains an alarmingly elusive notion in the context of espionage. In Donald Rumsfeld’s immortal words, we live in an age of “unknown unknowns”: of ignorances that we don’t even know we’re ignorant of. We have no idea what threats may arise next in the digital realm – not least because, somewhere, they may already have beaten us in a battle we didn’t even know we were fighting.

Spread to US Treasury,The 20 greatest children's books ever,2024-09-25,2023-05-23,BBC Culture,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230522-the-20-greatest-childrens-books-ever-what-the-voters-say,"What do the global critics and experts who voted in our poll have to say about their top picks? 1. Where the Wild Things Are (words and illustrations by Maurice Sendak, 1963) With its perfect symbiosis of words and pictures, the classic Where the Wild Things Are topped our poll of 100 greatest children's books. First published in 1963, and still loved all over the world, Maurice Sendak's powerful, stunningly illustrated book tells the tale of Max as he goes on a journey of discovery, encountering the ""wild things"". It is a fable that is both dark and ultimately uplifting. ""If I was leaving for a desert island and there was only one book to take away, it would be this one,"" says Marie Wabbes of the Belgian Francophone section of the International Board On Books for Young People (IBBY). ""It understands childhood, the angry child, the attraction of power and the immensity of maternal love."" Quek Hong Shin, the Singapore-based children's author and illustrator, describes it as, ""a great children's book about anger, self-discovery, and a mother's love for a child"". While Rose Green, a US editor, says: ""No childhood is complete without a Wild Rumpus! The quintessential story of losing your cool, taming your monsters, and coming back home to find your supper is still hot."" Ireland-based author Clara Kumagai recalls how, reading the story as a child, the monsters scared her. ""But I still loved them,"" she writes, describing the book as ""an epic that manages to combine fear, courage, love, and loneliness in less than 350 words and 40 pages. It's lyrical and unexpected, and each page does exactly what a picture book should – it surprises and delights.""    2. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (words by Lewis Carroll; illustrations by John Tenniel, 1865)   Among the most iconic works of children's literature, Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (more widely known as Alice in Wonderland) tells the logic-defying story of a girl named  Alice who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world full of anthropomorphic creatures and surreal scenarios. The book has had a huge influence on popular culture, been translated into many languages, and adapted into ballets, operas, films and more. UK film and culture writer Lillian Crawford writes: ""We owe our dreams to Lewis Carroll. [It is] the book which made me curious about the world and imagination, to which I will never tire of returning no matter how old I am."" Ira Saxena, meanwhile, a children's author and book critic based in India, describes the book as ""a remarkable fantasy tale, [with] utterly amusing characters, capturing the senses forever"". Many voters commented on the book's enduring quality and universal appeal. The 1981 edition was illustrated by influential Slovak artist Dušan Kállay, points out Hana Krizanova of Slovakia's International House of Art for Children. Both the text and visuals are, she writes ""iconic and captivating"". And Theo Heras book reviewer and board member of IBBY, Canada,, sums the book up in two words: ""Still magical"".  Read more about BBC Culture’s 100 greatest children’s books: The 100 greatest children’s books  Why Where the Wild Things Are is the greatest children’s book  The 21st Century’s greatest children’s books  Who voted? #100GreatestChildrensBooks 3. Pippi Longstocking (words by Astrid Lindgren; illustrations by Ingrid Nyman, 1945) Pippi Longstocking is a legendary protagonist – a spirited, non-conformist girl with a sharp wit and super-human strength, she has had a powerful influence on several generations since Swedish author Astrid Lindgren created her in 1945. The book has been adapted to both TV and film and is known across the world. Pippi is ""anything but a saint"", says award-winning French children's author Marie-Aude Murail, and she is ""a breath of fresh air in the land of (overly) well-behaved children"". Sophie Casson, Canadian children's book illustrator, writes: ""As a child, I completely identified with the freedom this little girl carried out in every aspect of her being –  Pippi does what she wants, when she wants, in the way she sees fit, very unworried about how she looks. Totally empowering for the little girl from the 70s. Pippi has a strong sense of what is right or wrong and fights for her views, and I think that stays an enduring legacy."" French illustrator Pierre-Emmanuel Lyet says that the book's cover struck him as a child: ""Pippi carrying a horse at arm's length, I thought it was so great! "" And for culture journalist Cath Pound, Pippi was a role model: ""Funny, feisty and delightfully eccentric, Pippi Longstocking is the girl I longed to be as a child."" 4. The Little Prince (words and illustrations by Antoine Saint-Exupéry, 1943) The Little Prince (or Le Petit Prince) is an elegantly illustrated novella about a boy who goes on a journey to visit other planets, on the way considering themes ranging from love and loneliness to friendship and loss. The tale continues to be popular all over the world, appealing to both children and adults. ""This book is a classic that is still used in many education programmes,"" says Cameroonian children's author and playwright Joel Eboueme Bognomo. Monica Severs of Hackney Libraries, London, found the book eye-opening: ""How wonderful for a very bored child (like I was) to be transported to space and visit planets inhabited by such a variety of characters. It appealed to my humanity, the good bits and the not so good. As a child, it gave me a different perspective of people, relationships and myself."" Writer Gülsah Özdemir Koryürek, who is also the co-founder of Sifirdan publishing, Turkey, describes the fable as ""a book of intellectual planets"".  5. The Hobbit (words and illustrations by JRR Tolkien, 1937) The classic fantasy novel The Hobbit is set in Middle Earth, and follows the journey of hobbit protagonist Bilbo Baggins, wizard Gandalf and 13 dwarves. On their episodic quest to reclaim the dwarves' home and treasure, they encounter conflict and danger, and Bilbo gains a new level of maturity and wisdom. Bilbo Baggins is, says UK-based illustrator Jim Kay, ""an unlikely, diminutive protagonist in a beautifully realised world"" – the novel is ""still a joy to read, and it rattles along at a wonderful pace"".  Children's author and broadcaster Chris Smith credits The Hobbit with leading him to a whole new world of reading: ""Not only is this an amazing story for children, it's also the ultimate gateway book because it unlocks the enormous world of [sequel] Lord of the Rings. When my teacher read us this book in year nine it blew my mind,  and started me off on a reading journey that's still going strong, and still feels unexpected 40 years later."" US author Christopher Paolini, meanwhile, describes The Hobbit as ""a perfect fairy tale for young and old alike. Tolkien captured magic with this one"".  6. Northern Lights (Philip Pullman, 1995) The first of the trilogy His Dark Materials, the powerful Northern Lights is set in a parallel universe dominated by the Magisterium, where Lyra Belacqua – accompanied by her ""daemon"" – travels to the Arctic to search for her missing friend Roger and her imprisoned uncle Lord Asriel, who has been experimenting with a mysterious substance, ""Dust"". Pam Dix, chair of IBBY UK, recalls how the novel  ""exploded into the children's fiction world. Bringing together a multiplicity of concepts in a format that is more than fantasy, more than historical fiction, a new form"". Lisa Sainsbury of the University of Roehampton says: ""When Philip Pullman conceived of daemons and created a world for them, he conjured one of the potent metaphors of children's literature. Northern Lights (and His Dark Materials) offers the means through which to explore the mysteries of childhood and growing up, and renders these experiences through a bold expression of girlhood. Northern Lights makes childhood matter, long after we have moved into realms beyond it."" Writer and journalist Beverley D'Silva praises the novel as ""life-changing, cosmic storytelling"".  7. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (words by C S Lewis; illustrations by Pauline Baynes, 1950) CS Lewis's fantasy novel is the first – and the most celebrated – of seven novels in the Chronicles of Narnia. A land of talking animals and mythical creatures ruled by the evil White Witch, Narnia is the setting in which four English schoolchildren find themselves, after travelling there through a wardrobe in the country house where they are staying. Their adventures lead them to meet the lion Aslan. ""With the publication of this book, we learned that we could enter another world through the back of a wardrobe, and our world was never the same,"" says US-based writer Ellen Kushner. While US author Christopher Paolini  writes: ""Step through this door into a new world… Isn't that the basis of so many stories? Lewis perfectly captured that feel, and his characters are lively and memorable, as is the land of Narnia. As with all great stories, the ending is a bit bittersweet, and leaves one yearning for more."" The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is ""just a magnificent book"", says Tine Nielsen of Babel-Bridge Literary Agency, Denmark, ""with so many compelling characters, so many layers and so many memories that will stay with you for the rest of your life"".   8. Winnie-the-Pooh (words by AA Milne; illustrations by EH Shepard, 1926) Set in the fictional Hundred Acre Wood, the beloved Winnie-the-Pooh follows the adventures of anthropomorphic bear Pooh, and his friends Piglet, Eeyore, Owl, Rabbit, Kanga and Roo. Its sequel is The House at Pooh Garden. ""An unforgettable story of friendship"" is how Theresa Rogers, professor of education at the University of British Columbia, Canada, describes it. ""Winnie-the-Pooh, Eeyore, Piglet and the rest are affecting characters that young readers take with them throughout their lives (as have I)."" Katrin Lilija, editor-in-chief of Lestrarklefinn, Iceland, also has happy memories of reading the book as she grew up: ""Winnie the Pooh is a book I enjoyed with my father as a child. The innocence of Pooh bear has stayed with me since my childhood, along with some memorable solutions and misunderstandings he and the other animals in Hundred Acre Wood make. The story of Pooh is a book I read to my children."" UK author MG Leonard is also a fan: ""The humour [and] the perfectly observed idiosyncrasies of each character throughout these gentle stories about growing up are unsurpassed. I was read these stories, then read these stories, and have then gone on to read them to my own children."" 9. Charlotte's Web (words by EB White; Illustrations by Garth Williams, 1952) American author EB White's brilliantly told tale centres on a farm girl's pet pig Wilbur and his friendship with a barn spider named Charlotte. When Wilbur is under threat of slaughter, Charlotte weaves messages into her web praising Wilbur in order to persuade the farmer to let him live. Themes including innocence, change and mortality are all addressed as the story unfolds. ""This story struck my empathy cord very strongly in grade two when the teacher read it to the class,"" writes Canadian illustrator Sophie Casson. ""A sad story ending was so new to my imagination, it jolted me forward into a feeling of emotional maturity. A perfect book to introduce big questions about life and death."" Singapore-based author and illustrator Quek Hon also points to the grown-up subjects addressed in the book, describing it as ""a book filled with giant themes for little ones"". Kalpana Sunder, a journalist based in India, calls it ""one of the most magical books, that takes the reader into a world where children and animals rule"".   10. Matilda (words by Roald Dahl; illustrations by Quentin Blake, 1988) The iconic Matilda Wormwood is a precocious child with cruel parents, and Dahl's much-loved novel follows her time in school, run by the sadistic, authoritarian Miss Trunchbull. Along the way, Matilda's remarkable intelligence is nurtured by her teacher Miss Honey, and disregarded by her parents and the tyrannical headmistress, as the story unfolds with increasingly extreme scenarios. The book's illustrations by Quentin Blake have become synonymous with the story, and all of Dahl's work. Matilda has been successfully adapted for stage and screen, and, decades after it was first published, continues to attract devotees across the world. ""Is there a single bookish child in the world who wouldn't pick Matilda as one of their top 10?"" asks David Robson, science writer and author. ""Matilda teaches us that it's okay to feel different from the people who are closest to us, and the power of being true to ourselves."" Culture writer Lillian Crawford describes Matilda as ""the essential companion for bookish girls"". And for the Children's Laureate of Wales, Connor Allen, Matilda ""gives children hope, and above all lets their imagination run wild and enjoy a heartfelt story. One of the best stories and films for me as a child"". 11. Anne of Green Gables (LM Montgomery, 1908) Canadian author LM Montgomery's 1908 novel is blessed with one of children's literature's great heroines: red-headed, 11-year-old orphan girl Anne Shirley, who ends up living on a farm on Prince Edward Island, after being mistakenly adopted by a middle-aged brother and sister, when they had intended to adopt a boy. Headstrong, fearless, and highly intelligent, Anne is a figure that young readers have identified with through the ages, for the way in which she makes the best of everything in life, making mistakes but growing in strength and maturity as the story progresses. ""Any girl who feels like an outsider, like she doesn't fit in, will find herself in the pages of this book. I loved Anne deeply. To me this story wasn't inside a book, it was real,"" says MG Leonard. ""Anne's exuberance for life in spite of her difficult beginnings, her creativity and joy still inspire readers,"" agrees Theo Heras. It is also a book that has been ""read and recognised globally,"" says Karin Lesnik-Oberstein, professor of English Literature at University of Reading. ""A Canadian classic which has had a great influence on ideas of Canadian identity and Canadian landscape."" 12. Fairy Tales (Hans Christian Andersen, 1827) Are there any stories as seminal within children's literature as those of the 19th-Century Danish author? From The Emperor's New Clothes to Thumbelina to The Ugly Duckling, his imaginatively inspiring tales, perfect in their mix of light and shade, have gripped generations of children at bedtime and otherwise – transporting them to fantastical worlds while teaching them about ordinary human values like love, kindness and honesty. They've also inspired endless retellings in all artforms, right up to this month's loosely-inspired Disney live-action Little Mermaid blockbuster. ""I especially appreciate the volume translated into English by Tiina Nunnally, since I don't read Danish, and many of the previous versions were translations of translations,"" comments Mexican writer and activist Sandra Cisneros. ""Andersen's tales make me understand why he was so revolutionary in his day. I adore this book. I read it all the time as an adult, especially the marvellous The Snow Queen"".  13. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (JK Rowling, 1997) What more can be said about JK Rowling's tale of a boy wizard's adventures at magical boarding school Hogwarts, the beginning of an era-defining, internationally-beloved franchise? Published in 1997, with an initial run of only 500 copies – where its current sales stand at over 120 million copies worldwide – it has beguiled all ages with its parade of vividly-drawn characters and scintillating narrative twists and turns. Above all, what many readers have valued is Rowling's skill at immersing them in a world that was so fully-realised from the off. ""It's the most influential book for my generation for sure,"" comments Hana Krizanova. ""We grew up together with Harry, Hermione and Ron. Not so many books have left me in such despair that I can't be there with them."" ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone brought a new kind of magic to me as a young reader, and continues to reach new readers still today. The magical world of Harry Potter has expanded greatly, but the books will always contain the greatest experience,"" adds Katrin Lilija. Meanwhile US children's author Kathryn Erskine provides a personal touch in her commendation: ""There's good reason that Harry's fight of good against evil captured the world's attention – it is creative, imaginative, and utterly engaging,"" she says. ""And thank you, Jim Dale, for the audio books, so exquisitely done that you not only made the multi-day road trip doable, my family sat in our van in the hotel parking lot to hear the end.""    14. The Very Hungry Caterpillar (Eric Carle, 1969) ""How can a book so simple be so impactful?"" asks Portuguese literary agent and editorial consultant Racquel Mestre of Carle's classic picture book about a very peckish caterpillar who consumes his way through a whole variety of comestibles until, in the climax, he transforms into… a be-winged vision. Perhaps it's that its narrative of metamorphosis and change over time is such a potent one, or perhaps it's to do with the universal joy of eating (it even has holes in its pages to represent the caterpillar's gnawing through the book).  Ghanaian writer Nii Ayikwei Parkes has a particularly pleasing explanation for its appeal: ""I have a niece that calls this 'the book with the hole in it', and I think that is precisely its charm,"" he says. ""It allows every kid to find their place in it, which is what good books do."" And there's that ending ""which is fantastic, always surprising and full of joy,"" says Chilean author and illustrator Maria J Guarda, ""a wide spread of a beautiful butterfly blossoming. It is always a pleasure to observe Carle's images, with bits of paper cut to form shapes, and a great balance of white with vibrant colours and textures.""    15. The Dark is Rising (Susan Cooper, 1973) Fantasy writing doesn't come more evocative than Cooper's beguiling novel of magic and mystery, in which a young boy, Will Stanton, experiences a profound disturbance on the night of his 11th birthday – leading to his realisation that he is the last of the ancient Old Ones, and a key player in vanquishing the forces of the Dark. Indeed, Australian writer and illustrator Anna Zobel reveals that the book ""is on my desk right now, covered in post-its, because I'm using it as a mentor text for upper primary writing workshops. Cooper is a genius at evading exposition. Her language is so playful, too. She's the master of quiet metaphor, of personification, of inverted phrasing. In those same pages, the snow is 'thin and apologetic'; The lawn is 'a wide grey sweep'; the rabbits move 'twitch-nosed forward'. She's a brilliant writer to both read and study."" Thematically, meanwhile, it taps into something so fundamental that young readers can't help but be stirred by it. ""Profound is the word I would use to describe the impact this book had on me,"" notes MG Leonard. ""It enabled me to see darkness and light at work, through people's actions in daily life, and the courage to champion and fight for the light.""  16. The Arrival (Shaun Tan, 2006) The wordless graphic novel is one of 14 21st-Century books in the top 100, the power of its images appealing to voters around the world. According to Melanie Ramdarshan Bold, a senior lecturer in children's and YA literature at the University of Glasgow, Scotland, ""This gorgeous wordless graphic novel really distils the emigrating/immigrating/refugee experience – the fear, suffering, loneliness, anxiety, strangeness, hopefulness, cultural and communication barriers – in a powerful and unique way. I loved the magical realism – the strange fruits, animals, buildings and transport – which really show how bizarre and alien the experience of adapting to a new environment can be."" Donovan Bixley, a children's author and illustrator from New Zealand, calls The Arrival ""a tour de force"", praising the book for being ""endlessly re-readable for all ages and brilliantly executed to allow readers from any culture to empathise with the characters"". Kimberley Reynolds, Emerita Professor of children's literature at the UK's Newcastle University, says: ""A timeless fable for our times: families separated by poverty and oppression, reunited in new places where they can thrive. The images powerfully evoke the confusion, loneliness and uncertainty of starting in a new country whose language, conventions and cuisine are unfamiliar. Each detail has been carefully thought about. An uplifting and unforgettable book."" The images manage to convey a complicated story: ""Without words it portrays the struggle of the displaced, the lost, and the lonely trying to find a new life in foreign lands,"" says Jim Kay, while Nii Ayikwei Parkes ""fell in love with this book as a father, appreciating for the first time as an adult the incredible narrative power of illustration"". Clara Kumagai sums it up: ""This book has no words – and doesn't need them. In its wordlessness, young readers can create their own stories; for others it may mirror the experience of emigrating (or fleeing) to a country in which language and culture is strange and unknown. The art is gorgeous, sepia-toned and detailed, each page demanding to be lingered over."" 17. Little Women (Louisa May Alcott, 1869) ""I must've read and re-read Little Women countless times,"" says MG Leonard. ""I loved the relationships between the sisters, and saw myself in Jo. This was the first book I read to truly make me weep floods of tears. It is a wonderful book."" Lillian Crawford also returns to Little Women regularly, and identifies with Jo: ""Perhaps the children's book I come back to the most, as the March sisters grow older and I understand them more truly. Louisa May Alcott created the perfect book for little girls to grow into womanhood with. I will forever be a Jo."" Kalpana Sunder praises the ""strong female characters in a powerful tale"", and Karin Lesnik-Oberstein says that Little Women is ""another globally recognised and enduring classic, which is reflected in the many film versions made of it"". Emerita Professor of children's literature at Newcastle University Kimberley Reynolds similarly highlights its multiple adaptations, commenting: ""A genuine classic that is threaded through publishing and cinematic history. Powerful females managing at home in a wartime (civil war) context. Validation of creativity, but also of nurturing. Despite the wartime backdrop, men as well as women are shown to be empathetic and caring, and women to be courageous and strong. Life is unpredictable."" 18. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Roald Dahl, 1964) The wit and verve of Roald Dahl's classic are a big draw for poll voters, with children's book author and illustrator Quek Hong Shin from Singapore praising it for being ""a deliciously wicked story"", and US author Christopher Paolini commenting that the book is ""surreal, funny, and full of delightful wordplay"". ""All of Dahl's works are a delight in language,"" says children's book illustrator Sophie Casson from Canada. ""Although some of the characters' stereotypical depictions are to be discussed with the children, the story absolutely jolts children in an incredible fantasy land all children connect to. You can almost smell the chocolate with Charlie. This story literally blew my mind with imagination and I was so drawn in by the duality of the personality in Willy Wonka."" The illustrations are a big part of the appeal, too, as Hana Križanová says: ""It was almost impossible to choose just one book from Roald Dahl, he is one of the most talented storytellers of our times. Dahl and Quentin Blake managed to create iconic stories with very simple, funny visuals that made them an unforgettable power couple.""   19. Heidi (Johanna Spyri, 1880) The alpine classic is a hit with voters around the globe who appreciate its vivid evocation of landscape and compelling characters. Kalpana Sunder praises the book for being ""an endearing story that takes you to the Swiss Alps, with a gruff but loving grandfather, and a childhood spent in the outdoors"", while Nii Ayikwei Parkes says: ""This was a book I connected with as a kid, primarily because of the goats, but the friendship between Clara and Heidi is so moving that it became a favourite."" The book's rural setting draws in readers, as BBC Culture's Lindsay Baker comments: ""Heidi lives on a beautiful mountainside in an attic room – the ultimate escapist fantasy."" And for many, such as the British writer and arts critic Marianne Levy, that contrast with their own lives accounts for Heidi's enduring appeal. ""Growing up deep in English suburbia, I was enthralled by this book's alpine meadows, and in complete agreement with little Heidi on the stifling nature of the city,"" she says. ""Long after I was old enough to know better, it was my deepest desire to sleep in a hayloft and drink milk fresh from a goat."" 20. Goodnight Moon (words by Margaret Wise Brown; illustrations by Clement Hurd, 1947) This picture book – in which a bunny says goodnight to the objects and creatures in its bedroom – contains layers that aren't immediately apparent, according to the voters in the poll. ""Originally published in 1947, Margaret Wise Brown's knowledge of child development is behind the incredible simplicity of this book,"" says Pam Dix. ""Animate and inanimate objects play equally vital roles in the young child's world."" The book's pared-back approach is deceptive, according to Giorgia Grilli at the University of Bologna, Italy: ""A child's prayer. An apparently simple, yet deeply intense book on the courage it takes to close one's eyes when it is dark."" Joe Sutliff Sanders from the University of Cambridge believes the book places the reader into several different roles at the same time: ""A masterclass in understatement, Goodnight Moon tricks the adult reading the book into becoming a poet, a tour guide to the dwindling moments before sleep, and a naughty child, a gift for any grown-up."" A balm for all ages, ""it never fails to soothe and quiet a little one or a frazzled parent,"" says Theo Heras. And The Observer's picture book critic and News Review assistant editor Imogen Carter argues that Goodnight Moon is ""simultaneously a sort of sedative in book form, and one of the wackiest children's tales ever written: the words lull and charm while the wildly beautiful colours of the illustrations blow your mind with their delightful incongruity.""

Spread to US Treasury,The Martians are coming!,2024-09-25,2013-10-30,Jordan Hoffman,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20131029-war-of-the-worlds-viral-radio,"Orson Welles’ vision of the apocalypse from Mars anticipated today’s Hollywood storytelling and our own doom-minded moment, writes Jordan Hoffman. We interrupt this article to bring you a special bulletin: the legendary radio broadcast of HG Wells’ The War of the Worlds, presented by Orson Welles on 30 October 1938, is celebrating its 75th anniversary. It catapulted its already notorious director to superstardom, sent radio listeners into panic (though to what degree is the subject of debate), and put Grover's Mill, New Jersey on the map. More striking, however, is just how current everything about the broadcast remains. Recent years have seen a barrage of mass destruction in film and television, from Cloverfield to The Walking Dead to the final battle of Man of Steel. Changes in technology, most notably mobile phone cameras, have also given birth to a new subgenre rooted in fooling its audience: the ‘found-footage’ horror film. We are not likely to be fooled by radio today, but The War of the Worlds set the stage for equivalent 21st-Century freak outs. Welles’ radio programme The Mercury Theatre on the Air began airing adaptations of classic literary works in July 1938. After 16 programmes including Treasure Island and The Count of Monte Cristo, Welles decided that for the night before Halloween he would try, as he put it, “the radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying ‘Boo!’” The result was a perfect marriage of content and form – a horrifying examination of the apocalypse presented in a new, and therefore frightening, medium. Apocalypse now Stories of humanity’s end go all the way back to Noah and the flood, but the kind of apocalyptic narrative that resonates most is often determined by the political and social factors of its time. In 1938 Americans were looking nervously toward Europe and the threat of fascism. Annalee Newitz, editor-in-chief of sci-fi website io9.com and author of Scatter, Adapt and Remember: How Humans Will Survive a Mass Extinction, believes that an ‘end-it-all story’ was just what radio listeners wanted. “[It was] very satisfying for an audience that doesn't know what to expect next and doesn't want to worry about the future,” Newitz says. She feels anxious people still reeling from World War I and the influenza pandemics that followed it, worldwide economic depression and the fear of further conflict in Europe found a tale of definitive destruction like The War of the Worlds to be “comfort food.” Similar anxieties about an uncertain future invade the minds of pop culture consumers today. The world has yet to catch its breath after the attacks on the World Trade Center, wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, housing bubbles, fiscal cliffs and a news culture breathlessly looking for a new threat. The number of recent films featuring unstoppable doom on the scale of The War of the Worlds has been vast. There have been aliens (Cloverfield, Skyline, Battle: Los Angeles) and viruses (the Resident Evil series, 28 Days/Weeks Later, Contagion). We have seen human biology stop working (Children of Men, Perfect Sense) and the Earth explode for no reason (2012, Knowing, Melancholia). Newitz cites the critical and popular success of Cormac McCarthy’s 2006 novel The Road, which, like Welles’ War of the Worlds, possesses very little in terms of backstory. The fear and uncertainty of government is blasted away [in The Road],” she says. “For an audience worried about unknowable terrorist enemies and confused by complex tax and health insurance policies, you strip that off and worry instead about the basics: food, shelter and broken legs.” Orson’s Martians The Mercury Theatre’s broadcast offered its similarly knotted-up listeners a heaped plate of the same fare. Loosely adapting HG Wells’ 1898 sci-fi novel, the programme was a fourth-wall-breaking peek at what a radio station would sound like giving an on-the-scene news report of an unstoppable interplanetary invasion. No one knows for certain to what extent Welles had intended to spread panic, but certain facts remain. CBS' Mercury Theatre on the Air was not the most popular programme during the 8 pm time slot on Sundays. That was NBC's Chase and Sanborn Hour, a variety show. But Welles knew precisely when Chase and Sanborn cut to a musical interlude, which was also when many people would spin the dial to see what else was on. That was when his War of the Worlds, which at the time was masquerading as a similar variety show gave its first heart-stopping “we interrupt this broadcast”. Since Mercury had only middling ratings, it was not a sponsored show. As such, it did not have regularly scheduled commercial breaks. So if you were somebody who switched over without hearing the introduction, you had a solid half-hour remaining of frenzied reporting from the frontline of the advancing apocalypse. “There were no other points of verification back then. You couldn't crowdsource on Twitter or check CNN.com,” says media consultant Max Dawson, a former professor of Radio, TV and Film at Northwestern University. The absence of conflicting reports may have had a greater psychological effect. The other networks might have been covering up what was happening or, considering that the machinations of large radio networks were still unknown to people, it could also be easy to believe that CBS had the only scoop. Indeed, the most terrifying moments in Welles' broadcast include the use of dead air – an intentional ‘technical difficulty’ – analogous to today's viral videos and found-footage movies shot using shaky mobile phone cameras. It is far more difficult to determine if something is fake if its form is imperfect. Fool me once “New technologies are magnets for our fears, and new media is a flashpoint because communication is so central to our experience,” Dawson adds. The Blair Witch Project, a spiritual grandchild of Welles' War of the Worlds, was the first to exploit the internet to spread misinformation in the name of entertainment. And no movie campaign since has pulled the wool over our eyes in quite the same way. It wasn't just the use of then ‘prosumer’ video but the false website that claimed the movie was actually stitched-together from uncovered raw stock. Still, if not actually fooling the audience, other found-footage movies, like Cloverfield and Paranormal Activity have had some success. And always these are movies meant to scare the pants off of people. “Technology changes, anxiety stays the same,” Dawson says. “It's somewhat endearing.” If we aren't going to be duped by radio or movies again, what is next? Perhaps social media. “I want to see the Orson Welles of Vine,” Dawson jokes. “I look forward to seeing creative people who understand how new platforms can confront our enduring anxieties.” While fears of terrorism and a fragile global economy remain, and new technology proliferates, there will be no lack of psychological demand for stories of the apocalypse. The most effective storytellers will understand how to translate – and exorcise – real-world fears into symbolic mythmaking, just like Welles did. What was the first mainstream movie to exploit 9/11 imagery for horror-entertainment catharsis, after a tacit agreement in Hollywood to pull back a bit? A certain film by Steven Spielberg in 2005: an adaptation of War of the Worlds.

Spread to US Treasury,The unknown women who recovered art from Nazis,2024-09-25,2024-03-13,Mia Taylor,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240313-monuments-women-new-orleans-wwii-museum-recovered-art-from-nazis,"Years after the 2014 Hollywood movie made the Monuments Men famous, the Monuments Women are finally being recognized with an exhibition in New Orleans. The award-winning 2014 Hollywood movie The Monuments Men, exposed audiences around the world to what was arguably the greatest treasure hunt in history. The movie, starring A-listers George Clooney, Matt Damon and Bill Murray, tells the true story of a World War Two platoon that came to be known as the Monuments Men, a group tasked by President Franklin D Roosevelt with rescuing art stolen by the Nazis during the course of the war.  While the film shines a light on the harrowing work involved in protecting and recovering art from the Nazis, there's one part of the story not told by the movie: the Monument Women. Alongside the men who were engaged in the important effort of preserving priceless cultural treasures for future generations, there were also women who played a key role in that effort. And now, nearly 80 years later, those overlooked women are getting their close-up thanks to a New Orleans exhibition. The National World War II Museum in the United States, located in New Orleans, Louisiana, recently staged the first exhibition in the world to ever include the stories of some of the Monuments Women. The exhibition is merely one part of a broader effort that has taken place to fully recognise the overlooked women. The Dallas-based Monuments Men Foundation, established 15 years ago, has also officially changed its name to the Monuments Men and Women Foundation, as part of the movement to acknowledge all of the individuals responsible for saving priceless works of art both during and after World War Two. ""It was only when I started traveling around with the foundation and finding and meeting the Monuments Women that I had a chance to find out more about their story,"" says Robert M Edsel, who established The Monuments Men Foundation and has written four books about these individuals, including the number-one bestseller that served as the basis for George Clooney's movie. ""My view now is that if we're going to tell the story of the Monuments Men, that means the Monuments Men and Women. And let's make sure the women get full billing and credit."" The exhibition at the National WWII Museum, which is housed in the Liberation Pavillion and is now part of the museum's permanent collection, is designed to do just that. Spread over three rooms, the exhibit includes state-of-the-art digital interactive experiences and even an immersive recreation of a salt mine where Nazis had hidden some of the stolen art that was later recovered by monuments officers. And throughout the installation, there are panels, many written by Edsel himself, dedicated to helping future generations learn about the critical role that more than two dozen women played in returning priceless works of art. While World War Two was in full swing, with battles raging across Europe, Monuments Men working behind enemy lines were charged with protecting art from the Nazis. The group was made up of a special force of American and British museum directors, curators, art historians and others. But it wasn't until the war ended in 1945 – and the effort turned to returning art – that women became involved.  ""At the end of war, the word goes out in an article written in Stars and Stripes that this Monument effort needs more bodies,"" explains Edsel, and it was at that point that women began signing up to join the cause. The Allied armies' Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives (MFAA) team, as it was officially called, ultimately included 27 women, the majority of whom were from the United States, but about six to seven were British and a handful of the women were French. Edsel has met and interviewed several of these women whom he describes as brave war heroes and is in the process of writing a book about them. Among the British team members was Anne Popham Bell, the niece of author Virginia Woolf. Popham Bell's father was keeper of the Department of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum and an authority in Italian drawings. Anne Popham Bell grew up immersed in art and went on to study art history herself at the Courtauld Institute in London. That knowledge made her an invaluable asset to the MFAA team. ""Her initial job in the British military was driving a motorcycle at night, under blackout conditions in order to deliver photos to a runway,"" explains Edsel. ""Those were harrowing experiences, on a motorcycle, while London is being bombed, driving along a bomb-cratered road."" In 1945, Popham Bell was dispatched to the MFAA Branch of the Control Commission for Germany, and ultimately found herself stationed in Bünde at Divisional Headquarters where she became the highest ranking female officer at the location, charged with coordinating the Monuments Men in the field. But that wasn't all. Later, Popham Bell helped the MFAA team return some 5,000 church bells that had been looted from churches across Europe. They had been taken by the Nazis to be smelted to create war materials, Edsel explains. ""There was a shipyard in Hamburg filled with all of these church bells as far as the eye could see. There were church bells piled on top of church bells and she had to go through all of them looking at foundry marks to try and figure out what country they came from and what church,"" continues Edsel. ""She was in charge of coordinating that."" Mary Regan Quessenberry, who was born in Boston, Massachusetts, was another member of the Monuments Women. Quessenberry graduated from Radcliffe in 1937 with a degree in arts history and then spent a year traveling the world as a Radcliffe Scholar. During that time, Quessenberry visited China and Japan, where she studied Asian art with Harvard professor and future Monuments Man Langdon Warner. Later, she returned to the United States and to Radcliffe in order to pursue a Master of Arts, where her professors would include another future Monuments Man, Mason Hammond.   In 1942, Quessenberry enlisted in the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corp, which was the first female unit to serve in the US Army in a capacity that did not involve nursing work. ""She was a real war hero,"" says Edsel, who visited Quessenberry to interview her a few years before she passed away at the age of 94. ""She was among the first graduating class of the Women's Auxiliary Corp. There were 40,000 women who applied and about 400-plus were accepted. She was in the very first graduating class and was in England [during the war] as early as 1943."" Quessenberry initially underwent training that allowed her to assess bomb damage from aerial photographs following air raids. She used this skill to identify important monuments and culturally-significant sites that should be avoided during future bombing runs. But after the Allied victory, as the war was winding down, she too responded to the article in Stars and Stripes seeking Monuments team members. ""Her parents had taught her to stick your head up in the air and take risks because something great might happen, so she volunteered for the Monuments work, and it required her to go to Berlin,"" says Edsel. ""And when she gets there and knocks on the door, the door opens and it's Mason Hammond, her history teacher from Harvard and he throws his arms around her and says 'Mary, thank God you're here'.""  Quessenberry's assignment in Berlin involved identifying German dealers who might still be trying to traffic art stolen by the Nazis, says Edsel. She was also tasked with finding any art that Allied soldiers may have taken. Quessenberry continued doing that work until 1948. ""She loved it,"" says Edsel. ""She was unabashed and determined."" During her time on the team, Quessenberry successfully identified some works of art that dealers were trying to move around. ""She took the MPs [military police] and put a stop to that,"" adds Edsel. ""She was immensely proud,"" continues Edsel. ""She wanted to break the glass ceiling. She was very proud about being a woman in uniform and representing her country and very proud about what she was doing as a Monuments officer. She was glad to be able to put her art history education to work."" Rose Valland had perhaps the most Hollywood-movie-esque role of all the Monuments Women. She was working at the Jeu de Paume museum in Paris as its curator, supervising operations and collections when, in October 1940, the Nazis commandeered the building and turned it into the headquarters and clearing house for all the art they were looting. The building was used to store paintings and countless other works of art, much of which had been stolen from private French collections, often owned by Jews. ""The Nazis wanted to have one person working in the building who was not from their group, someone who could keep the lights on and the power running and that person was Rose Valland,"" explains Edsel. ""But unbeknownst to them, she spoke German."" For four years, Valland worked there and eavesdropped on Nazi conversations, surreptitiously maintaining detailed notes of all the art that was passing through the building, including the destinations of train car shipments filled with looted art.  ""She was using her near-photographic memory watching these works of art coming through the door and keeping track of where they are going,"" continues Edsel. ""And she was pulling photo negatives and stuffing them into her brassiere or wherever she could. So, she develops this warehouse of information of what's been stolen and where it's been shipped."" With all of the information Valland collected, she played a tremendously important role after liberation in helping to recover stolen art. ""In April 1945, weeks before the war's over, she becomes captain in the French army and goes into Germany with that army, right behind the Americans and starts what will become a lifelong  – almost 40-year – odyssey, looking for works of art stolen from her country,"" Edsel continues. Valland was determined to spend every day for the remainder of her life looking for this art, says Edsel. And she did. Edsel's foundation, The Monuments Men and Women, is now preparing to republish Valland's memoir about this experience, titled The Art Front. The book was initially published in French back in 1961 and recounts Valland's experiences secretly maintaining notes about where the art stolen by the Nazis was being shipped. By the time the Monuments team disbanded in 1951 they had recovered more than five million works of art, including priceless pieces by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Botticelli and Manet. There are several panels within the exhibit at the National WWII Museum in New Orleans dedicated to the women who took part in this effort, including Rose Valland, Mary Quessenberry and others. There are also interactive floating paintings that tell visitors the story behind the painting, where it was stolen from – and the monuments man or woman who was responsible for recovering it. The exhibition also allows visitors to research the entire roster of women who were involved in the effort to recover lost art. ""The exhibit is titled Monuments Men and Women and that was a conscious decision we made,"" says retired Col Peter D Crean, vice president of education and access at the National WWII Museum. ""While the common lexicon refers to the Monuments Men, there were men and women who were attached to this effort and the women played a major role."" Crean stresses that including the women in the exhibition's title and throughout the exhibit itself is not about telling a ""fuller"" story of the monument effort. It's about telling the story. ""It's the Monuments Men and Women,"" he says. The new exhibition, along with the republishing of Valland's book and the renaming of the Dallas-based Monuments Men foundation, are merely three ways the work of the Monuments Women will live on. The US Army also recently celebrated the graduation of its first class of new monuments officers, which are now being called heritage and preservation officers. The graduates included several women, among them Captain Jessia Wagner, who says carrying on the work of the Monuments Women is incredibly necessary and something she is proud to do. ""I studied the MFAA women and men during graduate school research and remember thinking… they stepped into these insane roles during World War Two and they absolutely rose to the occasion,"" says Wagner. ""It was not a 'me' motivation; it was a 'we' motivation, being a part of something bigger than yourself, a greater mission... The group was laser-focused on how to affect greater change together...It's definitely an honor to carry the Monuments Women’s work forward.""

Spread to US Treasury,What is levelling up and who is it helping?,2024-09-25,2021-03-03,By Anthony Reuben,https://www.bbc.com/news/56238260,"MPs have criticised levelling up schemes after finding that only 10% of the promised funding has been spent so far. The Public Accounts Committee also criticised a lack of transparency in how the money was allocated. Levelling up is a government policy to reduce inequality based on where people live. It was a big slogan for the Conservatives in the 2019 election and was in the party's manifesto.  Rishi Sunak says its aim is ""to create jobs, drive growth, and make sure that people feel enormous pride in the places that they call home"". The Levelling Up Fund awarded £1.7bn to projects in October 2021, £2.1bn in January 2023 and another £1.1bn in November 2023. The North West of England received the most money overall, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber. Questions were raised when the South East of England was awarded the second largest amount of funding in the second round. The government highlighted funding per head of the population. If you look at the funding awards this way, Wales comes out on top and the North of England does better than the South of England. The Public Accounts Committee said that only £3.7bn had been allocated to local authorities by December 2023, while councils had been able to spend only £1.24bn as of Sept 2023. It said the first round of levelling up funding was awarded to ""shovel-ready"" projects that were due to be completed in March, but 60 out of 71 (85%) have had to extend their deadlines, with further delays in other schemes said to be ""likely"". Areas were invited to bid for investment in transport, cultural, town centre and regeneration projects. Local MPs were allowed to give their formal support to two bids before the proposals were judged by officials from the Treasury, Levelling Up Department and Department for Transport. Assessing how fair this is, is not straightforward. Some projects - such as transport - may spread across several constituencies, represented by MPs from different parties. For the projects that can be allocated to a single party, we can say that more money was allocated to Conservative constituencies than to Labour ones. But there are significantly more Conservative ones. BBC analysis of the second round of funding found: Areas have also been competing for money under the government's Towns Fund. In that contest, of the 56 constituencies that won, 47 had Conservative MPs. On the second round of funding, Rishi Sunak said: ""two thirds of all the levelling up funding is going to the most deprived parts of our country"". BBC analysis shows that using the government's index of multiple deprivation, which is the usual measure, in the second round about 57% of England's funding went to the areas with the highest deprivation, down from 69% in the first round. That analysis excludes a small number of awards that were given to areas covering multiple local authorities.    We asked the Levelling Up department about Mr Sunak's claim. It said it was not based on the government's index of multiple deprivation but was instead based on measures involving productivity, employment, vacancy rates, lack of skills and transport links.  Labour said the money awarded was dwarfed by the cuts to local authority funding since 2010, with Alex Norris telling MPs: ""the government have nicked a tenner from our wallets and expect us to be grateful for getting less than two quid back."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies found that between 2009-10 and 2019-20, English councils' non-education funding per resident had fallen by almost a quarter, after adjusting for rising prices. The Institute for Government found that councils in the most deprived areas had been worst hit because they were the most reliant on central government funding. Andy Street, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands criticised the Levelling Up funding process as being part of Whitehall's ""broken begging bowl culture"". He suggested the money would have been allocated better by local decision-makers than civil servants in London. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"
Spread to US Treasury,Wales awaits Christmas Covid rules decision,2024-09-25,2021-12-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-59682599,"Wales is waiting to find out if ministers in Cardiff will reimpose tougher restrictions on businesses and social contact. The Welsh government cabinet met twice on Thursday to decide how to tackle the new Omicron variant, amid alarm at its growing spread in the UK. It is not clear whether they will issue advice, impose new legal restrictions, or do both. The number of Omicron cases in Wales rose by 33 to 95 on Friday. But a ""rapid increase over the coming days and weeks is expected"", according to Dr Meng Khaw, national director for health protection and screening services for Public Health Wales. There will be a press conference, led by Mark Drakeford, on Friday, but more details may be released on Thursday night. Wales' most senior doctor, chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton, advised the public to ""prioritise"" who they see at Christmas. He said the Welsh NHS has been asked to consider cancelling some types of care, which could include planned surgery. It comes as overall UK cases have hit a record for the second day running. First Minister Mark Drakeford predicted Omicron will hit Wales ""very quickly and very steeply"" in January. He said a number of services - from the NHS to bin collections - could be affected if lots of workers are off sick. At a Welsh Parliament committee meeting he warned of estimates indicating the coming wave could see ""half of the population of the United Kingdom will fall ill with coronavirus"". ""That is the most enormous number and it will be compressed in to a much shorter number of weeks than was the case with either Alpha or Delta,"" he said. He said ""fresh assistance"" for parts of the economy most affected by Coronavirus are among the things being considered by the Welsh government. Dr Frank Atherton estimated Wales's Omicron rate was just a ""few days"" behind other parts of the UK. He told BBC Wales the country's health boards had been given ""advice and instructions"" on ways to freeing up capacity in the NHS. ""You can work very closely with social care to make sure that patients who are ready and fit for discharge can get back to where they should be, which is in the community, and you can look to how you can relieve pressure on emergency care by using other ways of providing frontline care to patients."" He advised people to reduce their social contacts. ""We absolutely need to prioritize what we want to do at Christmas, for me it's about seeing family. It's not about going to the pub, it's not about going to a nightclub, it's not about going anywhere that's crowded or indoors."" Could Wales become the first UK nation to reimpose coronavirus restrictions on social contact since they were scrapped in the summer? The mood music from the first minister on Thursday was gloomy, with worries stretching not just from the impact on the Welsh NHS, but to the provision of services themselves given high levels of sickness absence expected. There is no Treasury support in the form of furlough, restricting the support for businesses available if the Welsh government decides some may need to be closed, or restricted. The question is - do ministers feel the situation is so bad they feel they have to act? Plans for possible remote learning in schools have also been announced. A letter from Education Minister Jeremy Miles calls on headteachers to plan for some classes, year groups or the whole school to move online. Schools will have two days at the start of term to plan for pupils' return, meaning some schools will return to class later than planned after the Christmas break. On Thursday the Ministry of Defence announced 98 armed forces personnel have been made available to support the booster programme, working in 14 teams of vaccinators. The UK has been experiencing record high daily Covid cases as the Omicron variant of coronavirus spreads rapidly, with Wales expected to deal with huge numbers of infections in the coming days and weeks. People in Scotland have been asked to limit socialising to three households at a time in the run-up to Christmas, with shops and hospitality venues being told to bring back physical distancing and screens. Welsh ministers will be hoping their plans will be sufficient to cover the festive season and into the New Year, but will keep the option of making further changes during that period should they feel they are needed. Wales' overall Covid rates have fluctuated slightly since November. The latest seven-day rate stands at 500.7 per 100,000 people. Public Health Wales (PHW) reported 2,889 cases on Thursday, and no deaths. The total number of deaths it has reported stands at 6,501. There were warnings that some Welsh firms are already seeing a significant impact on trade. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said Labour ministers ""must use the £500m of unallocated Covid support sitting in government coffers to help firms and protect jobs.  ""It's clear ministers of all colours across the UK are facing a challenging public health picture in an uncertain period. ""However, any consideration and implementation of restrictions must be evidence-based and have an impact on tackling the virus, unlike vaccine passports."" Dr Roland Salmon, a former PHW director, said there was not much evidence that restrictions work. ""Will they do any more than bring a lot of economic harm and long-term health harm to the people who are on the receiving end of those measures?"" he said. ""I'm afraid our best defence is immunisation,"" Dr Salmon told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. Welsh ministers are ramping up Wales' Covid booster campaign, aiming to offer all adults a third jab by the end of this month. But an assistant director at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board warned emergency services may ""possibly not be able to cope"" if Covid cases surge. Wyn Thomas, assistant area director for primary care at the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, was asked by BBC Wales how much leeway there was in capacity, if predictions of a ""tidal wave"" of omicron hospitalisations proved true. He said: ""I don't think there's a lot of leeway.  ""It's not just the hospitals, primary care is very busy, social care is very busy, so I think actually the more people protect themselves and avoid the need to go to A&E or to be admitted to hospital, is going to take pressure off the system, because as we're seeing, this rapid increase means that some people [will] undoubtedly be hospitalised and I think the system is very full at present."" The health board is concentrating its booster jab efforts online and a booking website went live for the first time on Wednesday afternoon attracted 225,000 hits in the first 24 hours."
Spread to US Treasury,Lockdown bid to 'save lives not Christmas',2024-09-25,2020-10-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-54647460,"Wales' 17-day lockdown will start later, with the first minister saying the priority is about ""saving lives not saving Christmas"". From 18:00 BST people are being told to stay at home, with all but essential businesses closed. Economists have warned the lockdown may cost the economy more than £500m and the Conservatives have accused ministers of having ""no exit plan"". But the Welsh Government said any delay would have caused greater harm. Pubs, bars, restaurants and hotels, as well as all non-essential shops will have to close, with people being told only to travel for essential reasons, such as for medical treatment, to buy food and to exercise. The nationwide ""firebreak"", which comes after local lockdowns in communities, aims to slow the rise in Covid cases and hospital admissions. First Minister Mark Drakeford has reassured the public the ""short, sharp"" lockdown will end as planned on 9 November, with consistent Wales-wide measures coming afterwards. But the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru have accused the Welsh Government of not having an ""exit strategy"" to end the spread of the virus and restart the economy. At Friday's Welsh Government briefing, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the pandemic would not be over in the coming months but added there were ""things that we can do... to make sure that Christmas of a coronavirus sort can still be celebrated here in Wales"". He added: ""How that will mesh in with the difficulties that are being faced elsewhere in the United Kingdom is just impossible to predict."" The national lockdown brings an end to the local lockdowns imposed on 15 counties, as well as the city of Bangor and town of Llanelli in recent weeks. People can be fined £60 for a first coronavirus restrictions offence, up to a maximum fixed penalty notice of £1,920. Primary schools will reopen after next week's half-term break, but only Years 7 and 8 in secondary schools can return at that time under the new rules. It comes as stricter coronavirus rules are coming into force for nearly six million Britons on Friday, including Warrington moving into the highest level of England's Covid-19 restrictions alongside Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region and Lancashire after a surge of Covid-19 cases. Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there would be ""greater"" economic harm if the Welsh NHS becomes overwhelmed and there were ""deeper and harder"" measures for a longer period of time. ""If we do this now and if we then have a consistent set of national rules, to keep the transmission and the intensity of the virus at a lower level, then we can have a much more normal Christmas season for businesses,"" he said. ""The month of December is really important for many businesses, if we delayed, we would have almost certainly impacted upon that part of the season."" Dr Margaret Harris, World Health Organization spokeswoman, said people should start planning how to safely celebrate Christmas. ""It will be a new Christmas, but we can enjoy our time together,"" she said. ""We just have to do it slightly apart."" But the Welsh Conservatives have accused the Welsh Government of having no plan for what will happen after the Wales-wide lockdown ends. The party's leader in the Senedd Paul Davies said the Welsh Government should be looking at ""hyper-local"" lockdowns rather than imposing a ""damaging"" national lockdown. ""The first minister is taking us into a Wales-wide lockdown without publishing the full data to justify it, the details of what they are going to achieve during the lockdown and now we don't know what the situation is going to be at the end of it,"" he said. ""People are concerned that this second Wales-wide lockdown is just the start of rolling lockdowns over the coming."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government needed to publish plans on how systems to halt the spread of the virus - including track and trace - would be improved during the next two weeks. ""No-one wants to live in a perpetual state of coming in and out of lockdowns. For the sake of public health and our economy, this break has to be the start of a different approach,"" he said. Northern Ireland's reproduction (R) number is the highest of any the four UK nations, while Wales has the lowest, between 1.1 and 1.4. The UK's average is between 1.3 and 1.5. Even though Wales has some of the lowest coronavirus infection rates in the UK, First Minister Mark Drakeford said that without this lockdown the Welsh NHS would not be able to cope. The number of patients in hospital in Wales with coronavirus is now the highest since June, according to NHS Wales figures out on Friday. There were 894 people in Welsh hospitals with the virus, up 26% week-on-week, while 43 of them are in critical care, a rise of 72%. This is about two-thirds of the number at the peak. Food shops, off-licences and pharmacies can stay open but supermarkets will be unable to sell items like clothes during Wales' temporary lockdown and only essential items. Business leaders say companies in Wales have been given just hours to finalise plans for the firebreak. Among those affected was the former winner of the BBC's The Apprentice, Alana Spencer, who was due to open a new cafe on the Aberystwyth sea front on Friday. In a tearful social media post, she said she was ""gutted"" by the timing and later added it was a ""devastating blow"" to her new business. ""I took to social media and I had a small melt-down,"" she said. However she told BBC Radio Wales she will now use the takeaway service during lockdown to trial new products. ""Luckily we have a hatch on the front so we can do takeaway, so we'll take it from there and open properly at the end of the lockdown,"" she said. ""It's a bitter pill to swallow, when we are in Ceredigion, we have lower numbers and we are being very sensible here, but ultimately people's lives are at risk."" People can be issued a fixed penalty notice ""for most types of breaches"" and fined £60 for the first offence. That fine is increased to £120 for a second offence and continues to double for repeated offences, up to a maximum of £1,920. If prosecuted, however, a court can impose an unlimited fine. Residents of Caerphilly county were the first to go into a local lockdown on 8 September. Key worker Lois Griffiths's son and daughter will continue to go to a childminder as she has to carry on working.  ""I've got to carry on with my life,"" she said. ""We can't just stick in the house and do nothing - we've got to earn money."" Her 10-year-old daughter Amy is disappointed because lockdown means she can't go to her dance class. ""I feel really sad because I've got 'Team' coming up and I don't want to stop doing that,"" she said. Unique Creations has been ""chock-a-block"" as people want a pre-lockdown trim before the hair salon on Blackwood High Street closes on Friday evening. ""We're flat out,"" said stylist Ellen Watkins.  ""I'm hoping it will be the same when we come back. There's a lot of worry. I'm looking to buy a house.  ""Financially where am I going to be if the salon can't open back up? It's a really scary time for me."" The timing has been called ""an absolute dog's dinner"" for Welsh businesses as it straddles two UK government financial support schemes - and firms will have to apply for both separately. Furlough ends on 31 October but the new Job Support Scheme (JSS) starts on 1 November - and to be eligible for the remaining week of furlough, workers must have already been furloughed for at least three consecutive weeks. On Friday, Finance Minister Rebecca Evans announced an extra £5m to help small firms retain workers not eligible for the remaining week of furlough, while another £5m will be added to the Discretionary Assistance Fund for people waiting for benefits or facing hardship while still working. Mr Drakeford had said he feared employees could face redundancy if the Treasury does not change its support for workers. The Welsh Government had asked for the JSS to be brought forward, or furlough restrictions eased, for the length of the lockdown, and offered to pay the cost for the difference between furlough and the JSS, estimated at £11m. However the UK government said ministers in Cardiff knew ""full well"" it was not possible for the Treasury, adding the timing of Wales' lockdown was ""very, very unfair"" on people ""caught by the time gap"". The Treasury said the UK government had provided billions in support to Wales. The National Institute Of Economic and Social Research says that up-front cost ""must be set against potential economic benefits"" after lockdown if it is successful in reducing the spread of the virus and restoring economic confidence. More than 100,000 people in Wales work in the accommodation and food industries while nearly 200,000 work in the wholesale and retail trades and car repairs.  Estate agents have to close and house viewings and valuations have to stop, a blow for the Haus agency which is to open its new Cardiff branch on Friday - only to close for two weeks in the evening. ""It's been such a challenging time,"" said director Chris Birch. ""Everything involved in running a business, let alone moving in a global pandemic, has taken so much longer and the admin and red tape is another level."" Public health officials and politicians have warned they will not know the full impact of the firebreak lockdown until after it ends on 9 November. Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, said there was ""always a lag phase of about two to three weeks"" before any visible change of that intervention can be measured and detected"". But the first minister has said the lockdown end date is fixed as to avoid further harm to the economy. Wales, though, has been warned of the possibility of another lockdown early in the new year if Covid-19 starts spreading quickly again at Christmas.

Spread to US Treasury,"Job cuts warning as 600,000 roles go in lockdown",2024-09-25,2020-06-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53060529,"The number of workers on UK payrolls dived more than 600,000 by May compared to before lockdown, official figures suggest. The number of people claiming work-related benefits, which includes the unemployed, was up 126% to 2.8 million. The early estimates reflect the impact of around six weeks of lockdown in which large parts of the UK were shut. But economists say the full effect on employment will not be felt until wage support schemes end in October.  ""The slowdown in the economy is now visibly hitting the labour market, especially in terms of hours worked,"" said Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics (ONS)."" Frances O'Grady, secretary general of the Trades Union Congress, said the labour market was ""on red alert"".  ""We need strong action now to stop lasting economic damage,"" she added. Separate figures published by HMRC on Tuesday showed that a total of 9.1 million workers are having their wages paid through the government's furlough scheme - more than a quarter of the workforce. Overall, the official UK unemployment rate for the three months to April held steady at 3.9% as the massive state wage support in place stopped job losses.  Reflecting that, the ONS said the total number of weekly hours worked in the period dropped to 959.9 million - down by a record 94.2 million, or 9%, on the previous year. However, the agency said that early estimates from the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system showed that the number of payroll employees fell by 612,000, or 2.1%  in May compared to March, when lockdown was implemented.  And it said there had been a record fall in job vacancies in that period to 476,000 - down 342,000 from the previous quarter - hinting at worse to come.  Capital Economics economist Ruth Gregory said it was ""abundantly clear"" that the labour market had weakened dramatically. ""Some of this will surely start to filter through into the actual unemployment figures as the government's job furlough scheme is wound down from August."" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, agreed: ""The furlough scheme continues to hold off the bulk of job losses, but unemployment is likely to surge in the months ahead.""  Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, warned that many businesses were expected to bring only part of their furloughed workforce back, while they sought to tentatively reopen after the lockdown. ""Hiring new workers is also likely to be put on hold for some time,"" she said.  Kayleigh Rennix has never struggled to find work before. The HR manager from Essex was earning close to £40,000 working in the education sector before she resigned in March, fearing her role was at risk.  Since then she's applied for dozens of jobs, but has had little interest from employers. ""As my leaving date approached, coronavirus reared its ugly head. I would say I've applied for more than 100 jobs and not had many call-backs,"" she says. Now the 34-year-old has found herself relying on benefit payments for the first time in her life, and expects to move back in with her parents when her tenancy expires later in the summer. Some economists believe unemployment could hit 10% - a rate not since since the mid-1990s - as social distancing rules remain in place and consumers curb their spending. The Institute of Employment Studies (IES), an apolitical think tank, pointed out that the number of claims for work benefits had risen 1.6 million since March - a rate faster, it says, than during the Great Depression of 1929.  At the same time, it says there are eight unemployed people are chasing every job vacancy in the UK - up from just two before the crisis. ""It's clear too that this crisis is hitting many poorer areas hardest - with coastal towns and ex-industrial areas seeing particularly big increases in unemployment,"" said director Tony Wilson.  The IES said among the worst hit areas of the UK were: The headline quarterly employment and unemployment numbers remain barely changed, as all the furloughed workers count as having jobs. The furlough scheme is working in suppressing unemployment and protecting livelihoods so far, the real test of its functioning is what happens now.  The test of it will be whether those jobs remain as the taxpayer wage support is eased away. It requires the government to inject as much confidence as possible, into the minds of employers facing uncertainty and declining bank balances.  But further rescue package and employment support will be required too. The balancing act with the pandemic remains as delicate as ever. As one Cabinet minister puts it - ""we need to restart the economy, without restarting the virus"". A swathe of businesses have announced job cuts as the economy has contracted sharply due to the pandemic, opting not to furlough those workers instead. Examples include: Bosses in sectors such as car making, aviation and hospitality have warned there could be many further cuts without additional government support.  In normal times, the employment rate tells you most of what you need to know about jobs.  But these are not normal times.  With the furloughing scheme keeping people employed, if not working, we have to look elsewhere to get a picture of what's happening.  It's like building a jigsaw, but with pieces from different boxes: surveys, payroll data, jobs advertised, three-month trends and even looking at week-on-week changes.  The picture it builds is different to the headline employment figure but perhaps not surprising: Serious pressure on jobs during lockdown.  Last week, the ONS revealed the UK economy shrank by a 20.4% in April - the largest monthly contraction on record - as the country spent its first full month in lockdown. That is three times greater than the decline seen during the whole of the 2008 to 2009 economic downturn. Britain's economy is likely to slump by 11.5% in 2020, slightly outstripping falls in countries such as Germany, France, Spain and Italy, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned.  Meanwhile, the latest furlough figures from HMRC indicate that more than a quarter of the UK workforce is having 80% of their monthly wages, up to £2,500, paid by the government, while they are temporarily off work. Their employer, which chooses whether or not to furlough workers, can top up the remaining 20% if it wishes. The Treasury also said there had been 2.6 million claims for support grants from the self-employed. The Prime Minister's spokesman said: ""We are seeing the impact of coronavirus on our economy, as is the case in many countries. ""It is starting to show in today's [jobs] figures but our extensive support through the furlough scheme, grants, loans and tax cuts has protected thousands of businesses and millions of jobs."""
Spread to US Treasury,Connecting Cornwall to the G7 countries,2024-09-25,2021-06-09,By Johnny O'Shea,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cornwall-57007894,"This week Cornwall hosts the leaders of the world's largest so-called advanced economies at the G7 summit. Cornwall has a rich heritage and, with millions of Cornish descendants spread around the world, there are enduring international connections. It is a place that has had an important role in some key innovations, from the invention of steam power to the development of communications. Here are some examples of how Cornwall is linked to the visiting countries. In the 18th and 19th Centuries, Cornwall was the global centre of tin and copper mining. Up to 500,000 Cornish miners took their expertise and shared their skills abroad, in countries including Australia, USA, Canada, Peru, Mexico and South Africa. These also included those looking to make a living after the price of copper crashed in 1866. ""There are an estimated six million living around [the world] today who are descended from those migrant Cornish workers,"" according to Cornish Mining World Heritage. In Canada, communities were formed in Newfoundland, Ontario and the Prairie Provinces, and Cornish is included as an ethnicity option on the Canadian census. The last mine to stop working in Cornwall was South Crofty in 1998, but in 2017 Strongbox Exploration, a mining company with Canadian connections bought it with a plan to mine for tin once more. The company has changed its name to Cornish Metals and is now listed on the London and Toronto stock exchanges. Richard Williams, chief executive, who lives in Vancouver, said: ""What we have seen over the last year in particular is much greater demand for electronics, and tin is a fundamental component in anything electronic.  ""Cornwall has a wealth of tin so we think it has got a tremendous future."" As well as having a stake in what lies underground, there is also Canadian interest in a Cornish project focussed on the sky. Melissa Thorpe, from British Columbia, Canada, is head of Spaceport Cornwall, aiming to be the first UK venture to launch into space. She said hosting the G7 in Cornwall was a ""huge opportunity"" for the spaceport: ""We will use this platform to challenge outdated perceptions of Cornwall and showcase our innovative project with Virgin Orbit. ""We want to challenge other countries to look at their launch activities and consider ways that we can access space more responsibly and sustainably.""  One further Canadian connection is the Davidstow Creamery, near Camelford, the largest cheese factory in the UK, which is owned by Canadian company Saputo. The G7 summit website refers to Cornwall's ""distinct cultural identity, including its own language and traditions, and is recognised as one of the six 'Celtic nations'"". These nations are Wales, Scotland, Ireland, the Isle of Man, along with Brittany in north-west France. Cornwall is geographically closer to Brittany than London, the languages are similar, as is the coastline and the strong vein of independence. Also binding the two areas is one of the most significant raids of World War Two. In March 1942, Operation Chariot was launched from Falmouth, with the obsolete destroyer HMS Campbeltown packed with explosives heading for the strategically important German fortress at St Nazaire on the west coast of France. HMS Campbeltown was remodelled to look like a German ship, allowing it to safely sail six miles (9.6km) up the Loire estuary, past 80 German emplacements, and was rammed into the dock gates. The explosives detonated and 600 commandos disembarked from it, and 18 smaller accompanying vessels. Many of the commandos were captured and 169 died in what has become known as ""the greatest raid"" that took the port out of service for the remainder of the conflict. Falmouth will host the media for this summit, but it could also welcome a French visit to the memorial on the Prince of Wales pier, a short stroll from the International Media Centre. In 2019, there were about 350,000 foreign visitors to Cornwall, and Germany accounted for 96,000 of them, according to Visit Cornwall. Cornwall's ""stunning landscape"" is referred to in the G7 literature, and it has inspired a number of well-known writers - Winston Graham, Daphne du Maurier and Virginia Woolf among them. More recently, Rosamunde Pilcher, from Lelant, may have been popular as a novelist in the UK, but in Germany she is a household name. Film crews are regularly seen recreating her stories for Sunday night TV slots on German network channel ZDF, watched by about eight million viewers. There have been more than 100 episodes broadcast and one of Ms Pilcher's most celebrated stories, Shell Seekers, is largely set in a hotel in Carbis Bay. Another industry that Cornwall has played a significant role in is communications, with GCHQ at Bude, and Goonhilly Earth Station on the Lizard continuing to do so. In a 2017 BBC documentary, Invented in Cornwall, Professor Lucie Fisher said ""Cornwall has been at the forefront of the communications revolution for 150 years."" In the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, west Cornwall was at the centre of a communications revolution. In Porthcurno, a cable was brought ashore that would allow the first messages to be sent to and from India in 1870. Thirty years later, Italian engineer Guglielmo Marconi sent the first ever trans-Atlantic radio transmission from Poldhu, Cornwall. Historian David Barlow said: ""This was most definitely a pivotal moment in the history of communications. It is as famous now as it was 100 years ago. It was a momentous thing to do, it really was."" Such was its significance that, not long afterwards, Poldhu also received the first wireless message ever sent from the US, by President Theodore Roosevelt to King Edwards VII on 18 January 1903. Cornwall is a place that attracts artists with St Ives as a focal point. Famed for its light and turquoise waters, 20th Century artists including Alfred Wallis and Ben Nicholson based themselves there, and it is home to a Tate gallery. Sculptor Barbara Hepworth is perhaps the best known former artistic resident, along with potter Bernard Leach, and both have museums in the town. Leach founded his St Ives pottery with Shoji Hamada, who he had travelled back from Japan with after meeting in 1920. A century on, the relationship endures and their work continues to influence ceramics and studio potters around the world. Mr Hamada returned to Japan and helped establish the town of Mashiko into a world-famous pottery centre and he was made a Living National Treasure by the Japanese government. Dr Matthew Tyas, curator and deputy director at the Leach Pottery, called it ""an enduring friendship"", adding ""St Ives' cultural relationship with Japan is expansive and growing.  ""Likewise, the local communities of St Ives and Mashiko have grown closer over the years, with the relationship being formalised in a declaration of friendship and cultural collaboration in 2012."" There is also a rail connection between one of Cornwall's most famous sons, Richard Trevithick and Japan. He pioneered the world's first high-powered steam powered engine and his grandson, also Richard Trevithick, is revered in Japan having built the first locomotive in the country. The G7 literature states that about two million Americans trace their ancestry to Cornwall with communities that continue to have strong connections. Grass Valley in California, Mineral Point in Wisconsin, Copper Country in Michigan, Butte in Montana and others all have shops selling pasties and celebrate St Piran's Day - the patron saint of tin miners, and one of three patron saints of Cornwall - on 5 March each year. Close to Carbis Bay, at the side of the river in Hayle, lies a discreet plaque commemorating a Cornish hero. Rick Rescorla was in charge of security for the bank Morgan Stanley during the World Trade Centre attacks in New York on 11 September 2001. Having anticipated an attack of this sort, he regularly drilled the staff in evacuation procedures. On the day of the attack, he led more than 2,500 staff safely out of the south tower, singing Cornish songs as he did so, before returning inside to collect anyone left behind. The building collapsed and he was among the 2,605 killed. The US Department of Homeland Security formed a Rick Rescorla award for resilience to recognise superior leadership, and it would be a fitting tribute for the visiting president to pay his respects."
Spread to US Treasury,No commitment from Kwarteng on business gas help,2024-09-25,2021-10-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58859941,"Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has not committed to any additional government help for businesses struggling amid record gas prices. Some industries have warned firms could be forced to shut down operations. Mr Kwarteng said he was working closely with the chancellor over possible support for energy intensive sectors - but a Treasury source denied this. The business secretary said domestic customers would not see a change to the energy price cap this winter. Asked on BBC One's Andrew Marr programme whether there would be additional government help for energy-intensive companies, Mr Kwarteng described the situation as ""critical"" and said he was ""looking to find a solution"". When Andrew Marr suggested this sounded like a ""yes"" the business secretary said: ""No, it doesn't sound like yes at all.  ""We already have existing support and we're looking to see whether that's sufficient to get us through this situation."" Speaking to Times Radio Mr Kwarteng, who met leaders from heavy industry on Friday, said he was not going to commit to ""any firm figure or subsidy"" for companies. Asked about whether the government would ensure factories would not have to close if they could not pay for gas he said it was a commercial decision and ""up to them"". He added: ""We are not in the business of bail-outs. What we are in the business of is ensuring security of supply and that is what I am focused on."" Wholesale gas prices have risen 250% since January. CEO of British Glass Dave Dalton, who was at Friday's meeting with Mr Kwarteng, said some of the confederation's ""significant"" members were ""teetering on the edge"".  ""I think some companies are staring down the ability to survive, absolutely - ultimately that obviously cascades on to jobs and impacts on the consumer,"" he told the BBC.  Gareth Stace, director general of UK Steel, said he was frustrated by the lack of action to support businesses. He told the BBC that without help in the next week or so, there would be ""significant and permanent damage to the UK steel sector"". Unite leader Sharon Graham said the country was ""contemplating factory shutdowns across viable manufacturing and businesses"" and that workers were ""worried sick"". Businesses have been shouting louder and louder for support through this period of soaring energy prices. This morning, the business secretary told the BBC he was listening to their concerns - but would not commit to any extra support. Those industries that use a lot of energy for manufacturing say that the time for working out a way forward has long gone.  The director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, expressed his frustration, saying pauses in steel production will only increase.  The government says the current situation emphasises the need for a revolution in how we generate energy, moving towards home-grown renewables. But that's little comfort for those businesses dependent on energy from fossil fuels now, competing with intense demand in a global market. On the Andrew Marr show, Mr Kwarteng denied asking for ""billions"" from the Treasury to subsidise energy-intensive businesses and said supply itself was ""not an issue"". A Treasury source said the business secretary had been ""mistaken"" to say that he had been working on possible support measures with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Bridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government ""needs to get a grip"" and called for ""urgent answers on who exactly is running the show"".  ""The two key government departments responsible for the current cost of living crisis have spent this morning infighting about whether they were in talks with each other. What a farce,"" she said. She also accused the government of having ""put its out of office on"", referring to reports that the prime minister is on holiday in Spain.  A number of Conservative MPs have called for the government to take action to support heavy industry. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on the UK government to ""nurse"" businesses through the crisis, describing it as a ""perfect storm"". The domestic consumer energy price cap, which is reviewed every six months, sets the maximum level a supplier can charge a consumer on a standard tariff in England, Wales and Scotland.  Mr Kwarteng told Marr that protecting consumers was his ""first and foremost objective"" and as such the price cap would stay at its current level until its next update which is due to in April. Some suppliers say the cap is just delaying an inevitable increase in consumer prices and should be reviewed more regularly. Energy regulator Ofgem has warned households will see further ""significant rises"" in the spring, when the cap is reviewed. Asked by Marr if he was sure the lights would stay on this winter, Mr Kwarteng said ""yes, I am"". Due to high gas prices household energy suppliers have been forced to sell gas for less than they can buy it due to the price cap, leading some to fail. Last month, nine domestic energy supply companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers and on to higher rates. Paul Richards, chief executive of Together Energy, which he said is currently making losses, said while he supported a price cap to protect customers, the current mechanism ""is not fit for industry, nor is it fit for customers"". He said it protected customers in the short term but somewhere between £1bn and £3bn in costs would be spread back across business and households as a result of suppliers going bust. The founder of OVO Energy Stephen Fitzpatrick told Marr that it has been ""too easy"" for companies to enter the energy market and that there will be more companies in difficulty. He said the market was a complicated one, and he thought some people had not understood the risks."
Spread to US Treasury,"Johnson wanted to be injected with Covid, inquiry told",2024-09-25,2023-11-07,Kate Whannel,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67347456,"Boris Johnson ""wanted to be injected with Covid-19 on television"" to calm public fears, an ex-aide has said. The claim - by Lord Lister - came in a witness statement to the Covid inquiry. He said Mr Johnson ""suggested to senior civil servants and advisers that he wanted to be injected with Covid-19 on television to demonstrate to the public that it did not pose a threat"". It was ""at a time when Covid was not seen as being the serious disease it subsequently became"", he added. He said it was an ""unfortunate comment"" that had been ""made in the heat of the moment"". He also confirmed his former boss had said letting ""the bodies pile high"" was preferable to another lockdown. The remark was made in September 2020 but first reported in April 2021,  At the time, Mr Johnson dismissed the report, calling it ""total rubbish"". Lord Edward Udny-Lister said the comment was made at a time when the government was ""trying to avoid a further lockdown given the already severe impact on the economy and education"".  On Tuesday, the Covid inquiry was also shown messages in which the head of the civil service Simon Case said of his Downing Street colleagues: ""These people are so mad... they are just so madly self-defeating. I've never seen a bunch of people less well-equipped to run the country."" And entries from the 2020 diaries of Sir Patrick Vallance revealed that the then-chief scientific advisor felt Mr Johnson was ""all over the place"" on the issue of implementing a second lockdown. Lord Lister is a long-time ally of Mr Johnson, having worked with him during his time as mayor of London and prime minister. In his evidence session to the Covid inquiry, which lasted over two hours, Lord Lister was asked about the atmosphere in the Downing Street operation. Last week, Helen MacNamara, a senior civil servant during the Covid pandemic, said there had been a ""macho"" culture and that a ""toxic"" environment had affected decision-making.  Lord Lister said: ""I think there was a lot of tension that was taking place"" adding that Dominic Cummings, another senior adviser in Downing Street, was ""not an easy man to deal with"". Later in the session, Lord Lister was asked about the UK government's relationship with the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales during the pandemic. He said there had been ""a great deal of mistrust and frustration"" towards the Scottish government. ""It seemed to us in Downing Street, it didn't matter what the decision was, Scotland would want to do things slightly differently."" Asked if he felt the Scottish government was being ""opportunistic"", Lord Lister said ""I think that is a good word"".  He later added that Mr Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon, who was Scotland's first minister during the pandemic, ""generally didn't like each other very much"".  Questioned on the second lockdown, introduced in November 2020, Lord Lister suggested it could have been avoided if the tier system had been given more time to work. Under the tier system, areas where subject to different restrictions depending on the prevalence of the disease. It was essentially made redundant around a month after being introduced, when Mr Johnson implemented a second national lockdown.  Lord Lister said the tier system was ""messy but the right thing to do"" adding: ""If we kept going I believe it would have worked."" Earlier in the day, the Covid inquiry had seen further extracts from a diary written in October 2020 by the government's then chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance.  The note says Mr Johnson and Rishi Sunak, who was chancellor at the time, were both ""clutching at straws"" while trying to argue against a second lockdown in October 2020. Sir Patrick describes a meeting on 8 October as, ""very bad"". After being shown the final slide in a presentation by the Covid-19 Taskforce, Sir Patrick wrote that Mr Johnson responded, ""Whisky and revolver."" ""He was all over the place"", Sir Patrick says, adding that Mr Sunak was using ""increasingly specific and spurious arguments against closing hospitality"". In another diary entry from 25 October, Sir Patrick says Mr Johnson ""owns the reality for a day and then is buffeted by a discussion with [the chancellor]."" Simon Ridley, former Head of the Cabinet Office Covid taskforce also gave evidence to the inquiry on Tuesday.  He admitted the taskforce was not asked about the Eat Out To Help Out scheme introduced by Mr Sunak in summer 2020. The scheme gave diners up to 50% of their bill off and was aimed at bolstering the hospitality industry, however some scientists have argued it helped the virus spread.  Asked whether his team had been ""completely blindsided by the Treasury"", Mr. Ridley responded, ""correct.""

Spread to US Treasury,UK prices rise at fastest rate in 10 years,2024-09-25,2021-12-15,Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59663947,"The cost of living surged by 5.1% in the 12 months to November, up from 4.2% the month before, and its highest level since September 2011.  Higher transport and energy costs drove the rise, which was above forecasts of a 4.7% increase, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Its chief economist Grant Fitzner said more expensive fuel, energy, clothing and second hand cars were big factors. The cost of raw materials also rose significantly, he added. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a £1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car cleaned. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money - sometimes referred to as the cost of living. Since the UK economy reopened after lockdown, companies have struggled to keep up with a surge in consumer demand.  Global supply chain problems, staff shortages and rapid demand for oil and gas have all driven up prices. The end of Covid support schemes and Brexit have also played a part.  In November, petrol prices jumped to the highest ever recorded - 145.8p a litre - while the cost of used cars jumped due to shortages of new vehicles.  A global shortage of computer chips for in new cars has led to a shortage of vehicles, leading to increased demand in the second hand car market. Even before Wednesday's figures, the food and drink industry had warned that the soaring cost of raw materials and ingredients was having a ""terrifying"" impact on consumer prices. Consumers are feeling the impact of price rises. Chrissy Jones, from Frome, says prices for everything from insurance to food and petrol have gone up. ""We can't plan for the future,"" she says. Energy bills in particular are higher. The former People's Energy customer was spending about £1,000 for both electricity and gas each year.  But when the firm went bust, she was switched onto the cheapest available tariff with British Gas, which is about double that. ""Do I fix at that price, or do I hope that the situation gets better? It's a bit of a gamble,"" she says. Ms Jones is on a pension and says a lack of security around knowing what she might be spending on bills in the New Year means that she and her family are putting off plans. A holiday in the next year was unlikely and her hopes to adopt a rescue dog were being put on hold. ""It wouldn't be fair on the dog and it wouldn't be fair on our purse,"" she says. ""It's just incredibly worrying - you wonder where it's going to end. How much more [are prices] going to go up?"" That's a concern. A quadrupling of natural gas prices in the last year has still to show its full impact on domestic energy prices. Many raw material costs are still rising, which will feed into higher prices if companies cannot absorb them. Rising inflation is not just an issue for the UK, and the government's hands are tied when it comes to dealing with what is a global problem. The latest figures for the US show prices rose 6.8% in the year to November, the highest level for almost 40 years. Wage inflation is also a factor. The latest inflation figure is substantially above the most recent figures on average pay rises of 4.3%, meaning living standards are effectively falling.  On Wednesday, Britain's most powerful trade union, Unite, said it would act to ensure this effective pay cut was reversed. ""Current estimates suggest that costs for the typical UK family will jump by £1,700 in 2022,"" said Unite general secretary Sharon Graham. ""Workers did not create this cost-of-living crisis so why should they pay for it?""  On Wednesday, the ONS said the retail price inflation (RPI) measure - which includes housing costs, such as council tax, and is still linked to final salary pension payments, train tickets, mobile phone tariffs, and interest on student loans - rose to 7.1%. That's up from 6%, and its highest since March 1991. RPI rather than CPI is also used by unions for pay bargaining, and Ms Graham said members should fight for rises that matched this measure.  ""Employers favour the CPI in cost calculations because it saves them money, but the truth is that this is a hidden tax on workers' wages,"" she said. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said on Wednesday he understood the impact being felt by consumers.  He said: ""We know how challenging rising inflation can be for families and households which is why we're spending £4.2bn to support living standards and provide targeted measures for the most vulnerable over the winter months. But Labour claimed the government is not doing nearly enough to tackle the problem, especially as further inflationary pressures from rising energy costs are coming down the line.  Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden said: ""These figures are a stark illustration of the cost-of-living crisis facing families this Christmas. ""Instead of taking action, the government are looking the other way, blaming 'global problems' while they trap us in a high-tax, low-growth cycle."" The unexpectedly sharp jump in inflation, now more than twice the Bank of England's 2% target rate, will certainly intensify debate over a rise. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund predicted inflation would reach around 5.5% early next year - its highest in 30 years - and warned the Bank not to succumb to ""inaction bias"". The Bank has resisted a rate rise amid uncertainty about the impact of the Omicron variant on economic growth and people's finances. Economist Samuel Tombs, at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation is now ""uncomfortably high"" for the Bank, but believes rate-setters will still hold fire when they meet this week."" Yael Selfin, economist at consultancy KPMG, also thought the Bank would ""adopt a wait-and-see approach at this week's meeting"". Prices are rising at the fastest rate for a decade, 13 years if you use the ONS' favourite measure that includes owner-occupier housing costs. Inflation has risen above 5% more quickly than expected by the Bank of England and others, on a path to more than 5.5% by the spring, and it is likely to stay above the Bank's 2% target for the next two years. All of this reflects the lived experience of us all in petrol forecourts, supermarkets and department stores. The impact on living standards is material with real incomes now likely to be falling again. It does not make an interest rate rise on Thursday a done deal, given the economic uncertainty surrounding the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. The key economic uncertainty for the Bank and the Treasury is now what happens in companies and unions with how wages are set. When combined with ongoing labour shortages, there is a lot of pressure for companies to give considerable wage rises in the new year. While Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he welcomes such a move, fear of a spiral of rising wages and prices is precisely what would lead to the Bank of England having to raise rates more quickly than currently expected over the next year. Given there is little expected respite from energy prices and rising taxes, an interest rate rise on the cards in the next few months, and ongoing Omicron restrictions, the outlook for early 2022 remains challenging for consumers and businesses."
