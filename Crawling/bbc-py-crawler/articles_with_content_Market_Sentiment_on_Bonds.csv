Market Sentiment on Bonds,A J-pop sensation's guide to Tokyo's music scene,2024-09-14,2024-05-05,Mayra Peralta,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240503-a-j-pop-bands-favourite-live-music-experiences-in-tokyo,"YOASOBI breaks musical barriers both in their native Japan and overseas. Here's how they enjoy Tokyo's hottest live music, from buskers in Shibuya to concerts at Nippon Budokan. Vibrant subcultures and the second largest music market in the world make Tokyo a bucket list-worthy ""music destination""; delighting locals and visitors alike with its sheer diversity. We spoke with chart-topping J-pop sensation YOASOBI, aka Vocaloid music producer Ayase and singer Ikura, to get a feel for the city’s musical landscape. The SpeciaList Comprised of composer Ayase and vocalist Ikura, YOASOBI is a record-breaking J-pop duo taking over global music charts with singles such as Idol and The Brave. Originally drawing musical inspiration from fiction published on Monogatary.com, the pair are renowned for transforming written works into sonically innovative chart-toppers. Their hit Idol surged as the first song performed in Japanese to top Billboard’s Global Excl. US chart. ""Given that Tokyo is the capital and the biggest city in Japan, a lot of the creative talent and artists gather [here] to explore cutting-edge sounds and music,"" says Ayase, whose wildly popular collaborations with Ikura were originally based on short stories from Monogatary.com; Sony Music Entertainment Japan's social network for creative artists. ""A lot of the trends and sounds are set in Tokyo; that’s why the music scene is so high level."" Long before YOASOBI became internationally famous, Tokyo eclectic musical culture and venues allowed them to perfect their unique, literary-inspired sound. ""In Japan and Tokyo, there's a lot of individuality, so whether you go to the clubs or live houses or maybe [to] a specific venue to see an artist you like, there's not just one space where all that culture is packed into,"" says Ayase. Discovering Tokyo is an endless journey of exploration, with something to offer to every music enthusiast, from nostalgia-fueled city pop to experimental sounds. Here are Ayase and Ikura's favourite ways to experience Tokyo's contemporary music scene. Frenetically dynamic, Shibuya has become one of Tokyo's most popular destinations. Spanning 15 sq km and brimming with venues that cater to different music crowds, the district attracts everyone from curious passersby enjoying street performances to connoisseurs exploring the live music scene.  Shibuya is the epicentre of trends and a mandatory stop for visitors, says Ayase. He recommends first-time travellers and those who want to discover Tokyo’s music offerings start off by exploring the district on foot. ""Shibuya is where you can experience the hottest trends in terms of music,"" he says. ""It centres around the younger generation so they drive a lot of the culture, whether it’s fashion, the clubbing scene or music. The town is very lively so [...] you’re going to hear music almost 24/7… You can walk in the city and see these huge LED billboards where a lot of artists are promoting their latest work and teasing their music videos.""  Ikura encourages visitors to pay attention to buskers in the area. ""At the corner of the Shibuya Scramble Crossing, in front of Tsutaya, you can find street musicians playing,"" she says. A landmark of Shibuya's world-famous intersection, the Tsutaya book store is located right in front of the Shibuya JR [train] Station and is, as Ikura explains, ""just two steps away from the Hachiko [dog] statue"". Address: 2 Dogenzaka, Shibuya-ku, 150-0043 Tokyo Instagram: @city_shibuya_official Perhaps no other place on the planet flaunts the diversity of Tokyo’s live music landscape quite so well as ""live houses"" – venues of varied sizes and aesthetics that host gigs every night. And there’s no shortage of options; all acts and musical genres, from jazz to heavy metal, find a place in the eclectic Tokyo scene. A superb example is Shibuya Gee ge, an unassuming and intimate venue with a motley selection of show listings. The live house, which is slated to celebrate its 14th anniversary in September 2024, is equipped with a grand piano and a high-quality audio system often commended by local artists. Before rising to global stardom, Ikura occassionally performed here and still recommends it without a second thought. ""You can find good singer-songwriters playing at this venue,"" she says.

Originally conceived as a martial arts hall for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Budokan is an octagonal arena-style venue steeped in music history. ""We have a lot of sentiment and memories there because it's a very famous venue where the top artists from Japan perform,"" says Ikura. The storied venue has witnessed legendary moments of music history over the years. In 1966, the arena welcomed The Beatles for a five-date concert, establishing a rock 'n roll tradition perpetuated by groups such as Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Cheap Trick. Tip Keeping up with music acts and events in Tokyo is not always an easy feat. Ayase’s tip: make the internet your ally. ""The entire town has a lot of music playing all the time so you can go to the clubs or any type of live house to listen to bands, pop, EDM,"" he says. ""If you look at social media, you can find all kinds of events and performances that are ongoing. So go to Shibuya, have some drinks, have some fun, look up events online and attend."" Budokan's reputation as one of Japan's most iconic concert halls grew exponentially over the years as stars sold out concerts and recorded critically acclaimed live albums. Nowadays, the venue remains a coveted and prestigious location for international and local acts. ""Performing there is usually the dream of upcoming artists and it was our dream as well,"" Ikura says. ""YOASOBI became really active in the middle of the Covid-19 [pandemic] so we couldn’t do a lot of performances in front of an audience. In December 2021, we got to perform in the Budokan for the first time with a live audience and it was such a memorable experience for us to be performing in the same venue where [emblematic] artists have performed."" Website: https://www.nipponbudokan.or.jp/english Address: 2-3 Kitanomarukōen, Chiyoda City, Tokyo 102-8321 Phone: +81 3-3216-5100   With scenic paths and attractions such as a zoo and the Ghibli Museum, Inokashira Park is a favorite busking spot for artists. Located in Western Tokyo, about 20km from Shibuya, this enchanting spot is Ikura’s recommendation for outdoor music performances. ""When I was still a student, I used to hang out a lot in the area of Kichijoji. I spent a better part of my teen years there, more specifically, in a park called Inokashira Park,"" she says. ""I used to perform on the street back when I was really young. That experience of performing in front of the public put me on the path of [becoming] an artist and my music-writing and music-making career originated there. Kichijoji and that park are very intimate place for me in terms of my musical history."" Inokashira Park, however, is not only relevant to Ikura’s personal story; the park has served as the filming location of music-centered movies such as Parks, starring Mei Nagano, and hosts outdoor concerts and music festivals every year. Address: 1-18-31, Gotenyama, Musashino-shi, Tokyo   Recognised as the home of counterculture movements in Tokyo, the Koenji neighbourhood reflects Tokyo’s edgy and unconventional spirit, and is littered with vintage shops, music bars and live houses. In fact, Koenji is known as the birthplace of the punk movement in Japan. ""There’s a lot of culture there between actors, actresses, bands, artists, creatives and even comedians,"" says Ayase of the creative hub, just two metro stops from Shibuya. The artistic offerings in Koenji are varied, ranging from vintage record stores to indie rock and punk basement bars. However, Ayase, who has long been part of the neighbourhood’s artistic community, recommends walking around the Koenji Station for the most authentic experience. ""There are a lot of musicians playing their songs in this station area,"" he says. ""I used to be in a [rock] band and we moved to Tokyo with the dream to perform and make it big one day. The first place I arrived in Tokyo was Koenji. It was a very fun experience for me, looking back. I think [about] it as a big milestone for my musical career."" Address: 4 Chome-48-2 Koenjiminami, Suginami City, Tokyo 166-0003 You can't talk about Tokyo’s contemporary music scene without mentioning its nightlife and gig culture. ""I think there’s a very strong club culture in Shibuya so whether [you’re looking for] a hip hop-type of vibe or an EDM type of vibe, you can find a lot of those clubs in this area in Shibuya called Dogenzaka,"" says Ayase. With a slew of entertainment spaces dedicated to different genres, Dogenzaka Street is a go-to for whoever wants to lose themselves to the beat. Options are endless and cater to different tastes, but Ayase mentions a specific Shibuya institution that has been open since 1996, pioneering the ""all music-genres"" scene and accommodating different music acts from DJs to rappers.   ""Club Asia, specifically is a good example,"" he says. ""But there’s also a lot of live houses that you can attend close to the Shibuya Station. There’s definitely a lot of options.""

Market Sentiment on Bonds,Jack Antonoff has redefined pop music - here's how,2024-09-14,2021-08-04,By Mark Savage,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-58085468,"Jack Antonoff's fingerprints are everywhere.  In the last year alone, he's made records with Lana Del Rey, Lorde, St Vincent, The Chicks and Taylor Swift - with whom he shared the Grammy award for album of the year. Unassuming and earnest, he's become the go-to collaborator for pop's most sophisticated female stars, co-writing and producing records like Swift's Folklore, St Vincent's Masseduction and Del Rey's spectral masterpiece Norman [Expletive] Rockwell. ""Why are they drawn to working with me? I don't know,"" he says. ""I feel like that's a question for them."" So we checked. ""He's a wonderful person. He's a joy to work with,"" is the simple response from Annie Clark, aka St Vincent. ""Jack very much takes my lead,"" Del Rey told the NME last year. ""I don't know how it is with him with other people, but he liked for me to know where I was going."" Antonoff has a reputation for generosity and empathy. His laid-back studio demeanour is free of the sexist power games that can sour the relations between male producers and female artists.  The 37-year-old consistently describes his collaborators as friends - even when it's rock icon Bruce Springsteen. ""We were just hanging out,"" Antonoff says of how Springsteen ended up singing on Take The Sadness Out Of Saturday Night, the third album by his own band, Bleachers. ""The friendship led to the collaboration."" Like Springsteen, Antonoff grew up in New Jersey in a ""normal middle-class Jewish family, where we just played baseball and hung out at the house and played guitar"". But things changed forever when his younger sister, Sarah, succumbed to brain cancer at the age of 13. ""So amidst this sleepy, normal existence came this thing that made me feel there was something really different and challenging about my family,"" he recalls.  ""I think everyone deserves a period of their life that feels a little untouchable. And if you're confronted with certain things at a young age, you don't really get that. It's a huge, huge lens through which I remember my childhood and my life."" Antonoff says he has lived with anxiety and depression ever since, and has ""written a tonne"" about the pain and grief of losing his sister. But he's cautious of ascribing all of his musical impulses to that catastrophic, unimaginable tragedy. ""I always felt misunderstood, and I can't really pinpoint why,"" he says. ""I was supported and loved but I always had this huge thing I was carrying around, like, 'You don't get me, you don't get it.'  ""I don't know where that comes from. It could come from being the middle child, or having a younger sick sibling, and there's probably truth to it - getting lost in that shuffle. But I was also fairly shy in those younger years, and maybe [music fulfilled] this need to define oneself."" That's why, when his school friends started cover bands, he preferred to write original songs.  ""Some people need to build things to communicate, and I know people who can't feel their existence unless they're being very physical in some kind of way. I've always needed music. I see it as a language."" After playing in a couple of local bands, Antonoff eventually joined the power-pop trio fun. and co-wrote the single We Are Young. A global smash, it earned them a Grammy for song of the year in 2013, but Antonoff was already planning his getaway. ""I remember immediately - immediately - feeling like, 'I don't want to play We Are Young when I'm 35,'"" he later recalled. So he formed Bleachers, drawing on his love of 80s pop and college rock. Their music is a strange dichotomy -  raucous and thrilling, but with a dangerous riptide of misery below the surface. Nowhere is that more apparent than on their new album, which interrogates his sadness while seeking a path out of it. The record began in 2019, as Antonoff was coping with the fallout from a major break-up (reportedly from actress and screenwriter Lena Dunham, although he is careful not to name names). ""I found myself in this frustrated place,"" he says. ""It's very easy to leave a period of your life, and it's very hard to enter the next one.  ""You can leave anything. You can sell your stuff and walk out the door, but it's very hard to move on. And it's a very uncomfortable place to live, but a very fruitful place to write from."" The first track he wrote was Don't Go Dark, a literal account of the end of the relationship, that Antonoff describes as the ""angriest, cruellest"" lyric he's ever recorded. ""It was a necessary story to tell, because I had this pretty ugly feeling,"" he says. ""Not 'I love you', not 'I hate you', but 'You've got to [expletive] off, you have to leave me alone.' And it was sort of poking at me: 'Write about this, write about this.' ""It's the opposite sentiment to the rest of the album - which is that holding someone's darkness is the ultimate expression of love. But there's the other side to it, relationships where you have to say, 'Do what you want, but I can't hold your darkness.'  ""You only have so much space [in your heart] or else you can't move through your life."" It's problematic, he acknowledges, to be exposing these sentiments to the world. ""Writing is the most private thing you could do. You've levelled a bunch of complaints against yourself and the people around you - and when you release it to the world, it always leaves you with a new set of questions like, 'Why do I feel the need to share these things?' ""I think it's probably why a lot of people who do this have a hard time in life, because that doesn't really make sense on paper. You take the most hyper-personal things and throw it out to a bunch of strangers."" But as tortured as the lyrics get, Antonoff finds balance with some of the most exuberant, catchy melodies of his career. Recorded with his touring band in the midst of the pandemic, the desire to be back on stage is so conspicuous you can taste it. There's a delicious moment on How Dare You Want More where Antonoff trades riffs with saxophonist Evan Smith - the rest of the band falling back to highlight their duel. It was a spontaneous moment, that happened to be captured on film in New York's iconic Electric Lady studio. ""I used that film as the backbone of the song,"" says Antonoff. ""For the guitar-sax battle, I overdubbed one or two of my lines but that's the exact live take. If you watch the video, the sax player is exactly just playing it in the moment."" The live studio sound has become a hallmark of Antonoff's recent productions, from the hushed acoustics of Swift's Folklore and Evermore, to the sweaty 70s funk of St Vincent's Daddy's Home.  The turning point came with Lana Del Rey's Norman Rockwell. Billed as a ""folk record with a little surf twist"", it saw the musician pivot from the analogue synths and maximalist arrangements he'd become known for. ""There was something about making Norman,"" he says. ""There were just sets of instruments around and we were like, 'Screw it, let's make some sounds. Let's do the opposite of what a lot of the people around us are doing right now. Let's unplug the drum machine.'  ""It's funny because that sounds so basic, but at that time it was really groundbreaking."" The decision has permeated pop - or, at least, the more thoughtful, confessional end of the market.  You can trace a line from Norman Rockwell to the ghostly aesthetics of Billie Eilish's new album, or the acoustic moments on Olivia Rodrigo's Sour (Swift and Antonoff even get a writing credit for their influence on her single Deja Vu). How does Antonoff feel about influencing a new generation? ""Well, I think we're all in sort of this unconscious conversation where we move together,"" he says.  ""We're kind of pulling each other in different ways. You look for the things that feel shocking. And the idea of shocking isn't as simple as like a crazy modular synth or hitting a metal board with a whip to get your snare sound.  ""Sometimes you reach a point where shocking is just playing your drum set and I reached that point. And now I'm actually kind of drifting to a different point."" He won't divulge what that new idea might be - psychedelic flugelhorn? Hardcore polka? A steam-powered mouse orchestra? - but drops a cryptic hint: ""You have to swim against the tide enough to find yourself. At the end of the day, you can't really feel excited if you're making things that slot too well into what's already going on."" For now, though, he's indulging in the music of his youth. Take The Sadness Out Of Saturday Night revels in the sounds of New Jersey and New York.  You can hear Talking Heads, The Strokes and Blondie lurking in the wings, but it's the reverb-drenched anthems of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band that take centre stage. Antonoff even secured that aforementioned feature from Springsteen on the gritty-but-romantic Chinatown, after playing him an early draft of the song.  When The Boss suddenly declared, ""Let's go into the studio,"" Antonoff didn't give it a second thought. ""But a couple of days later, I went through it and hearing him take over the second verse really just hit the spot in a pretty intense way."" Reconnecting with New Jersey's most famous son brought the record together thematically too.  Growing up, Antonoff had always wanted to flee the state for its more glamorous neighbour, New York. But as he tried to understand why, post-breakup, he was finding it so difficult to experience joy, he realised the answers all lay at home. ""I got to thinking, is this a Jewish thing? Is it a cultural thing? A generational thing? Why does joy have to come with pain? ""That's in my family - that sort of Holocaust mentality of, 'Don't get too happy, because they're coming.'  ""But the problem with that is that the easiest way to have an unadventurous life is to prepare for the worst. And I don't want that. I want to be able to dive out there and just grab things, even if I miss them."" The answer, he discovered, ""quite literally entails going back to New Jersey"".  ""The hallmarks of this album are about taking my sound back home, and looking at the past with less of a dark lens,"" he adds. ""It's so easy to remember the horrible things. When I was writing this album, I just thought, 'Well what about everything else? It's not worthless.'  ""I had to remember that joy is not an embarrassing emotion."""
Market Sentiment on Bonds,Coronavirus fears wipe £200bn off UK firms' value,2024-09-14,2020-02-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51681620,"London's FTSE 100 share index has seen one of its worst weeks since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008 as markets continue to reel from the impact of the coronavirus.  Shares have shed almost 13% of their value, wiping £210bn from the value of companies on the index. Investors are worried after a surge in the number of companies warning about the impact of the outbreak on firms. US markets are also in the red, with markets around the globe in retreat. ""The panic mode is full on,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. ""The coronavirus outbreak has certainly hit businesses, and it might have a longer-than-expected negative impact on company earnings and global growth,"" she added. Globally, the dismal week on stock markets has so far wiped about $5 trillion from the value of listed companies around the world, according to Capital Economics' chief economist Neil Shearing. He said that affected the value of pension pots and could make it more difficult to borrow money if banks become more fearful of taking risks. Big shifts in the stock market are often in the news, whether they are booms in the US or falls due to the coronavirus or the financial crisis. As companies grow, they issue shares. The largest companies in the UK have shares which are bought and sold on the London Stock Exchange. There are good reasons why this performance affects your life and finances. Millions have pensions - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest this money to help it grow. Widespread falls in share prices are likely to be bad news for pension savers. Read more here. Investors are selling shares over fears that consumers will spend less if the virus continues to spread in the UK, Mr Shearing said. Instead, he said, investors are putting their money into government bonds, which are considered a safer investment. ""The markets are essentially betting on the fact that growth is going to slow the central bank is going to cut interest rates,"" he said. And it could be a safe bet. In an interview with Sky News, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that the coronavirus outbreak could lead to a downgrade of the UK's economic growth prospects. One of the firms selling some shares to buy government bonds is Bowmore Asset Management. ""We've gone from risk assets into more safe-haven assets,"" the wealth manager's client director Charles Incledon said. The company said that more than 130 listed firms in the UK had warned about the effects of the coronavirus on their business. Those firms range from travel companies to drinks makers, with both British Airways owner, IAG, and Diageo, which makes Guinness, warning that the demand had been affected by the outbreak. But Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that the reaction of investors to the announcements by companies was becoming increasingly irrational. ""Yes, the outbreak is frightening. Yes, it's unquantifiable. But is it as bad as a traditional influenza season in the West? No."" He said it had killed fewer people in Europe than the French heatwave last year. ""I don't want to sound macabre or unconcerned about it, but it shows how stock market sentiment has shifted from being over-exuberant to having no fear at all to now having reassessed things in a more sober fashion."""
Market Sentiment on Bonds,Soaring shares: A good or bad sign?,2024-09-14,2017-08-02,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40744544,"For weeks now, US stock markets have been hitting records, a rise claimed by President Donald Trump as proof of a healthy economy.  But Mr Trump's pride in the numbers is at odds with analysts and investors, who have expressed increasing discomfort over the market's climb. About 65% of investment managers surveyed by Northern Trust last quarter said they believed shares were over-valued, the highest ever in the firm's report.  Surveys by Bank of America Merrill Lynch have expressed alarm about the high prices, as have policymakers at the Federal Reserve. ""We are concerned about equity valuations right now,"" says Mike Morrill, chief operating officer at DF Dent, a Baltimore-based investment company. ""We've had nine years of a strong bull market and that's not going to last forever."" The sentiment is similar to statements Mr Trump himself made before his election, when he said the stock market was ""so bloated"" and warned people to ""be careful"". If investors believe prices are too high - and are buying anyway - that could be a sign of a bubble.  So is the stock market rally a reason to cheer, as Mr Trump suggests now? Or could a crash be around the corner? Stocks, which have been on a long-term upward trend, surged early in 2017, amid optimism over business-friendly policies endorsed by the Trump administration, such as tax reform.  Analysts say that without clear signs of progress on reform in Washington that effect has faded.  Now, it's strong corporate revenue and profit growth that are boosting share prices, with gains going to larger, multinational companies. The three major measures - the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq - have climbed between roughly 10% and 17% so far this year, compared with about 6% to 7% during the same period last year. The Nasdaq has hit a new high more than 40 times this year. Since 2012, the value of the S&P 500 index has almost doubled. ""The stock market hit the highest level it's ever been,"" Mr Trump boasted on Wednesday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average exceeded 22,000 points on Wednesday morning.  ""Our country is doing very well,"" he said. But that hasn't stopped the muttering that the stock market, at least, is due for a correction.  Robert Shiller, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at Yale University, says share gains reflect optimism about where the economy is heading, but it's an unreliable forecasting tool, and shifts quickly. ""The stock market is mostly psychology,"" he says. ""The fluctuations in it mean that we're in an optimistic mood but we could change and we could change suddenly."" Investors are trying to anticipate what might trigger a change - whether it be rising interest rates, weak consumer spending, developments overseas or something else entirely.  Mr Shiller says he thinks Mr Trump himself poses one of the biggest risks.   The firestorm in Washington in May after Mr Trump fired former FBI director James Comey prompted some of the biggest one-day share sell-offs this year.  ""Usually, presidents are not able to transform the economy unless he does something disastrous, which transforms it down,"" says Mr Shiller. ""I'm thinking that it's more likely he will create some kind of uncertainty, disruption and that might be a trigger for decline."" Many of the biggest gains come from a single sector - technology stocks - the same industry that some investors say is overvalued. The S&P 500 information technology index, which averages 68 companies, including heavyweights such as Apple, Microsoft and Facebook, last month passed the record set in March 2000.  The index rose about 22% in the first seven months of 2017, while the broader S&P 500 climbed about 10%.  Some say the gains in tech make sense, as investors target a part of the economy seeing rapid growth.  However, others worry that in some cases the rise in shares has little to do with the companies' actual prospects.  And in more recent weeks, tech stocks have come under pressure. If the sell-off spreads to other sectors, it could be a warning of bigger problems.  Jill Hall, a US equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, doesn't expect stock markets in general to rise much more this year, but she's not predicting a big sell-off either.  She thinks investors will shift their money from the high-growth tech industry into sectors such as energy, health care and finance. ""What we're expecting is more of a rotation out of growth and into value,"" she says. Some say they're worried Federal Reserve and central bankers elsewhere will move too aggressively to increase interest rates, causing havoc in bond and stock markets. About 27% of investors surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch last month identified a mistake by central bankers in the US and Europe as the biggest risk to their outlooks. Another 28% were worried about bonds. Mr Trump himself raised alarms on these lines at a presidential debate last year.  ""We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble,"" he said. ""The only thing that looks good is the stock market. But if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down."" That's something that is not lost on the central bankers responsible for monetary policy. Last month Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen told a US congressional committee: ""We want to make sure that we manage this in a way that is not disruptive to financial markets.""  And that's a sentiment financial markets would no doubt endorse. "
Market Sentiment on Bonds,The ex-conspiracy theorist fighting misinformation,2024-09-14,2023-03-18,By Tess de la Mare & Carolyn Milford,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-64758113,"A former conspiracy theorist has found speaking out about misinformation has given him ""a whole new lease of life"".  Bristol-based Brent Lee, 43, got sucked into the so-called truther movement in his early 20s when the UK was on the brink of invading Iraq.  He would spend almost 15 years ""down the rabbit hole"", as he terms it, believing every atrocity from 9/11 to mass shootings was being orchestrated by a ""satanic elite"".  Ultimately it was the rise of American far-right pundit Alex Jones and his insistence that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax that made Brent question his own beliefs.  When he first started to pay attention to conspiracy theories, there was nothing about Brent that would have marked him out as vulnerable to misinformation.  He was living in Peterborough, was playing in a band and doing low-paid jobs to help him get by while he tried to build a career as a musician.  Speaking to BBC West, he said: ""I felt happy, I had a big circle of friends through music, nothing had happened - there was no catalyst."" Instead it was general distrust in the then-government and its claims about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction that allowed conspiracy theories to take hold. It was not a big stretch for Brent to believe the attack on the Twin Towers was an inside job, he recalled. ""I just had this strong anti-war sentiment and the conspiracies gave me an answer as to why that was happening."" Within a few years, Brent believed that the world was being controlled by an occultist, paedophilic elite.  He began to believe that every outrage such as war crimes and school shootings were rituals or sacrifices by this shadowy group.  His beliefs opened a rift between him and most of his friends.  During the early days of social media he began building a big community of fellow truther musicians, showcasing their work on platforms like MySpace, Facebook and his blog. The majority of Brent's relationships were now conducted online with people spread across the world.  ""Not just the bands and the artists but also the fans of all these people - that was my community for quite a few years,"" he said.    His new belief system would have a fundamental impact on Brent's life.  ""I didn't pursue any career properly. I didn't think about a mortgage, I didn't think about all the normal kind of things that people do,"" he said.  Brent feared having kids because he didn't want to bring them up ""in the new world order"" but now feels he has missed out.    The 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 26 people including 20 young children were killed, proved a turning point for Brent.  The belief that it was a hoax designed to toughen America's gun laws became the dominant narrative among conspiracy theorists - a narrative heavily promoted by Alex Jones on his InfoWars website.  This jarred with Brent's own belief that victims of shootings and other atrocities were being sacrificed by a satanic elite.  It shook him just enough that he slowly started to question the foundations of his thinking.  But it would be another six years before he left his online truther world completely - helped along by several seismic shocks in the UK and US political system.  ""I always thought that these elections were rigged, that they were predetermined,""he said.  He believed Hillary Clinton would stroll to the White House, the UK would vote remain in the Brexit referendum and Jeremy Corbyn would never become Labour leader.  ""All three things were the complete reverse,"" he said.  He realised these had happened through ""people power"" and were not the work of some shadowy global cabal pushing its chosen candidates into power.    Brent believes that conspiracy theories gave him a way of making sense of a world that seemed fundamentally unfair.  ""I felt there must be a reason why this world isn't fair, there must be a reason why these things are happening and (conspiracy theories) give an answer as to why."" He added: ""Conspiracy theories are actually really hard to deal with, but also at the same time at least there is an answer.""  Since launching a blog speaking out against misinformation, Brent has himself been accused of being an actor by conspiracy theorists.  But he said the outpouring of support he has received has helped replace the community he lost when he stepped away from the truther movement.  ""It has given me a whole new lease of life - I wasn't expecting people outside of the truther community to want to hear what I had to say,"" he said.  ""People found it useful hearing from someone who believed that stuff and why they believed it - putting things into context really helps people understand."" ""That's what I found with conspiracy theories, putting the theories into context helps dismantle them."" Dr Daniel Jolley, a social psychologist studying conspiracy theories, believes at their heart they are a way of ""making sense of a very complex and scary world"". The fact Brent was able to reassess his entire world view largely by himself is ""pretty rare"", Dr Jolley said.   ""Conspiracy beliefs are so hard-wired and they become such a part of your identity that changing that identity becomes really difficult,"" he said. This can be particularly tough for people who are already socially isolated.  ""You may have started this journey because you felt lonely, you were looking for answers, and suddenly you are back to where you started.""  But the fact Brent's interest in conspiracy theories began with a general distrust in the government is something Dr Jolley has seen over and over in his research.  Spin and obfuscation from those in power can create ""fertile ground"" for conspiracy beliefs, he said.    Tackling conspiracy theories is ""about having trust in our institutions and trust in our journalists to try and pull out the lies"". While mental health conditions such as anxiety and paranoia might sometimes play a role, there is no psychological profile for a conspiracy theorists.  ""It could really be any of us,"" Dr Jolley said.  Follow BBC West on Facebook,Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk"
Market Sentiment on Bonds,China's empty tower blocks highlight economic woes,2024-09-14,2023-07-06,By Stephen McDonell,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66125675,"The small eastern city of Zibo in Shandong province is experiencing an outdoor barbecue craze. People from all over China are coming here to taste its lamb skewers, which have become legendary via social media. It's quite a raucous experience and certainly not for the faint-hearted. The street is packed, you sit on little plastic chairs, drink beer and wrap chunks of meat with spring onion on the local flatbread while karaoke songs pump out in all directions. On the face of it, these crowds appear to show an economy rebounding strongly from the coronavirus emergency - but according to economists that's not the case. Rather, they say, this is an example of people choosing a cheap, tasty, option at a time of great pressure on household incomes. A man sitting with his shirt off tells us this is the perfect spot to enjoy a hot summer night with his family, and that this type of fun has a price tag to match the moment. ""This place is great for ordinary people,"" he says. ""Recently, it's been hard to make money but still easy to spend it. After three years of Covid, the economy is only slowly recovering."" University graduates are being hit especially hard by China's economic doldrums, with youth unemployment hovering at or above 20%. Some students are feeling nervous about their futures. ""Yes, I'm worried,"" says one woman who'll soon graduate. ""There's a lot of competition. It's hard to find a job. All my classmates feel the same pressure.""  For those who have jobs, a big reason for their reluctance to spend big is economic security. They're concerned about the potential to join the ranks of the unemployed, and their household's largest single investment is, in many cases, no longer worth what they thought it would be.  The real estate sector is under great stress in China. To see this first-hand, we drive a few hours east of Zibo to the outskirts of a much larger city, Qingdao. Here, a property explosion hasn't matched real demand from buyers or renters, and the result has been huge housing estates built with very few residents in them. A woman is selling cold noodles from a portable stand outside her housing complex where she has few neighbours. A few years ago, her husband bought a flat here after moving to Qingdao to give their child a better start because they heard the schools would be good. I ask her if she's worried about the value of her home collapsing. ""Of course I'm worried,"" she says. ""But what can I do?"" Nearby a couple who are street cleaners have stopped for lunch. They point to the huge estate behind them and say that nobody lives there. Across the road there is a small forest of concrete towers without paint, without windows and with window frames now looking the worse for wear, having been exposed to the elements. ""Construction just stopped there one day last year,"" the man says. According to his wife, the entire suburb is pretty dead. ""There's nothing here. There's no petrol station. You have to go a long way for fuel. It's really not convenient to live here,"" she says. There had been hope that this region would take off after the city hosted a major political meeting, the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation Summit, and China's leader Xi Jinping gave it his personal stamp of approval as a place to invest and do business, potentially hosting international expos and the like. But the factories, start-ups and other companies that would supposedly employ those who bought property here have been few. According to a local real estate agent, sales volumes have halved in the area in recent years. ""Prices are down because the market is saturated,"" she says. ""Too many homes were built and it's hard to sell them."" We put up a drone to get a bird's eye view and it looks even worse than at ground level. Entire new housing estates where work has stopped can be found in all directions. Those that are finished don't have much sign of life in them. What's more, this supply and demand problem isn't unique to this area. It isn't even unique to this city. In province after province across China, evidence pointing to the danger of a property bubble is easy to find. One reason for rampant real estate speculation in this country has been a lack of other options for investment. But the boom in real estate drove house prices out of the reach of ordinary families in many big cities. The government response was to cap the number of flats any person could buy.  It was a genuine attempt at an egalitarian reform, but pressure is now coming to reverse this. In Qingdao, such measures have already been eased, in an attempt to stimulate its stalled real estate market. The challenge for Chinese policymakers is to find a way to wean this economy off such a heavy reliance on property sales to generate growth and business confidence. Economists like Harry Murphy Cruise, from Moody's Analytics, think China is facing significant problems. ""China's economy is in desperate need of rebalancing,"" he tells the BBC from Australia. ""It's had that massive period of growth over the last two or three decades from big infrastructure building, from a massive uptick in the property market that is actually not a sustainable growth driver going forward. ""Look around the world, developed economies need households as a key driver of economic growth, and that is just not what China has at the moment."" The Chinese government is considering ways to promote more spending by individuals and by businesses from interest rate cuts to cash handouts. But the problem is sentiment. People will feel more secure when there are more jobs. Businesses need to invest to create more jobs, but they are reluctant to do so while customers are so insecure. As Harry Murphy Cruise puts it: ""It's sort of like the chicken and the egg. You can't have that uptick in the economy unless you have business spending. They're not spending until they see that uptick. So, there's a stalemate that's really holding back a key portion of the economy."" Then there's the chance that all of this will bleed into global trade. China is big. What happens to the world's second largest economy turns ripples into waves. Reduced manufacturing here - off the back of weak international demand - has resulted in fewer exports, fewer Chinese-made goods available worldwide and less business activity in Asia's mega factory. Then the subsequent slower consumption in China means fewer imports of other countries' products. The headache for the Chinese government is that it may have to choose whether to go for a short-term stimulus fix, which would delay the rebalancing it will eventually need to face, or whether to absorb more immediate pain and bring on the long-term solution more quickly. Naturally, there are almost certainly those in Beijing's upper echelons of power considering some sort of middle path, starting with a milder boost to stabilise the economy, then considering the larger problems at hand. Because they know that, once negative sentiment sets in, it can be hard to turn around. Yet if you want to feel optimistic about Qingdao, and about life, you go to the beach. Tourism along its famous coastline does seem to be picking up. There's laughter, sandcastle construction and everyone - whether they're a captain of industry or a truck driver - is enjoying the great embrace of the ocean. Whether it matches reality or not, here you almost can't help but feel that, despite everything, the future still has good things in store."
Market Sentiment on Bonds,Evergrande shares jump as debt deadline looms,2024-09-14,2021-09-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58660578,"Shares in Evergrande have jumped in Hong Kong after the troubled property giant struck an agreement with Chinese bond holders on Wednesday. The announcement helped to calm some investor concerns over debts of more than $300bn (£220bn). But the world's most indebted developer is also due to make a $83.5m interest payment on an overseas bond on Thursday. The Hong Kong market was closed on Wednesday when the deal was announced. After a volatile day of trading, Evergrande shares closed more than 17% higher. The firm's shares have lost more than 80% of their value on the Hong Kong stock market so far this year as it struggles to raise money to meet its obligations. The company had moved to placate investors, saying in a statement on Wednesday that it would pay interest payments for its domestic bonds.  The amount due for the domestic bond is estimated to be $35.9m (£26.3m). However, the statement did not reveal how much interest would be paid or when any payment would be made, saying only that the bond ""has already been resolved through private negotiations"". The filing also did not mention the separate foreign bond. Under agreements with investors, the company has a 30-day grace period before a missed payment on the offshore bond would become a default. Some analysts have cautioned that the failure of such a large and heavily-indebted property developer could have a major impact on the Chinese economy, which could potentially spread to the global financial system. And while Wednesday's deal was seen by some investors as a positive development, others remain wary. ""It's too soon to say whether this is just a brief respite or it signifies that a rescue plan is in the works,"" Donald Low, Director of the Institute for Emerging Market Studies at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology said. Investment experts are looking for clarity over what the Chinese government may do to resolve the firm's debt crisis. ""Until there is certainty regarding how the government will deal with Evergrande, investors are likely to remain jittery,"" Catherine Yeung, Investment Director, Fidelity International told the BBC. Ms Yeung also pointed that Beijing' business crackdown - which has seen it increasingly tightening its grip on big businesses, including tech giant Alibaba and ride-sharing app Didi Chuxing- may add to uncertainty.  ""Investors can usually deal with different standalone issues but the regulatory changes we have seen so far this year, coupled with the fast evolving Evergrande situation, has seen investor sentiment weaken,"" she said.

Market Sentiment on Bonds,Evergrande chairman put under police surveillance,2024-09-14,2023-09-28,By Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66932548,"Evergrande's chairman Hui Ka Yan has been put under police surveillance as the problems for the Chinese property giant mount. Evergrande said its shares would remain suspended until further notice. It marks another low for the heavily indebted property giant which defaulted in 2021, triggering China's current real estate market crisis. In August, it filed for bankruptcy in the US in a bid to protect its American assets as it worked on a deal. In a statement on Thursday, Evergrande said Mr Hui ""has been subject to mandatory measures in accordance with the law due to suspicion of illegal crimes"", without giving any further detail. The latest share suspension comes just a month after the firm's previous 17-month suspension was lifted. Evergrande - once the world's most valuable property developer - is at the centre of a real estate crisis threatening the world's second largest economy. With more than $300bn (£247bn) of debt, the firm has been scrambling to raise cash by selling assets and shares to repay suppliers and creditors. Most of Evergrande's debt is owed to people within China, many of whom are ordinary citizens whose homes have not been finished. When the firm defaulted on its huge debts in 2021, it sent shockwaves through global financial markets as the property sector contributes to roughly a quarter of China's economy. Several other of the country's major developers have defaulted over the past year and many are struggling to find the money to complete developments. Hui Ka Yan, also known as Xu Jiayin, was born into a poor family in China's central Henan province in 1958, during Mao Zedong's economic and social campaign, the Great Leap Forward. Despite his upbringing, after setting up Evergrande in 1996, he became a poster child for China's super-rich. He earned the nickname ""Belt Brother"" in 2012 by wearing a gold-buckled belt from the French luxury label Hermès to China's annual legislative conference. In 2017, he became China's richest person with his fortune rising to $42.5bn (£34bn). But his wealth has plummeted since then, largely as Evergrande's problems have grown, and he has kept a low profile in recent years. There are several reasons why Evergrande's problems are serious. Firstly, many people bought property from Evergrande even before building work began. They have paid deposits and could potentially lose that money if it goes bust. There are also the companies that do business with Evergrande. Firms including construction and design firms and materials suppliers are at risk of incurring major losses, which could force them into bankruptcy. The third is the potential impact on China's financial system: If Evergrande defaults, banks and other lenders may be forced to lend less. This could lead to what is known as a credit crunch, when companies struggle to borrow money at affordable rates. A credit crunch would be very bad news for the world's second largest economy, because companies that can't borrow find it difficult to grow, and in some cases are unable to continue operating. This may also unnerve foreign investors, who could see China as a less attractive place to put their money. In July, Evergrande revealed it had lost a combined 581.9bn yuan ($79.6bn; £65.6bn) over the past two years. It has been working on a new repayment plan and the company seemed to have been moving closer to resolving the problem after it filed for US bankruptcy protection. Its latest plan was to reissue its overseas debt as new bonds that it had to pay back in about 10 years' time, as well as offering their creditors stakes in the company as shares. But earlier this week, Evergrande revealed its mainland unit Hengda Real Estate had defaulted on 4bn yuan of debt. Chinese business wire Caixin also reported that several current and former executives has been detained. Trading in its two other units - property services and electric vehicles - was also suspended on Thursday. ""China's property-sector stress will continue to pose cross-sector credit risks in the near term,"" wrote Lan Wang and Duncan Innes-Ker of Fitch Ratings.  ""The government's modest policy easing to date is unlikely to drive a sharp turnaround in homebuyers' sentiment, even though it has led to some recent improvements in broader economic indicators,"" their report said."
Market Sentiment on Bonds,Morning business round-up,2024-09-14,2012-04-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-17585999,"What made the business news in Asia and Europe this morning? Here's our daily business round-up: Unemployment across countries that use the euro edged higher in February to 10.8%. That's up from 10.7% in January and the highest level since the introduction of the single currency in 1999. Spain has the highest rate of 23.6%. Meanwhile, a separate report confirmed that manufacturing activity in Europe shrank in February. A former senior official at the European Central Bank (ECB) has said that the risk of eurozone debt woes spreading, the so-called contagion threat, has always been ""overstated"". But Juergen Stark, who resigned last year as the ECB's chief economist, told the BBC's Hard Talk that it was too early to say if Greece will be able to meet its austerity targets. He said this would be known in six months' time. The UK's manufacturing sector grew at its fastest pace for 10 months in March, a survey has indicated. The Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing rose to 52.1 last month from 51.5 in February. A reading above 50 implies growth. The data is an encouraging sign that the UK economy grew in the first three months of 2012 and avoided a recession. The recovery in the UK financial services sector is continuing, a survey has suggested, with optimism improving and firms taking on new staff. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and employers' group the CBI found business volumes in the three months to March grew for the eighth quarter in a row. This video can not be played Biz Heads Optimism in the sector rose for the first time in a year. The continued lack of activity in the UK housing market has been reflected in the latest injection of equity into British homes. Housing equity withdrawal remained negative in the final three months of 2011, the Bank of England said. The £8.5bn injection of equity reflected low levels of sales, rather than owners making an active effort to pay off their mortgages more quickly. The main Asian news was a report showing that Japanese manufacturers continue to remain pessimistic despite recent weakness in the yen. The Bank of Japan's (BOJ) Tankan survey showed that large manufacturers' sentiment between January to March remained at minus four, the same level as the previous quarter. The survey is considered by the BOJ while deciding its monetary policy. You can hear the BBC's interview with ex-ECB chief economist Juergen Stark in the latest edition of our Business Daily programme. He reveals that he left the bank last year because of deep concern about the ECB's policy of buying the government bonds of indebted eurozone members. Market data"
Market Sentiment on Bonds,Stock market fall: How will it affect you?,2024-09-14,2018-02-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42963321,"As European stock markets follow the turbulence in Asia and US trading, the BBC has asked for your questions about what is happening. Many of the questions the BBC received focused on the possible ramifications for ordinary people. Others wanted to know if it was likely the instability could bring about a crash. BBC Business journalist Brian Milligan answers a selection of your questions below. Even if you don't own shares or bonds directly, there is a good chance you own them as part of your pension. Twelve million workers in the UK are now members of defined contribution (dc) schemes.  This means the value of their retirement income is directly dependent on the value of the shares their pension fund owns. But as long as you are not retiring in the very near future, this should not really affect you. In fact the shares your pension fund will now be buying will be cheaper, and will have a better chance of growing in value. Ultimately, share prices depend on two things: the profits made by companies, and the sentiment of investors. At the moment, many companies are making good profits, especially in the US, where tax cuts will boost earnings further. As long as these economic fundamentals are good, it is unlikely there will be a full-blown ""crash"" - unless investors have a real reason to worry. Their concern at the moment is about rising inflation and rising interest rates, which are actually signs the global economy is growing well.  Ask your crystal ball!  The only advice on this from the experts is that markets recover over the long term. The definition of ""long term"" is rather more hazy. ""Markets are capricious beasts in the short term and, looking forward, stock prices could move in either direction without defying the laws of statistics,"" said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""However, in the long term, markets are more reliable in generating growth, and so anyone saving for retirement should still consider the stock market as a friend not a foe."" Do you have a question for the BBC to investigate? It's really the other way round. Investors are worried the US Federal Reserve - America's central bank - may raise rates four times this year, rather than the three previously expected. The Bank of England has also signalled that it expects to raise rates twice this year, maybe as soon as May. Higher borrowing costs mean lower profits for companies, and less spending by consumers. Which is why share prices have fallen.  It is the danger of inflation which causes central banks to raise rates. However, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will take market falls into account when deciding whether to increase rates, particularly if they think consumers are likely to cut their spending as a result. The Bank of England target for CPI inflation is 2%. The latest figures show CPI running at 3% in the year to December.  While the Monetary Policy Committee's main job is to keep inflation in check, it also takes into account the health of - and risks to - the economy as a whole. While it did put up rates by 0.25% in November - to 0.5% - that was the first rise in 10 years. However, the Bank has now hinted that it may not tolerate 3% inflation for much longer.  You may also like: Stock markets move constantly, so measuring growth very much depends on the dates you chose. But it is interesting to ask whether the average investor has gained or lost money over the last year, given the correction in prices. At the time of writing, the FTSE 100 is pretty much where it was a year ago. In other words at the headline level the average investor has neither lost nor gained money over the last year. However, when you take dividends into account, investors may still have made reasonable returns. The average yield on the FTSE 100 is currently 3.8% - far higher than the return on cash.  Journalists are not qualified to give financial advice. However, while no one knows what the stock market will do in the future, we are getting close to the end-of-year deadline for ISAs. If you are considering investing soon, it may be worth using up your ISA allowance for 2017/18. If you buy a stocks and shares ISA, you can leave it in cash, until you decide where you want to invest. You are allowed to contribute up to £20,000, for which you will pay no tax on the income or capital gain. Younger people who want to buy a home may want to consider the Lifetime ISA, to which the government will contribute an extra 25%. Produced by BBC's UGC and Social News team"
Market Sentiment on Bonds,Can India's Adani Group recover from $100bn loss?,2024-09-14,2023-02-07,By Archana Shukla,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64495573,"India's Adani Group has seen its market value plunge after a US investment firm made fraud allegations against it. Can its ambitious growth plans survive?  Until two weeks ago, the ports-to-energy conglomerate which operates seven publicly traded companies had a combined valuation of $220bn.  But since 24 January, when short seller Hindenburg Research accused the group of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud, its valuations have nearly halved. The group's founder Gautam Adani has seen billions wiped off his personal wealth and has dropped out of the list of the world's top 20 richest people. The Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them ""malicious"" and ""baseless"" and says it plans have not changed. But investors are clearly still nervous.  On Monday, the group said in a statement that it would prepay loans worth $1.1bn, taken using shares as collateral, ahead of their maturity date next year. This, it said, was partly due to ""continued market volatility"" and to assure investors that the group's promoters would ""prepay all shares-backed financing"". The announcement led to a rally in the flagship company's stock - on Tuesday, shares of Adani Enterprises closed 15% higher on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Last week, the group also called off its secondary share sale. The 2.5bn (£2bn) it had raised was meant to pay off debt and fund projects, including airport renovation, expressway construction and an ambitious green hydrogen ecosystem. They indicate investors are losing confidence in a company. Analysts are now watching to see how the stock price slide affects the company's operations, cash flow and expansion plans. ""Most of their ambitious projects will have to be heavily scaled back in ambition and timetable, because they will have next to no capacity to raise funds right now,"" says Tim Buckley, director at Climate Energy Finance, a think-tank that works on financial issues related to transition from fossil fuel to clean energy. It could borrow money to fund projects and acquisitions - a common strategy for infrastructure companies, which helped fuel the Adani Group's rapid growth. But the group's debt has grown at a faster pace than revenues and profitability, which some fear could raise risks of a default - a concern flagged by both the Hindenburg report as well as some analysts. The group already has total debt of nearly two trillion rupees ($24bn; £20bn) - it almost doubled over the past three years as Mr Adani's ambitions extended to areas such as 5G and green hydrogen. Nearly two-thirds of Adani's debt is from overseas sources such as bonds or foreign banks, according to a report by global brokerage Jefferies. Until now, the group has mostly raised funds by using its infrastructure assets or shares as collateral. But with stock prices plunging, the value of this collateral has also dipped. The private wealth units of two big banks, Credit Suisse and Citigroup, have stopped accepting Adani bonds as collateral, Bloomberg has reported.  Many Indian banks have also loaned billions of dollars to companies linked to the group and state-owned insurance firm Life Insurance Corporation of India has invested in it. Market observers say that the Hindenburg report and the reaction to it will make lenders cautious - which means loans could become costlier. ""There is pressure on the company's credibility. It will make it extremely difficult to raise fresh loans, especially in the overseas market,"" an Indian corporate banker said on condition of anonymity as he didn't want to be seen commenting on the Adani Group. Another observer, a former banker with an international wealth fund, said that the group may be forced to delay some projects until the issue settles down. He also did not want to be named. The BBC sent a list of questions to the Adani Group. A spokesperson replied: ""All our ongoing projects continue according to the plan. Adani Group's core fundamentals remain unchanged.""  Scrutiny on the group has now increased. Investors and credit rating agencies are closely assessing its ability to raise money and repay loans. S&P Global Ratings has downgraded its outlook on two Adani companies to negative. ""New investigations and negative market sentiment may lead to increased cost of capital and reduce funding access for rated entities,"" it said.   In a video statement after the group's share sale was called off, Mr Adani had said that its balance sheet was ""healthy and assets robust"". He added that the group has an ""impeccable track record of fulfilling our debt obligations"". But credit rating agency ICRA said in a statement last week that the group's large, debt-funded capital spending programme remains a key challenge. Most of the group's capital-guzzling new businesses such as green energy, airports and roads are housed under flagship company Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) and depend on it for funds. AEL has enough cash but could come under pressure if it has to pay interest for even its subsidiaries. Some of the group's firms will be shielded from the current volatility because they own and operate strong physical assets such as ports, airports and factories. ""Adani Ports and Adani Power are the strongest and most well-capitalised [firms], which means their assets are backed by long-term government contracts. Most of the loans taken by these companies are against these revenue and profit-accruing assets,"" says the corporate banker quoted above. However, this isn't the case for some of the group's newer businesses. Companies such as Adani Gas and renewable energy arm Adani Green already have immense debt on their books and are still building up their cash flows. This could make them more vulnerable to market shocks and reduce their creditworthiness. The banker points out that while the prices of bonds issued by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd have fallen only marginally, those issued by Adani Green had lost more than a quarter of their value in three days. Deferring new projects and selling some assets to raise money could be a way out. ICRA has said that some of the planned capital spending is discretionary in nature and can be deferred, depending on how much liquidity it has. ""The company has built assets that are valuable to a developing country like India, and there will be many strategic investors interested,"" said a corporate adviser who didn't want to be named. Some analysts remain optimistic. ""I have seen varied operating [Adani] projects from ports, airports, cements to renewables which are solid, stable and generating a healthy cash flow. They are completely safe from the ups and downs of what happens in the stock market,"" says Vinayak Chatterjee, an infrastructure expert who is founder and managing trustee of the Infravision Foundation.  Analysts are also watching to see if there will be a regulatory enquiry into the group's corporate governance. The issue has also set off a political row over Mr Adani's perceived closeness to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which both deny.  On Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi from the main opposition Congress party brought up the allegations in parliament, accusing Mr Modi of helping the Adani Group - his comments caused uproar, with a federal minister accusing Mr Gandhi of levelling ""wild allegations"" without proof.    A day earlier, the party had held protests across the country, demanding an investigation into the allegations. Mr Buckley says that as pressure mounts, the Adani Group's ability to win government contracts easily to ramp up revenues will be challenged. It will also find it difficult to restore its credit credibility.  Since the group has to repay a significant amount, it will have to do a strategic asset sale, he says. "
Market Sentiment on Bonds,Trade war: What will China's next move be?,2024-09-14,2019-05-16,By Karishma Vaswani,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48290733,"Donald Trump's book The Art of the Deal could give you some insight into how he is negotiating with China amid the current trade war.  One of his business philosophies is called negative thinking - anticipating the worst outcome, and preparing for it.  ""I always go into the deal anticipating the worst,"" he writes. ""If you plan for the worst - if you can live with the worst - the good will always take care of itself.""  But is the US really prepared for the absolute worst China could do? In a clip from China Central Television, that's now gone viral on Chinese social media, anti-US sentiment appears to be at a peak. ""China is not willing, but not afraid, to fight"", says the presenter. ""After 5,000 years of winds and storms - what kind of hardship has the great Chinese nation not weathered?""  Looking even further back in China's history, perhaps Beijing is taking a page out of China's ancient strategic manual The Art of War.  As author Sun Tzu advises: ""If your opponent is of choleric temperament, seek to irritate him"".  Here's what could China do to ""irritate"" President Trump's arguably ""choleric temperament"" in this trade war. China is the biggest foreign holder of US government bonds, known as Treasuries, but in March stepped up its sale of these bonds to the quickest pace in two and a half years - according to data from the US Treasury department.  And Beijing could keep doing this - although it would come at a cost.  Hu Xijin, editor in chief of the Global Times which is published by the Communist Party's official mouthpiece the People's Daily, has tweeted: ""China may stop purchasing US agricultural products and energy, reduce Boeing orders and restrict US service trade with China. Many Chinese scholars are discussing the possibility of dumping US Treasuries and how to do it specifically."" But analysts say doing that would actually hurt China more.  In simple terms, if Beijing sold US Treasuries then it would drive down the US dollar - and that could potentially destabilise the US economy.  But that wouldn't be good for China in the long term. It needs a stable global economy as its economy weakens - so hurting the US in this way would, in effect, hurt China too.  Selling US Treasuries would also devalue China's holdings - effectively becoming an own goal.  China's currency is controlled, which means it's not freely traded. The central bank guides where the midpoint of the currency should be and then it trades within a narrow band around that midpoint. It has already lowered it in recent days, which analysts say is a signal to the market that China is willing to use the currency as a tool to offset the impact of US tariffs.  The weaker the Chinese currency, the less expensive its goods are in the US. In theory, this means more people will buy them, and Chinese companies won't suffer as much.  But the downside is that China's imports will become more expensive too - which will affect goods such as oil, and other raw materials that it needs to keep its economy chugging along. It's a delicate balance - and a tough position to be in.  This is one area where China could really tighten the screws on the US.  Foreign direct investment (FDI) has been a key factor driving China's economic growth - and it's also reaped dividends for the foreign companies investing in China, despite the challenging business environment.  However, Beijing could decide to make the environment even tougher.  In 2018, China was the second largest recipient of FDI in the world and a large chunk of that money came from the US, even as the trade war between the two intensified.  However, according to reports, China's National Development and Reform Council - the country's central planning agency has taken over the responsibility of deciding who will be allowed to invest in the country based on national security criteria. That's an important move, because now the council is the equivalent in some respects of the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States, (CFIUS)  - the entity tasked with evaluating which companies are security risks and which aren't.  Beijing will see the latest US moves to keep Huawei out of its markets as discriminatory - and could make it harder for American companies to get licences to operate in China, target the buying of American products as being anti-patriotic, and hold up goods at ports and customs.  Expect more American firms to see renewed scrutiny whilst investing in China.  China has consistently said it doesn't want to fight - it says it's being forced into a corner by the US.  In fact even if you drill down into the $60bn-worth of US goods that Beijing raised tariffs on this week in retaliation, the scale of the tariff increase is less than what's being reported, according to Vinesh Motwani of Silk Road Research.  In December China suspended retaliatory tariffs on vehicles and auto parts, and that suspension has remained in place. Analysts say this signals that Beijing wants to show some good faith in the lead up to the meeting between the two leaders at the G20 in Japan in June.  Still, Sun Tzu's Art of War prescribes: ""Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt."" Perhaps - if those talks in June don't go well - China is leaving room for itself to apply further pressure in the future. "
Market Sentiment on Bonds,Will Argentine and Turkish crises spread?,2024-09-14,2018-09-06,By Ana Nicolaci da Costa ,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45191872,"Economic crises in Turkey and Argentina have led to talk of ""contagion"" - the danger of financial problems in one country spilling over into others. Turkey has struggled with a falling currency and worsening relations with the US. A spiralling crisis in Argentina prompted the government to announce austerity measures and to ask the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an early release of a $50bn loan. The sharp falls in the value of Turkey's lira and Argentina's peso have led to fears that currencies from South Africa to Russia will follow suit. In Asia, India's rupee and Indonesia's rupiah have already been hit. So should Asian economies be concerned? Put simply, contagion is a self-fulfilling process, whereby economic problems in one country prompt investors to sell assets in economies with similar risks. In a globalised world, a crisis in one country can also quickly spread to others through trade links or lending by banks.  That is why a downturn in Turkey or Argentina matters abroad -  beyond making holidays there cheaper. Trade is the obvious way for trouble in one country to affect another.  When an economy begins to falter, companies tend to cut production and then jobs. As a result, consumers have less money to spend on goods, including imports. This is bad news for global businesses that export a lot of goods to the country.    If a crisis also causes a country's currency to weaken, the cost of imports rise, further hurting demand. However, Joseph Gagnon at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, says Asia has ""very low trade links"" with Argentina and Turkey, ""so that is not much of a worry"". Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist for IHS Markit, also says trade with Turkey is an unlikely channel of contagion for Asia, since the region relies more heavily on big economies such as China, Europe and the US for their exports. ""The more significant concern for Apac [Asia Pacific] nations would be if the Turkish economic crisis results in contagion to emerging markets currencies and equities, which could potentially trigger significant capital outflows from emerging markets,"" he said. The phrase ""emerging markets"" refers to developing countries in Africa, Latin America or Asia, while major economies such as the US, the UK and Japan tend to have higher living standards and more developed financial systems. During an economic crisis, investors tend to sell riskier assets, such as emerging market currencies or stocks, and hold on to safer ones, such as the US dollar or government bonds issued by major economies.  Julian Evans-Pritchard, a senior China economist at Capital Economics, says countries that rely on money from overseas and have foreign inflows of cash into their stock and bond markets are particularly at risk of contagion. ""The risk is that when sentiment turns more negative, foreign investors start to pull out those funds, which has an impact on the exchange rate,"" he said. ""For countries that borrowed a lot in foreign currency, usually in US dollars, this can make it difficult for them to repay their foreign currency denominated debt. That's what happened in 1997 during the Asian financial crisis, for example."" In Asia, both India and Indonesia rely heavily on foreign capital inflows, which is why their currencies have suffered in particular. India, an oil importing country, has seen its import bill rise along with higher oil prices and this has caused its current account deficit to widen, said Mr Biswas of IHS Markit. A country that runs a current account deficit may rely on inflows of foreign money to finance spending and investments. Indonesia, meanwhile, has low foreign exchange reserves and a high level of foreign ownership in the local equity and bond markets, Mr Biswas added.  This makes it particularly vulnerable to investors pulling their money out of the country. Another way contagion can spread is when banks in one country own assets in another country which is in trouble. The economic problems can cause the value of these assets to fall. When that happens, investors worry how a bank will cope with the falling value of the assets, and how this will affect its ability to lend money to consumers and other borrowers. Such concerns weighed on European bank shares recently, with investors worried about how much Turkish assets they own. The Financial Times reported that a wing of the European Central Bank was concerned about the exposure of some of the eurozone's biggest lenders to Turkey. The report said Spain's BBVA, Italy's UniCredit and France's BNP Paribas, all of which have significant operations in Turkey, were particularly exposed. Spain's banks are the most exposed to Turkey, according to IHS Markit, citing data from the Bank for International Settlements. They have about €81bn of exposure to Turkish assets, and French banks have exposure to about €35bn. But IHS Markit's Mr Biswas said Asian banks' exposure to Turkey was limited. ""In the big picture of the banking sectors of the Asian countries, this would not be a serious negative factor in their outlook,"" he said."
Market Sentiment on Bonds,Japan and China's unlikely new friendship,2024-09-14,2018-10-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45989353,"Trade tensions with Washington have driven Japan and China into an unlikely friendship. Tokyo and Beijing have long been at odds over past military confrontations and present territorial disputes.  Yet on a crucial visit to Beijing, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has now hailed a historic turning point.  The two sides are seeking to boost economic ties and regional stability including North Korea. On Friday Mr Abe met his Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang, and he is due to meet President Xi Jinping later. Usually, not that great. The countries do trade with each other but politically, things have been quite fragile at times.  Japan's World War Two occupation of parts of China remains a very emotional issue and there are several disputed islands that Tokyo and Beijing have yet to agree on.  Mr Abe's current trip to China is the first visit by a Japanese head of government in seven years. ""From competition to co-existence, Japan and China bilateral relations have entered a new phase,"" the Japanese premier told reporters in Beijing.  His Chinese counterpart echoed that sentiment saying they should ""return to a normal track"" of ""stable, sustained and healthy"" relations.  It comes at a time of escalating trade tensions between the US and most of the rest of the world. That means Washington is making it harder for other countries to export to the US market.  The Trump administration has imposed huge trade tariffs which it says are in retaliation for other countries' unfair trade practices.  While Washington's trade war is most prominently fought with China, it also targets many other countries, including Japan. Travelling with Mr Abe is a Japanese business delegation hoping to forge closer ties and boost trade.  ""Vigorous trade will bring the bonds between our people ever closer,"" Mr Abe told reporters.  Japan and China are by far Asia's largest economies and the two sides have signed a deal to maintain annual dialogue and to cooperate on innovation.  The also agreed to make it easier for their financial markets to work together and vowed to uphold free trade principles.  There are also plans for a wider regional economic partnership and a special trade zone linking up China, Japan and South Korea.  It's not all about trade though. Both sides also say they want to work to safeguard peace and stability in the region. The biggest threat to peace is widely seen as coming from North Korea, and Tokyo and Beijing have long disagreed on how to deal with the situation. China is Pyongyang's only remaining economic ally, while Japan has in the past warned against any rush to appease Pyongyang.  North Korean missiles have Japan in easy reach and a number of abducted Japanese citizens remain captives in the North. At the Beijing summit though, Mr Abe said Tokyo was ""determined"" to normalise diplomatic relations with Pyongyang if there was progress on denuclearisation and the release of Japanese citizens. "
Market Sentiment on Bonds,Japan's workplaces rethink 'drinking with the boss',2024-09-14,2019-12-18,By Virginia Harrison,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50568595,"Riku Kitamura remembers his first ""drinking party"" as a new graduate in Japan. The 28-year-old worked for a market research firm and the team would regularly socialise over drinks in the evening.   ""[At first] I did feel the pressure that I had to drink more, that I had to catch up to others. It got me quite drunk,"" he says.  Drinking with colleagues after work has long been part of Japanese culture. Nomikai, or drinking gatherings, are seen as central to building strong relationships.  But in some offices, those gatherings have become less frequent as concerns over power harassment grow. That's taking away a path many workers in Japan traditionally relied on to get to know their boss. Essentially workplace bullying, power harassment ranges from isolating an employee to physical abuse by a superior.   ""Forcing people to go to a drinking party is sometimes seen as harassment,"" says Kumiko Nemoto, professor of sociology at Kyoto University of Foreign Studies. ""In the past, it happened all the time. It was part of normal corporate culture in Japan but now it's seen as power harassment.""  The government wants to introduce rules for employers to prevent power harassment from next year. The move is part of a wider effort to stamp out harmful workplace behaviour in a country known for punishing hours and even death caused by overwork. Against this backdrop, some managers are hesitant to invite their staff to drinks after work.  Mr Kitamura says over the last three years, bosses have been clear that drinking isn't compulsory. ""Managers are afraid of a backlash,"" he says. ""I can definitely feel that the managers aren't pushing it [and] trying to avoid the risk."" Among them is 47-year-old Tats Katsuki. Mr Katsuki, a manager at a Japanese trading house, admits he doesn't ask his team to go out drinking as companies take a tougher line on harassment.  ""People are generally worried for all kinds of harassment, power harassment, sexual harassment,"" he says.  That awareness has spiked over the past five years, and individuals ""get fired all the time now for this kind of stuff,"" he says.  ""Subordinates can always anonymously email or write letters to… a complaints box. People are much more aware and prudent."" It's a far cry from the Japanese workplaces Mr Katsuki began his career in more than two decades ago.  Back then, he says there was a ""different mentality"". He'd go out drinking with colleagues in Tokyo up to four times a week.  ""Your boss would say, are you free now? Let's go. There was really no way of saying no,"" Mr Katsuki says.  The party would carry on after client dinners, sometimes into the early hours. He felt he was probably drinking too much and often battled with hangovers.  But overall, it wasn't a hardship: ""At the time I thought it was good because you get to know your bosses really well. We used to talk about work a lot but also non-work stuff… [and] get to know the other person better."" His generation came up in the workforce after Japan's economic bubble burst in the early 1990s. An era of excess and extravagance ended as a period of prolonged economic pain - known as the country's lost decade - began. The idea of a ""job for life"" started to recede and other forces, such as more part-time staff and women in the workforce, saw the culture within traditional Japanese organisations shift.  Prof Nemoto says before the bubble burst, drinking was an extension of work. But as the business environment changed, so too did expectations on staff - including around socialising with the boss.  Mr Katsuki says now workplaces in Japan are just like anywhere else in the world, with pre-planned social events like welcome dinners.  He says the amount of alcohol drunk at work functions has fallen and fewer bosses will tap their staff on the shoulder for a night out. That's due in part to fears around the perception of harassment.  Mr Katsuki's experience mirrors the shifting workplace dynamics seen elsewhere in the world that have left some unsure of the new ""rules"" on the job. He discusses this regularly with his team and has pushed to define the boundaries of what's acceptable so as not to overstep the mark.  ""People are unsure even whether they can say 'you changed your hairstyle' to a female employee. There's a lot less conversation because people are afraid of saying something… and being told that's harassment."" Yet as managers attempt to navigate the new terrain, some younger workers are feeling left out. They think the perceived risks have prompted an overreaction.  Mr Kitamura, who now works as a project manager at market research firm CarterJMRN in Tokyo, says newcomers ""feel like they aren't being invited to drink anymore"".  ""They feel excluded. Drinking is still a social tool... to really connect with your manager. They will talk to the manager and say, hey why aren't you inviting me to the drinking party?"" He says while he felt pressure as a newcomer to go to work gatherings, he enjoys drinking and wants to be included.  Parissa Haghirian, professor of international management at Sophia University, echoes that sentiment - and underlines the importance in Japan of forming social bonds over dinner and drinks.  ""People like drinking in Japan,"" she says. ""Drinking and smoking are seen as relaxing things. It doesn't have such bad connotations.""  ""The idea is we do this together, it's extremely important to be part of it."" "
Market Sentiment on Bonds,ECB says no quick end to stimulus,2024-09-14,2017-07-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40666236,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has insisted there is still a long way to go before it can call a halt to its economic stimulus programme. ECB president Mario Draghi threw cold water on speculation that the bank might wind the programme down soon. The bank is still buying 60bn euros (£53bn) of bonds a month as part of its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The ECB also kept the key interest rate for the countries that use the euro currency unchanged at 0%. Mr Draghi said: ""After a long time we are finally experiencing a robust recovery, where we only have to wait for wages and prices to follow a course towards our objective.  ""The last thing the governing council wants is an unwanted tightening and for conditions that may either slow down this process or even jeopardise it."" Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The comment on inflation which is sticking in our head is Mr Draghi's notice to markets that: 'We are not there yet.'"" However, the euro did move sharply to a 14-month high against the dollar when at one point Mr Draghi hinted that the governing council of the ECB might start discussing reducing QE in the autumn. Neil Wilson from ETX Capital commented: ""It wasn't much but the market is super-sensitive to anything from Draghi at the moment."" Last month, Mr Draghi's speech in Sintra in Portugal was interpreted by many economists as meaning the eurozone's economic recovery would allow QE to end and for interest rates to rise. Patrick O'Donnell, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said: ""This is a well-choreographed attempt by Mr Draghi to make sure that financial markets don't get ahead of themselves after his more hawkish comments of late."" The QE bond-buying programme, together with ultra-low interest rates, was designed to encourage lending and fend off the threat of deflation in the eurozone. Mr Draghi said the policy had been a success: ""We have created in the last three years six million jobs, much more than any time before the crisis in the same amount of time. ""All the economic sentiment indicators and survey indicators are either at all time highs or close to them so the policies have been successful."" However, the inflation rate in the eurozone was 1.3% in June, down slightly from 1.4% in May, some way below the ECB's target of close to, but below, 2%. Mr Draghi said: ""Measures of underlying inflation remain low and have yet to show convincing signs of a pick-up, as domestic cost pressures, including wage growth, are still subdued. Underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to rise only gradually over the medium term."" Aberdeen Asset Management's Mr O'Donnell said: ""We probably won't hear anything significant out of the ECB until September, which is plenty of time for investors to digest Mr Draghi's caveat laden hawkishness. ""Mr Draghi will be hoping that today's performance is enough to give him a quiet summer."""

And it is aiming higher for the poll on 7 June. Many here fear the growing conservatism of the current government. Under the 12-year rule of the Islamist-rooted AK Party, constitutionally-secular Turkey has fundamentally changed.

Market Sentiment on Bonds,UK economy 'vulnerable' to borrowing shock,2024-09-14,2020-03-11,By Szu Ping Chan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51836555,"A surge in public spending risks exposing the UK economy to a shock rise in borrowing costs, according to the government's spending watchdog. Abandoning long-term goals to balance the books could have consequences, the Office for Budget Responsibility said. Higher annual borrowing and overall debt would leave Britain ""vulnerable"" to changing investor sentiment. The warning came as the chancellor unveiled the biggest Budget giveaway since 1992. Rishi Sunak's first budget included an extra £7bn to support workers and businesses affected by the coronavirus and at least £5bn to help the NHS cope with the outbreak. In total he outlined £30bn of extra spending this year. But higher spending over the long-term would be likely to lead to higher borrowing, which could prompt a rise in the cost of that borrowing. A year ago, the OBR predicted the UK economy would grow by 1.4% this year. Now it says it expects it to grow at just 1.1% this year, the slowest pace since the financial crisis. That does not take into account any hit from the virus, which will slow growth further and could add an additional £6bn to the deficit over the next two years, George Buckley, chief UK economist at Nomura estimates.   The extra £12bn to battle the coronavirus was not costed in this year's Budget, he points out. Public borrowing is already forecast to climb to a six-year high by 2022 without taking into account these additional spending measures. There has been no immediate impact on the cost of government borrowing. Yields on ten year government bonds rose only marginally after the Budget as investors took the near-term planned rise in borrowing in their stride Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, said: ""Markets are not only willing to accept [higher] fiscal spending but are now actively cheering it."" However, the OBR said the government's decision to move away from trying to reduce Britain's debt in relation to the size of the economy, could store up problems for the future. The last government said it aimed to bring down public sector net debt, but it now is projected to remain steady at around 75% of GDP over the next five years. Robert Chote, the chairman of the OBR, said that while he did not see the government spending splurge as a ""gamble"", a sudden increase in inflation and interest rates would make ""the arithmetic a lot more uncomfortable."" Sir Charlie Bean, a member of the OBR's budget responsibility committee, added: ""Clearly the more debt you build up, the more exposed you are if things go wrong.  ""And there's a good general principle that you want to have the debt-to-GDP ratio declining in good times, to build up the space for responding precisely to the events like the coronavirus. ""If you only have the ambition to keep debt constant as a proportion of GDP, every time you get a bad shock, you just ratchet that up again."" Boris Johnson's government has moved away from an previous Tory ambition to eliminate borrowing this decade. In the Budget the chancellor launched a review of the government's current self-imposed spending rule, which requires it to balance the books, excluding investment spending, within three years. Public borrowing is forecast to be lower this financial year at £47.4bn than predicted last March, but after that the deficit is projected to rise sharply. The government is now set to borrow £54.8bn in the coming financial year to plug the gap between the money it spends on public services and the tax revenues it collects. This is much higher than the £40.2bn that was forecast. This will rise to £66.7bn in 2021-22. The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing. The government expects to borrow almost £100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts. And that figure does not include £12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn. Mr Sunak said a weaker global backdrop would drag down UK growth. But the OBR said it expected the economy to rebound in 2021 with the help of the big spending boost. It said growth is forecast to rise to 1.8%, before moderating to 1.5% in 2022 and 1.3% the following year. Higher growth would make it easier to reduce debt as a proportion of the overall size of the economy and make the UK less vulnerable to a shock rise in borrowing costs. However, the growth forecasts were made before the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in the UK became clear. So they do not take into account the impact of the virus, the emergency government stimulus measures, or the cut in UK interest rates announced earlier on Wednesday. Mr Sunak said the coronavirus outbreak would have a ""significant impact"" on the economy, warning that a fifth of Britain's workforce could be off work at the same time during the peak of the outbreak. But he said the extra spending and investment would provide ""security today"" and ""prosperity tomorrow"". Mr Sunak unveiled a three-point plan to tackle the coronavirus, including: Mr Sunak said the government would do ""everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure""."
Market Sentiment on Bonds,Trade war: What will China's next move be?,2024-09-14,2019-05-16,By Karishma Vaswani,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48290733,"Donald Trump's book The Art of the Deal could give you some insight into how he is negotiating with China amid the current trade war.  One of his business philosophies is called negative thinking - anticipating the worst outcome, and preparing for it.  ""I always go into the deal anticipating the worst,"" he writes. ""If you plan for the worst - if you can live with the worst - the good will always take care of itself.""  But is the US really prepared for the absolute worst China could do? In a clip from China Central Television, that's now gone viral on Chinese social media, anti-US sentiment appears to be at a peak. ""China is not willing, but not afraid, to fight"", says the presenter. ""After 5,000 years of winds and storms - what kind of hardship has the great Chinese nation not weathered?""  Looking even further back in China's history, perhaps Beijing is taking a page out of China's ancient strategic manual The Art of War.  As author Sun Tzu advises: ""If your opponent is of choleric temperament, seek to irritate him"".  Here's what could China do to ""irritate"" President Trump's arguably ""choleric temperament"" in this trade war. China is the biggest foreign holder of US government bonds, known as Treasuries, but in March stepped up its sale of these bonds to the quickest pace in two and a half years - according to data from the US Treasury department.  And Beijing could keep doing this - although it would come at a cost.  Hu Xijin, editor in chief of the Global Times which is published by the Communist Party's official mouthpiece the People's Daily, has tweeted: ""China may stop purchasing US agricultural products and energy, reduce Boeing orders and restrict US service trade with China. Many Chinese scholars are discussing the possibility of dumping US Treasuries and how to do it specifically."" But analysts say doing that would actually hurt China more.  In simple terms, if Beijing sold US Treasuries then it would drive down the US dollar - and that could potentially destabilise the US economy.  But that wouldn't be good for China in the long term. It needs a stable global economy as its economy weakens - so hurting the US in this way would, in effect, hurt China too.  Selling US Treasuries would also devalue China's holdings - effectively becoming an own goal.  China's currency is controlled, which means it's not freely traded. The central bank guides where the midpoint of the currency should be and then it trades within a narrow band around that midpoint. It has already lowered it in recent days, which analysts say is a signal to the market that China is willing to use the currency as a tool to offset the impact of US tariffs.  The weaker the Chinese currency, the less expensive its goods are in the US. In theory, this means more people will buy them, and Chinese companies won't suffer as much.  But the downside is that China's imports will become more expensive too - which will affect goods such as oil, and other raw materials that it needs to keep its economy chugging along. It's a delicate balance - and a tough position to be in.  This is one area where China could really tighten the screws on the US.  Foreign direct investment (FDI) has been a key factor driving China's economic growth - and it's also reaped dividends for the foreign companies investing in China, despite the challenging business environment.  However, Beijing could decide to make the environment even tougher.  In 2018, China was the second largest recipient of FDI in the world and a large chunk of that money came from the US, even as the trade war between the two intensified.  However, according to reports, China's National Development and Reform Council - the country's central planning agency has taken over the responsibility of deciding who will be allowed to invest in the country based on national security criteria. That's an important move, because now the council is the equivalent in some respects of the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States, (CFIUS)  - the entity tasked with evaluating which companies are security risks and which aren't.  Beijing will see the latest US moves to keep Huawei out of its markets as discriminatory - and could make it harder for American companies to get licences to operate in China, target the buying of American products as being anti-patriotic, and hold up goods at ports and customs.  Expect more American firms to see renewed scrutiny whilst investing in China.  China has consistently said it doesn't want to fight - it says it's being forced into a corner by the US.  In fact even if you drill down into the $60bn-worth of US goods that Beijing raised tariffs on this week in retaliation, the scale of the tariff increase is less than what's being reported, according to Vinesh Motwani of Silk Road Research.  In December China suspended retaliatory tariffs on vehicles and auto parts, and that suspension has remained in place. Analysts say this signals that Beijing wants to show some good faith in the lead up to the meeting between the two leaders at the G20 in Japan in June.  Still, Sun Tzu's Art of War prescribes: ""Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt."" Perhaps - if those talks in June don't go well - China is leaving room for itself to apply further pressure in the future. "
Market Sentiment on Bonds,Islamic banking post-Paris,2024-09-14,2015-12-03,Eric Barton,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20151202-how-the-terrorist-attacks-in-paris-could-affect-islamic-banking,"Will the atrocities in France change the future for Sharia-compliant banking? Islamic Financing A look at the basics rules... Islamic banking is guided by rules called Sharia law, which are based on the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. The rules forbid profiting from money lending, meaning Sharia-compliant banks often buy properties for clients and then sell them back at an increased price through monthly payments. The rules also forbid banking transactions from investing in anything harmful, generally defined as gambling, prostitution, weapons, or alcohol. Developments built with Sharia-compliant financing, for instance, cannot include bars or restaurants that serve liquor. When Daud Vicary Abdullah stood in front of a packed ballroom at the Global Insurance Symposium in the US city of Des Moines, Iowa, in May, he could feel tension filling the room. Abdullah was there to talk about a sector of money lending governed by Islamic law, in a place where Muslims are far from common. Abdullah, president and chief executive officer of the International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance (INCEIF) in Malaysia, told the crowd that the goal of Islamic financing is simple: to guarantee ethical business practices. Islamic financing, based on Sharia law, forbids Muslims from investing in projects where liquor or pork will be sold, for instance. But more importantly for banks, it also prohibits making a profit lending money, meaning most deals are asset-backed rather than interest-backed. After Abdullah spoke, hands shot up among the 400 attendees. The questions continued for so long that they ran out of time. Afterward, Abdullah had 40 or 50 people wanting to know more about Sharia law and how they could enter the industry. “People said, ‘Gosh, we thought you were going to get up there and yell “Allahu Akbar”,’ but it was really fascinating,’” Abdullah recalled. “I was, without question, nervous about getting up there, but they accepted me and the subject.” Since then, there has been terrorism in Paris — the worst attacks on the city since World War II that left 130 dead — and anti-Islam sentiment growing, casting a shadow on all things Islam. Despite this, Abdullah believes people will see beyond the current situation, and recognise that Sharia-compliant banking focuses on a higher ethical standard, something most would likely see as a good change.  “Islamic Finance is not a religious issue. It is a business decision,” said Abdullah. “There will, however, need to be a redoubling of effort to change the potential negative perceptions arising, whether they are real or not. This is an ongoing challenge, but one that the industry is used to and becoming better equipped to deal with.” In recent years, banking and related Sharia-compliant services have been among the fastest-growing segments of finance in the West. Analysts say the recent news shouldn’t change that, but they say there’s little doubt that some decision-makers in banks may now think twice about expanding into an Islam-related field. The growth factor Rarely found outside the Middle East just a decade ago, Islamic financing has found acceptance in recent years from government regulators and bankers, with big Islamic banking hubs now in London and Malaysia. In July, Germany’s first Sharia-compliant bank opened in Frankfurt. “The UK has been very good to open its arms to Islamic finance, as far as non-Muslim countries are concerned,” said Faizal Karbani, founder and CEO of London-based Simply Ethical Ltd, which helps companies adapt to Islamic law. “A decade ago, there was very little on the market that was Sharia certified, and now there are regular seminars and training and many Western banks getting into the industry.” While Muslims in many Western countries had no choice but to use traditional financing just a decade ago, the growth in Sharia-compliant banking means it’s available more widely than ever before. And in many countries, Islamic banking has grown enough that there are competing banks looking for Muslim customers. The reason is simple: bankers see opportunity in a sector once served only by Arab companies. Islamic finance has grown by 17% globally in recent years, according to analysis from Ernst & Young. By 2019, Islamic financing will have 1.8tn in assets and see profits triple, the consultancy firm estimated. That growth is in part because of the expansion into new markets but also because there’s so much liquidity in the Middle East, thanks to oil money, said Iman Abdel Khalek, director of Middle East Debt Capital Markets at Citigroup in Dubai. “There’s a growing interest in the Western world for Sharia financing as it becomes more mainstream,” Khalek said. “It’s not a market that major banks can ignore.” In the past year, banks in Hong Kong, Luxembourg, South Africa, and the UK have issued their debut Islamic bonds, said Najib Al Aswad, senior manager at Islamic Finance Advisory & Assurance Services (IFAAS), an international Islamic finance consultancy headquartered in Birmingham, UK. In Hong Kong, RHB Asset Management Sdn will soon add two more Islamic investment funds to the one it created last year. To make this happen, many countries must rewrite finance laws to allow Islamic financing or, like Malaysia, come up with a dual system to oversee banks. The Islamic banking sector in Malaysia began with just a single bank in 1969, followed by a 1983 law that allowed the expansion of the industry, and the addition of an Islamic money market in 1994. “It all starts with a political will to change financial regulations,” Al Aswad said. Whether there will be that political will now, after the attacks in France, is unclear. Among the barriers to more widespread acceptance in the West has been a lack of training offered for those who wanted to learn the rules of Islamic financing and no way for consumers to know if banks were truly compliant, Karbani said. Now, several international organisations, including Ethica Institute of Islamic Finance in Dubai and the UK-based Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, offer certification programs for banks, accounting firms, and other companies that might be looking to diversify into this sector. Uncharted territory But even as major Western banks begin to embrace it, Islamic financing remains illegal in some countries and hard to find in others. In Japan, for instance, finance laws don’t allow banks to buy a property and then sell it back to customers, as is done by many Sharia-compliant banks. In February, however, Japan’s Financial Services Agency hinted that it may begin to relax the rules to allow Sharia-compliant banking. “There is still healthy skepticism towards Sharia financing because people look at it and think that it’s a product based on faith,” Karbani said. But that may change as banks realise they’re closing off a growing segment of banking. “A lot of the growth is not guided by good sentiment but good financial thinking.” In China, HNA Group, a conglomerate with investments from aviation to tourism, is now issuing what’s believed to be the country’s first Islamic financing, offering Sharia-compliant bonds and a $150m deal to buy ships. Meanwhile, in the US, the first Islamic bank opened in 1980, but the industry there has grown little since, according to a report from the US Federal Reserve. While large banks like Citigroup offer Islamic financing, only one US bank, Michigan-based University Islamic Financial, offers Sharia-compliant services exclusively. “One of the main issues with Sharia financing is simply that it’s misunderstood,” Abdullah said. David Yerushalmi, a New York lawyer who has led a campaign in the US against Sharia-compliant financing, said the problem isn’t an understanding of the industry. He said the problem is that Sharia compliance requires a committee of experts to oversee the bank’s activities in that field, and these committees often end up with “hardcore Islamic radicals,” according to Yerushalmi. “When you look at Sharia-compliant financing, the investing public doesn’t know what it’s getting,” Yerushalmi said. “People think banks are supplying Sharia-compliant programs, but what they’re really getting is financing overseen by radicals.” After the attacks in Paris, Yerushalmi believes the Sharia-compliant financing industry will slow for a short time but will continue to grow after the initial anti-Islam sentiment passes. Standardising the rules Falling oil prices might also slow the growth of Islamic financing, Khalek warned, but a bigger issue is the debate about how to define Sharia rules. Her division is overseen by a board of three scholars that sign off on deals and provide regular audits, she said. Other banks offer far fewer guarantees. “There is certainly a lack of standardisation in considering what is, and what isn’t, Sharia compliant,” Khalek said. “But there is continued innovation in this industry.” Abdullah’s university in Kuala Lumpur, INCEIF, with 30 full-time faculty, is one such organisation looking to provide a standard set of rules for the industry. His school offers three masters and a doctorate in the practical application of Sharia rules in finance. His campus is also home to the International Shari'ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA), which hopes to align different schools and governing bodies on what defines Islamic financing. More than anything, Abdullah wants the West to embrace the idea that Islamic financing isn’t just about what’s permissible but what’s ethical. Islamic law dictates that financing ought to support only the public good, he said, meaning Sharia-compliant banks can’t use money to buy bulldozers used to destroy rainforests. “There has been a lot of trust lost in the financial system in the last few years. Sharia financing offers an alternative to this,” Abdullah said. He said he believes, “Sharia equals ethical and responsible financing.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
Market Sentiment on Bonds,Dumb money behaviour explained,2024-09-14,2014-11-03,Ari Weinberg,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20131029-dumb-money-behaviour-explained,"Harold Evensky, who leads financial planning for the firm Evensky & Katz, has long tried to protect his clients from allowing their personal psychological hang-ups to undermine sound financial decisions.   While such is the goal of most, if not all, financial planners, some of Evensky's inspiration has come from an unlikely source — a client. But not just any client. Evensky has gleaned valuable insights into behavioural economics from Nobel Prize-winning psychologist, Daniel Kahneman. Kahneman was awarded a Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002 for helping develop behavioural economics, a field of study that delves into the psychology that clouds otherwise rational economic decision-making.  In his popular writing, Kahneman, a psychologist by training, walks readers through the mental cues that help us make up our minds. When it comes to financial decisions, we can often be tricked (or trick ourselves) into believing that we are making the right choice with our money because we often base those decisions on rosy projections, past performance, linked events or even mushy things like emotion and sentiment.  But that rarely leads to smart decisions or financial gains when it comes to investments. These insights are particularly important for financial planners, who often become voices of reason when we are faced with challenging financial or economic choices.  While Evensky won’t talk about his famous client’s financial tendencies, he spoke with BBC Capital about how he incorporates teachings from behavioural economics in his own work. BBC Capital: What have you learned from Kahneman's academic discipline that either stands out to you, or that you use with your other clients?   Evensky: The first is managing expectations…to help clients understand how they handle issues in different situations. [Behavioural finance shows that] if you give someone a choice of, say, a 100% chance that they will get $800,000 or an 80% chance that they will get $1,000,000 and a 20% chance they get nothing, they take the sure thing. Turn that around, a 100% chance of losing $800,000 or an 80% chance that they lose $1,000,000 and a 20% chance of losing nothing, they gamble.  It’s exactly the same question, but it helps client’s understand the difference between being risk averse and loss averse. People are used to thinking that they don’t want to take risk. The reality is that most investors don’t want to take a risk to get rich, but they will take a risk not to get poor. This helps frame why investors need to be in stocks and not 100% bonds. There’s more risk than just the market going up or down, it’s [the risk of] not having enough money to live off of. BBC Capital: Is there any area where faulty logic like that comes up again and again? Evensky: People have significant challenges when it comes to mental accounting, or mental math. One example is dealing with linked probabilities. If you have a chain of four events, each assigned a 90% probability of occurring, the actually likelihood of your expected outcome is actually 66%. Which number are you making your decision on — 90% or 66%? Similarly, losses hurt more than gains. A client came in after the tech bust — a retired surgeon, the classic curmudgeon. He said, “I don’t get it, I was up 80% last year, but down 60% this year and I’m under water. Shouldn’t I be up 20%?” Mental math prevents you from realizing that the gain from one year and loss from the next are not on the same basis. BBC Capital: Have you found that people’s behaviour outside of their finances is reflective of how they act with money? Evensky: In our experience, there’s really no correlation. Someone may like to bungee jump, but that doesn’t mean that they wouldn’t be a conservative investor. Those deeply concerned with the high cost of medical care down the road [and the need to have money to pay for it], may be highly comfortable [with the risks in] the financial markets. And someone who’s not as concerned may be scared to death of taking risk! BBC Capital: How do you respond to a client who brings you a hot tip or investment idea? Evensky: In these cases, we utilise some of the concepts in behavioural finance, the first is framing. [I say]  “I don’t know anything about that, tell me about it.” Then we hear all of the great things that could happen to their money…and [we] probe more about what could go wrong. Then we go back through their financial plan — and look at capital needs. [Then I explain] If it works, you can take an annual cruise around the world. If it doesn’t work, you have to work three more years. This gives them completely different visions. BBC Capital: What about the biases people have around what they see as obvious — but might be wrong about? Evensky: People often confuse certainty and safety. If they tell me “I don’t want to take risk,” I say “Go bury [your cash] in the backyard, but let’s look at the consequences to your life style.” Don’t trust social security? Then keep working. There are consequences to conservative decisions that might make them anything but conservative [choices]. BBC Capital: How do you get people to focus on decisions that are decades away, like their estate? Evensky:  [The sentiment is:] ‘Who needs it? I’m not going to live that long.’ What they forget is that it’s not just about the probability. If you start giving everything away and don’t die early, you’re stuck. Like everything, there has to be a balance. If they want to give away a lot of money to avoid taxes down the road, we’ll walk them back. If you have enough money to do everything you want to do, that’s fine, but don’t take the risk of going overboard to avoid taxes when you’re dead and then not be dead.

Market Sentiment on Bonds,The films redefining the US,2024-09-14,2021-04-19,Caryn James,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210415-the-films-redefining-the-american-experience,"From Nomadland to Minari, the films dominating the Oscars this year are a clutch of powerful social dramas that are helping to redefine the US. Caryn James assesses this shift. Former political radicals, the economically dispossessed and beleaguered immigrants are the faces at the centre of this year's dynamic Oscar frontrunners – an unexpected silver lining to an awards season upended by the pandemic. Conventional wisdom says that during times of crisis, such as the Great Depression, moviegoers want escapism. But almost all the franchise-action movies set for 2020 were delayed, and among the few big-budget films that arrived even Tenet and Wonder Woman 1984 fizzled out. Instead, the year has given us powerful social dramas that redefine the American experience with clear-eyed, 21st Century realism. Among the best picture nominees, Judas and the Black Messiah and The Trial of the Chicago 7 look back to the 1960s and flip the narrative: Black Power and anti-war activists vilified by the mainstream then are today's screen heroes. Nomadland and Minari challenge the myths of the American Dream itself, with its promise of a welcoming country full of economic opportunity. These films offer a recognisable version of the US today, and their embrace by Oscar voters suggests how prevalent those views have become.  More like this: - Eight of the best films of 2021 so far - Chadwick Boseman: A film icon who changed Hollywood - Is Tom Hanks part of a dying breed of genuine movie stars? Judas and the Black Messiah reframes The Black Panther Party, once seen as a danger to society and now more likely to be viewed as the forerunner of today's racial justice movement. Fact-based, and one of the year's most effective and passionate films, it is set in 1969, when Chicago police, sent by the FBI, murdered Fred Hampton, chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Panthers. Daniel Kaluuya is favoured to win best supporting actor for his fiery performance as Hampton, with co-star LaKeith Stanfield nominated in the same category for playing a small-time crook who infiltrates the Panthers for the government. The film portrays Hampton as a sensitive individual and a dynamic speaker, willing to give his life for a revolution that will give power to the people. The unmistakable villain is FBI director J Edgar Hoover (Martin Sheen), who for decades was lionised by mainstream America. ""The Black Panthers are the single biggest threat to our national security,"" Hoover says on screen, as he did in real life, in almost those exact words. The FBI, he says, must ""prevent the rise"" of a Black Messiah. With crowds chanting, ""Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!"" at Hampton's speeches, Kaluuya captures the character's messianic appeal.  The film doesn't ignore the Panthers' justification of violence as a path to social justice. ""Political power flows from the barrel of a gun,"" Hampton tells a crowd of followers. Judas doesn't examine that attitude too closely, either, but one thing is clear: all the gunfire and the murders on screen are instigated by the FBI or the police, confirming the screen Hampton's label for them as ""bloodthirsty murderous pigs."" That theme of police violence makes the film timelier than ever in the US today. The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a slick Hollywood film, less artfully done than Judas, but it similarly brings a contemporary attitude to its real-life, once-denounced heroes. They were put on trial in 1969, accused of inciting a riot because they had protested on the streets during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Aaron Sorkin, who is nominated for writing the screenplay, also directed, and he often focuses on the conflict among the radicals. Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), the thoughtful, polished leader of SDS (Students for a Democratic Society) argues about strategy with the calculatedly clownish Yippie, Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen, nominated for supporting actor). But their common enemy is the wrong-headed government. In court, the judge is biased and sometimes addled, as he was in life. During flashbacks to the street demonstrations, the Chicago police are corrupt and brutal, cracking protestors' heads and dragging them on the ground. Sorkin himself has called attention to how drastically attitudes have changed since that period, saying in one news interview, ""The Chicago 7 were called un-American, unpatriotic... Today it's widely accepted that the protests they led and the thousands of others who protested with them hastened the end of this disastrous war."" That idea has become so prevalent that The Trial of the Chicago 7 stands as an easy Oscar choice, benign and safe in its political assumptions as well as its filmmaking. Nominees in other categories examine the difference between the US's past and the present, which may be only marginally better, because being aware of a problem doesn't fix it. In Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, the blues singer of the title (Viola Davis, nominated for best actress) fights a racist industry in the 1920s and the late Chadwick Boseman (frontrunner to win best actor) plays a musician struggling with memories of a violent racist attack. In One Night in Miami, four iconic black men in 1964 argue about the best way to use their fame to fight racism. Leslie Odom Jr is nominated for the supporting actor Oscar for his role as the singer Sam Cooke, but it's the radical Malcolm X (Kingsley Ben-Adir), whose real-life reputation has been burnished over time, who expresses the unjust-government theme. The fictional Malcom says of his FBI tail, ""Hoover's lackeys have been following me so long they know where I'm going to be before I do."" The American Dream has long included the concept of the United States as a place with economic opportunities for all. Nomadland shows how outdated that notion is in today's insecure economy, as it captures the harsh reality of ageing and barely getting by. The central character, Fern (Frances McDormand, a frontrunner for best actress), takes to the road after a factory shutdown decimates her town in 2011. Living in her van, she picks up temporary jobs at an Amazon warehouse and as a janitor at a National Park. Chloé Zhao, who it is widely assumed will win the best director Oscar, surrounds McDormand with real-life nomads playing versions of themselves, let down by a cratering economy and a wobbly government support system. One of them, Linda May, complains that her social security retirement benefit is an unliveable $550 (£400) a month after having worked for decades.  As beautifully made and eloquent as Nomadland is, at times it sugar-coats the problems it points to. The fictional characters, Fern and her friend Dave (David Strathairn), have families willing to take them in. Unlike so many people without resources, they choose whether to stay on the road. Still, Nomadland is so resonant with real-life issues that it has evoked complaints about its depiction of Amazon, considered too kind in light of some workers' complaints about conditions. Zhao has addressed the problem more forcefully off screen than on. ""It's so simplistic to say Amazon is the ultimate evil"", she said in an interview with Deadline. With or without that giant company, the nomads ""still don't have enough social security. Their pensions are gone."" The idea of a comfortable retirement built on hard work has felt increasingly archaic over the last few decades, but now truly, it is only a fantasy for many, as Nomadland tells us. Minari layers that economic idealism with the bedrock concept of the US as a country that welcomes immigrants. Steven Yeun (nominated for best actor) brings quiet strength and nuance to the role of a Korean-American father who moves with his wife and two children from California to a small farm they've bought in Arkansas. The film is so intimate and pertinent that it's easy to forget it is set in the 1980s. But that period setting highlights how much the country has changed. The dream of prosperity, the rugged individualism of a small farmer who would rather struggle on his own than settle for a decently-paid job with no future, is deeply ingrained in the American myth. The crops may wither as the well runs dry, but the family perseveres in its new life. It was easier to believe in that goal in the past, though. The idea has certainly faltered since the great recession of 2008. Lee Isaac Chung, nominated for best director and original screenplay, handles the immigrants' perspective with first-hand knowledge and complexity. The wife wonders if they should live among other Koreans, giving them a sense of community. The husband is more keen to leave their roots behind, but he grows Korean vegetables, a choice that binds him to home and is also a savvy way to fill a gap in the market. Immigration today includes preserving cultural identity, no longer the ""melting pot"" ideal of assimilation that dominated the 19th and 20th centuries. But those 1980s characters in Minari don't encounter anything like the discrimination or hostility so many immigrants do today, are not called foreigners or worse. Overt bias is only evident in one scene, when children blurt out racial remarks to the Korean siblings. In reality, the film lands in an era fraught with anti-immigrant sentiment around the world, and a recent wave of anti-Asian attacks, physical and verbal, in the US. The dissonance between what is on-screen and off makes a jolting point about the present.   The film also found itself in a mini tempest when the Golden Globe nominations were announced. Minari was in the foreign language film category (eventually winning the prize) and as a result was ineligible for a best picture nomination, even though it was produced and shot in the US. The backlash against the categorization was swift. In a tweet, actor Daniel Dae Kim called the nomination ""The film equivalent of being told to go back to your own country when that country is actually America."" It also received a Bafta nomination for Film not in the English language. Although the characters speak Korean more often than English, the film's identity goes far deeper than language. Minari is profoundly American, from its story of hopeful immigrants to the way it intersects with a reality harsher than what we see in such lovely detail on screen. The film is emblematic of a year in which movies have redefined the American story itself, with its ideals, its awareness of how much some of them have been tarnished, and its wonderfully persistent optimism about the future.

Market Sentiment on Bonds,Where young people are getting richer,2024-09-14,2018-07-10,Maddy Savage,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180709-unlike-most-millennials-norways-are-rich,"Young Norwegians have enjoyed a 13% rise in disposable household income, bucking a downward trend in other strong economies. Will this golden age last? Young people across the western world are on track to become the first generation to grow up poorer than their parents. So how are millennials in just one country bucking this trend? It’s old news that university debts and rocketing housing costs are common concerns for people born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s, living in the US, the UK and many other countries. Multiple studies suggest this group will be the first in recorded history to end up poorer than those which came before. But perhaps this doesn’t have to be a foregone conclusion. In Europe’s northernmost country, things are decidedly different. Best known for its Viking history, snow sports and jaw-dropping fjords, Norway is making a new name for itself as the only major economy in Europe where young people are getting markedly richer. People in their early thirties in Norway have an average annual disposable household income of around 460,000 kroner (around $56,200). Young Norwegians have enjoyed a 13% rise in disposable household income in real terms compared to Generation X (those born between 1966 and 1980) when they were the same age. These startling figures come from the largest comparative wealth data set in the world, the Luxembourg Income Database, and were analysed in a recent report on generational incomes for the UK Think Tank The Resolution Foundation. Compare this with young people in other strong economies: US millennials have experienced a 5% dip, in Germany it’s a 9% drop. For those living in southern Europe (the southern Eurozone suffered the brunt of the global economic crisis in 2008), disposable incomes have plunged by as much as 30%. Norway’s youth unemployment rate (among 15- to 29-year-olds) is also relatively low at 9.4% compared to an OECD average of 13.9%. ‘A lucky situation’ On a rare scorching day in the Norwegian capital Oslo, it’s not difficult to find young locals who embody the country’s good fortunes. “I don’t really think about how I spend my money,” says Aleksander Aarnes, a 25-year-old graduate. “I go to the theatre about once a month, go to the cinema once a month. I can go out and eat and drink with friends... I go on vacation (holiday).” Aarnes is pursuing a career writing for musical theatre, but is yet to earn anything for his efforts, so he funds his lifestyle by working just one or two shifts a week in a supermarket in Korsvoll, a sleepy suburb dotted with large detached pastel-coloured wooden houses. He shares an apartment with a friend in another suburb about a 20-minute bus ride from the city centre. “I’m really aware of the lucky situation I am in... I don’t have to sacrifice too much to pursue the career I want,” he says. Aarnes’ hourly pay starts at 164 Norwegian kroner (around $20), increasing for weekend and evening shifts. After taxes (which are comparatively high in Scandinavia) he’s left with around 14,000 kroner ($1700) a month, of which he sets aside half for rent, travel and bills and uses the rest for “whatever else” he likes. Further down the road in Korsvoll, a 31-year-old business analyst called Øystein is packing his BMW with supplies for a barbecue. He doesn’t want to share his full name, arguing that “even though Norway is rich, people don’t really want to talk about how rich they are personally.” But he admits he earnt enough to buy a two-bedroom apartment on the waterfront when he was 27 and regularly goes on holiday to the US and Asia.   What’s Norway doing differently? A huge part of young Norwegians’ fantastic lifestyle is down to the country’s rapid economic growth. After seeing the biggest increase in average earnings of any large high-income economy between 1980 and 2013, it now leads multiple global rankings for wealth and wellbeing. It weathered the global recession well. Last year it came top of the 2017 Legatum Prosperity Index, which analyses 110 countries around the world. Norway’s huge oil and gas sector is the clear driving factor behind the nation’s economic boom over the last three decades, following major discoveries in the North Sea (although falling energy prices in recent years have had an impact). But as Hilde Bjørnland, an economics professor based at BI Norwegian Business school in Oslo explains, it is not just how much money Norway makes that’s significant, but what it does with it. “It has managed the oil [money] well in that it is saving, and using a portion of that to put back into society,” she says. “So rather than a few getting a lot, many people have access to this wealth.” Norway has done this by storing its money in the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. In simple terms, this is a giant savings pot which makes money by investing in more than 9000 companies. It is currently worth around $1 trillion. In spite of this savings pot, taxes are kept high and the country has a compressed wage structure, which means minimum salaries are negotiated by unions. “Young people and people in lower-paid industries have [experienced] the growth rates in their wages each year... and the differences between those who earn a little and those who earn a lot are not so large as in other countries,” says Bjørnland. The Resolution Foundation’s report on generational income concludes that rising inequality has been a core factor in driving down disposable incomes for millennials in other strong economies such as the US, UK and Germany. In these countries, where there are wider wage bands, young people bear the brunt of a lack of pay growth and job mobility. By contrast, Bjørnland argues that an egalitarian approach – distributing wealth between generations – has contributed to strong life satisfaction and a lack of social unrest in Norway. High welfare payments and heavily subsidised health care also help when it comes to pitting Norwegian millennials' prospects against those elsewhere in Europe. Unemployment benefits are generous: allowing many people to claim around 60% of their previous salary for two years, while they are looking for new work. As in all the Nordic countries, low childcare costs and a general parental leave system also ensure a high participation of women in the workforce. Free education at most schools and public universities and easy access to loans (which borrowers don’t pay interest on while they are studying) alongside high employment rates for students are also part of the jigsaw. “It’s a significant factor that while young people are studying, they’re able to have a job on the side,” says Bjørnland, who adds that this kind of casual work can often bring in a higher income for young people in Norway than those in other western countries. Her sentiment is shared by many of the throngs of students cooling off in the Åkerselva river just a few metres from the shiny glass buildings that dominate the business school’s campus. “It’s not that difficult to find a job here and they’re always really well-paid. So it helps a lot, to cover your leisure life and your studies,” says Gabriella Sanzana, a 27-year-old from Chile, who’s doing a master’s in human rights while working part-time as a waitress. “I have to pay a lot of taxes, but I don’t really care, because I know that [the state] gives you so many things at the same time.” A secure future? Despite Norway’s glowing CV, there are concerns about sustaining its success. High youth employment is declining, according to Investing in Youth: Norway, a recent OECD report, which states that the number of job opportunities for 15 to 29-year-olds doesn’t match up with the amount needed for a swelling youth population, which rose by 18% between 2007 and 2016. Immigration accounted for over four-fifths of this increase and unemployment among Norway’s foreign-born population is currently around 10%. Kristian Heggebø, a senior researcher at the Centre for Labour and Welfare Research at Oslo Metropolitan University, argues that while well-educated international students and labour migrants from elsewhere in Europe “tend to do well on the jobs market,” there are persistently high levels of “labour market discrimination against ethnic minorities.” “To some extent it could be [because of] a lack of qualifications, but there is no doubt in my mind that the issue is on the demand side and not the supply side,” he says. Heggebø argues that there is “firm empirical evidence” which demonstrates that despite rising immigration over the past two decades, many Norwegian employers are still “sceptical towards hiring someone with a non-Norwegian background.” Even second generation immigrants born and educated in a Nordic country can end up struggling to gain access to the labour market, he says, suggesting that anonymous CVs in the first stages of recruitment could be a crucial part of the solution. Fragmented society Preparing to catch the train home after a day in the sweltering city centre, Ove George, who’s from Nigeria and is currently unemployed, says he believes networking is often the key to getting work in Norway, something that can be tricky for foreigners without Norwegian connections. “The last job I got was through a Norwegian friend I had, and after that I haven’t really got a good job,” he explains. Also at the station is 19-year-old Djibouti-born Kayad Mahammed, who currently works for a media company. He says he’s “not struggling” and personally found it “easy” to get a job. But he adds that he believes “it’s hard to get rich” for many immigrants, who can wind up clinging onto entry-level jobs for fear of ending up unemployed again. Meanwhile, despite the Scandinavian country’s pride over its egalitarianism, there are signs inequality is rising within the wider population, too. OECD figures suggest that the share of Norwegians earning less than half the national average income was 8.1% in 2015, up from 6.9% in 2004, with young people more at risk than any other group. (Although, put this into context, this is still low by global standards – the proportion in the US is 16.8% and 10.9% in the UK.) Those who end up outside of employment, training or education altogether can often feel more vulnerable in Norway than they might in other countries, argues Sebastian Königs, one of the authors of the OECD’s Investing in Youth: Norway report. “For the young Norwegians who are disadvantaged and have social issues, finding their spot in society can be much harder,” he says. “Because generally speaking everyone is doing so well in society, this becomes a stigma.” This cohort is six times more likely to feel depressed than other young Norwegians, nine times as likely to suffer from poor health and more at risk of remaining outside the labour market for the long term, according to OECD figures. The price of success According to Bjørnland, even the wealthiest Norwegians should be wary of its fragility moving forward. “You’re used to having a good time, you’re used to taking long weekends... if you’ve had it like this for a long time you take it for granted,” she says. “But things which have happened in the past might not happen again.” She argues that Norway needs to work harder to diversify its industries in order to remain competitive in future. This might include expanding its technology, raw material and renewable energy sectors, all alongside an emerging start-up scene. It has grown quickly in recent years but still lags behind its Nordic neighbours. Employers will also have to be more open to attracting international talent to fill the jobs created outside its oil and gas sector, she suggests. On the other hand, young Norwegians “used to being able to work wherever they like” may need to become increasingly “focused on where the skills are needed” in order to maintain the same standard of living as millennials entering the workforce today. Solutions? Despite Norway’s current challenges, many experts believe that there is still a huge amount that other nations can learn. At the OECD, Sebastian Königs cites much closer links between education, employment and social services than in most other countries as an effective way of supporting young people in the early stages of their careers. Every Norwegian school leaver gets a personal follow-up phone call to discuss their options if they don’t enter the employment market or pursue further studies, for example. He argues that while Norway’s population is just 5.1 million, larger nations could still replicate these policies if they wanted to. “This isn’t about the size of the country, this is about how much resources you’re willing to invest in it... Norway perceives this to be a central priority, and it should be.” Meanwhile, Kristian Heggebø says he believes that even if oil is taken “totally out of the equation” and Norway is forced to reshape its economy in the future, it will continue to prosper as a result of its egalitarian approach and safety net for young people. “If we keep these components in place then I’m willing to bet everything that I own that we will still be performing at a very, very high level compared to other European countries, simply because we have a way [to deal with] difficulties that is more humane.”"
Market Sentiment on Bonds,How the Plague made the rich richer,2024-09-14,2020-07-02,"Eleanor Russell, University of Cambridge and Martin Parker, University of Bristol",https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200701-how-the-black-death-make-the-rich-richer,"When a third of Europe’s population was lost, wealth concentrated into tiny groups. Could Covid-19 trigger something similar? This article originally appeared on The Conversation, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence. In June 1348, people in England began reporting mysterious symptoms. They started off as mild and vague: headaches, aches, and nausea. This was followed by painful black lumps, or buboes, growing in the armpits and groin, which gave the disease its name: bubonic plague. The last stage was a high fever, and then death. Originating in Central Asia, soldiers and caravans had brought bubonic plague – Yersina pestis, a bacterium carried on fleas that lived on rats – to ports on the Black Sea. The highly commercialised world of the Mediterranean ensured the plague’s swift transfer on merchant ships to Italy, and then across Europe. The Black Death killed between a third and a half of the population of Europe and the Near East. This huge number of deaths was accompanied by general economic devastation. With a third of the workforce dead, the crops could not be harvested and communities fell apart. One in ten villages in England (and in Tuscany and other regions) were lost and never re-founded. Houses fell into the ground and were covered by grass and earth, leaving only the church behind. If you ever see a church or chapel all alone in a field, you are probably looking at the last remains of one of Europe’s lost villages. The traumatic experience of the Black Death, which killed perhaps 80% of those who caught it, drove many people to write in an attempt to make sense of what they had lived through. In Aberdeen, John of Fordun, a Scottish chronicler, recorded that: This sickness befell people everywhere, but especially the middling and lower classes, rarely the great. It generated such horror that children did not dare to visit their dying parents, nor parents their children, but fled for fear of contagion as if from leprosy or a serpent. These lines could almost have been written today. Although the death rate from Covid-19 is far lower than that of the Black Death, the economic fallout has been severe due to the globalised, highly-integrated nature of modern economies. Add to this our highly mobile populations today and coronavirus, unlike the plague, has spread across the globe in a matter of months, not years. While the Black Death resulted in short term economic damage, the longer-term consequences were less obvious. Before the plague erupted, several centuries of population growth had produced a labour surplus, which was abruptly replaced with a labour shortage when many serfs and free peasants died. Historians have argued that this labour shortage allowed those peasants that survived the pandemic to demand better pay or to seek employment elsewhere. Despite government resistance, serfdom and the feudal system itself were ultimately eroded. But another less often remarked consequence of the Black Death was the rise of wealthy entrepreneurs and business-government links. Although the Black Death caused short-term losses for Europe’s largest companies, in the long term, they concentrated their assets and gained a greater share of the market and influence with governments. This has strong parallels with the current situation in many countries across the world. While small companies rely upon government support to prevent them collapsing, many others – mainly the much larger ones involved in home delivery – are profiting handsomely from the new trading conditions. The mid-14th Century economy is too removed from the size, speed, and interconnectedness of the modern market to give exact comparisons. But we can certainly see parallels with the way that the Black Death strengthened the power of the state and accelerated the domination of key markets by a handful of large companies. Black Death business The sudden loss of at least a third of Europe’s population led to a redistribution of wealth for everyone else. In the longer term, however, people responded to the devastation by keeping money within the family. Wills became highly specific and wealthy businessmen, in particular, went to great lengths to ensure that their patrimony was no longer divided up after death, replacing the previous tendency to leave a third of all their resources to charity. Their descendants benefited from a continued concentration of capital into a smaller and smaller number of hands. At the same time, the decline of feudalism and the rise of a wage-based economy following peasant demands for better labour conditions benefited urban elites. Being paid in cash, rather than in kind (in the granting of privileges such as the right to collect firewood), meant that peasants had more money to spend in towns. This concentration of wealth greatly accelerated a pre-existing trend: the emergence of merchant entrepreneurs who combined trade in goods with their production on a scale only available to those with significant sums of capital. For example, silk, once imported from Asia and Byzantium, was now being produced in Europe. Wealthy Italian merchants began to open silk and cloth workshops. These entrepreneurs were uniquely positioned to respond to the sudden labour shortage caused by the Black Death. Unlike independent weavers, who lacked the capital, and unlike aristocrats, whose wealth was locked up in land, urban entrepreneurs were able to use their liquid capital to invest in new technologies, compensating for the loss of workers with machines. In southern Germany, which became one of Europe’s most commercialised areas in the late 14th and 15th centuries, companies such as the Welser (which later ran Venezuela as a private colony) combined growing flax with owning the looms on which workers span that flax into linen cloth, which the Welser then sold. The broad trend of the post-Black Death 14th and 15th centuries was a concentration of resources – capital, skills, and infrastructure – into the hands of a small number of large companies. The age of Amazon Rolling forward to the present, there are some clear similarities. Certain large organisations have stepped up to the opportunities provided by Covid-19. In many countries across the world, entire ecologies of small restaurants, pubs and shops have suddenly been closed down. The market for food, general retail and entertainment has gone online, and cash has pretty much disappeared. The percentage of calories that restaurants provided has had to be rerouted through supermarkets, and much of this supply has now been taken up by supermarket chains. They have plenty of large properties and lots of staff, with the HR capacity to recruit more rapidly, and there are many underemployed people who now want jobs. They also have warehouses, trucks and complex logistics capacity. The other big winner has been the giants of online retail – such as Amazon, who run a “Prime Pantry” service in the US, India and many European countries. High street shops have been suffering from price and convenience competition from the internet for years, and bankruptcies are regular news. Now, much “non-essential” retail space is closed, and our desires have been re-rerouted through Amazon, eBay, Argos, Screwfix and others. There has been a clear spike in online shopping, and retail analysts are wondering whether this is a decisive move into the virtual world, and the further dominance of big companies. Keeping us distracted as we wait at home for our parcels is the streaming entertainment industry – a market sector which is dominated by large companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime (again), Disney and others. Other online giants such as Google (which owns YouTube), Facebook (which owns Instagram) and Twitter provide the other platforms that dominate online traffic. The final link in the chain is the delivery companies themselves: UPS, FedEx, Amazon Logistics (again), as well as food delivery from Just Eat and Deliveroo. Through their business models are different, their platforms now dominate the movements of products of all kinds, whether your new Toshiba branded Amazon Fire TV, or your stuffed crust from Pizza Hut (a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, which also owns KFC, Taco Bell and others). The other swing to corporate dominance has been the move away from state-backed cash towards contactless payment services. It’s obviously a corollary of online marketplaces, but also means that the money moves though large companies that take their slice for moving it. Visa and Mastercard are the largest players, but Apple Pay, PayPal, and Amazon Pay (again) have all seen increases in their transaction volume as cash sits unused in people’s purses. And if cash is still imagined to be a vector for transmission, then retailers won’t take it and customers won’t use it. Small business has taken a really decisive hit across a wide range of sectors as Covid-19, like the Black Death, results in big companies gaining market share. Even those working at home to write pieces like this are working on Skype (owned by Microsoft), Zoom and BlueJeans, as well using email clients and laptops made by a small number of global organisations. Billionaires are getting richer while ordinary people lose their jobs. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s CEO, has increased his wealth by US$25 billion since the start of the year. But this is not the whole story. The other big trend in the response to the virus has been the strengthening of the power of the state. Governing pandemics At a state level, the Black Death caused the acceleration of trends towards centralisation, the growth of taxation, and government dependence upon large companies. In England, the declining value of land and consequent falls in revenue prompted the crown – the country’s biggest landowner – to attempt to cap wages at pre-plague levels with the 1351 Statute of Labourers, and to impose additional taxes upon the populace. Previously, the government was expected to fund itself, only imposing taxes for extraordinary expenses such as wars. But the post-plague taxes set a major precedent for government intervention in the economy. These governmental efforts were a significant increase in the crown’s involvement in people’s daily lives. In subsequent plague outbreaks, which occurred every 20 years or so, movement began to be restricted through curfews, travel bans, and quarantines. This was part of a general concentration of state power and the replacement of the previous regional distribution of authority with a centralised bureaucracy. Many of the men running the post-plague administration, such as the poet Geoffrey Chaucer, were drawn from English merchant families, some of which gained significant political power. The most outstanding example of this was the de la Pole family, who in two generations went from being Hull wool merchants to earls of Suffolk. With the temporary collapse of international trade and finance after the Black Death, Richard de la Pole became the crown’s greatest lender and an intimate of Richard II. When Italian mega-companies re-emerged in the late 14th and 15th Centuries, they also benefited from the crown’s ever-growing reliance upon merchant companies. The Medici family, who eventually came to rule Florence, are the most striking example. Merchants also gained political influence by purchasing land, the price of which had fallen after the Black Death. Land ownership allowed merchants to enter the land-based gentry or even the aristocracy, marrying their children to the sons and daughters of cash-strapped lords. With their new status, and with the help of influential in-laws, the urban elites gained political representation within parliament. By the end of the 14th Century, the government’s extension of state control and its continued ties to merchant companies drove many nobles to turn against Richard II. They transferred their allegiance to his cousin, who became Henry IV, in the (vain) hope that he would not follow Richard’s policies. This, and the subsequent Wars of the Roses, generally depicted as a clash between the Yorkists and the Lancastrians, were actually partly driven by the nobility’s hostility towards the centralisation of government power. Henry Tudor’s defeat of Richard III in 1485 ended not only the war but also quashed any further attempts by the English baronage to regain regional authority, paving the way for the continued rise of companies and central government. The state we are in The power of the state is something that we largely assume in the 21st Century. Across the world, the idea of the sovereign nation has been central to the imperial politics and economy of the last few centuries. But from the 1970s onwards, it became common among intellectuals to suggest that the state was less important, its monopoly of control within a given territory contested by multinational corporations. In 2016, of the largest 100 economic entities, 31 were countries and 69 were companies. Walmart was larger than the economy of Spain, Toyota larger than India. The capacity of these large companies to influence politicians and regulators has been clear enough: consider the effects of oil companies on climate change denial. And since Margaret Thatcher, prime minister of the UK from 1979 to 1990, pronounced that she intended to “roll back the state”, more and more parts of previously state-owned assets now operate as companies, or as players in state engineered quasi-markets. Roughly 25% of the UK’s National Health Service, for example, is delivered through contracts with the private sector. Across the globe, transport, utilities, telecommunications, dentists, opticians, the post office and many other services used to be state monopolies and are now run by profit-making companies. Nationalised, or state owned, industries are often described as slow, and in need of market discipline in order to become more modern and efficient. But thanks to coronavirus, the state has come rolling back in again like a tsunami. Spending on a level which was mocked as “magic money tree” economics only a few months ago has been aimed at national health systems, addressed the problem of homelessness, provided universal basic income for millions of people, and offered loan guarantees or direct payments to a host of businesses. This is Keynesian economics on a grand scale, in which national bonds are used to borrow money backed by future income from taxpayers. Ideas about balancing the budget appear to, for now, be history, with entire industries now being reliant on treasury bailouts. Politicians the world over have suddenly become interventionist, with wartime metaphors being used to justify gigantic spending. Less often remarked is the astonishing restriction on personal freedoms. The autonomy of the individual is central to neoliberal ideas. “Freedom loving peoples” are contrasted with those who live their lives under the yoke of tyranny, of states that exercise Big Brother surveillance powers over their citizens behaviour. Yet in the last few months, states around the world have effectively restricted movement for the vast majority of people and are using the police and armed forces to prevent assembly in public and private spaces. Theatres, pubs and restaurants are closed by fiat, parks have been locked, and sitting on benches can get you a fine. Running too close to someone will get you shouted at by someone in a high vis vest. A medieval king would have been impressed with this level of authoritarianism. The pandemic seems to have allowed the fiscal and administrative powers of big government to bulldozer arguments about prudence and liberty. The state’s power is now being exercised in ways that haven’t been seen since the second world war, and there has been widespread public support. Popular resistance To return to the Black Death, the growth in wealth and influence of merchants and big business seriously aggravated existing anti-mercantile sentiment. Medieval thought – both intellectual and popular – held that trade was morally suspect and that merchants, especially wealthy ones, were prone to avarice. The Black Death was widely interpreted as a punishment from God for Europe’s sinfulness, and many post-plague writers blamed the church, governments, and wealthy companies for Christendom’s moral decline. William Langland’s famous protest poem Piers Plowman was strongly anti-mercantilist. Other works, such as the mid-15th Century poem the Libelle of Englysche Polycye, tolerated trade but wanted it in the hands of English merchants and out of the control of Italians, whom the author argued impoverished the country. As the 14th and 15th Centuries progressed and large companies gained a greater share of the market, popular and intellectual hostility grew. In the longer term, this was to have incendiary results. By the 16th Century, the concentration of trade and finance into the hands of large companies had evolved into a near-monopoly upon royal and papal banking by a small number of companies who also held monopolies or near-monopolies over Europe’s major commodities – such as silver, copper, and mercury – and imports from Asia and the Americas, especially spices. Martin Luther was incensed by this concentration and especially the Catholic Church’s use of monopolistic firms to collect indulgences. In 1524, Luther published a tract arguing that trade should be for the common (German) good and that merchants should not charge high prices. Along with other Protestant writers, such as Philip Melancthon and Ulrich von Hutten, Luther drew upon existing anti-mercantile sentiment to criticise the influence of business over government, adding financial injustice to their call for religious reform. The sociologist Max Weber famously associated Protestantism with the emergence of capitalism and modern economic thought. But early Protestant writers opposed monopolistic companies and the commercialisation of everyday life, drawing upon anti-mercantile sentiment that had its roots in the Black Death. This popular and religious opposition eventually led to the break from Rome and the transformation of Europe. Is small always beautiful? By the 21st Century we have become used to the idea that capitalist firms produce concentrations of wealth. Whether Victorian industrialists, US robber barons or dot com billionaires, the inequalities generated by business and its corrupting influence over governments have shaped discussion of commerce since the industrial revolution. For critics, big business has often been characterised as heartless, a behemoth that crushes ordinary people in the wheels of its machines, or vampirically extracts the profits of labour from the labouring classes. As we have seen, the arguments between small business localists and those who favour corporations and the power of the state date back many centuries. Romantic poets and radicals bemoaned the way that the “dark satanic mills” were destroying the countryside and producing people who were no more than appendages to machines. The idea that the honest craftsman was being replaced by the alienated employee, a wage slave, is common to both nostalgic and progressive critics of early capitalism. By the 1960s, the idea that there was some fundamental difference between small and large forms of business added environmentalism to these longstanding arguments. “The man” in his skyscraper was opposed to the more authentic artisan. This faith in local business combined with a suspicion of corporations and the state have flowed into the green, Occupy and Extinction Rebellion movements. Eating local food, using local money, and trying to tilt the purchasing power of “anchor institutions” like hospitals and universities towards small social enterprises has become the common sense of many contemporary economic activists. But the Covid-19 crisis questions this small is good, big is bad dichotomy in some very fundamental ways. Large scale organising has appeared to be necessary to deal with the huge range of issues that the virus has thrown up, and the states that appear to have been most successful are those which have adopted the most interventionist forms of surveillance and control. Even the most ardent post-capitalist would have to admit that small social enterprises could not fit out a gigantic hospital in a few weeks. And though there are plenty of examples of local businesses engaging in food delivery, and a commendable amount of mutual aid taking place, the population of the global north is largely being fed by large supermarket chains with complex logistics operations. After coronavirus The long-term result of the Black Death was the strengthening of the power of big business and the state. The same processes are happening much more rapidly during the coronavirus lockdown. But we should be cautious of easy historical lessons. History never really repeats itself. The circumstances of each time are unique, and it simply isn’t wise to treat the “lesson” of history as if it were a series of experiments that prove certain general laws. And Covid-19 will not kill a third of any population, so though its effects are profound, they will not result in the same shortage of working people. If anything, it has actually strengthened the power of employers. The most profound difference is that the virus comes in the middle of another crisis, that of climate change. There is a real danger that the policy of bouncing back to a growth economy will simply overwhelm the necessity of reducing carbon emissions. This is the nightmare scenario, one in which Covid-19 is just a prequel to something much worse. But the huge mobilisations of people and money which governments and large companies have deployed also shows that big organisations can reshape themselves and the world extraordinarily rapidly if they wish. This gives real grounds for optimism concerning our collective capacity to re-engineer energy production, transport, food systems and much else – the green new deal which many policy makers have been sponsoring. The Black Death and Covid-19 seem to have both caused concentration and centralisation of business and state power. That is interesting to note. But the biggest question is whether these potent forces can be aimed at the crisis to come.

Market Sentiment on Bonds,The teenage gamers earning six figures,2024-09-14,2018-03-23,Bryan Lufkin,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180323-how-video-games-make-some-teens-millionaires,"From making their own games, to broadcasting live online, to playing professionally in packed stadiums – how entrepreneurs in their teens and twenties earn a living on video games. Alex Balfanz is an 18-year-old student at Duke University in North Carolina. Every day he has lectures or seminars, followed by assignments. Like many students his age, he devotes a couple of hours per day, and many more at weekends, to video games. But he’s not just playing them – he’s making them. And making a lot of money doing it. “In the 10 months that Jailbreak has been released, it has already yielded seven figure profits,” Balfanz says of his cops-and-robbers adventure game released last year. A few weeks ago, it was played for the billionth time. Balfanz is just one of thousands of young gaming entrepreneurs in their teens or twenties making money in an industry that made $36 billion last year. It's offering new ways to make a living that didn’t exist 10 or even five years ago, even within the games industry. Another 18-year-old student, Andrew Bereza, is the creator of Miner’s Haven and Azure Mines, two games he made over the last two years for Roblox, a kids-focused platform that allows children to build their own games and publish them online – it's the same platform that houses Balfanz’s Jailbreak. “While I’m not in the annual millions like a couple of my colleagues have recently hit, I’ve been steadily earning six figures every year since I started,” he says. He is using his earnings to pay for university, where he is studying computer science. If he didn’t have a platform to distribute his games, “I don’t know how I ever would have been able to afford college or the ability to do full-time game development”, he says. Making and selling your own games Today, thanks to online sales platforms like the App Store, Steam or Roblox, anyone with the right idea and some development nous can reach more than a billion people. But while the technology and ecosystem to reach this vast customer base has only appeared in the last decade, the DIY mentality of young app developers is nothing new: it’s actually not too different from wannabe rock stars starting bands in their garages in the 1970s, or aspiring directors filming home movies on a VHS camcorder in the 1980s. “With creative industries, that’s always been the case, particularly in young people,” says Roger Altizer, co-founder of the entertainment arts and engineering programme at the University of Utah. He says that young people have always come up with creative expressions and have tried to monetise them. With video games specifically, Altizer points out that in the 1980s, young designers made their own video games, stored them on floppy disks and put them in plastic bags, then sold them physically at stores, capturing a certain entrepreneurial spirit. Today? We have indie games like Flappy Bird that become worldwide sensations, achieving overnight success. However, there are now so many being published, it’s becoming an ever-more crowded market. Still, the idea of possible success in this field fuels dreams. Anthony Tan is a high-school student in Australia whose surreal adventure game, Way to the Woods, is due out next year, and has already generated a lot of excitement among games journalists. “You play as a deer and their fawn trying to find their way home in a sleepy, abandoned world,” Tan says. “I think I’d like to go to uni after my completing my current project,” says 18-year-old Tan, who “started off making crappy little Flash games on the side for fun in about Year 8 or 9.” While not everyone is going to make millions off their own game, it still scratches an entrepreneurial itch, Tan says: “Video games are fun for me because I get to dip my toes into all of those fields: creating, designing, modelling, sculpting, painting, engineering, composing.” ‘Serious games’ to promote a cause A lot of young people have used this democratisation of resources to be innovative in a particular way: promoting ideas to improve society. Games that touch on gender identity, cultural politics or mental health care. As a concept, this isn’t new, either. The World Food Programme released what it described as “the world’s first humanitarian video game” nearly 13 years ago: called Food Force, it was released in seven languages and aimed to teach kids about world hunger. But what is new is that young budding video game developers are doing this on their own, and even pursuing careers doing so at university. “We have people coming to school to make serious games because they want to make games that make a difference,” Altizer says. Altizer himself does this at the Therapeutic Games and Apps lab at the University of Utah, which focuses on creating games that help spinal cord injury patients do exercises that prevent pressure sores from wheelchair use, or games that give social workers VR tours of fictional homes to spot dangers for children inside. The internet doesn’t just allow today’s teens and young adults to make their own games to spread a message, though: a charismatic few are using it to make a living as performers. Streaming online in front of millions A relatively new way of making money is by playing video games – and getting strangers on the internet to watch you do it. “Let’s Play” videos, in which an online personality films themselves playing a video game as they add colour commentary for viewers, is a trend that grew so popular, it eventually led to a new platform, Twitch – an entire site devoted to streaming videos of other people playing video games. It is now one of the most popular websites on the internet globally, and was bought by Amazon in 2014 for nearly $1 billion. Being a streamer on a place like Twitch requires entrepreneurial skills, scrappiness and a tolerance for risk. Elspeth Eastman, a Twitch streamer with 103,000 followers, says that after university she spent $2,000 on a new computer to try her hand at streaming. Today, she says she makes a living doing what she loves full-time. “Right now, I’m sitting in a room that’s 90% wires and computers,” Eastman says over the phone from her filming studio. “It’s absolutely your own business. You have to do everything at once: you’re the lights guy, and you’re also the person on stage.” Eventually, it can lead to advertising partnerships, or paid subscriptions, with a cut of the funds going to the streamers. But for a lot of newer streamers, it’s asking for donations from subscribers. It takes a while to get enough viewers to be able to monetise. “This patronage model where people would sponsor artists is very common,” Altizer says. Eastman and another streamer, who goes by Valkyrae who has 200,000 followers and has had a full-time job streaming for three years, point to the importance of networking and self-promoting yourself on social media, or filming videos with streamers who have more subscribers than you. And like DIY app development, the community-centred nature of streaming can also drive a greater good. Valkyrae mentions a charity stream that she participated in last Christmas that raised $8,700 in six hours for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. “One of my subscribers had cancer and he needed surgery,” she says. “And we raised enough money for his surgery, which was like $8,000. You can help people financially – I’m helping my mum financially because of all this extra income I’m getting.” Professional video game players But perhaps the most ambitious – and lucrative – avenue to success that didn’t exist in the mainstream a decade ago is the rise of the professional video game player. Many of these people are in their 20s or younger. The sport is estimated to attract 600 million viewers and be worth £1 billion ($1.4bn) by 2020. The International Olympics Committee is even thinking about adding it to the official roster of events. Sumail Hassan is the youngest gamer to win $1 million in eSports winnings. He’s made more than $2.5 million playing Dota, an online multiplayer game. He calls it a full-time job. “ESports have only gotten bigger since my career started in 2015,” Hassan says. He’s 19 now but has been gaming since he was seven. “I knew video games were the thing I was best at and so went pro.” Altizer says that the University of Utah offers eSports scholarships, and that the university has a varsity eSports programme that pits players against each other in games like League of Legends and Overwatch. Like professional athletes, the chances of becoming a world-renowned eSports player are very slim. “It might not be a path to fame and riches of winning the international tournament. That’s the same thing as going to school and playing lacrosse – there aren’t many people making millions of dollars as lacrosse players,” Altizer says. Hassan says he’s going to stay focused on his gaming career for now, but advises others looking to follow in his footsteps to stay in school and get an education. (This is a sentiment echoed by streamers Eastman and Valkyrae.) “Don’t bet on making a living playing games,” Hassan says. Plans for the future? Whether it’s eSports, streaming or developing indie video games out of your bedroom, the games industry has evolved rapidly over the last couple of decades, and many of these new career paths were born alongside the growth of the internet. Being successful here calls upon lots of skills beyond computer programming: having a bubbly on-air personality, marketing yourself on social media and more. But most won’t end up in a big studio making the next Call of Duty, or becoming the next champion World of Warcraft player, or a Twitch streamer with millions of followers. And that’s not a bad thing, because young people today have more opportunities to enter the industry. Altizer likens it to music: “There are probably more people working in the industry supporting music rather than making money as musicians,” he says. “It’s easier to get a job at the music store tuning guitars than opening for a band on stage.” -- Bryan Lufkin is BBC Capital’s features writer.

Market Sentiment on Bonds,How music reflects the economy,2024-09-14,2018-05-12,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180508-what-can-spotify-tell-us-about-the-economy,"Researchers and policy makers are beginning to think it’s data like this that can give a valuable insight into the mood – and therefore behaviour – of consumers. This story is from Front Row on BBC Radio 4. It was presented by Kirsty Lang and produced by Edwina Pitman. To listen to more episodes of Front Row, please click here. Adapted by Sarah Keating. One week in we let the story begin  We're going out on our first date  You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat  Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate  It is doubtful that Ed Sheeran and his song-writing partners were thinking about the global economy when writing these lyrics from the song Shape of You. However, as the most played song to date on music streaming service Spotify, researchers and policy makers are beginning to think it’s data like this that can give a valuable insight into the mood – and therefore behaviour – of consumers. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England’s chief economist, who is tasked with monitoring the country’s economic data, says that if economists want to understand what is happening, they should focus on new areas of ”big data” alongside more traditional sources. He made the point in a recent speech that “it is estimated that 90% of all data ever created occurred in the past two years. A good chunk has come courtesy of social media.” “Capturing people’s true sentiments and preferences is devilishly difficult,” he continued in his speech. “Traditional surveys of market participants or the general public tend to be biased in their sampling and framed in their responses…these realities may call for exploring non-traditional means of revealing people’s preferences and sentiments.” The BBC’s economics editor Kamal Ahmed says that although he does not think Haldane is advocating the abandonment of old-fashioned traditional economics, but that he is right to question the efficacy of methods such as surveys as a way of understanding how the economy is operating. “We ask people on a scale of one to 10 how do you feel about X, Y and Z, and that clashes with how people behave,” Ahmed says. “Behavioural economics has come much more into the discipline of economics. Understanding how economies operate is much more about how we feel rather than what we think we are doing, and we’re not rational beings.” This is where music choices come in as Haldane points to recent research that used data collected from the US Billboard top 100 and the UK’s Official Charts Company. Both charts are composed of the top 100 songs with the highest number of plays on public radio and online streaming music services, and the highest amount of dollar sales. Researchers at Claremont Graduate University took data from 2000 to 2016 and were able to categorise songs by labels such as energy, danceability, loudness and valence (positivity or negativity) via Spotify Developer API, which creates algorithms in order to suggest songs, and personalised playlist to users. The results showed that the positivity and energy of the most popular songs has been falling since 2000, while the tempo and loudness has remained stable. Surprisingly, danceability seems to be on the up. They were also able to analyse song lyrics in order to categorise songs into eight sentiments: joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise, trust and anticipation. In looking at the songs most popular during the difficult global financial crisis of 2008, they found that songs with lyrics associated with anticipation, disgust, sadness, fear and anger peaked in popularity from 2008 to 2009 and then began to fall after that date. According to the research, “these plots indicate that individuals are projecting their current states of mind into the music they choose to listen to.” The BoE’s chief economist is keen to note the significance of the results and noted another interesting finding in the research. “Intriguingly, the resulting index of sentiment does at least as well in tracking consumer spending as the Michigan survey of consumer confidence,” he says, referring to the University of Michigan’s long running monthly index in the US which gives a nationally representative of consumer sentiment which has implications for the value of stocks and bonds. “And why stop at music?” asks Haldane. “People’s tastes in books, TV and radio may also offer a window on their soul. So too might their taste in games.” He points to EVE Online and World of Warcraft as examples of games with their own virtual markets that offer economists the opportunity for learning more about spending behaviour. So, what can the music we stream and the pop cultural preference reveal about our consumer behaviour? The top three tunes in 2017 were Ed Sheeran’s Shape of You, Despacito by Luis Fonsi featuring Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber, and Something Like This by the Chainsmokers featuring Coldplay. Uptempo and poppy – does this mean the economy is in a good state given that science has found the reverse to be true, that we tend to listen to melancholy music when we are feeling sad?  Kamal Ahmed says we cannot jump to conclusions just yet as the world is still changing at a rapid rate. “The problem is that Bank of England data sets [and] theories go back decades, centuries and therefore you can judge these things over a longer period of time.” He warns that the old adage that “correlation does not imply” remains. “Finding a correlation in a year may not be true in five years’ time so you have to be very careful,” he says. “You can almost find anything if you look hard enough because there are billions of bits of data produced every single day but it’s important that we understand sentiment and about the economy in a slightly more 21st-Century way. -- To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

Market Sentiment on Bonds,Morning business round-up,2024-09-14,2011-10-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-15199379,"What made the business news in Asia and Europe this morning? Here's our daily business round-up: Stock markets across Europe have been boosted by expectations that EU leaders are about to act to ease the debt crisis. The main markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris were about 2% up, after Hong Kong closed 5.6% higher. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said in a television interview that there were plans for co-ordinated action to recapitalise banks.  In the UK, the Bank of England has said it will inject a further £75bn into the UK economy through quantitative easing (QE). The Bank has already pumped £200bn into the economy by buying assets such as government bonds, in an attempt to boost lending by commercial banks. But this is the first time it has added to its QE programme since 2009. There have been recent calls for it to step in again to aid the fragile recovery. The Bank also held interest rates at the record low of 0.5%. European aircraft maker Airbus has struck a deal worth $9.5bn (£6.2bn) with Australia's Qantas for 110 jets. The order, said by Qantas to be the country's single largest aircraft purchase by units, will underpin the airline's expansion into Asia. Qantas, which is launching a low-cost and a premium airline in Asia, is buying 78 Airbus 320neos and 32 A320s. Eleswhere in Asia, there are reports that many Chinese private sector enterprises are facing bankruptcy because of credit tightening and an explosion in informal lending. In the eastern city of Wenzhou, one-fifth of the city's 360,000 small and mid-sized businesses have stopped operating due to cash shortages, China's official news agency Xinhua reported on Thursday.

Its shares fell by as much as 10% in early trade to HK$11.90 from an offer price of HK$13.30. Citic securities, China's largest listed brokerage had sold 995.3m shares raising HK$13.2bn ($1.7bn, £1.1bn).  Many Chinese firms have recently cancelled or postponed their proposed listing on the exchange.  Meanwhile, the state of the UK housing market has been under scrutiny. House prices are ""lacking genuine direction"", according to the Halifax, as it reported a 0.5% fall in values in September compared with August. Prices were down 2.3% from a year ago, leaving the average home in the UK worth £161,132 ($249,560), the lender said.
