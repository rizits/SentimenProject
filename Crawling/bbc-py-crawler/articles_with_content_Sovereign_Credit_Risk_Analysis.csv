Sovereign Credit Risk Analysis,Who should I vote for and what are the parties promising?,2024-09-14,2024-06-20,By the Visual Journalism team,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxeez8271nvo,"Polls open in the UK general election on Thursday - have you decided which party will get your vote? If not, this guide offers a summary of where the main parties stand on the issues most important to voters, based on the promises they have made during the campaign. Click on the drop-down list to select the nation, political parties and issues that interest you. A manifesto is the list of pledges parties make to voters, explaining what they would do if elected. This interactive has been put together by the BBC's Visual Journalism team, the BBC's political research unit in London and BBC journalists in Belfast, Cardiff and Glasgow. Its aim is to summarise where the parties stand on key topics to help voters make informed decisions at the ballot box. We have selected issues highlighted in polling company Ipsos Mori's Issues Index, a monthly survey that measures the things the public believe to be the most important facing the country. We analysed surveys from the twelve months before the election was called and selected the issues based on their aggregate score over that period. In some cases we have combined similar issues for simplicity. For example, ""NHS, hospitals, healthcare and social care"" are included under the one category of ""NHS and care"". ""Democracy"" was added as an issue on the editorial grounds that it help fulfil the BBC's public service commitments. In order for a party to be included in the guide it must be standing candidates in at least one sixth of seats in the nation it is campaigning in as well as meeting one of the following criteria: Parties are ordered by their vote share in the 2019 general election - and then alphabetically. You can see a full list of all parties standing at the general election here. This is an editorial process overseen by BBC journalists. All parties included in the guide have contacted by the BBC and given the opportunity to identify their key policies in each area. Because of devolution, the UK parliament cannot rule on, or has limited powers over, some of the issues highlighted in the guide. For example, ""health"" is devolved to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Parties do still campaign locally on these devolved issues in the run up to a general election. For this reason, the guide highlights issues that are devolved or partly devolved to acknowledge that these policies may not become law in that nation even if they are passed in Westminster.

Sovereign Credit Risk Analysis,In full: Transcript of Chilcot interview,2024-09-14,2017-07-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-40510539,"The chair of the Iraq Inquiry, Sir John Chilcot, has spoken exclusively to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg to mark the first anniversary of the publication of his report into the 2003 invasion. Here you can read a full transcript of the interview. LK: Sir John, it probably feels like a long time ago now, because it is a long time ago. Can you take us back to the moment when you had the first phone call asking you to chair the inquiry and what did you think? JC: The first phone call came on a Friday evening. I was at home in Devon and - and the cabinet secretary's private secretary came on to say (clears throat) he wants an urgent word. I said, 'well, I'm here.' 'No, no, no. He wants an urgent word first thing on Monday morning.' I was still there on Monday morning, the cabinet secretary telephoned and said, 'there's going to be an announcement this morning that there's to be an Iraq inquiry. Are you going to chair it?' I said, 'well I'd quite like to think about and the terms of reference and the membership and procedures.' 'Well, I can give you about eight minutes.' LK: Eight minutes? JC: Yes or no. I said, 'give me a minute.' And then I said yes. LK: Why did you say yes? JC: Because I was asked to do it. I'd been involved in Iraq through the Butler Inquiry, I knew some of the stuff, the government was pledged and Parliament had accepted there was to be one. I thought lots of people could do it. But I knew that I could do it in a way that would not be the same as other inquiries which had proved problematic, frankly, in their procedure. So. LK: What was the difference then? JC: I was really clear from the outset, even before the Parliamentary statement by Gordon Brown on the Monday, that it shouldn't be an accusatory inquiry, it should be an inquiry into the facts, the history, in effect. That had consequences. First of all, duration. Because the - I had no part, of course, in discussions in the Cabinet Office with ministers and officials about how long it might take. They took the view it might be a year or a bit more, but they were basing that on the assumption that it would be a private inquiry on paper with no public hearings or anything of that character. Like the Falklands Inquiry had been in 1984. I knew right from the outset, by instinct and then by parliamentary discussion, press commentary and the rest, certainly the families that was not going to work. It was going to have to have hearings and it would imply then that it would take longer. I didn't - no idea how long. LK: You had no idea how long? JC: No. And I - very sad, I do need to get a reference and mention it here for Martin Gilbert. Apart from him dying sadly part-way through, all the colleagues stuck with it, and so did the - the secretary to the inquiry. I won't say we didn't get a bit impatient at moments, but there it was. LK: Why did it take so long? JC: Because there was so much stuff. It was a history of, in effect, starting in 2001, of eight to nine years of diplomatic, military, political resource, every sort of aspect. And I felt very sorry for the families, I really did, and we kept in touch with them as best we could. Some said that's okay, some said, you know... And the lawyers were involved, and their lawyers. Which slows things down when you try and get into a relationship. But one of the other features which, I think, contributed both to duration, but also to process, was an instinctive feeling which all my colleagues shared, that we didn't want an accusatory inquiry so we didn't want legal representation. Gordon Brown actually wanted us to administer an oath. I took a bit of legal advice, said, 'no, I'm not going to do that, because if we do witnesses are exposed to a possible charge of perjury. Then they have to have legal representation, QCs on both sides.' And I thought oh, poor Lord Saville, Bloody Sunday, 200 million quid.  LK: So Gordon Brown wanted you to take evidence from people under oath? JC: He said, 'think - please consider very carefully, can you or will you?' I said, 'no, but we'll introduce a - an informal procedure where I'd be asking each witness, you know, 'will you stand by what you say because we will then compare it later to the written record, and so be careful.' And they all agreed. LK: Why do you think he wanted you to take evidence under oath? JC: Oh, belt and braces. Made sure the truth came out. I'm not so sure. I don't know actually. I think he just felt in procedural terms it was sort of stronger. Well, there it was. LK: And you say you were against that idea because you were worried about people having to perjure themselves? JC: Not having to, but by exposing them to the risk. If you take an oath you are open to a charge of perjury if the documentary record, for example, shows that you didn't tell the truth. In that situation every witness is entitled to a lawyer to represent them. That destroys the dialogue. And what we wanted, frankly, was to get the story. And I have got a - collateral - for this for argument. Because Gordon Brown, when the first attempt at a Falklands-style inquiry failed politically. LK: To hold it in private? JC: Yeah. He said, 'well, John, why don't you go round all the heads of the relevant select committees and the leaders of political parties and see what they want?' And pretty much without exception they all said, 'we want to know all that happened and the evidence behind it.' They didn't say, 'we want to find the guilty party.' So I followed their guidance. But for a long time.  LK: Did you - did you have any idea at the start how complicated and controversial it would become? JC: Controversy yes, because it had begun as a very controversial piece of statecraft. Complex, I think I probably underestimated it. There were so many dimensions and facets. Some of them were extremely interesting. I learnt a great deal, in those years. As, for example, the difficulty of finding out how many people die in a civil war or something approaching a civil war. Because you've got hospital records but lots of people are just buried in the ground or blown up, whatever. It's very hard to estimate. And the estimate range was huge. It's not a pleasant subject but it's interesting.  LK: Did the inquiry get too big do you think? JC: In the sense of too large an army of staff and committee members, certainly not. I think we were very sparse. In terms of range and scale there were two propositions put to us: one was we should do an interim inquiry up to but short of the invasion, or perhaps including the invasion but leave the rest for another tier of report. One or two of the committee saw attraction in that. I have to claim I was opposed and so were others. On the footing that it was already apparent that one of the great failings of this enterprise was the lack of preparation and thought beforehand, which then spills over into the aftermath, and how do you read back if you've already published what you said about the run-up? It just doesn't make historical sense. The other was, could you pair off whole areas of subject matter? The treatment of civilians, for example, increasingly it became too difficult just to - you don't go down every rabbit hole. You can't do that. But when there's a sort of quite wide rabbit hole, it might even be a badger sett, you - you've got to do down it. Partly because people keep giving evidence and raise topics. International law is a classic case. Do you want me to go into that? LK: So you had to pursue the evidence, you had to follow the evidence where it took you? JC: Yes. LK: But did you also get frustrated by the length of time it took, because of course not everything was in your control? JC: I don't admit to frustration. I don't even admit to fatigue. It was very stimulating. I was - as I said earlier, I was sorry for the families in particular, but also that politically there was a risk that the impact of it would fade. I don't believe myself that happened, but that's a judgement for others.  LK: One of the reasons, of course, it took so long is the process of Maxwellisation.  JC: Yes. LK: People who were to be criticised were given a right to reply beforehand. Was that the right thing to do? JC: I hesitate to use the phrase, 'the right thing to do,' because it has echoes of other people using it. Was it necessary? Yes, I believe it was, for reasons of underlying fairness. If you're going to deprive witnesses of the opportunity to have legal representation during a live session, or indeed in representing their case, you have to find some other way of rectifying the potential unfairness. Now, there's a history to Maxwell, as lots of people know, and you go right back to the Salmon principles, and Maxwell of course was a  - it was a business inquiry about fitness to be a director. There are those, including my very revered friend of very long standing, Louis Blom-Cooper, who says you didn't have to do that. You can do it without being unfair. To which my reply is you can only do it without being unfair if you give legal representation. And if you do that you expand the time in a different way, and raise the cost.  LK: Did that process, though, lead to you having to change some of the criticisms that you would put forward? JC: Well, that's one way to ask the question.  What it did do was I think it produced some new evidence which we'd not been made aware of, because we had the whole of the government archive, and you can't index a government archive 100%. So there were bits of evidence which were helpful. Others which actually pointed to new directions for us to re-explore. So to that extent did it change our ultimate opinions, judgements, not the basic ones, no. It was of course a confidential process, so I'm even at this stage not saying who was involved and what they argued. Did it have a positive effect? To a degree. I still think it satisfied the fairness criteria. But the other thing it did was avoid the delay question, which I don't know that people accept. We set for those often very senior politicians and military and other people, quite strict deadlines to respond to often very substantial bodies of draft material. And they all held to them, they didn't string it out. Which - well, I think I was slightly surprised actually. LK: And there was suspicion among the public at the time? JC: Oh yes. LK: That some of the key witnesses, senior military figures, senior politicians were trying to water down the criticisms that you wanted to make of them. JC: They were entitled to make their own argument on fairness grounds. But I don't think the report that came out suffers from dilution. LK: But did some of them - and I know you can't identify them - JC: Yeah. LK: But did some of them try to water down the criticisms that you were making of them? JC: I think the fair answer to that is no. They would make the best of their own case. They're entitled to. LK: Isn't that the same thing? JC: No, it's not the same thing actually. It's not to say 'if you avoid that word in that sentence of the draft, I think it would suit me.' There was none of that kind of argument. There were serious arguments about - and I'll take legal argument as one category - where you can have quite an extended dialogue and come out at the end with a revised draft which is not dilute but is more informative or better informed. LK: So a different account? JC: Yes. But I do deny dilution. And anyway, if you look at that report, it's not dilute.  LK: Did you find it frustrating then during that period? Because for a long time you were right in the middle of a row about this, with very few opportunities - JC: Yes. LK - to put your side of the story. JC: Yeah. At this stage and after a year has passed and more than a year, I find it quite reassuring that we held to our ground, and neither truncated the report, which was prime minister Cameron's argument, which I think would have been unforgivable, a terrible waste of a lot of time and effort and truth, the other was - there was understandable pressure from the families. But I think by the time we launched it, it had satisfied their need for - I avoid the word 'closure', but for an account that satisfied their wish to know all that happened and why it happened and by whom. LK: And David Cameron, he did pressure you to try and hurry up? JC: (speaking over) Yes, he did. LK: How did that play out? What did he say to you? What was the form of those discussions? JC: Essentially messages via the cabinet secretary or senior Cabinet Office staff, and then eventually public correspondence. Which I had no difficulty in replying to politely. Firmness and politeness are different things.  LK: Why do you think he was trying to do it? JC: Oh, I think you would need to ask him. But there was some media interest from some of the papers. The Guardian is still using the larger format, but others are not.  LK: Did some of the delays with Maxwellisation, and of course the nature of the evidence you were dealing with, a lot of the fact that it had to take so long was because of course, of the nature of what you were asking.  JC: Yes.  LK: And the nature of the witness sessions and the rest. Do you feel that the politicians you dealt with were as straight with you as they ought to have been? JC: I think I'd need to distinguish. They adopted different approaches. And I have to name names here because these were public sessions. Tony Blair is always and ever an advocate. He makes the most persuasive case he can. Not departing from the truth but persuasion is everything. Advocacy for my position, my Blair position. Jack Straw, on the other hand is much more the historian. And produced, I mean, not only vast amounts of written material, but really stuck to his memory and recall of the key facts as they recurred to him in - under questioning. Others, it was - it varied. You would expect a lawyer to make legal argument.  LK: And they were, particularly the sessions with Tony Blair, they were extraordinarily tense.  JC: Yes. LK: You say he always tried to make the most persuasive case, the advocate's case. JC: Yes. LK: Do you feel he was as straight with you as he ought to have been? JC: I think I'd have to take us back into the body of the report itself, and the critique that we made. There is, I argued, you know, including in the launch statement, the responsibility on the leading politician, of a government, both to make the case for the policy decision taken but also to balance that with realism about risks, downsides, counter-arguments. If you act simply as a one-sided advocate you risk losing that. And I think that risk did come - come about. LK: And indeed, your report would say, says, for example on the intelligence. JC: Yes. LK: He gave it a certainty that wasn't justified. I mean that's another way of saying it was exaggerated.  JC: He found - I don't know whether consciously or not - a verbal formula in the dossier and his foreword to it. He said - and used it again later. 'I believe the assessed intelligence shows beyond doubt.' Pinning it on 'my belief'. Not on the fact, what the assessed intelligence said. You can make an argument around that, both ethical and - well, there is an ethical argument I think. LK: Do you think it was ethical to do that? JC: We criticised it and said it shouldn't have been done.  LK: But was it ethical? JC: I don't know that I - I'm not an ethicist. (laugh) LK: But you spent years studying this - JC: Yes. LK: Intelligence. The way you put it in the report and what you've just said would suggest that's somebody who's spent their life in government, in public service. JC: Yes. LK: That you feel he manipulated the evidence to make his own case.  JC: Again I'm declining the word 'manipulate'. Using as best he could. But it's only fair to him to say that on the very eve of the invasion he asked the then chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee, can you tell me beyond any reasonable doubt that Saddam has weapons of mass destruction. To which the answer was, yes I can. He was entitled to rely on that. But would it have been wise to rely on it? LK: And when it came to his evidence to you - JC: Yes. LK: Do you feel he gave you the fullest version of events?  JC: I think he gave an - what was - I hesitate to say this, rather, but I think it was, from his perspective and standpoint, emotionally truthful and I think that came out also in his press conference after the launch statement.   I think he was under - as you said just now - very great emotional pressure during those sessions. Far more than the committee were. He was suffering. He was deeply engaged.  Now in that state of mind and mood you fall back on your instinctive skills and reactions, I think. LK: But he was relying, you suggest, therefore on emotion, not fact? JC:  Both. I mean fact, insofar as there are facts particularly in the intelligence sphere. Nobody should be allowed to become a senior minister reading intelligence without undergoing a training course. That was a diversion, but it's also true. LK: But just having been part of those incredibly intense sessions and then having studied that version of events along with the enormous array of documentary evidence that you had, just in the most simple terms, do you believe that Tony Blair  was as straight with you and the public as he ought to have been? (long pause) JC: Can I slightly reword that to say I think any prime minister taking a country into war has got to be straight with the nation and carry it, so far as possible, with him or her. I don't believe that was the case in the Iraq instance.    LK: In your view was it a necessary war? I mean you say plainly in the report the peaceful options had not been exhausted. JC: Indeed. To that extent it doesn't satisfy the last resort criteria to that extent. Not necessarily for the United Kingdom to join. I leave the Americans to make their own argument.    LK: If it was therefore unnecessary, do you feel that the politicians who made those decisions for our country ought to bear some greater responsibility? Now you very clearly did not have a legal power in your inquiry, but you probably amassed more evidence than any kind of legal case ever would. Is there a case, do you think, for politicians involved to face some kind of further test, to face the law? JC: I can't think what it would be.  There isn't a court. In theory the general assembly of the United Nations could commission the International Court of Justice, but it never has and probably never - well except in one current instance but that's a trivial one.  So it won't happen that way. If it's not a court internationally recognised you haven't got an authoritative verdict as an outcome, so other than reputational damage, what's involved? I take a more nuanced position, if I'm allowed to, which is that it could have become a necessary war had the intelligence proved to be more reliable than it proved to be. But later - and in effect it's the Colin Powell position. Don't exclude war, but don't do it yet, it's not necessary yet.  It could even be - I hesitate to take in vain the name of a distinguished French president - but it is even the Chirac position. At least on paper.   LK: And that's one of the things you go through, the whole dynamic as Britain and the US were trying to get France into their place and they were pushing back in that other way. But for you therefore it was the rush to the conflict? JC: Indeed, and it has so many and quite profound implications. The lack of preparation, the lack of risk analysis. The lack of resource allocation. Mistaken models I take - one thing very close to my heart 'cause of my earlier life in the Home Office and elsewhere and Northern Ireland, was the failure of security sector reform. And the notion that British civil policemen, largely unarmed, could enter into a conflict zone and be effective. I mean that's just loony. The Italian carabinieri were very good.  LK: Whose fault was that? But whose fault was that? I mean when you read through the information in the report, particularly about preparation, it's astonishing. Whose fault was it? Because it must have been somebody's fault. JC: The critique that we mount and mounted, and I still stand by, was that a prime minister at the head of the government of a large country can't be expected to run a war on his/her own. If you look at the Second World War you have people like John Anderson fulfilling the civil side of government and Attlee signally in the new biography by John Bew - and Tony Blair, the prime minister of the time should, could not, have done it all himself with a tiny Number 10 staff. What we say he could and should have done was appoint a very senior non-departmental minister to run the show and coordinate otherwise very senior ministers - defence, Foreign Office and pull it together. And the fact is there was no - I think we used the rather idiomatic term - there was no buy-in by all the different departments and arms of government. And that should have been pulled together and it wasn't. And to do that you need a lot of political clout. I'm not going to cast that particular role in 2002-3, but there's a good parlour game.   LK: Do you think though that because of the lack of preparation, because of your view that it was not at that stage a necessary war. JC: Yeah. LK: Does that mean then the British government put British servicemen and women and Iraqi civilians in harm's way unnecessarily? JC: In harm's way, certainly. It might have become necessary at a later point, and you can't of course run an exercise like Iraq whenever you do it without civilians being unavoidably profoundly affected.  We - I think I have to stick with - it was not necessary for us to join in that at the time we did. LK: And of course America's intentions were plain to see at that point. But having studied it in such detail, seeing for the first time before any of us, those notes, those intimate notes between Tony Blair and George W Bush, do you think the relationship between the US and the UK at that stage was appropriate? Was the relationship between the prime minister and the president appropriate? JC:  There are several things I'd like to say about that. One is I think that the fundamental British strategy was fractured, because our formal policy, right up to the autumn of 2002 was one of containment. That was the concluded decision of cabinet.   But the prime minister was running one of coercive diplomacy. With the knowledge and support of the foreign secretary, but the foreign secretary hoped that diplomacy would win and not coercion. I think the prime minister it probably looked the other way round. So, I think what is harder for I suppose someone who's lived a life in Whitehall to understand is the fact that other members of the cabinet, including quite senior members, did not raise any kind of challenge to this - it was pretty plain policy was going two different ways  - sort it  somebody. And that kind of pressure was never really exerted except by Robin Cook who does deserve real credit not only because it's with hindsight now. The other things I wanted to say about that were - the official machine, it did put up good and relevant advice at various points, one of which was, shortly before the invasion, look, you've got to have a proper war cabinet setup.  We've always had one, we need it. No. Advice formally went from recall from both the cabinet secretary and David Manning. You need a senior ministerial level committee running it and then an official one to take down the policy intent of the politicians and he'd give it effect in Whitehall. To which the prime minister said, 'you can play your games as officials, do what you like, but I'm not having a ministerial committee.' And I think it's well known why.   LK: Because he didn't want the challenge? He didn't want the scrutiny? He didn't want people to stop him doing what he wanted? JC: I think that's the broader interpretation and the other is, could it be kept from leaking and would there be dissent by certain other members of that potential committee. LK: So it was clear to you that Tony Blair was running his own game with George Bush, while the rest of the government - JC: Yes. LK: - apart from one or two people didn't know what was going on? JC: That was the fact of the matter. The really quite damaging effect of that however was to give at every level, in the military and in civil government, the opportunities to shove up any difficult issue they couldn't resolve with the Americans at their level. Well it had better go up to the president/prime minister. Which I mean is hopeless. You can't clog up that relationship with literally hundreds of difficult decisions. You've got to work right through a system. Now the American system was quite fractured, of course, between Rumsfeld and Cheney on the one side and Colin Powell on the other. But leave them to their problems. So was ours.  It was also upside down. I've got a rhetorical point to make but it's a real one. Tony Blair made much of, at various points and still does I think, of the need to exert influence on American policy making. To do that he said in terms at one point, 'I have to accept their strategic objective, regime change, in order to exert influence.' For what purpose? To get them to alter their policy? Of course not. So in effect it was a passive strategy. Just go along. LK: Do you think he was almost played by the Americans then? JC: I think you would need to have a two nation inquiry to get to that.  LK: If you're not doing much these days, you're officially retired, there you go.  JC: But it is a possible interpretation. We certainly concluded that the amount of effective influence exerted was very slight and short lived. Clearly getting George Bush to go to the United Nations in September '02, but that only lasted two/three months. When it comes to the immediate post-invasion era it's pretty much zilch. Whether in terms of de-Baathification or disbanding the Iraqi army without money or whatever but with their guns, in all sorts of ways. And then the situation reverses in 2006-7 when in the light of the security failure the Americans mount the surge and we're trying to get out. LK: When you saw some of the most notable documents that emerged -  JC: Yes. LK: And I'm thinking of course of the note. JC: Of course. 'I shall be with you whatever.' LK: What did you think when you saw that for the first time? JC: I thought exactly the same as David Manning and Jonathan Powell thought. LK: Which was? JC: You mustn't say that!  LK: Because? JC: Because you're giving away far too much. You're making a binding commitment by one sovereign government to another which you can't fulfil. You're not in a  position to fulfil it.  I mean he didn't even know the legal position at that point.    LK: And on the legal position, I mean you weren't constituted to set up to adjudicate on whether the war was illegal or not.  JC: No. LK: But you do make the point, very clearly, in very polite yet quite damning terms, that the ways in which the legal decisions were taken were far from satisfactory.  What did you mean by that? JC:  I suppose if you take it right to the sharpest point the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, was able by middle of February to say that I think there is not only a reasonable argument you can make, it might not prevail but you can make a reasonable argument, that was early February. Then under some pressure, I think the better view is that Resolution 1441 by itself without further resolutions could sustain the argument of legality. His legal secretary writes to the prime minister's foreign affairs secretary at that moment and says, 'there needs to be very strong evidence that Saddam is in continuing breach,' and what happened? The prime minister takes no advice from anyone as to the strength or quality of the supporting evidence. Doesn't discuss it with any colleague and simply instructs the private secretary, write back, say it's fine. Now that is perfunctory to an absurd degree. So failure of process - and for me that's very striking. I don't particularly want to pursue the ins and outs of the legal arguments up to that point, but at that moment I think there was a real failure of responsibility. LK: So whether the legal arguments meant that it was okay or not, the ways which those decisions were reached -  JC: Yes. LK: - fell significantly short in your view? JC: I think that's a euphemism.  LK: Having studied the aftermath, as you did, do you think fundamentally that Britain's involvement in Iraq has made the middle east and therefore by extension our country, less stable, more dangerous? JC: I always hesitate to reach these broad judgements, particularly on affairs which I haven't studied myself. However, I think it is necessary to say that the security failure in Iraq - both Iraq as a whole and in the south east where we took responsibility - I'd like to make a point about that too - can only have disrupted not only Iraq itself but the whole balance of power - Iran, Iraq, the Gulf States, the rest, and indirectly Syria. Libya is a possible exception up till much later. But what I do think is that the failure of security was staring people in the face from very early on. Certainly from the autumn of 2003. By the very latest at the end of 2003. And far too little was done about it.  Now could anything useful have been done about it? You could have poured in more resources, you could have confined your activity, you could have put more weight on the Iraqi political community. But nothing happened until it was frankly too late. And I go back one to the pre and post invasion connection. We started off offering the Americans a large scale force of a divisional headquarters and one armoured brigade to go in through the north of Iraq. We wound up, at very short notice, giving them a divisional headquarters and three armoured brigades in the south. Now for that you would need first of all six month's notice according to the Strategy Defence Review, as we sit here, and - but you would also have to point out, we could only sustain that for a very brief period. And allowing for the new chapter of the Strategic Defence Review we were running two with Afghanistan from 2005 anyway, two medium scale operations without end.  And we couldn't do that. We hadn't got the men, the equipment, the means.   LK: So we were hugely overstretched almost from the very beginning? JC: Yes.    LK: In terms of your report having put politicians and senior military people who were involved under such intense scrutiny, so close to the events really -  JC: Yes. LK: Do you think we could ever go to war in the same way, given what your Report uncovered? JC: Oh yes. In an existential crisis, certainly. No question about it. And I don't think we would need a war powers act to prevent us to do that.  But more generally, I think we have seen evidence of - not of a failure of nerve, but of an insistence on much better control of capacity, resources before reaching a decision to do something on that scale. And I don't think that's wrong. Whether the machinery is perfect and whether memories will survive say a decade or two I'm more doubtful, but the lessons are there. LK: So you believe the report should in theory  - could stop a similar rush to war where not enough was being done whether in the legal process or the intelligence process to be sure that it was the right thing? JC: I've got good reason to have real confidence in both the Ministry of Defence institution and in the armed services, to think that they would not allow that to happen without much more rigorous analysis. And just to take one - it's not a small point - but I had so many years in Northern Ireland where the troops were after all the evolution of our presence there, given extremely clear instructions and orders as to how to operate. No such instructions or operational guidance was given at all at the beginning of the Iraq affair. What do we do when a bunch of Iraqis come at us and we've got rifles? Do we shoot or not shoot? Nothing. Now that can never happen again. That was awful.  LK: And you believe -  JC:   That was professional failure. LK: - that's because the report has brought in a new level of challenge you believe? JC: I believe so. In fact I'm assured so and hope it's so. LK: By whom? What assurances have you had? JC: The rising generations of military. They don't want to be in that position, face a report like ours in ten or twenty years time.    LK: So the rising generations of the military have told you they won't make the same mistakes again, because of the Report? JC: Yes, and they weren't their mistakes.   LK: What about the families? JC: Yes. LK: Do you think the report changed things for them? JC: Well, I can only report what actually happened on the day of the launch. I was extremely uncertain as to what kind of reception we would get. We gave the families an hour and a half before I went into their room and I didn't know whether you'd get boos or brickbats or even rotten tomatoes. Instead we got loud applause. I then made a little talk and at the end of that even louder applause and thank yous and whatever, without real dissent from anywhere in the room. And then on the occasion of the actual launch statement at the end, there was I think something close to a standing ovation from some. Now the sense of relief I experienced was huge. But not to say there wasn't uncertainty. I think the families showed remarkable patience actually and endurance, having to live with real doubts about what would come out. But I have to say one thing which is not to set against that observation - well two. One is we did try to keep contact but the other was it was not a report for an about and to the bereaved families. It was about the whole thing. In that sense quite different from say the Hillsborough Report. And I have to get in another mention of Bloody Sunday. It wasn't about three hours of an afternoon, it was about eight years.    LK: Do you think therefore in your own mind it was worth it? JC: Worth it in the sense of the public money spent, of the human effort involved, I've no doubts about either. I think it was a stopping place looking to the future which may have set, if not a new direction, set new criteria for big scale decision making by governments in conflict situations. And I think that was necessary. LK: And as somebody's still a Whitehall watcher, do you think the deficiencies in how government works that you observed and detailed have disappeared? Have the problems been fixed? JC: I think they've been recognised and I hope are in the process of being fixed. I mean certainly institutional changes have been made. National Security Council etcetera, etcetera. But the only test will be in the event, in the future event. LK: What was the worst thing about it for you? Did you have any moments through the whole process where you just thought, argh, this is never gonna work? JC: Not so much that, but both I, and I think I speak here for our very senior military adviser who'd been chief of general staff for the first Gulf War and around then, was a disappoint - a profound disappointment - at the failure of professional standards in both civil and military government in too  many cases and on too many occasions. I mean things had really not gone at all well and that - there was individual failing as well as collective institutional failing. LK: And presumably that meant lives were lost because of it? JC: Well, you can't make a direct cause or connection. You can only say a situation was allowed to eventuate and the consequences of that situation were for some people fatal. But you can't then say therefore those people are responsible for those fatalities.  LK: Not directly. JC: Yup. LK: And what was the best thing? JC: The best thing at one level was the intellectual rigour and stimulus of the committee and it's quite admirable staff. That was almost a counterbalance to what I've just said about failures of professional standards. This was done by - to my eye - to the best standards I've ever experienced in Whitehall. Unfailingly and over a good number of years by a lot of people. I was very pleased about that. LK: And in terms of the best thing about the report's impact? Because the classic public response to these things is to say, it gave us lots of new information but it didn't change any minds. Do you think you changed minds? JC: My hope is that some future minds will have been changed. Because you can't just say that block of volumes never existed. It's there now. It's standing in the way of a retreat back down the road to a lesser standard.    LK: And is that the best thing for you in terms of its impact? JC: Yes.  It says to me it was worthwhile the personal efforts involved by all of us. LK: So you're glad you said yes when you had a couple of minutes to think about it all those years ago? JC: Now, yes, but there were moments in between. But yes.    LK: Sir John, thank you so much. "
Sovereign Credit Risk Analysis,Saudi Aramco flotation values oil giant at $1.7tn,2024-09-14,2019-11-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50450527,"Saudi Arabia has placed a preliminary valuation on state oil company Aramco of between $1.6tn (£1.22tn) and $1.7tn. The company has published an updated prospectus for its initial public offering (IPO), seeking more than $25bn for the sale of 1.5% of its shares.  That would make it potentially the world's biggest IPO, coming from the world's most profitable company  It is short of the $2tn valuation that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was reportedly keen to achieve. ""The base offer size will be 1.5% of the company's outstanding shares,"" the state-owned energy giant said in a statement that set the price range at 30-32 Saudi riyals per share ($8-$8.5). That could value the IPO at as much as 96bn riyals ($25.60bn) at the top end of the range. If priced at the top end, the deal could just beat the record-breaking $25bn raised by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014. Individual retail investors, as well as big institutions, will have a chance to buy shares. Aramco had initially been expected to sell some 5% of its shares on two exchanges, with a first listing of 2% on the kingdom's Tadawul bourse, and then another 3% on an overseas exchange. The firm says there are now no current plans for an international sale, with that long-discussed goal now seemingly being put on ice. Aramco called off a number of so-called roadshows for the shares, aimed at enticing foreign buyers, the Financial Times reported.  European meetings were cancelled on Monday after similar pitches in Asia and the US were dropped at the weekend, the newspaper said. The crown prince is seeking to sell the shares to raise billions of dollars to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in non-energy industries. Analysts S&P Global Ratings said the stock market debut could enable Saudi Arabia to strengthen its financial position.  ""If subsequently effectively deployed, the funds raised could be used to support longer-term economic growth in Saudi Arabia,"" it said. In its prospectus released last week, the company lists a variety of investment risks ranging from terrorist attacks to geopolitical tensions in a region dominated by Saudi-Iran rivalry. The 600-page prospectus also includes the government's control over oil output as another potential risk. After the flotation, Aramco will not list any more shares for six months, the prospectus says. Although one of the attractions for investors is the potential of high dividends, the document said Aramco has the right to change dividend policy without prior notice. Aramco has hired a host of international banking giants including Citibank, Credit Suisse and HSBC as financial advisers to assess interest in the share sale and set a price. Based on the level of interest. The sale of the company, first mooted four years ago, has been overshadowed by delays and criticism of corporate transparency at Saudi Arabia's crown jewel.  Aramco last year posted $111bn in net profit. In the first nine months of this year, its net profit dropped 18% to $68bn. A third of Aramco's shares - about $8bn worth - will be sold to the man and (the prospectus says) even the divorced woman on the street, giving local Saudi Arabians a stake in their nation's cash cow for the first time.  A TV and billboard advertising campaign, as well as social media, is stoking enthusiasm on the ground and demand is expected to be high.  For the remaining $16bn, the oil giant is turning to institutional investors. And a source close to the company says there has been sufficient interest that they're confident they can cover most of this off within the Gulf.  But there will be disappointment amongst officials if global demand is not there for the jewel in Saudi Arabia's crown.  A fossil fuels company owned by an absolute monarchy in a volatile region are not an easy sell for many Western firms, pursuing the latest trend in investment policy of ""ESG"" (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria. Norway's sovereign wealth fund is among those to already rule themselves out from investing.  But the promise of sharing the promised annual $75bn cash dividend pot might be too good for some to miss, according to James Bevan, Chief Investment Officer at CCLA Investment Management (one of the UK's largest charity fund managers).  Given his firm's focus, he is not looking to invest in the shares but explains why some are. ""It's a 'risk' in the eyes of some investors to be very underweight in oil and gas, and Aramco may be a means of plugging a sector gap with perhaps less worry than associated with holding Gazprom,"" he says. Investors follow indexes - such as the FTSE 100 - which are made up of array of types of industries and so some feel oil and gas needs to be correspondingly represented in their portfolio. As Aramco's big sales pitch road show kicks off, the real test of investor appetite for the company will begin. "
Sovereign Credit Risk Analysis,A secret weapon against catastrophe,2024-09-14,2017-05-16,Amanda Ruggeri,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170515-resilience-bonds-a-secret-weapon-against-catastrophe,"The costs of natural disasters are becoming too much to bear – and it’s driving up premiums no matter where you live. The solution may be a transformative type of insurance never seen before. In a conference room overlooking downtown Miami, British executives are talking about why they know south Florida’s streets so well. It isn’t because of the sunshine. It’s because of the area’s risk for disasters like hurricanes and flooding. “There are hundreds of my colleagues… who know the zip codes of these counties in this part of the world almost as well as the residents here,” says Rowan Douglas, head of capital, science and policy at the London-based risk management group and insurance broker Willis Towers Watson. “This area of the world is protected to some degree by a global community of everyone else who buys their insurance policy. My mother-in-law in northwest Spain is sharing risk with Florida."" No policy or premium stands alone. Our global economy is so intertwined that if you buy insurance, you’re helping to cover the fallout from far-away crises, whether an earthquake in Mexico or flood in Louisiana. As a result, nearly everyone’s pocketbook is affected by one simple fact: rebuilding after a major catastrophe nearly always costs more than preparing for it in the first place. And climate-related disasters (like droughts and tropical storms) are getting more common. From 2005 to 2015, the UN found there were 335 weather-related disasters each year across the globe, almost twice the number seen from 1985-1994. The average catastrophe also is getting more expensive. While the inflation-adjusted cost of natural disasters was about $30 billion annually in the 1980s, it’s now more than six times that: an average of $182 billion a year. Governments have improved at implementing policies that protect against some types of disasters. For example, zoning laws can restrict the population living in hurricane-prone areas. But it hasn’t been enough. From 2003 to 2013 alone, natural disasters caused $1.5 trillion in damages, killed more than 1.1 million people and affected more than 2 billion. At the same time, it’s not as if governments are finding they have more room in their budgets to clean up a crisis – or to build the resilience measures that could help prevent them. Enter a new idea that could transform not only the global economy, but how disasters affect us: a resilience bond. As well as guaranteeing help to communities after a catastrophe, it would help fund projects and strategies they need to become less vulnerable to begin with. “Resilience bonds are, in my view, the next exciting and innovative frontier in infrastructure and resilience finance,” says Samantha Medlock, former senior advisor to the Obama White House on resilience and now senior vice president at Willis Towers Watson. The concept is part of an overall trend, experts say, that could transform how communities work: as risk modelling has become more and more sophisticated, the private sector is getting closer to being able to turn not only risk, but resilience, into numbers. It’s like a life insurance company being able to tell you not only how likely you, specifically, are to have a heart attack in the next five years, but also exactly how much walking a half hour a day or cutting out red meat could reduce that risk… and what that increase in health is likely to be worth, in cash, to your future. That ability to put ‘hard numbers’ on what previously have been seen as ‘soft’ concepts, like the value of resilience, is huge, industry insiders say. “It will be a financial and scientific revolution, and it will save billions of dollars and thousands, if not millions, around the world of lives,” says Douglas. Fix-it mentality When it comes to preparing for future disasters, humanity tends to be woefully optimistic. In the same way that it’s difficult to convince individuals to fork out money for a life insurance policy, it’s tough to get governments to carve out spending for just-in-case scenarios when they also need to prioritise streets and schools. Worldwide, just 26% of economic losses due to natural disasters were covered by insurance in 2016. “That means people dying or suffering, and governments and aid agencies and charity and philanthropy filling that gap. Or not filling that gap, as the case may be,” says Daniel Stander, managing director of consulting company Risk Management Solutions (RMS), which works with companies and governments to model and manage catastrophe risk. Buying insurance for your household (or city) is one thing. Another is making your community resilient to begin with. Here’s the problem: it’s difficult to pay for something when the risk of doing nothing is hard to quantify. In other words, it’s not enough to only determine how likely a city is to experience a magnitude eight earthquake at a specific depth. You also have to know how many buildings that would destroy, lives it would disrupt – and the likelihood and extent of that financial loss. Without figuring out both the cost and the probability of risk, you can’t determine the value of resilience – like adopting an earthquake-resistant building code. The resulting lack of hard numbers means communities historically haven’t been rewarded upfront for thinking ahead – whether by credit ratings agencies, insurance companies or even their own central governments. And that’s made it difficult to decide to spend on resilience now… rather than kicking the decision to the next mayor or CEO and hoping a disaster won’t happen on your watch. But that tends to be a bad move long-term – especially as for major crises, making the needed changes now tends to be cheaper than rebuilding after. One recent study reported that each dollar spent by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) on disaster preparedness in the US saved $4 later. Other cases can be more extreme. One analysis of flood prevention measures in Kinshasha in the Democratic Republic of Congo found that every dollar spent on measures like constructing small dams, cleaning drainage canals and seeding watersheds with grass saved at least $45.58 during the following rainy season. But with a fix-it ethos still more common than a plan-ahead one, it’s no wonder that governments have found themselves vulnerable to big financial losses. In the US, flooding is the largest source of financial exposure for the federal government after only Medicare and social security. That has led to struggles. In 2011, the worst global natural catastrophe loss year on record, the country had $116 billion in damage claims. Fema’s National Flood Insurance Programme (NFIP), which provides insurance to flood-prone communities, is more than $24 billion in debt. But it wasn’t until September 2016 that NFIP bought its own re-insurance programme, effectively transferring more than $1 billion of risk out of taxpayers’ wallets and into the reinsurance market. People will have to shift their entire thinking about how disaster recovery is funded – and by whom, experts say. “There’s a perception that, following a disaster, the federal government’s role is to make you whole and rebuild homes and infrastructure and community at the federal taxpayer’s expense. And that is simply not true,” Medlock says. “There are limits to what the federal government can – and should – do.” Fat cat The insurance industry itself, which dates back at least 14th-Century Genoa, may make sense for helping to cover that gap. “No one understands the risk of loss from climate hazards better, I would argue, than the insurance industry,” Stander says. “They’ve become experts at translating hazard into damage, and then damage into cold, hard cash.” But many traditional insurance products aren’t quite right for governments. Take a homeowner’s policy. You pay an insurer, who keeps your money, just in case of, say, a burglary. If you do get burgled, you tell the insurer what you lost and they pay back the value of the items. But as anyone who has had to make a claim knows, that process can take weeks or months. You also run the risk that the insurer could argue over the value… or decide to not pay out at all, as New York University found out to its detriment after a 2015 flood, leading it to sue its insurer for $1.5 billion in denied coverage. Governments can’t run the risk of losing taxpayers’ money. And when it comes to disaster response, no one wants a delay – not least of all because, with each passing day, losses can escalate. Medlock points out Hurricane Sandy. After it hit the east coast of the US in 2012, it took the US Congress about 90 days to agree on an appropriations package for federal disaster assistance. “That three-month delay is very inefficient,” Medlock says. “It creates tremendous uncertainty for survivors, for communities – and for regional economies.” One innovation developed in response is a parametric catastrophe (or ‘cat’) bond. When you buy a cat bond, the insurer doesn’t hold the money in their bank account – it sits in an account beyond their control, so there’s no chance of it disappearing when you need it. There’s another twist, too: whenever there’s a crisis, you don’t have to tell the insurer (let alone prove) exactly what was lost. Instead, the payout happens automatically as soon as a certain parameter is reached – often as quickly as 48 hours later. For a storm cat bond, it might be when storm surge reaches a certain height. That was the trigger chosen by New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) for its first cat bond, which it issued in response to Hurricane Sandy in 2013. (According to reports, the MTA is now issuing its second cat bond). It's worth noting that to have an immediate payout, the parameters that trigger a cat bond, like minimum strength of the storm, require certainty and clarity -- a lesson learned, according to reports, after a Mexican cat band took more than three months to pay out after Hurricane Patricia in 2015. The first federal government to purchase a cat bond was Mexico, which bought a parametric bond in 2006 that was structured by reinsurer Swiss Re to cover damage from earthquakes (and later, hurricanes). Today, says Nikhil da Victoria Lobo, Swiss Re’s Americas leader for global partnerships, some 40 federal governments worldwide have purchased similar protection. “When we started this discussion in 2006, it was about one risk – earthquakes; one country – Mexico; and one transaction – Mexico’s first cat bond. Today, there are so many sovereign nations doing this,” he says. But that’s still only one-quarter of countries worldwide. And whenever governments are unprepared for a catastrophe, the consequences get even worse. The knock-on effect of a disaster can include everything from disrupting supply chains to a power outage that stops production. So far, most entities have been able to manage disruptions, Standard & Poor wrote in a recent report. But “looking ahead,” it added, “the picture is less certain.” If a disaster causes an economic cascade effect, S&P wrote, in the most extreme cases, certain governments could see a downgrade of four-to-five notches in their credit rating – the equivalent of moving from investment-grade to junk bond status. By affecting everything from car insurance payments to homeowners’ insurance, that’s enough to send a country’s economy into a tailspin. The trick is to prevent disasters from becoming so deadly and damaging to begin with. And that’s where the resilience bond comes in. Pilot project A resilience bond is “an innovative variation on the cat bond”, says Medlock. It would work like this: imagine City X wants to build higher seawalls or fix its levee, but doesn’t have access to funds. When it goes to buy a multiyear, parametric cat bond for flooding, the insurer takes the expected impact of that planned investment into account and lowers the premium the city has to pay. With that cost saving in the budget, City X now has the money to fund its seawalls and levee – even if no disaster ever occurs. At the moment, this hasn’t happened yet. But it’s close. “We’re probably not years away from this sort of a concept becoming real,” says Medlock. “We could be months away.” One government leader interested in piloting the concept is Greg Guibert, the chief resilience officer of Boulder, Colorado. He recently partnered with the Stanford Urban Resilience Initiative for a workshop on innovative solutions for resilience finance. Just a few days later, he says “my head is kind of spinning” from the potential tools he was introduced to – especially the concept of a parametric resilience bond. Like many other local leaders, Guibert has had difficulty with funding resilience. Disaster recovery money came in after a devastating 2013 flood, he says, “but the federal funds have dried up. So we’re looking at more innovative avenues for financing.” A resilience bond appeals because you could use a dividend from a resilience bond to capitalise even less infrastructure-based types of resilience programmes, like community-building exercises that strengthen disaster response by encouraging neighbours to look out for one another. “I’m never going to be able to add enough zeros to a city budget required to achieve that otherwise,” Guibert says. But as long as a resilience bond remains untested, it can be a hard sell to others at the local level. “The ultimate value of local government is to protect the residents and property,” says Guibert. “So if you make a large alteration in how you do that, you really want some assurance that you’re making an appropriate choice for our citizens. That can be a hard leap when we’re talking about really major investments.” It isn’t just local governments that would need to come on board before the first resilience bond actually makes a trade. Other entities that are integral for providing financing – like the US Government Finance Officers Association, or rating agencies – will have to agree in the innovation’s merit, too. “Until those people give credit to that decision-maker, and thereby bring down their financing costs, you’re never going to create a tangible and monetised cash flow” to fund the project, says da Victoria Lobo. But from the amount of excitement around the products to S&P’s increasing recognition of climate change, da Victoria Lobo says, “I think we’re a lot closer than we think we are.” No one knows exactly how much of an effect a product like this could have on encouraging resilience investment. But with both the number and the expense of natural disasters on the rise, it seems fair to say that this kind of incentive won’t come a moment too soon.

Sovereign Credit Risk Analysis,Trading on superstition,2024-09-14,2012-08-01,David Wolman,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20120731-bulls-bears-and-black-cats,"Would you invest in a fund that trades on superstition? David Wolman has, and in the process he discovers unsettling truths about how we treat and handle money. When Shing Tat Chung was a baby, his parents changed his name on the advice of a fortune teller. The soothsayer warned that the name they had given him at birth had “too much fire”, whatever that means. The new one, which also happens to be his current one, “is supposed to be more balanced and carry a good fortune,” Chung told me. “I will also apparently make lots of money with this name,” he says, laughing. That’s a relief because I recently gave him some of my money. More specifically, I put $200 into an experimental investment fund Chung launched in June. Mind you, this guy is not some stock-picking savant who finished Stanford Business School at the age of 15. Chung is a 25-year-old newly minted graduate in design from the Royal College of Art in London. Fascinated by superstitions and their wider, yet often overlooked, ramifications for society, Chung decided to start The Superstitious Fund Project. Some people trust Windsor-knotted stock traders and mutual fund managers to grow their money. Others use algorithms designed to respond to various market conditions so that – one hopes – they deliver earnings. Still others buy gold, plunk it in a vault, and pray that it will be worth more on some future date than it is today. How odd is it then, really, to calculate trade decisions by way of astrology and numerology? The fund works like this: stock trades are carried out by an Automated Trading System (colloquially, a “robot”), which is a computer program that buys, sells or holds stocks based on a set of specifications encoded into the program’s governing algorithm. The code for Chung’s experiment was written by Jim Hunt, who runs a firm called Trading Gurus, and together with Chung they named it “Sid the Superstitious Robot”. (They also decided to make the source code completely transparent and free to download.) Like many investment models, Sid is an automated speculator. But whereas other algorithms might take action based, for instance, on a stock’s recent performance or the price of oil, the criterion for this program are lunar phases and the affection and disaffection people have for certain numbers. “I wanted it to operate based on human characteristics,” Chung says. Sid won’t buy anything on the 13th of the month, and steers clear of buying or selling any stock if its value happens to have a 13 in it. As for lunar phases, Chung explains with a hint of pride that the algorithm finds a new moon to be “good”, whereas a full moon is very, very bad. “The closer the moon is to being full, the more it effects us,” Chung says. So as the full moon approaches, the robot – instead of starting to grow claws and thick brown hair – sells more, as if it is nervous about the moon’s impact on multinational corporations and the decision-making capabilities of senior management. If you’re wondering how this automated yet temperamental trader handles an eclipse, one word: sell. And get this: the robot’s beliefs evolve. People are constantly seeing correlations in the world and interpreting them as patterns that they can or should act upon. Sid also generates new, albeit irrational, beliefs and acts on them. Cautious not to leave any spiritual stone unturned, Chung went as far as seeking the advice of a fortune teller to help him determine the most prudent launch date. When her first suggestion conflicted with a prior engagement already on Chung’s calendar, she used her powers and a sacred pendant to “visualise” another option: 1 June. It all sounds rather ridiculous, until you discover that Sid and the Superstitious Fund illuminate some disquieting truths. On the one hand, magical thinking is, of course, everywhere: unlucky numbers; the dangers of Friday the 13th; boosted birth rates in the year of the dragon; holding one’s breath when driving past a cemetery; black cats, rabbit’s feet, horoscopes, crossed fingers, lucky underwear, and every palm reader, healer, mystic, shaman, soothsayer and woo-woo yoga instructor from New York to New Guinea. But the last thing you want is the steward of your money making decisions based on slight vibrations in the cosmos. When it comes to matters financial, we’re all business, right? Hardly. A generation of behavioural economics research has demonstrated that standard predictions of how we treat and handle money have woefully misread Homo sapiens. Rational we are not. For example, a tax incorporated into a price tag on supermarket shelves makes us more frugal, whereas an equivalent tax added at checkout is virtually ignored. We also spend the same money differently depending on whether it’s labelled credit, rebate, or bonus, and our willingness to pay for stuff is heavily influenced by the payment method. One recent article listed eleven ways in which consumers behave irrationally when confronted with maths. There are probably more. When it comes to moo-la, the technical term for us is “cuckoo”. Economic impact  Inconsistencies born from biases and tricks of the mind are one thing; superstition is another. The idea of a “Friday 13th effect” came to prominence thanks to a 1987 study by Robert Kolb and Ricardo Rodriguez, two finance professors at the University of Miami, who found that you are more likely to lose in the stock market on that day, as opposed to a “normal” Friday. Their findings have since been disputed by other stock market studies, but Kolb and Rodriguez say the paper was published tongue-in-cheek. Their point was not that the day itself had an effect, it was to illustrate how superstition has an effect on our behaviour. These beliefs have a massive, and largely negative, impact on the economy –boom times for fortune tellers notwithstanding. Chung has estimated that Friday the 13th costs the US alone hundreds of millions of dollars, due not only to all those elevators and buildings indicating the absence of a 13th floor, but also lost revenue due to shortened vacations and purchases bypassed because of that unlucky date. Realtors in Hong Kong have reported that apartments deemed haunted might sell for as little as 40% of what a comparable un-haunted apartment might bring in. According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, the majority of stock traders in Shanghai are not bankers pursuing value based on market analysis, but everyday individuals who “gamble on numerical superstitions, with little understanding of concepts from the financial arena.” Not that those who have mastered said “concepts” have necessarily done great things for anyone of late. “Given the failure of all these sophisticated mathematical models that have turned geniuses into morons over the years,” says Marc Hochstein, executive editor of the financial services daily American Banker, “it’ll be interesting to see how a model [like Sid] that intentionally has no rhyme or reason performs.”   Three years ago, a finance professor in Copenhagen looked at 80 years worth of data from the New York Stock Exchange, S&P 500, the Dow Jones Composite Average, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and tried to determine whether the 362 solar and lunar eclipses that took place over that time period affected investment decisions and the economy. “[T]he stock market is an ideal breeding ground for superstition,” wrote Gabriele Lepori, who found below-average returns during times of “negative superstitious events”, like eclipses. His and other researchers’ findings suggest that we resort more heavily to superstition when there is high uncertainty, the stakes are high, and when we perceive outcomes to be essentially beyond our control. The great irony, of course, is that superstitions are supposed to protect us from misfortune. Yet they do the opposite. They are expensive, and their cost is borne by believers and eye-rollers alike. Unproven experiment For Chung, the whole thing was personal at first but it quickly snowballed. He comes from a family that subscribes to many superstitions. His mother never orders seven dishes at a restaurant (unlucky number) and has filled the house with lucky bamboo and statues of the Buddha holding gold (lucky vegetation, deity, and metal respectively). More recently, she decided at the last minute not to buy a house because the feng shui of the place was off; a decision made because of the direction the toilet faced. After maintaining a blog about superstition for a while, Chung decided that a fund that actually trades on the FTSE100 would be an interesting way to explore the murky intersection of value, faith and the economy. “Where money and risk are involved,” he says, “superstition is there lurking in the background” – at casinos, of course, but also on Wall Street. “I wanted to poke fun at our superstitions,” he says, “but I also wanted to highlight our irrational nature in a way that is less critical and more about encouraging dialogue.” At present he plans to let the fund run for a year, tracking its performance against various indices and other funds, both managed and automated. Should there be gains, he will send dividends to people like me who threw down for a stake in this otherworldly approach to playing the markets. (Yes, his mother is an investor, to the tune of £100/$157) If the whole thing tanks, the money is gone. Poof. But at least investors are aware of that risk ahead of time, not to mention reminded of it in every correspondence from Chung, which now includes the cautionary e-mail tag: Please be aware, that this is an unproven, highly speculative, experiment and a project with the risk of total loss. Meanwhile, everyone and their cousin is reaching out to him to share titbits about their personal superstitions, and he is currently making the rounds to talk with future-of-money thinkers in London, audiences at Microsoft, CNBC, CNET, The Wall Street Journal, among others. Has the whole experience made him want a career in finance? “Definitely not,” says Chung; he finds the prospect of losing other peoples’ money quite worrisome. After three weeks of trading the fund had dropped 12% from its starting value of £5,000, while the NASDAQ100 and Hang Seng Index rose around 4% during this period. It has since rebounded a little; at the time of writing the fund is around -5% of its starting amount. Is losing 5% of value horrible? Depends whom you ask and what you compare it to. In the age of Libor, Lehman, Madoff, and sovereign debt write-offs, maybe it’s not so bad. I guess I’ll find out next spring, and BBC Future will follow up with Chung to find out how both he and the fund have fared over the course of this experiment. Besides, speculation is just that: not a sure bet. “When you gamble,” says Chung, “you either win or lose.” When you put it that way, maybe the more rewarding way to lose $200 would have been an impromptu trip to Las Vegas. Then again, I’m a Cancer, and Cancers aren’t prone to such rash behaviour.

Sovereign Credit Risk Analysis,Sri Lanka in first debt default in its history,2024-09-14,2022-05-19,By Peter Hoskins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61505842,"Sri Lanka has defaulted on its debt for the first time in its history as the country struggles with its worst financial crisis in more than 70 years. A 30-day grace period to come up with $78m (£63m) of unpaid debt interest payments expired on Wednesday. The governor of the South Asian nation's central bank said the country was now in a ""pre-emptive default"". Later on Thursday, two of the world's biggest credit rating agencies also said Sri Lanka had defaulted. Defaults happen when governments are unable to meet some or all of their debt payments to creditors. It can damage a country's reputation with investors, making it harder for it to borrow the money it needs on international markets, which can further harm confidence in its currency and economy.  Asked on Thursday whether the country was now in default, central bank governor P Nandalal Weerasinghe said: ""Our position is very clear, we said that until they come to the restructure [of our debts], we will not be able to pay. So that's what you call pre-emptive default. ""There can be technical definitions... from their side they can consider it a default. Our position is very clear, until there is a debt restructure, we cannot repay,"" he added. Sri Lanka is seeking to restructure debts of more than $50bn it owes to foreign creditors, to make it more manageable to repay.  The country's economy has been hit hard by the pandemic and rising energy prices, but critics say the current crisis has been of the previous government's own making. A chronic shortage of foreign currency and soaring inflation have led to a severe shortage of medicines, fuel and other essentials.  Professor Mick Moore from the University of Sussex and former consultant on Sri Lanka for the Asian Development Bank said even though it looked like Sri Lanka was struggling from the effects of global economic problems, it was ""emphatically not that"". ""This is the most man-made and voluntary economic crisis of which I know,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Prof Moore said the previous administration had borrowed money for infrastructure projects and then ""insisted in this very macho fashion"" on repaying mounting the debts, rather than restructuring them with creditors.  He said the then government ""went along in this way until about six months ago and basically they had given away virtually all the foreign exchange they could command"". ""This is egregious incompetence,"" he added. Prof Moore said the country faced a ""very critical situation"". In recent weeks, there have been large, sometimes violent, protests against President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his family due to the growing crisis. The country has already started talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a bailout and needs to renegotiate its debt agreements with creditors.  Later on Thursday, an IMF spokesman said the current talks on a potential loan programme were expected to conclude on Tuesday.  Sri Lanka's government has said previously that it needs as much as $4bn this year. Mr Weerasinghe warned that Sri Lanka's already very high rate of inflation was likely to rise further. ""Inflation obviously is around 30%. It will go even [higher], headline inflation will go [up] around 40% in the next couple of months,"" he said. He was speaking after Sri Lanka's central bank held its two key interest rates steady following a seven percentage points rise at its last meeting. The country's main lending rate remained at 14.5%, while the deposit rate was kept at 13.5%. In many ways this wasn't a surprise. The warning sirens of a potential default were already blaring a few weeks ago.  But much more than that, on the streets of Sri Lanka, where this crisis is biting, nobody is shocked.  As petrol queues run for miles, with fuel being sold on the black market for eye-watering amounts, as lines for handouts of free bread get longer by the day, the island's inability to pay back debts is being painfully felt.  In his first interview since taking office last week, the country's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told me things would get worse before they improve in Sri Lanka, but even he wasn't able to predict just how bad.  ""No-one has got all the details… so I will be like a doctor who's opening up the patient for the first time.""  Today's default is a depressing diagnosis for a nation facing more economic turmoil, even as talks with the IMF and other nations continue.  On Thursday, ratings agency Moody's Investors Service said Sri Lanka had ""defaulted on its international bonds for the first time"".  Moody's said it expected the country to eventually reach an agreement over an IMF bailout. ""However, finalising the programme will likely take several months given the need for staff level agreement on both sides, followed by parliamentary approval in Sri Lanka and approval by the IMF's executive board,"" the firm added.   Also on Thursday, Fitch Ratings lowered its assessment of Sri Lanka to a ""restricted default"" after a grace period for payments had expired.  S&P Global Ratings did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. Credit ratings are intended to help investors understand the level of risk they face when buying a financial instrument, in this case a country's debt - or sovereign bond. Last month, S&P and Fitch credit rating agencies warned Sri Lanka was about to default on its debts. Last week, President Rajapaksa's elder brother Mahinda resigned as prime minister after government supporters clashed with protesters. Nine people died and more than 300 were wounded in the violence.  On Friday, Sri Lanka's new Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told the BBC that the economic crisis was ""going to get worse before it gets better"".  He also pledged to ensure families would get three meals a day.  Appealing to the world for more financial help, he said ""there won't be a hunger crisis, we will find food""."
Sovereign Credit Risk Analysis,Where young people are getting richer,2024-09-14,2018-07-10,Maddy Savage,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180709-unlike-most-millennials-norways-are-rich,"Young Norwegians have enjoyed a 13% rise in disposable household income, bucking a downward trend in other strong economies. Will this golden age last? Young people across the western world are on track to become the first generation to grow up poorer than their parents. So how are millennials in just one country bucking this trend? It’s old news that university debts and rocketing housing costs are common concerns for people born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s, living in the US, the UK and many other countries. Multiple studies suggest this group will be the first in recorded history to end up poorer than those which came before. But perhaps this doesn’t have to be a foregone conclusion. In Europe’s northernmost country, things are decidedly different. Best known for its Viking history, snow sports and jaw-dropping fjords, Norway is making a new name for itself as the only major economy in Europe where young people are getting markedly richer. People in their early thirties in Norway have an average annual disposable household income of around 460,000 kroner (around $56,200). Young Norwegians have enjoyed a 13% rise in disposable household income in real terms compared to Generation X (those born between 1966 and 1980) when they were the same age. These startling figures come from the largest comparative wealth data set in the world, the Luxembourg Income Database, and were analysed in a recent report on generational incomes for the UK Think Tank The Resolution Foundation. Compare this with young people in other strong economies: US millennials have experienced a 5% dip, in Germany it’s a 9% drop. For those living in southern Europe (the southern Eurozone suffered the brunt of the global economic crisis in 2008), disposable incomes have plunged by as much as 30%. Norway’s youth unemployment rate (among 15- to 29-year-olds) is also relatively low at 9.4% compared to an OECD average of 13.9%. ‘A lucky situation’ On a rare scorching day in the Norwegian capital Oslo, it’s not difficult to find young locals who embody the country’s good fortunes. “I don’t really think about how I spend my money,” says Aleksander Aarnes, a 25-year-old graduate. “I go to the theatre about once a month, go to the cinema once a month. I can go out and eat and drink with friends... I go on vacation (holiday).” Aarnes is pursuing a career writing for musical theatre, but is yet to earn anything for his efforts, so he funds his lifestyle by working just one or two shifts a week in a supermarket in Korsvoll, a sleepy suburb dotted with large detached pastel-coloured wooden houses. He shares an apartment with a friend in another suburb about a 20-minute bus ride from the city centre. “I’m really aware of the lucky situation I am in... I don’t have to sacrifice too much to pursue the career I want,” he says. Aarnes’ hourly pay starts at 164 Norwegian kroner (around $20), increasing for weekend and evening shifts. After taxes (which are comparatively high in Scandinavia) he’s left with around 14,000 kroner ($1700) a month, of which he sets aside half for rent, travel and bills and uses the rest for “whatever else” he likes. Further down the road in Korsvoll, a 31-year-old business analyst called Øystein is packing his BMW with supplies for a barbecue. He doesn’t want to share his full name, arguing that “even though Norway is rich, people don’t really want to talk about how rich they are personally.” But he admits he earnt enough to buy a two-bedroom apartment on the waterfront when he was 27 and regularly goes on holiday to the US and Asia.   What’s Norway doing differently? A huge part of young Norwegians’ fantastic lifestyle is down to the country’s rapid economic growth. After seeing the biggest increase in average earnings of any large high-income economy between 1980 and 2013, it now leads multiple global rankings for wealth and wellbeing. It weathered the global recession well. Last year it came top of the 2017 Legatum Prosperity Index, which analyses 110 countries around the world. Norway’s huge oil and gas sector is the clear driving factor behind the nation’s economic boom over the last three decades, following major discoveries in the North Sea (although falling energy prices in recent years have had an impact). But as Hilde Bjørnland, an economics professor based at BI Norwegian Business school in Oslo explains, it is not just how much money Norway makes that’s significant, but what it does with it. “It has managed the oil [money] well in that it is saving, and using a portion of that to put back into society,” she says. “So rather than a few getting a lot, many people have access to this wealth.” Norway has done this by storing its money in the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. In simple terms, this is a giant savings pot which makes money by investing in more than 9000 companies. It is currently worth around $1 trillion. In spite of this savings pot, taxes are kept high and the country has a compressed wage structure, which means minimum salaries are negotiated by unions. “Young people and people in lower-paid industries have [experienced] the growth rates in their wages each year... and the differences between those who earn a little and those who earn a lot are not so large as in other countries,” says Bjørnland. The Resolution Foundation’s report on generational income concludes that rising inequality has been a core factor in driving down disposable incomes for millennials in other strong economies such as the US, UK and Germany. In these countries, where there are wider wage bands, young people bear the brunt of a lack of pay growth and job mobility. By contrast, Bjørnland argues that an egalitarian approach – distributing wealth between generations – has contributed to strong life satisfaction and a lack of social unrest in Norway. High welfare payments and heavily subsidised health care also help when it comes to pitting Norwegian millennials' prospects against those elsewhere in Europe. Unemployment benefits are generous: allowing many people to claim around 60% of their previous salary for two years, while they are looking for new work. As in all the Nordic countries, low childcare costs and a general parental leave system also ensure a high participation of women in the workforce. Free education at most schools and public universities and easy access to loans (which borrowers don’t pay interest on while they are studying) alongside high employment rates for students are also part of the jigsaw. “It’s a significant factor that while young people are studying, they’re able to have a job on the side,” says Bjørnland, who adds that this kind of casual work can often bring in a higher income for young people in Norway than those in other western countries. Her sentiment is shared by many of the throngs of students cooling off in the Åkerselva river just a few metres from the shiny glass buildings that dominate the business school’s campus. “It’s not that difficult to find a job here and they’re always really well-paid. So it helps a lot, to cover your leisure life and your studies,” says Gabriella Sanzana, a 27-year-old from Chile, who’s doing a master’s in human rights while working part-time as a waitress. “I have to pay a lot of taxes, but I don’t really care, because I know that [the state] gives you so many things at the same time.” A secure future? Despite Norway’s glowing CV, there are concerns about sustaining its success. High youth employment is declining, according to Investing in Youth: Norway, a recent OECD report, which states that the number of job opportunities for 15 to 29-year-olds doesn’t match up with the amount needed for a swelling youth population, which rose by 18% between 2007 and 2016. Immigration accounted for over four-fifths of this increase and unemployment among Norway’s foreign-born population is currently around 10%. Kristian Heggebø, a senior researcher at the Centre for Labour and Welfare Research at Oslo Metropolitan University, argues that while well-educated international students and labour migrants from elsewhere in Europe “tend to do well on the jobs market,” there are persistently high levels of “labour market discrimination against ethnic minorities.” “To some extent it could be [because of] a lack of qualifications, but there is no doubt in my mind that the issue is on the demand side and not the supply side,” he says. Heggebø argues that there is “firm empirical evidence” which demonstrates that despite rising immigration over the past two decades, many Norwegian employers are still “sceptical towards hiring someone with a non-Norwegian background.” Even second generation immigrants born and educated in a Nordic country can end up struggling to gain access to the labour market, he says, suggesting that anonymous CVs in the first stages of recruitment could be a crucial part of the solution. Fragmented society Preparing to catch the train home after a day in the sweltering city centre, Ove George, who’s from Nigeria and is currently unemployed, says he believes networking is often the key to getting work in Norway, something that can be tricky for foreigners without Norwegian connections. “The last job I got was through a Norwegian friend I had, and after that I haven’t really got a good job,” he explains. Also at the station is 19-year-old Djibouti-born Kayad Mahammed, who currently works for a media company. He says he’s “not struggling” and personally found it “easy” to get a job. But he adds that he believes “it’s hard to get rich” for many immigrants, who can wind up clinging onto entry-level jobs for fear of ending up unemployed again. Meanwhile, despite the Scandinavian country’s pride over its egalitarianism, there are signs inequality is rising within the wider population, too. OECD figures suggest that the share of Norwegians earning less than half the national average income was 8.1% in 2015, up from 6.9% in 2004, with young people more at risk than any other group. (Although, put this into context, this is still low by global standards – the proportion in the US is 16.8% and 10.9% in the UK.) Those who end up outside of employment, training or education altogether can often feel more vulnerable in Norway than they might in other countries, argues Sebastian Königs, one of the authors of the OECD’s Investing in Youth: Norway report. “For the young Norwegians who are disadvantaged and have social issues, finding their spot in society can be much harder,” he says. “Because generally speaking everyone is doing so well in society, this becomes a stigma.” This cohort is six times more likely to feel depressed than other young Norwegians, nine times as likely to suffer from poor health and more at risk of remaining outside the labour market for the long term, according to OECD figures. The price of success According to Bjørnland, even the wealthiest Norwegians should be wary of its fragility moving forward. “You’re used to having a good time, you’re used to taking long weekends... if you’ve had it like this for a long time you take it for granted,” she says. “But things which have happened in the past might not happen again.” She argues that Norway needs to work harder to diversify its industries in order to remain competitive in future. This might include expanding its technology, raw material and renewable energy sectors, all alongside an emerging start-up scene. It has grown quickly in recent years but still lags behind its Nordic neighbours. Employers will also have to be more open to attracting international talent to fill the jobs created outside its oil and gas sector, she suggests. On the other hand, young Norwegians “used to being able to work wherever they like” may need to become increasingly “focused on where the skills are needed” in order to maintain the same standard of living as millennials entering the workforce today. Solutions? Despite Norway’s current challenges, many experts believe that there is still a huge amount that other nations can learn. At the OECD, Sebastian Königs cites much closer links between education, employment and social services than in most other countries as an effective way of supporting young people in the early stages of their careers. Every Norwegian school leaver gets a personal follow-up phone call to discuss their options if they don’t enter the employment market or pursue further studies, for example. He argues that while Norway’s population is just 5.1 million, larger nations could still replicate these policies if they wanted to. “This isn’t about the size of the country, this is about how much resources you’re willing to invest in it... Norway perceives this to be a central priority, and it should be.” Meanwhile, Kristian Heggebø says he believes that even if oil is taken “totally out of the equation” and Norway is forced to reshape its economy in the future, it will continue to prosper as a result of its egalitarian approach and safety net for young people. “If we keep these components in place then I’m willing to bet everything that I own that we will still be performing at a very, very high level compared to other European countries, simply because we have a way [to deal with] difficulties that is more humane.”"
