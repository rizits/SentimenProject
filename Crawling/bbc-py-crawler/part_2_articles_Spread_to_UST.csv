Spread to UST,The unlikely place where surfing may have started,2024-09-25,2024-09-09,Heather Jasper,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240909-the-unlikely-country-that-may-have-invented-surfing,"For at least 3,500 years, fishermen along the Peruvian coast have been making reed-bound boats and surfing the waves back to shore. Three-metre-high waves crash onto Playa El Mogote in the northern Peruvian seaside village of Huanchaco. Gazing out into the beach, a mix of locals and international tourists surf in the Pacific, but around a curve in the coastline, the arched prows of caballitos de totora line the beach, their bows pointing towards the ocean. For at least the past 3,500 years, Huanchaco's fishermen have been using these reed crafts to surf. Known as tup in Mochica, one of Peru's extinct Indigenous languages, or caballitos (""little horses"") in Spanish, these ancient crafts are made with tightly tied bundles of totora reeds that grow in freshwater ponds near the coast. Their signature upturned, narrow bow both slices through and pops up over the waves. The Pacific is anything but peaceful here, and in recent years its epic swells have been drawing modern surfers from around the world. But for those who have lived on this coast for thousands of years, caballitos were the only thing that could punch through the waves to help them reach their fishing areas before letting them surf their way back to the beach. Huanchaceños who still make caballitos are proud of their crafts, which some have claimed are one of the world's earliest surfboards, though every year fewer people here are learning the art of cultivating totora and constructing caballitos. Now, this ancient tradition is at risk of disappearing in the next few decades. Surfing is commonly believed to have been invented in Hawaii and petroglyphs depicting people riding waves date to at least the 12th Century CE. Yet, the Chan Chan Museum near Huanchaco and the Larco Museum in Lima display ancient ceramics showing people and gods using caballitos to surf, fish and even transport prisoners that predate this. ""Nobody here fishes with a wooden boat,"" said Carlos Ucañan Arzola, one of Huanchaco's last caballito makers. ""Totora is traditional and ancestral, from the Mochicas (also known as the Moche culture dating from the 1st-8th Centuries CE). This totora was preserved in Chan Chan,"" he added, referring to the 7th-Century Chimú city whose centre is only 5km from Huanchaco. Renowned Peruvian historian María Rostworowski believes these ceramics may date back even earlier to at least 1400 BCE. Caballitos measure about 4m long, a little under 1m wide and can carry loads up to 100kg. When they're dry, the boats weigh about 40kg, but after a morning fishing, they can weigh twice that and must be set upright on the beach to dry for a day or two. Today, Huanchaco's roughly 40 remaining fishermen all still use caballitos when they go out to set or check their nets. But as large commercial fishing boats have encroached on the coast, and an increase in erosion and litter often leaves the nets tangled or ripped, fishermen say the trade is becoming less profitable every year. As a result, many Huanchaceños have turned to tourism or left to seek opportunities elsewhere. ""There's only three men in my generation who fish on a caballito,"" said 30-year-old Edwin Blas Arroyo, who started learning to fish on a caballito from his uncle and grandfather when he was only seven. But even as more and more young people gravitate from fishing to tourism and away from these ancient surfboards towards modern ones, the caballito remains the symbol of Huanchaco. ""In Huanchaco there is a community that's remarkably proud, conscious of their past, the heritage of their culture and their knowledge, which dates to the times of the Mochicas and the Chimús (12th-16th Centuries), people who were intimately linked to the sea,"" wrote Marina Quiñe, a professor of marine biology at Lima's Universidad Científica del Sur in her study The caballito de totora in Huanchaco. ""Since its origin, fishing with a caballito de totora has been practiced without interruption on the Peruvian coast."" According to Enrique Amayo Zevallos', author of Sea and Waves: Rite and Sport of the Tup or Caballito de Totora to the Modern Surf Board, surfing for sport, competition and ritual was usually done on a craft similar to a tup, called tupe, made with a combination of totora reeds, bamboo and sea lion skins. The rituals lasted up until the Spanish banned them for being pagan. ""The purpose of [the tupe] was to have fun cutting through the waves of the sea, or surfing,"" Amayo Zevallos explained. Today, only the tup, which has historically been used for both surfing and fishing, survives. Jordi Rivera Prince, an anthropological bioarchaeologist who specialises in ancient Andean coastal fishing communities, noted, ""The design of a caballito is virtually unchanged in the past 3,500 years … It's history and living culture at the same time."" Totora reeds are a delicate crop, and cultivating, harvesting and transforming them into seafaring vessels is an art passed down through the generations. Fishermen bind the reeds so their triangular stems fit together perfectly and there are no pockets of air left between them. It takes days to dry the fresh reeds and hours to make all four bundles needed to assemble a new craft. Today, most fishermen tie the totora with nylon cords, though in the past they used thin ropes of braided llama fur. With the wear from heavy waves, strong equatorial sun and abrasion from sand and stones, caballitos don't last more than a couple months, so the cords are saved to make new crafts. More like this:  • Peru's mysterious 'horned fortress'  • The floating homes of Lake Titicaca  • Why surfers are heading to 'Cold Hawaii' Though primarily used for fishing today, Ucañan Arzola said he doesn't want their recreational purpose to be forgotten. ""The caballito de totora is also for sport, for surfing the waves."" Ucañan Arzola's father taught him to fish and surf on a caballito, and he's travelled to Australia to represent Huanchaco in a surfing competition, where he surfed on the ancient craft. Looking at caballitos standing upright on the beach, they appear to be made entirely of totora, just as they always have. But watching a fisherman carry his craft to the water, you may also see that the centre of most caballitos' totora bundles are filled with something else. Some fishermen use discarded plastic bottles and some use Styrofoam, but not because they float better. As development spreads along the coast, totora ponds are disappearing. With each new crop of hotels, restaurants and surf shops, marshes are filled in and unregulated sprawl takes over. Just north of Huanchaco, the government has set aside a stretch of coast for growing totora, but according to Ucañan Arzola, it's not enough to meet the demand of even a few dozen fishermen. Each pond is ""owned"" by a family, who cultivates the totora and cuts the reeds as they mature. It can take several months for totora to grow to full height, so families rotate harvesting the reeds from different ponds. As caballitos wear out, rarely is there enough totora to build a new one when it's needed. So, since the mid-1990s, fishermen have had to use some sort of filler to make up for the totora shortage. Despite the challenges, the few remaining caballito fishermen in Huanchaco are determined to keep this tradition alive. ""The fact that it's endured for thousands of years blows my mind. Especially in today's current [economic] culture, there's so many reasons to leave home, but they stay in Huanchaco,"" said Rivera Prince. ""It's a deeply specialised knowledge that I have so much respect for."" Today many caballito fishermen are in their 40s and 50s, and when they surf back to the beach while sitting down and steering with their bamboo pole, two or three young men wade into the water to catch the boat and pull it up on the sand. After each fisherman empties his catch from the hollow in the back of the craft onto the sand, one of the younger men will hoist the caballito on his shoulders and carry it up the beach to dry. Fishermen always share their catch with these helpers, and with older men who can no longer fish but who come to the beach in the morning. Fish are distributed to the younger generation in gratitude and to the older generation out of respect. Fortunately, these reed boats are now being preserved as Huanchaco has developed into a modern surfing destination. As the fishing industry has waned, some caballito-makers have started supplementing their income by offering rides to tourists on their reed boats. Their family members and neighbours are also opening surf shops, teaching the modern sport to visitors. Tourists riding on caballitos sit in the hollow back of the boat, where nets and fish are usually carried. Facing backwards, they don't see the waves coming until they're drenched. These days, passengers are given lifejackets, though the fishermen never use them. Rides usually last about half an hour and cost around 50 Peruvian soles (£10). Now, as in the past, Huanchaco's fishermen have never used modern paddles, instead preferring the rounded half of a 2m bamboo pole that their ancestors have used for thousands of years. Honouring their traditions while also embracing tourism may be the caballito's best chance at survival. According to Ucañan Arzola, it will also take motivation from the next generation. ""They have to get up early to go fishing. They have to have the incentive from a very young age. They have to learn so much about growing totora and about mending fishing nets. It all takes time. Many gravitate to surfing on modern surfboards but the caballito is surfing also,"" he said. Perhaps if the younger generation can remember the caballito's surfing roots, they may be able to ensure its survival. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Spread to UST,Did social media fan the flames of riot in Southport?,2024-09-25,2024-07-31,Marianna Spring,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1e8d7llg9o,"It’s become a familiar pattern of events: a violent, terrifying attack unfolds, innocent people are killed, and social media is set alight with unfounded - and often incorrect - accusations about the assailant's identity and what the motivation was. Think back to the stabbing attacks in Sydney earlier this year, falsely blamed on a Jewish student, or even the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in July. It’s the same with Monday’s attack on a children’s holiday dance and yoga session in Southport, England. A false name - attributed to the 17-year-old accused of killing three little girls as well as injuring eight other children and two adults - spread like wildfire across X, formerly known as Twitter. The BBC is not repeating the false name here to avoid spreading misinformation. Media organisations cannot give the suspect's real name for legal reasons, but Merseyside Police have said the name shared on social media is incorrect. Nevertheless, posts on X sharing the fake name were actively promoted to users and racked up millions of views. Just as with the Sydney attacks and the attempted shooting of Mr Trump, X was the focal point for untrue claims before they spilled onto other sites. It wasn’t just this fake name either. There were false claims the attacker was a refugee who arrived in the UK by boat in 2023 and unfounded speculation he is Muslim. Some of these posts were accompanied by Islamophobic and racist hate. Merseyside Police have confirmed that the 17-year-old they have arrested was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, that he appears to have no known links to Islam, and that they are not currently investigating the attack as terror-related. This all contradicts lots of these claims - but it didn’t stop them poisoning an already toxic online atmosphere. So did these false and unfounded social media posts fan the flames of unrest in Southport? There are lots of different factors contributing to the riot - led by protesters who expressed anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim views - not just social media. After all, protests and violence like this long predate the existence of the internet. Everything from political rhetoric, racism and wider anger about immigration to questions about government and police transparency and timing likely played a part. The fact that some of those at the rally decided to target Southport Mosque suggests that they may have been influenced by the unfounded online accusations that this had been an Islamist terror attack. The police themselves pointed to disinformation online as playing a part in the violence. There was discussion of the rally on regional anti-immigration channels on the Telegram app. Protest movements are often organised in closed chat groups we can’t access.  But false and unfounded claims about the attack expanded beyond the usual online spaces where these kinds of protests are organised. Content being seen by millions of X users, rather than just the fringes of social media, could also normalise some of the hate being pushed. Some of those amplifying these ideas included prominent political commentators and politicians. Others were less well-known, but with a reputation for promoting evidence-free conspiracy theories. Many of these accounts have purchased blue ticks, which means their posts feature more prominently on others' feeds. They are based all around the world too, with several right-leaning American profiles boasting hundreds of thousands of followers becoming very involved. They reshared variations of the false claims, using them to push anti-immigration views and ideas. That was in turn met by backlash denouncing the speculation - which also racked millions of views, but proportionally less than the original claims. Because the issue was picking up so much engagement, it was promoted further by X's algorithm, so that my own feed and those of several others who reached out to me were dominated with these posts as soon as they logged on to their X accounts. Some of the false claims seemed to originate not from these prominent political commentators or known conspiracy accounts though, but from anonymous profiles and pseudo-news accounts. Among the first accounts to share the false name, for example, was Channel 3 Now, which purports to be a legitimate news outlet, but whose origins are very unclear. The social media profiles belonging to the channel suggest it is based in the US or Pakistan, with little information about who actually works for the site. The site has since issued a “sincere apology and correction” following their article and posts, which says “we deeply regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused” and admitted their content was “not accurate”. They have not replied directly to the BBC’s questions. Other profiles - not using real names or images - copy-and-pasted the fake name to their own timelines across different, separate accounts to share the claim more widely. Some of these profiles seemed to belong to real users based in the UK, but others sharing this had the hallmarks of inauthentic accounts. These accounts can be automated or run by groups aiming to manipulate the online debate, and have a track record of posting only divisive content about issues like immigration. This isn’t just about pushing political agendas, either. Tragedies like this can also be exploited online to accumulate likes, views and follows - which in turn can be monetised. X has again been a focal point of this online frenzy, since the platform began allowing its paid blue-tick users to earn a portion of ad revenue for their posts. Their posts are more likely to be recommended on people's feeds, and they may be incentivised to post more controversial or sensational content to boost their views. This all seems to have had an effect on how attacks such as Southport are discussed in the hours and days after they have happened, since these kinds of frenzies are becoming more frequent and intense since the changes to X. On top of this, since Elon Musk took over the social media company, he has changed how it moderates false and hateful content - sacking dozens of employees who worked in these areas and introducing new measures like community notes provided by users to fact-check posts. X has not responded to the BBC’s request for comment. The social media company says publicly that it defends and protects users’ voices on the site. And while this is about a whole lot more than a tidal wave of social media posts, it's yet more evidence of the way the online world can inflame pre-existing tensions in the real world.  And that's a world where three little girls have had their lives cut short."
Spread to UST,A Paralympian's guide to the best of Paris,2024-09-25,2024-07-03,Caroline Harrap,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240703-paralympian-arnaud-assoumani-plans-your-paris-weekend,"Five-time Paralympic medallist Arnaud Assoumani shares his top tips for the City of Light, from must-see museums and the finest French cuisine to the best vintage shopping. The SpeciaList Among his five Paralympic medals, long-time Paris resident Arnaud Assoumani earned a gold in the long jump at the 2008 Games in Beijing – where he also broke the world record in his classification. Beyond his sporting achievements, he is committed to promoting inclusion and equality. As such, as part of the 2024 Cultural Olympiad, he has co-created a dance show, A l'Unisson, to be staged in July. Paris is the City of Light, but come 26 July 2024, it will become a city lit by the Olympic flame. An estimated 15.3 million people are expected to flood its streets when the Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games come to town, ready to experience the excitement against the backdrop of the glamorous French capital. We spoke to Paralympic medallist Arnaud Assoumani, one of the city's favourite adopted sons, to get his Parisian picks. ""I've always loved Paris,"" says the Orsay-born long jumper, who lived in the city for 15 years, first as a student, then returning for his training. ""Even when you've lived here a long time, it still impresses, because the whole city is a work of art."" Having first set his sights on a sporting career as a young boy, Assoumani overcame not only his disability (he was born without a left forearm) but also teenage bullying to achieve his dream. He went on to win five Paralympic medals, including a gold, and now hopes are high for a strong performance in his home country. ""I'm really proud to be able to compete in front of my family, in front of my friends and in front of a French audience,"" says Assoumani. ""But, also, I'm really happy that we have the opportunity to change perceptions around disability while inspiring millions of people along the way."" The world-renowned Paralympian is also an ambassador for Paris 2024 and, like his fellow French citizens, is feeling the buzz generated by the Games. ""Paris is probably one of the most beautiful settings in the world, in terms of its architecture and history, so it's going to be incredible,"" says Assoumani, who now lives in Montpellier but returns to the capital regularly. ""Be sure to take a walk, meet some people from other countries and just feel the atmosphere – that's when you're going to get that really positive vibration."" Here, Assoumani shares his top tips for a memorable stay in Paris – during this summer's Games and beyond. Wherever visitors decide to stay, Assoumani says it's impossible to go too far wrong as Paris is such a compact, walkable city.   Tip The Opening Ceremony for Paris 2024 will be held on the Seine – with many people able to watch that for free. As for the competitions, while most require a ticket, there's still time. ""For the Olympics, it could be a bit more complicated, but for the Paralympics, there are tickets still available from €15,"" says Assoumani. Alternatively, there are free 'fan zones' with giant screens. ""Also, there really is a district for every taste,"" he says. ""For instance, in the Marais, you'll find amazing food, great galleries and some of the best shopping. If you love fashion, you're in the right place."" Another neighbourhood he recommends is the Latin Quarter. ""As well as being close to Notre-Dame, Saint-Michel and Saint-Germain-des-Prés, it is itself very beautiful, and a lot of artists and actors are based in that area."" Alternatively, for a more village-y feel, he suggests heading up to Montmartre: ""There, you have small streets, interesting little shops and a view over the whole city."" As for his own preferred place to stay, he's a big fan of Hôtel Taylor, close to the Marais – due to the ""warm decor, caring staff and because I feel a bit at home there."" Website: paris-hotel-taylor.com Address: 4-6 Rue Taylor, 75010  Phone: +33 (0)1 42 40 11 01  Instagram: @hoteltaylorparis When it comes to restaurant recommendations, Assoumani admits to feeling somewhat conflicted. ""I love every kind of food,"" he says, ""and there are over 35,000 restaurants in Paris"". But he adds that he feels duty-bound to advocate for a classic French experience. ""One of the best known for that is Au Pied de Cochon in the 1st (arrondissement) – a traditional French restaurant that is famous for its food,"" he says. ""Or, if you want to try some snails, another great place is L'Escargot in Rue Montorgueil – a pedestrianised market street. Then there's Les Chouettes, which is really beautiful as it's spread over three floors, in the 3rd."" As for a favourite restaurant, while he struggles to pick just one, Syrian eatery Le Daily Syrien Veggie near Strasbourg-Saint-Denis holds a special place in his heart. ""The ingredients are really fresh and the food is amazing,"" he says. ""I love it there."" Also a fan of Asian cuisine, he recommends the 13th arrondissement, home to the city's Chinatown district, or the Belleville neighbourhood, which has its own Chinese quarter. His preferred choice is the restaurant Lao Siam, in Rue de Belleville, which has been serving up dishes from South-East Asia for almost 40 years. Alternatively, for global flavours ranging from Lebanese to Israeli to African, he proposes the 20th arrondissement – with the diversity of the area, he says, reflected in the food. Website: ledailysyrien.com Address: 72 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Denis, 75010 Phone: +33 (0)1 42 29 33 86  Instagram: @ledailysyrien ""There are some beautiful parks in Paris,"" says Assoumani. ""But to really escape the crowds, I'd suggest getting out of the city and into the woods. To the east, there's the Bois de Vincennes and, to the west, the Bois de Boulogne, and there you're going to be surrounded by trees."" Known as the ""green lungs"" of Paris, these two vast parks are easily accessible by public transport but feel like a million miles away. Ideal for a picnic, a peaceful stroll or to simply be among nature, they offer some more surprising features too. The Bois de Vincennes is the setting for a botanical garden, a hip hangout on a lake and the imposing fortress of the Château de Vincennes; while the Bois de Boulogne encompasses an amusement park, a three-star Michelin restaurant and the contemporary arts space of the Fondation Louis Vuitton. As for parks within the city, among his favourites are the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont in the north-east of Paris – known for its hilly layout, lovely vistas and special features such as a belvedere – and the Jardin des Plantes in the 5th arrondissement. ""That one is home to the natural history museum, many species of plants and a tree that's over 300 years old,"" he says. Alternatively, for a stroll next to the Louvre, he recommends the elegant formal gardens of the Jardin des Tuileries that date to the 1600s. Website: jardindesplantesdeparis.fr/en Address: 57 Rue Cuvier, 75005 Instagram: @jardindesplantesdeparis With his demanding training schedule, Assoumani doesn't get much time to himself. So, when he does have a day off, it's all about catching up on the ""normal"" things. ""I might go to a restaurant with friends, perhaps see a concert or maybe visit a museum,"" he says. ""There are so many great ones in Paris: the Louvre, the Musée D'Orsay, the Musée de l'Homme... They all offer a remarkable experience."" His number-one tip for summer 2024, however, is to go to one of the events taking place as part of the Cultural Olympiad – the official cultural programme of the Games – with some of those events free to attend. ""I would suggest that everyone coming to Paris should check out the Cultural Olympiad,"" says Assoumani. ""From theatre and dance to photography, there's a really rich and varied programme, with more than 2,000 projects – both in Paris and throughout France."" Among the highlights will be the chance to see the monumental tapestry created to commemorate the Paris 2024 Games; just next to the Eiffel Tower, SPOT24 puts a spotlight on the newer disciplines – from BMX and skateboarding to breakdance – and their links with urban cultures; and the Louvre is hosting a special exhibition exploring the history of the Olympics.  Website: olympiade-culturelle.paris2024.org Instagram: @Paris2024 Paris is famously a shopper's paradise. From flea market finds and vintage accessories to the chicest French labels, mouthwatering macarons or gourmet chocolate, there's no shortage of possibilities. ""For clothing, I like to buy something that I will either wear all my life or that's already been used or is upcycled,"" says Assoumani. ""So, the Marais is a good place to go because as well as small designer shops and concept stores, there are vintage places, too, like Kilo Shop. There are loads of great addresses in that area."" For classic French fashion brands, he suggests one of the city's iconic department stores such as Printemps in Boulevard Haussmann; for second-hand and antiquarian books, the historic green kiosks of the bouquinistes along the Seine; or, for those picture-perfect pastel macarons, Pierre Hermé or Ladurée, which have several locations in the city. Another essential experience, he says, is a visit to the famed food market, the Marché des Enfants Rouges. Founded in 1615, the city's oldest market remains renowned for its fresh produce today.

Spread to UST,'I'm lucky I'm still here' - chef Sat Bains,2024-09-25,2024-04-20,By Jude Winter,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-68849509,"A chef has described how he overhauled his lifestyle after surviving a ""widow-maker heart attack"". Sat Bains, who has a Michelin-starred restaurant in Nottingham, suffered a heart attack three years ago. The ""widow-maker"" heart attack is considered one of the deadliest, and occurs when the left anterior descending (LAD) artery leaving the heart becomes completely blocked. Mr Bains said: ""I had to relearn everything that I thought I knew."" But he added: ""Since it happened, I've been on an incredibly life-changing, mental and physical journey.""  Aged in his 50s, Mr Bains said he ""knew his cholesterol was an issue"" and, as a gym-goer, following a keto diet, he was sure he was healthy. After feeling chest pain during a workout, the pain then spread to his arm and jaw during a walk around Wollaton Park with his wife. He dialled 999, and was sent to Nottingham's City Hospital for an emergency operation. After 10 days at the hospital, Mr Bains was discharged, weighing 17kg (2st 9lb) lighter than when he arrived. On the heart attack, he said: ""I'd ruptured one artery, and blocked most of the others, so just two or three millilitres of blood were pumping through one artery. I just didn't think it would happen to me. ""The doctor told my wife Amanda, you're very lucky because he should have died this morning. It was that close."" After leaving hospital, Mr Bains said he struggled to walk, had no appetite, and realised he needed to overhaul his diet and lifestyle. He said he still eats red meat - just not as often - and has swapped out his 200g bars of Dairy Milk to a ""couple of Freddos a week"". He thanked all the staff at City Hospital who cared for him. ""I feel very lucky that I'm still here - and I intend to make the most of it - and that means making sure I maintain a healthy lifestyle,"" he said. Jacob Chacko, consultant cardiac surgeon at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ""Despite the name, widow-makers can affect both men and women, with common risk factors including smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and a family history of heart disease.""

Spread to UST,Column of tractors rolls into Barcelona,2024-09-25,2017-09-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41439787,"Columns of tractors waving the lone-star flag of Catalan independence are converging on the region's towns in support of Sunday's banned referendum. Supporters cheered as a column of vehicles, dubbed a Tractorada, rolled into the capital, Barcelona, streaming past the famous Sagrada Familia church. Catalan leaders have finally revealed the ballot boxes they plan to use. The Spanish government has again pledged to stop the referendum, which it says is unconstitutional. It is crunch time in Catalonia, where for the past five years the region's devolved government has demanded a referendum on independence from Spain, the BBC's Tom Burridge reports from Barcelona. Under a law passed by the local parliament, Catalan leaders say they may declare independence from Spain within 48 hours of the vote.  ""After the official proclamation of the results, which should take a few days. there is a period of 48 hours to proclaim independence but this does not exclude the possibility of us making yet another appeal on the night of the 1st [Sunday] for the need to sit down and talk to resolve this politically,"" Catalan President Carles Puigdemont told BBC News on Friday. The wealthy region of 7.5 million people in north-eastern Spain has its own language and culture, and a high degree of autonomy, but it is not recognised as a separate nation by the Spanish state. Tractoradas could also be seen in Catalan towns like Girona and Tarragona on Friday. ""We are asking for tractors to be parked peacefully near polling stations and, if they try to close them, impede them or make it as difficult as possible,"" a member of one farmers' group, Gerard Batalla, told AFP news agency earlier this week.  ""Simply leave them there, without going further."" A plastic ballot box was shown off to journalists on Friday at a news conference by Catalan Vice-President Oriol Junqueras and Raul Romeva, who handles foreign relations for the Catalan government. Police have been under orders to confiscate all referendum materials and to prevent public buildings being used as polling stations, while key figures in the referendum campaign have been threatened with prosecution. However, teachers and students at some schools are organising to keep them open for the vote, using coded messages on social media to make arrangements. Hundreds of teachers gathered at the regional government's headquarters on Thursday, chanting ""we will open"" and ""we will vote"". A website - escolesobertes.eu (""open schools"") - has been set up so people can track which schools are open. Meanwhile, a smartphone app launched to spread information has been targeted by the courts. Catalonia's high court told Google to delete the ""On Votar 1-Oct"" app from its application store. It said the app violated court orders to suspend the referendum. Mr Puigdemont had recommended that people download the app to learn where to vote on Sunday. It has received more than 1,100 five-star reviews, many of which directly appeal to Google to ignore the court. The referendum's official website domains have also repeatedly been seized. Spain is likely to deploy thousands of national police officers, currently stationed on board two cruise ships docked in Barcelona's port, to disrupt any voting, and ultimately to guarantee Spanish sovereignty over Catalonia, our correspondent says. Restrictions have been introduced on commercial light aircraft and helicopters flying over Barcelona this weekend to prevent activists trailing banners, according to local media.   Spanish government spokesman Iñigo Mendez de Vigo blamed the Catalan government for the stand-off in a BBC interview, suggesting it had been both inflexible and one-sided. ""We can change the constitution if there is a consensus in order to change it,"" he said. ""There isn't a consensus in order to change the Spanish constitution, so this is why the Catalan government acts unilaterally. It takes two to tango and in this case the Spanish government was always ready to talk but they didn't want to dance."" He also told a news conference: ""There will not be any referendum in Catalonia.""  Catalan leaders have appealed for help from the European Union, saying Madrid has undermined the bloc's democratic values. On Friday, European Parliament President Antonio Tajani said the referendum was illegal but that he would work towards a political solution between the Madrid government and the devolved administration."
Spread to UST,'Flexible' lockdown and 'no clear direction',2024-09-25,2020-05-11,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-52627232,"""Johnson under attack for risking staff safety, in back-to-work dash"" is the front-page headline on the Financial Times. It says the prime minister has been criticised by Labour and some unions for encouraging people working in manufacturing and construction to go back to their jobs, without ensuring their safety on public transport and in their workplaces.  The FT's leader says Mr Johnson's approach suggests a ""cavalier attitude towards the welfare of blue-collar workers"". The headline on the front of the Daily Mirror is a direct message to Boris Johnson: ""You must protect the workers.""  Its opinion column states that ""the fight against coronavirus has tragically become a class war"".  It acknowledges that some employers will be responsible and safeguard their staff.  But it goes on to warn that ""there will be exploitative bosses who cut corners or do nothing"". The Daily Telegraph highlights the prime minister's response to those criticising the new rules as contradictory - that the public should ""use good, solid common sense"".   There's a column by the former Conservative leader, Lord Hague, who argues that Mr Johnson's latest slogan, ""stay alert"", has gone down badly because his original one, ""stay at home"", was so good.  He invites readers to consider how people would have reacted if, during the Brexit referendum, ""take back control"" had been changed to ""take back a bit of influence"". The Guardian's headline is ""Johnson providing no clear direction on lockdown exit"".  Its leader argues that after several days of ""mixed messages and confused assertions"", the prime minister urgently needs to come up with a plan which the country ""can understand and unite around"". The website Huffpost UK examines what it calls the ""24 calamitous hours"" in which Mr Johnson's message ""unravelled"".  It casts an eye over the social media response to Sunday night's speech and the government's subsequent updates.  Among the highlights of the reaction, it believes, is a satirical video posted by the comedian, Matt Lucas. In it, he impersonates the prime minister, saying: ""Don't go to work, go to work. Go outside, don't go outside... and then we will or won't, something or other."" On its front page, the Daily Mail celebrates a more positive aspect of the plan to ease lockdown restrictions - the fact that relatives who don't live together will be able to see each other once again.  The headline is ""We ARE going to meet again"".   The Sun takes the story further, reporting on plans for a ""Gran day out""... with ""hugs for grandkids from the 1st of June"". Both the Daily Telegraph and the Sun suggest the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is to announce that the government's coronavirus furlough scheme is to be extended until September.  It was originally due to run until the end of June.  The Telegraph says during that period the taxpayer will cover 60% of wages, instead of the current 80%. The Sun reports that staff who return to their jobs part-time will still qualify for payments.  It quotes the Federation of Small Businesses, saying this will be vital to keep many firms afloat. Under the headline ""Great lockdown divide"", the Daily Mail reveals that different parts of England could emerge from the restrictions at different times.  This would depend, it explains, on where the virus flares up, so, for example, Newcastle would not have to tighten its measures if there was a fresh outbreak in Cornwall. The Daily Express is surprised by a suggestion from the government - that it is considering using waste water to track the spread of Covid-19.  An expert tells the paper that, although the infection can be detected in sewage, it breaks down in water more easily than other viruses, so this may not be the best way to trace it. There's a warning in the Times that the battle to contain the dangerous invasive plant, giant hogweed, may have been lost.  The plant, which was brought into Britain in the 19th Century, secretes chemicals which can cause serious burns.  The Times reports that it has spread to most parts of the country.  It explains that scientists think this year's flooding may have carried seeds downstream to new areas, and the warm weather has helped the species to thrive.  Finally, the Guardian reports that the guitar used by Kurt Cobain during Nirvana's famous ""MTV Unplugged in New York"" concert is to go under the hammer.  The performance took place in 1993, five months before the singer died at the age of 27.  The paper says the instrument will be auctioned in Los Angeles next month, and has a starting estimate of $1m."
Spread to UST,Pressure grows on China to re-open factories,2024-09-25,2020-02-07,By Justin Harper,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51353501,"Companies around the world are waiting for China to re-open its factories and plants on Monday. If this does not happen, major brands from car makers to tech giants will struggle to make their products. Inventories are already running low following widespread shutdowns at Chinese factories forced to close to prevent the spread of the coroanvirus. China, known as the factory to the world, plays a crucial role in the global supply chain and world economy. Apple is one brand that could face shortages with the two major assemblers of its iPhone - Foxconn and Pegatron - based in China.  The tech giant has closed its stores and office in China as it monitors the situation. Chinese authorities told companies to extend the Lunar New Year holidays until 10 February to contain the deadly virus from spreading further. The concern now is of further delays as some local authorities urge factories to remain closed. ''I am quite sure Monday is not realistic, even if virus data are suddenly suggesting that might just be possible. Many people are thinking April is more realistic for the virus peak,'' said Michael Every, head of financial markets Asia-Pacific for Rabobank. The impact has already been felt from the extended shutdown in China's manufacturing sector. Hyundai, the world's fifth biggest carmaker, has been forced to halt production in South Korea as it had run out of parts from China.  Other car makers face similar challenges with Tesla, Volkswagen and Toyota all warning they expect disruptions. ''Every factory faces this same issue,'' said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING. ''The shutdown affects not some particular companies but manufacturing as a whole as it is still uncertain how many factory workers will return to their factory after the extended holiday''. The economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak is spreading far and wide, moving across China's manufacturing sector, major airlines and now global supply chains. Theme parks and casinos have been forced to close their doors including Disneyland theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong, which will be shut for two months. This week casinos in Macau, the world's biggest gambling hub, were asked to temporarily close while Starbucks and McDonalds are among the major food chains to shut outlets. Wynn Resorts said it is losing about $2.5m a day in Macau by remaining closed. The casino employs about 12,000 people in the region."
Spread to UST,Covid vaccine priority list 'overlooks teachers',2024-09-25,2021-01-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-55632961,"The priority list for the coronavirus vaccine overlooks the role of teachers and other front-line workers, an MP has said. Charlotte Appleyard, a Derbyshire teacher, launched a petition for teachers, school and childcare staff to be prioritised for the jab. It has gained more than 460,000 signatures, prompting a discussion among MPs on Monday. The government said its priority is saving lives. Ms Appleyard's petition said putting teachers higher on the list would protect children and their families, reduce school closures and allow them to return to normality faster. Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, opening the debate, said it was not about ""leapfrogging"" others but ensuring teachers are considered too.  Ms Antoniazzi, MP for Gower and herself a former teacher, said research by a teaching union had found a ""three to four"" times higher rate of the virus among teachers than the general population, adding there is a lot of opportunity for it to spread in schools. She added: ""This is not about leapfrogging others that deserve the vaccine.  ""[Charlotte Appleyard] wants consideration about where they are placed on that list.  ""Only NHS staff and healthcare workers have been considered priority groups by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) but I and many others think this overlooks the role teachers and front-line workers have played during this pandemic."" In response, vaccine rollout minister Nadhim Zahawi said the government is ""following the science"" and the JCVI's recommendations in choosing who to vaccinate in the first phase. ""I understand the sentiment behind the petition,"" he added. ""[But] this is about saving as many lives as possible as quickly as possible. ""There is no evidence that teachers or childcare workers are at higher risk of mortality. We are protecting against death in this first phase.""  Speaking to Radio 4 on Tuesday Mr Zahawi said teachers, along with other front-line workers, would be ""top of the list"" once they had finished the first phase of vaccinations.

Capt Tom Moore originally aimed to raise just £1,000 for NHS Charities Together by completing 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday. The Duke of Cambridge hailed him as a ""one-man fundraising machine"". His daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore said: ""There are no words left to say. We cannot believe people's generosity and he's just floored by it."" Ms Ingram-Moore continued: ""We're all speechless. It's not even two weeks since this started. We're just working our socks off supporting him and this phenomenon. ""Yesterday we did 35 interviews and another 17 today but the Yorkshireman takes it all in his stride. ""He's become an A-list celebrity. I'm just the sidekick."" More than a million people have now made donations to his JustGiving page. And more than half a million people have called for Capt Tom to be knighted in a petition to the Honours Committee.  The petition, which was set up earlier this week, has received more than 680,000 signatures after his efforts grabbed the nation's attention. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is looking at ways to recognise his ""heroic efforts"". As he finished the challenge on Thursday, having raised about £14m, Capt Tom said it was ""an absolutely fantastic sum of money"".  In a tweet, he said he would be doing ""less walking"" on Friday but would be talking to TV channels in the United States, Argentina, Europe and the Middle East. Speaking to BBC Radio 2 he said the sum of money was ""absolutely enormous"" and ""very difficult to imagine"". He also thanked everyone who had donated for their support. ""I say thank you very much indeed. I appreciate it because the object for which we're donating is so important and so necessary... I think you're all so kind and thoughtful contributing to this cause,"" he said. The total includes an undisclosed donation from the Duke of Cambridge, who, with the Duchess of Cambridge, recorded a special video message for the veteran. Prince William said: ""It's amazing and what I love also is that he's a 99-year-old war vet.  ""He's been around a long time, he knows everything and it's wonderful that everyone has been inspired by his story and his determination. ""He's a one-man fundraising machine and God knows what the final total will be. But good on him, and I hope it keeps going."" In response, Capt Tom said: ""It's absolutely amazing that my super prince can say something like that."" He also said it was ""a moment we will never forget"". Capt Tom, who is originally from Keighley in West Yorkshire, has seemingly risen from nowhere to the status of near national treasure. Keighley Town Council has tweeted that it will ""honour the fundraising hero"" with the freedom of the town. Capt Tom began raising funds to thank NHS staff who helped him with treatment for cancer and a broken hip. With the aid of a walking frame, he completed 100 laps of the 25-metre (82ft) loop in his garden in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, in 10-lap chunks well before his birthday on 30 April. NHS Charities Together said it was ""truly inspired and humbled"" by his efforts. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Spread to UST,'Damage already done' by travel advice change,2024-09-25,2021-05-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-57255590,"If you speak to people in one of the eight areas worst-hit by the Indian coronavirus variant you'll probably hear the words ""confused"" and ""frustrated"". The government published, and then amended, travel advice for those in the areas of concern after it was accused of introducing ""local lockdowns by stealth"". The BBC has been speaking to people in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, about the effect of these apparent mixed messages. In an attempt to bring down the spread of the Indian variant of Covid, the government told residents they should ""avoid"" travel in and out of the eight worst-affected areas. This initial advice, published with little fanfare last Friday, was updated days later to say such travel should be ""minimised"", along with a reminder to meet outdoors and stay 2m (6ft 6in) apart from anyone in other households where possible. The space between the initial advice and its follow-up was short, but three people from Kirklees have told the BBC the gap was big enough to have an effect on them. Cheryl Burns runs a cafe in Huddersfield and a holiday cottage in Holmfirth, and says the initial advice was ""devastating"". She had opened her holiday cottage in April, and greeted her first indoor customers at the cafe just a week ago. ""For then this to come out and nobody knew. It's just chaos. It just felt it was all being snatched back,"" she says. She says she is relieved that the advice has been updated, but ""the damage is already done"". ""I've spoken to friends in hospitality and they have already had cancellations and had to refund people,"" she says. She said the industry had already been hit hard and fears confusion over the official advice will cause people to hesitate in visiting. ""Although they have clarified it, it sets doubts in people's minds. What we don't need is people being jumpy."" Jonathan Hughes, 58, has terminal cancer. He lives in Gomersal and had been planning to go to Edinburgh on 1 June to visit his son. The hotel they had planned to stay at had a seven-day cancellation policy which meant they had little choice but to cancel on Tuesday, he says. ""We felt rather bounced into a position we didn't want to be in. ""We'd spent rather a lot as I've a limited time to enjoy myself and we didn't want to lose it."" Jonathan says the confusion was ""so unnecessary"" and questions why it was posted on the government website on Friday evening. He says it seems to him that someone was in too much of a hurry for the weekend to think of the consequences. Jonathan says the hotel allowed them to move their booking, and he hopes to still get away on 1 June as planned. ""The room is still available so it may be game on yet,"" he says. Elizabeth Pannell's son will mark his 1st birthday on 29 May without a big party. ""My son was born during the first lockdown, and the first year of his life has been spent in isolation with me and his dad,"" says the 30-year-old, from Cleckheaton. She has decided not to hold a party because of concerns about Covid, despite friends and family asking if she was. ""I was very cautious, holding off planning anything. So when it all blew up at the start of the week I felt vindicated. Now it's all changed."" Elizabeth says she would not have rearranged a party even if she had organised one. ""I think I would have just left it, the government don't know what page they are on themselves and it could all change again in a couple of days. ""Locking towns down is not the way to go, I think.

Spread to UST,Ebola in DR Congo 'not yet global crisis',2024-09-25,2018-05-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44164027,"An Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is not yet an international public health emergency, the World Health Organization has said. It said there was a ""strong reason to believe that the outbreak can be brought under control"". At least 45 people are believed to have been infected in the current outbreak and 25 deaths are being investigated. Cases emerged in a rural area with one now confirmed in the north-western city of Mbandaka. The city of about one million people is a transport hub on the River Congo, prompting fears that the virus could now spread further, threatening the capital Kinshasa and surrounding countries. Ebola is an infectious illness that causes internal bleeding and often proves fatal.  It can spread rapidly through contact with small amounts of bodily fluid, and its early flu-like symptoms are not always obvious. At an emergency meeting, WHO experts said that ""the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not currently been met"". Had they decided otherwise, a larger response to the outbreak would have been triggered. Although Ebola had already spread to an urban area, the experts said they believed the outbreak could be brought under control.  They also stressed that it was ""particularly important there should be no international travel or trade restrictions"". The WHO said it had identified more than 500 people who had potentially come into contact with Ebola patients in the country.  It said they would be closely monitored for symptoms of the disease and were likely to be among the first to be given an Ebola vaccine, which - although still in the experimental stage - proved effective during a trial.   The WHO said some health workers had become infected with Ebola. WHO has previously admitted that it was too slow to respond to a deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa from 2014-2016 that killed more than 11,000 people. One teacher in the region told the BBC's Newsday programme that people had stopped shaking hands when they greet. Ziko Ilema said: ""I tried to greet a friend by shaking hands and he said: 'No, did you forget that Ebola is here?'""  ""They forbid people to greet by using hands, eating animals from the forest, and people are now living with fear,"" he added. Ebola is thought to be spread over long distances by fruit bats and is often transmitted to humans eating contaminated bushmeat - meat from wild animals such as monkeys or antelopes. Bars, restaurants and offices in Mbandaka have started to provide soap and basins of water for people to wash their hands as a way to prevent the spread of the disease, according to the AFP news agency. It also reports that officials are using infrared thermometers at the city's river ports to scan travellers in case they have a fever. ""But we don't have enough of the thermometers, so people are crowding up and getting annoyed,"" said Joseph Dangbele, an official at the private Menge port. Health Minister Oly Ilunga has announced that all healthcare in the affected areas would be free. WHO says that of the 45 Ebola cases reported, 14 are confirmed, 21 are probable, and 10 are suspected. They were recorded in Congo's Equateur province. Mbandaka is the provincial capital. Mr Salama said that isolation and rudimentary management facilities had been set up in the city. He said the disease could have been taken there by people who attended the funeral of an Ebola victim in Bikoro, south of Mbandaka, before travelling to the city. On Wednesday more than 4,000 doses of an experimental vaccine sent by the WHO arrived in Kinshasa with another batch expected soon. These would be given as a priority to people in Mbandaka who had been in contact with those suspected of carrying the Ebola virus before people in any other affected area, Mr Salama said. The vaccine, from pharmaceutical firm Merck, is unlicensed but was effective in limited trials during the West Africa outbreak.  However, it needs to be stored at a temperature of between -60 and -80 C, which is a challenge in DR Congo because electricity supplies are unreliable. WHO said health workers had identified 430 people who may have had contact with the disease and were working to trace more than 4,000 contacts of Ebola patients who had spread across north-west DR Congo. Many of these people were in remote areas, Mr Salama said. This is the ninth outbreak of Ebola in DR Congo - it was named after the country's Ebola river. Ebola can be introduced into the human population through contact with the blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. These can include chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, antelope and porcupines. It is not possible to eradicate all the animals who might be a host for Ebola. As long as humans come in contact with them, there is always a possibility that Ebola could return."
Spread to UST,What's a 'Science Princess' doing in an ice field in Alaska?,2024-09-25,2019-07-29,By Dhruti Shah,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-49149441,"While Celeste Labedz knew quite a few fellow scientists would appreciate the picture of her dressed up as a ""glaciologist Princess Elsa"", she had no idea the image would become a viral hit with more than 10,000 ""likes"" on Twitter. She tweeted:  ""I firmly believe that kids should not be taught that girly things and sciencey things are mutually exclusive. Therefore, I packed a cape with my fieldwork gear just to show what glaciologist Princess Elsa would look like. #SciencePrincess #TheColdNeverBotheredMeAnyway"". The cryoseismologist told BBC News: ""I posted the picture because I thought it would resonate with other scientists.  ""I was heading out to Alaska's Juneau Icefield to carry out research and I thought it would be a lot of fun. ""The cape folded up really small so I had it in my backpack. When we had a break, I took it out.  ""I wasn't expecting it to have the effect it had and to spread so far. It's had such a positive response. People are showing it to their kids and that makes me happy."" The reaction was so overwhelming she posted several other images from her trip, along with a link to Nasa facts about glaciers. Celeste and her mum, Cynthia, had originally made the cape to use in a Halloween costume depicting Princess Elsa from the Disney film.   And when she had the idea to pose in the field, Celeste asked Cynthia to send the cape over from her home state of Nebraska to the California Institute of Technology, in Pasadena, so she could fit it in her baggage for the journey to Alaska. ""I loved Cinderella while growing up but Princess Elsa is my favourite Disney character - she loves ice,"" Celeste said. Having posed for the picture, Celeste had to wait before posting it to Twitter, as there was no mobile phone signal on the glacier. She used a digital camera to take all the photos while out on the trip. ""Once I got back, it was about sifting through and sorting the ones for research out first and then looking through the Elsa pictures,"" she said. ""It took a few days. But I also spent quite a lot of time thinking about what I was going to write."" That photo of Celeste standing in the ice field - where she was investigating the use of seismometers to detect earthquakes on glaciers - also prompted others to showcase their pictures, with scientists sharing their own versions of what it's like to be a ""Science Princess"" and parents highlighting how helpful Celeste's image was for children needing a role model. ""It was amazing,"" Celeste said. ""I loved seeing some of the biologists holding furry animals. One was with a dog, another with an alligator."" Jakob responded: ""Oh my God I love it. My girls are huge Elsa fans (... duh), and are struggling a lot with gender prejudices from other kids. So showing them this will definitely give them courage to follow their dreams: astronaut dinosaur breeder and volcano plumber. Yeah, they are still young."" Celeste, whose dream is to visit glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica, said: ""Women have been excluded for a long time both historically and socially. There is a lack of role models and science is bound by historical notions that it's a white, male, heterosexual, able-bodied environment.  ""It can be exclusionary if you have the opposite of any of these characteristics and I want to encourage people with intersecting identities in everything that I do. ""I would like people to think carefully about what they think a scientist should look like."" Her own interest in science was encouraged by her parents. Her father worked at the University of Nebraska State Museum. ""I basically grew up in a natural history museum,"" Celeste said. ""I do science on ice. I'm studying geophysics and my research is focused on trying to figure out how useful seismology can be to help understand glaciers."" However, the trip on which she took the picture that's gone viral was one that had to be unexpectedly cut short. ""Unfortunately it wasn't that cold,"" Celeste said. ""We've been having a warmer summer season and climate change does play a big role in this.  ""On the glacier, you normally get temperatures up to 55-60F [12-15C] but we had several days where we were closer to 70F. ""I had to cut my fieldwork short as it was just too hot."""
Spread to UST,The long wait to be champions: Tales of Liverpool's title near-misses,2024-09-25,2019-05-03,Chris Bevan,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/48120368,"With two games to go, a first league title since 1990 still lies tantalisingly within reach for Liverpool - but will their story have a happy ending this time? Being brutally honest, there are not many tales of Reds' title challenges to tell from the past 29 years and no spoilers are needed for you to know that they all ended in tears. Since they were last crowned champions, for a then-record 18th time, Liverpool have managed serious bids in only six seasons - including this one - and been in the race on the final day only once, in 2013-14.  From mind games and meltdowns to fumbled crosses and famous slips, there are multiple reasons, theories or excuses for why they fell short each time - including a manager exit, a manager illness, and at least one manager making some extremely ill-advised claims. Their fans, some of who were singing 'we're going to win the league' with three games remaining in 2014, have still had success to cheer with a Champions League victory to add to one Uefa Cup, two FA Cups, and three League Cup wins in the Premier League era. But the league title is the one they all continue to covet. ""Next year is going to be our year"" has been the May mantra of many an Anfield fan during the past three decades, but it has also become a way of mocking the Merseysiders because every previous title challenge has been followed immediately by a campaign where they did not even come remotely close. BBC Sport speaks to some of the players and managers involved in those near-misses to find out what actually did go wrong, and why Jurgen Klopp's team might be different - even if that is only in the way they respond if the title also eludes them. Liverpool cannot finish lower than second this season - it will be only the fifth time they have made the top two in the past 29 years *Brackets indicate what happened the following season Days on top: 163/268 (0/259) Final position: 2nd (6th)  Date last top: 29 March (N/A) Games remaining when last top: 9 (N/A) Total points: 76 (64) Points behind winners: 7 (18) Try to imagine where Liverpool would be now if Jurgen Klopp had left with three months of the season to go, and you will get an idea of what happened to their title defence when Kenny Dalglish sensationally quit as manager on 22 February 1991. The Reds were three points clear at the top of the table when, two days after a pulsating 4-4 FA Cup draw with Everton, Dalglish stunned the football world by announcing he was leaving the club he had served as player and manager for 14 trophy-laden years. Dalglish would later explain that the stress and strain of witnessing the Hillsborough disaster and its aftermath in 1989 was telling on his mind and body and led to his decision, which surprised even his closest friends. Gary Gillespie, then a stalwart Liverpool defender and now a summariser on BBC Radio Merseyside, explained: ""Along with the other players who lived in Southport, we would go out as couples after games with Kenny and his wife. Even being that close and appreciating he was under a little bit of pressure, we never had any inclination whatsoever that he was going to pack it in. ""Losing your manager like that would hurt any team but Kenny was such an iconic figure, it was a massive blow to us."" This video can not be played The Merseyside derby that caused Dalglish to quit The collapse was immediate. With long-serving coach Ronnie Moran in temporary charge, Liverpool lost three games in the next eight days - 3-1 on Luton's plastic pitch, 1-0 at Goodison Park in an FA Cup fifth-round second replay, and most damaging of all, 1-0 at home to title rivals Arsenal, who replaced them at the summit. ""We just weren't quite as good for the rest of the season,"" says Roy Evans, who at the time was a key part of the club's famous 'boot-room' coaching set-up. ""I don't think our levels dropped that much, but the club was in shock and, just like today, you can lose the title very quickly."" A brief Reds revival in the following fortnight did not last and by the time Graeme Souness was appointed manager on 16 April, their title hopes had all but disappeared. Under Souness, Liverpool lost two of their final five games, but not even five wins would have overhauled Arsenal. Liverpool had lost only two out of 24 league games under Dalglish, but lost six of their final 14 without him. They still finished second, setting a record for finishing in the top two for 10 consecutive seasons that only Manchester United (1991-92 to 2000-01) have matched. ""We should not have capitulated the way we did but we were still the top team in the country then,"" remembered John Barnes, a two-time title winner with the Reds. John Barnes (far right) celebrates winning Liverpool's last league title with Ronny Rosenthal, Ian Rush, Ronnie Whelan and captain Alan Hansen. Between 1972-73 and 1989-90, the Reds won 11 out of 18 league championships, a period of overwhelming dominance that also brought four European Cups, two Uefa Cups, three FA Cups and four successive League Cups ""The next couple of years, and particularly the following season, we should have still been challenging, but we didn't. Whether Kenny had stayed or not, that team was getting older and needed freshening up, but it was broken up too quickly. ""What we usually did each year at Liverpool was introduce a couple of good youngsters alongside our experienced players, but a lot of our older heads left too soon. I am not saying we would have won the league the following year, or the year after, but we would not have fallen away so badly."" Days on top: 71/268 (0/275) Final position: 4th (3rd) Date last top: 28 January (N/A) Games remaining when last top: 14 (N/A) Total points: 68 (65) Points behind winners: 7 (13)  For the first time in the Premier League era, Liverpool were top at Christmas in 1996. Not for the last time, however, they would stumble in the second half of the season and ended up fourth - below both Newcastle and Arsenal on goal difference. ""We were unbeaten for our first 10 games in all competitions, which gave us incredible belief,"" recalls Jason McAteer, who missed only one league match that campaign. ""When we went top in December, I didn't think 'we are going to win the league' but I did feel it was going to be very difficult to beat us. ""From February onwards, though, we were off the top and I don't think we really knew how to get over the line. John Barnes was the only player left who had won the title, so we were in uncharted waters. ""It is a bit like the situation like now really, where James Milner is the only Liverpool player to have won the league (with Manchester City in 2011-12 and 2013-14), only we did not handle it so well."" Liverpool led defending champions Manchester City by four points on 25 December 2018. It was the fifth time since 1990 that they had been top of the table at Christmas, after previously doing it in 1990-91, 1996-97, 2008-09 and 2013-14 Spring saw inconsistency creep in, and individual mistakes became more costly too. David James fumbled two corners to concede two goals in a shock home defeat by Coventry, and made another April error at Anfield that ensured Manchester United left with three points and a commanding lead in the title race. ""'Jamo' sort of bore the the crowd's frustration,"" added McAteer. ""The media got on his back too and he got the nickname 'Calamity James' which didn't help. ""But what went wrong was not his fault - over the course of the season, only two teams had a better defensive record than us. In the end we probably drew too many games and we definitely dropped too many points against teams we should have beaten."" Barnes puts that down to the team's mentality, and an inability to grind out games the way United's team of that era could. He explained: ""When we played well, we were probably the best team in the country but, when we didn't, we could not get a result. We would suddenly lose a game out of nowhere. ""That was our big problem, and that is the big difference with Liverpool this year. They pick up points when they are not at their best, which is how you win the league, and they have only been beaten once all season.""

Gerard Houllier was absent for five months of the season after he fell seriously ill in October 2001. His assistant Phil Thompson took the reins but, after having heart surgery, the Frenchman returned at the start of April to proclaim his side were '10 games from greatness' as they chased glory in the Premier League and Europe, just as they do this year. It turned out they were actually seven games from finishing trophyless, after collecting three bits of silverware the previous season.  Bayer Leverkusen surprisingly eliminated the Reds from the Champions League in the quarter-finals and, despite a strong finish domestically, they could not compete with Arsenal's surge for the line as Arsene Wenger's side won their final 13 league games on their way to completing their second Double in four years. Liverpool spent plenty of time at the summit in spring, but only because they had played more games than the Gunners and even a run of 13 wins from their last 15 games was not enough to reel them in. ""Unlike this year, it never got to a point that season were I thought the title was in our grasp,"" says BBC pundit Danny Murphy, who spent seven years at Anfield from 1997 to 2004. ""I was enjoying the ride, but I never actually thought we would win it and that was probably because of how good Arsenal were. This video can not be played 'I believe!' Why Murphy was convinced in January that Liverpool will be champions ""We were never really close enough to really worry them but I still remember being devastated on the bus home after we lost at Tottenham with two games to go, because I knew it was over. They were not going to mess up from there. ""I never won the league so it was nice to challenge, without really being in a race. It is not like Liverpool's situation now, where they and City are so close that they will feel the pressure and it has been tit-for-tat each week. We never really got to that stage. Most days spent on top of Division One/Premier League since 1990-91 1. Manchester United 2,487 2. Chelsea 1,519 3. Arsenal 1,087 4. Man City 749 5. Liverpool 605 Includes this season where Liverpool have spent 140/267 days in first place. City have been top for 117 days in 2018-19, Chelsea for nine and Manchester United one - they began the campaign a day before everyone else. ""We probably surpassed our own expectations for maintaining a challenge and being in contention for so long, and I look back and think we gave it a hell of a good go because we could not have done much more in the run-in. ""I don't think Gerard's absence affected us either, because 'Tommo' did such a wonderful job.  ""There was so much trauma at the club because Gerard was so ill, but that actually gave us a freedom to play because everyone wrote us off - and maybe that freedom helped. ""It was amazing when Gerard came back because the most important thing was his health and of course winning something for him would have been the icing on the cake, but I still think considering what happened that year, we did remarkably well.""

On this occasion, however, when the first shots were fired it was Reds boss Rafael Benitez who pulled the trigger. On 9 January 2009, with his Liverpool side seven points clear at the top of the table (albeit with United having two games in hand), Benitez pulled out a piece of A4 paper at his news conference and began listing his grievances against the United boss. They ranged from Ferguson's conduct regarding referees to the how the fixture list favoured Liverpool's main title rivals. ""I want to talk about facts,"" began Benitez as he launched into a five-minute rant in front of reporters - which arguably backfired. It was seen as the turning point in the title race, but Liverpool did not noticeably falter in the aftermath and lost only two league games all season. The effect was probably more apparent on the boost it gave United.  Speaking about the incident in 2017, Red Devils defender Gary Neville told Soccerbox: ""I remember being at home that day watching Sky Sports News and thinking 'what has he done!?!'  ""It was reported that 'he's cracking up' and then the fans start singing 'Rafa's cracking up' and it did feel like the pressure was getting to him. You can imagine Sir Alex being at home being like 'I've got him'. This video can not be played Famous football manager rants (Benitez's 'Facts' press conference is 2 min 35 sec in) ""If you're going to call it on with another manager you've got to be sure to win. He was taking Sir Alex on on his own patch: mind games."" If that was Benitez's intention, it certainly failed. Was his meltdown more myth than 'Kevin Keegan moment' though? Take a closer look at Liverpool's results that season and it seems they were actually derailed by the same problem that threatened to undo Klopp's bid earlier this year - hardly any defeats, but too many draws.  Those were the harsh facts for Benitez to digest as United chased down his side, but he was combative until the very end. Asked just before United clinched their 18th title with a draw at Arsenal if the best team always wins the league, the Liverpool boss said: ""It just means they have more points. ""If United win the league it means they will have more points, clearly, but there are some very good teams in different positions in the table. To say who is the best at one moment is not easy."" Days on top: 59/268 (0/282) Final position: 2nd (6th) Date last top: 6 May (N/A) Games remaining when last top: 1 (N/A) Total points: 84 (62) Points behind winners: 2 (25) Unlike Liverpool's previous near-misses, this one is remembered as coming down to a single moment. On a fateful April day at Anfield, thousands of home fans had welcomed the Liverpool team bus before their game against Chelsea with flares, fireworks and chants of 'we are the champions'.  Those supporters were buoyed by a run of nine straight wins that had left them needing only seven points from their final three fixtures to secure the title, and it seems the Liverpool players shared their belief that glory would finally be theirs. This video can not be played Five years since Gerrard's slip: What else happened when Liverpool's title hopes slipped ""Before the game we were so confident,"" said Glen Johnson, who was the Reds regular right-back that season. ""I don't know if you remember it but we absolutely battered them.  ""They did not ever look like winning the game, but we could not score. As we were pushing, obviously we left a few open holes and what happened, happened. ""It was just a shock, I guess. It felt like a head in your hands moment, but it was such a freak incident. There was no danger or anything because that is why the back-four were so spread out because we had easy possession of the ball."" Johnson is describing Steven Gerrard's infamous slip, which allowed Demba Ba to run clear and put Chelsea ahead just before half-time. Willian sealed their victory with a breakaway goal in the final moments of the match. Liverpool were now left level on points with City, and nine goals worse off on goal difference. They looked like doing some damage to that deficit when they went 3-0 up against Crystal Palace in their penultimate game, but a final collapse at Selhurst Park was about to finish their hopes for good. This video can not be played Rodgers concedes title to Man City after 3-3 draw with Palace ""It was almost like it was meant to happen,"" says Johnson, who again is dredging up some painful memories. ""Their players were having out-of-body moments. ""I can't remember the guy's name but the centre-half has hit a ball, and he has probably never hit a ball like that in his life - and it has gone into the top corner from 40 yards."" The player was Damian Delaney, and that was Palace's first goal back, with 11 minutes to go. Eagles substitute Dwight Gayle quickly added two more, and a 3-3 draw in south-east London left Luis Suarez in tears and meant Liverpool's title dreams were left shattered once again. ""I think until this year, that was probably the only time we possibly could have won the title,"" says Barnes. ""It didn't feel we were close the other years, apart from when Kenny left. ""When people talk about why we have not won it for 29 years, the answer is simple - it is because there have always been better teams. This year, hopefully, it will be different."" With two games remaining, Liverpool have surpassed the points tally set by Arsenal's 'Invincibles' side of 2003-04 (90 points) and Manchester United's Treble winners of 1998-99 (79 points). They have also matched the best total of any of Sir Alex Ferguson's United teams, from their title-winning campaign of 1999-00 If it isn't, will it be the same old story of a backward step next season - or are there good times ahead regardless of how things go in the next few weeks? ""I have been watching Liverpool for BBC Radio Merseyside more or less since I retired and this is by far and away the best squad they have had since 1990,"" added Gillespie. ""They are a completely different animal at this moment in time to where they were in any of those failed title bids. ""I am not saying this team is destined to go on and achieve great things but, whether we win the title this year or not, everything is more or less in place for Liverpool to be a threat for a long time to come.""

Spread to UST,Ebola-hit DR Congo begins vaccination,2024-09-25,2018-05-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44194065,"Health workers in the Democratic Republic of Congo have begun an immunisation campaign in an attempt to halt the spread of an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus. The experimental vaccine proved effective when used in limited trials during the epidemic which struck West Africa in 2014-16. At least 26 people are believed to have died in the current outbreak. Health workers were among the first to receive the vaccine on Monday. It is an infectious illness that causes internal bleeding and often proves fatal.  It can spread rapidly through contact with small amounts of bodily fluid, and its early flu-like symptoms are not always obvious. More than 11,300 people died in the earlier outbreak in 2014-16. At least 45 cases of Ebola have been reported, including three health workers, since the outbreak began earlier this month. The virus has already spread from rural areas to the north-western city of Mbandaka, a major transport hub on the River Congo, where at least four cases have been confirmed.  This has sparked fears that the outbreak could reach the capital, Kinshasa, as well as neighbouring countries. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said it has ""strong reason to believe that the outbreak can be brought under control"". At an emergency meeting, on Friday WHO experts said that ""the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not currently been met"". The vaccine, made by pharmaceutical firm Merck, is not yet licensed, but was effective in limited trials during the West Africa outbreak. Dr Michel Yao, from the WHO, told the BBC that the vaccine had been tested in Guinea and that ""almost all of the people who were vaccinated could not get the disease"". The WHO has sent more than 4,000 doses to the Democratic Republic of Congo, with another batch set to follow. Health care providers and funeral workers are being vaccinated initially, before the programme is extended to more than 500 people who may have come into contact with those infected with the virus, in a so-called ""ring vaccination"". One of the most immediate obstacles to the immunisation campaign is the country's unreliable electricity supplies, as the vaccine needs to be stored at a temperature of between -60 and -80 C. Initial stocks of the vaccine have arrived in Mbandaka city, but they must now be transported through densely forested areas to reach remote rural areas where many cases have been reported. A further issue is that, as the vaccine has not yet been approved, its use is dependent upon informed and signed consent from all patients. This means that translators will need to be brought in to aid communication between health workers and local communities.  One teacher in the region told the BBC's Newsday programme that people had stopped shaking hands when they greet. Ziko Ilema said: ""I tried to greet a friend by shaking hands and he said: 'No, did you forget that Ebola is here?' ""They forbid people to greet by using hands, eating animals from the forest, and people are now living with fear."" Ebola is thought to be spread over long distances by fruit bats and is often transmitted to humans eating contaminated bushmeat - meat from wild animals such as monkeys or antelopes. Bars, restaurants and offices in Mbandaka have started to provide soap and basins of water for people to wash their hands as a way to prevent the spread of the disease, according to the AFP news agency. It also reports that officials are using infrared thermometers at the city's river ports to scan travellers in case they have a fever. ""But we don't have enough of the thermometers, so people are crowding up and getting annoyed,"" said Joseph Dangbele, an official at the private Menge port. Health Minister Oly Ilunga has announced that all healthcare in the affected areas would be free. This is the ninth outbreak of Ebola in DR Congo - it was named after the country's Ebola river."
Spread to UST,"Leak suspect, 21, is a US National Guard airman",2024-09-25,2023-04-13,By Mike Wendling,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65269975,"A 21-year-old US Air National Guardsman has been arrested over a leak of classified military intelligence that has rattled the US and its allies. Jack Teixeira, who reportedly shared the files in an online gaming chatroom, faces charges under the Espionage Act. Aerial footage showed officers making an arrest at Mr Teixeira's family home in Dighton, Massachusetts.  The documents he leaked revealed intelligence about the war in Ukraine and US spying on allies. Footage of the arrest in the town of 8,000 people about an hour south of Boston shows a young man, believed to be Mr Teixeira, walking backwards with his hands raised to armed FBI officers. He was handcuffed and led to a vehicle.  Roads in the area were blocked by police officers during the arrest. ""There were about six to eight Army guys with rifles walking around,"" local resident Dick Treacy told Reuters news agency. ""This is a very quiet area."" Mr Teixeira is expected to make his first court appearance in Boston on Friday.  He was listed as a member of the intelligence wing of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, based at Otis Air National Guard Base in western Cape Cod.  According to his service record, obtained by CBS News, the BBC's US partner, Mr Teixeira joined the force in 2019.  His official title is Cyber Transport Systems journeyman and he holds the rank of Airman 1st Class - a relatively junior position.  In a brief statement on Thursday, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said the suspect had been taken into custody without incident.  Mr Garland provided no further details on the investigation or the motive for the leaks.  At a separate news conference earlier in the day, defence department spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder said the leak was a ""deliberate criminal act"". When asked how such a young airman had access to classified defence documents, Gen Ryder said that across the US military, personnel are entrusted ""with a lot of responsibility at a very early age"".  ""Think about a young combat platoon sergeant, and the responsibility and trust that we put into those individuals to lead troops into combat,"" he said.  Eddy Souza, a 22-year-old man who said he went to school with Mr Teixeira, told Reuters he was surprised his former classmate had been identified as the suspect in the leaks.  ""He's a good kid, not a troublemaker, just a quiet guy,"" Mr Souza said. ""It sounds like it was a stupid kid's mistake."" Starting several months ago, at least 50 but perhaps more than 100 classified documents were posted on Discord - a social media platform popular with gamers. The documents - which BBC News is examining - contain a range of intelligence assessments about the war in Ukraine, but also sensitive intelligence about countries around the world. A defence department spokesman said the Pentagon is continuing to work to ""understand the scope, scale and impact of these leaks"". In a statement, Republican congressman Mike Turner - the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee - vowed to ""examine why this happened, why it went unnoticed for weeks, and how to prevent future leaks"".  On Wednesday, the Washington Post published an interview with one of the members of the chatroom where the documents initially appeared.  He described the leaker as a young, charismatic gun enthusiast in his early to mid-20s who worked at an unnamed military base.  The Post reported that the man was the leader of a Discord chatroom whose roughly two dozen members swapped ""memes, offensive jokes and idle chitchat"" and prayed and watched films together. The members included people from Russia and Ukraine and a number of other countries in Europe, Asia and South America, the paper reported. At first the leaks were kept inside the small chatroom, but in early March members began posting them on other Discord servers, including ones dedicated to the game Minecraft and a Filipino YouTuber.  From there they were posted on the fringe message board 4chan and on the Telegram chat app, particularly on pro-Russia channels. In some cases they were altered to increase Ukrainian casualty counts. The Air National Guard is the reserve of the US Air Force.  US President Joe Biden was briefed about Mr Teixeira's arrest while on a trip to Ireland, White House officials have confirmed to CBS. "

Spread to UST,Your favourite Ashes tour moment,2024-09-25,2017-12-08,Mark Mitchener,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/41643205,"England's James Anderson, Graeme Swann and Alastair Cook celebrate retaining the Ashes in Melbourne in 2010 It's official - England's demolition of Australia in Melbourne in 2010-11 is your favourite Ashes tour moment. Of the 25,000 BBC Sport users who voted online, 31% chose England's perfect Boxing Day as their highlight from more than a century of Ashes contests. Steve Harmison's first-ball wide in the first Test in 2006-07 was the second most popular choice, while England's three-run win in Melbourne in 1982 pipped the infamous 1932-33 'Bodyline' series into third. Here's the full run-down... Chris Tremlett and Tim Bresnan were not in England's XI for the first two Tests Win the toss, put them in, bowl them out, and overhaul their total without losing a wicket. Is this the nearest England's travelling fans will ever come to a perfect first day? England captain Andrew Strauss was vindicated in fielding first as pace bowlers Chris Tremlett (4-26), James Anderson (4-44) and Tim Bresnan (2-25) gave a seam and swing bowling masterclass to bowl Australia out for 98, their lowest Test score against England at the MCG. All 10 wickets fell to catches behind the wicket - six to wicketkeeper Matt Prior and four to the slip cordon. It meant England still had 47 overs to face. But Strauss and Alastair Cook did so with little fuss, ending the day on 157-0 as Australia's pace attack misfired and Mitchell Johnson was taunted mercilessly by the Barmy Army. England went on to win by an innings in little more than four days to retain the Ashes. What they said: ""In Andrew Strauss' wildest dreams, he couldn't have hoped it would turn out like this."" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew. Harmison's first ball went straight to his close friend Andrew Flintoff - at second slip ""The Harmison ball"" - three words that still strike fear into any England supporter. Confidence was high among the thousands of fans who travelled down under following the euphoria of recapturing the urn in 2005. After Australia chose to bat in the first Test in Brisbane, skipper Andrew Flintoff threw the ball to Steve Harmison, who had terrorised Australia's top order on the morning of the first Test in 2005. Harmison charged in at Justin Langer... and bowled a delivery so wide that it was caught by Flintoff at second slip. It is the worst - and most famous - first ball in history. The tone was set. Australia racked up 602-9 declared en route to a 277-run win at the Gabba and romped to a 5-0 whitewash. What they said: ""I froze. I let the enormity of the occasion get to me. My whole body was nervous. I could not get my hands to stop sweating."" Steve Harmison. England's three-run win equalled a Test record for the narrowest victory, although it was surpassed in 1993 and 2005 This was one of the closest Tests of all time - only 10 runs separated the scores of the four innings. Australia had two days to score 292 for victory, and were still 74 short when last man Jeff Thomson joined Allan Border. England captain Bob Willis spread his field for established batsman Border, offering him singles so England could target tailender Thomson, but the pair chipped away at the target, and eventually, with four runs needed, he turned to England's talisman. ""Ian Botham is going to have one last crack at Jeff Thomson,"" Henry Blofeld told Test Match Special listeners. Thomson flashed at a wide delivery, the ball flew off the edge, second slip Chris Tavare could only parry the ball, but Geoff Miller ran behind him at first slip to complete the catch. It was Botham's 100th wicket against Australia, and England had sneaked home. What they said: ""It became heart-stopping stuff. We were down to the last throw of the dice when I handed the ball to Botham."" England captain Bob Willis. Bill Woodfull - pictured here taking evasive action in the fourth Test in Brisbane - was hit over the heart in Adelaide, but while an orthodox field was in place The 'Bodyline' series of 1932-33 has gone down in history as one of the most famous, or infamous, Test series after England captain Douglas Jardine devised a 'leg theory' strategy to nullify the threat posed by Australia's Don Bradman, the best batsman in the world. His weapons of choice were Nottinghamshire fast bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce, who bowled short-pitched deliveries at the batsman's body with several close fielders posted on the leg side. The biggest flashpoint came at Adelaide. Larwood struck captain Bill Woodfull over the heart, while wicketkeeper Bert Oldfield retired hurt with a fractured skull. England cruised to victory, but the rest of the game was overshadowed by a rancorous exchange of cables between the Australian board, which considered England's tactics ""unsportsmanlike"", and the MCC, which furiously demanded the word be retracted. The controversy led to the Laws of Cricket being changed to limit aggressive and dangerous bowling. What they said: ""In Australia to this day, the word Bodyline carries the stench of underhand or unsportsmanlike behaviour, with the series regarded as Australian cricket's most controversial."" David Studham, Australian National Sports Museum. Mitchell Johnson's 313 Test wickets put him fourth on Australia's all-time list If ever a series deserved to be named after one player, this was it. Mitchell Johnson's figures alone make scary enough reading: 37 wickets at an average of 13.97 in five Tests. Imagine what it was like to face him from 22 yards, a growling, moustachioed wrecking ball charging in and producing what several respected judges said was the fastest bowling they had ever seen. Johnson's 7-40 in the first innings in Adelaide were his most impressive figures, but perhaps the psychological damage inflicted in the series opener in Brisbane was even more telling. It said much for the hold that he held over the England batsmen that a second 5-0 whitewash in three Ashes tours looked likely long before the series was over. What they said: ""I heard Stuart Broad, James Anderson and Graeme Swann say they were scared. When you've got that, you know that a bloke in the other team is doing damage."" Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen. Stuart MacGill was the second of Gough's three hat-trick victims Australia won the toss in the final Test in Sydney and the first day was dominated by a stand of 190 by the Waugh twins as Mark (121) and Steve (96) made hay on their home ground. However, there was to be a brief moment of magic for England's travelling fans. Darren Gough had been a mainstay of England's attack as they struggled for most of the 1990s, but the Barnsley pace bowler wrote his name into Ashes history at the SCG. With three deliveries left in an over, Gough had Ian Healy caught behind with one that climbed; Stuart MacGill had his middle stump removed by a searing yorker that swung out late; and, roared on by the England fans, Gough pegged back Colin Miller's off stump with another. What they said: ""The ball to Miller ended up being probably the best I've bowled all series."" Darren Gough. Elton John (centre) entertains Phil DeFreitas (l) and Phil Edmonds (r) A squad containing Ian Botham, David Gower and Allan Lamb was never likely to struggle on the social side of an overseas tour. The 1986-87 series proved to be successful on and off the field for England, who made a mockery of this comment in one newspaper: ""There are only three things wrong with this England team. They can't bat, can't bowl and can't field."" Mike Gatting's side confounded their critics to win the series 2-1 and retain the urn. Botham, as ever, reserved his best performances for the 'old enemy', while opener Chris Broad - six months after son Stuart was born - hit centuries in three successive Tests. Phil DeFreitas gets into the spirit during the Christmas Day fancy dress party Off the field, the team partied hard. Pop star Elton John spent time with the squad for much of the tour, and acted as DJ for the victory party after the Ashes were clinched in Melbourne. The traditional Christmas Day fancy-dress party, a staple of winter tours in those days, was particularly memorable, the star of the show being seam bowler Phil DeFreitas dressed as singer Diana Ross. It was England's last Ashes success for some time - they would not win it again until 2005. What they said: ""David Gower and Allan Lamb were having this drinks race. When we got on the coach, Gower was spewing out of the window, Lamby was stopping the driver to go to Pizza Hut."" Phil DeFreitas. Damien Fleming, trapped lbw, was the fifth of Dean Headley's six wickets In the Melbourne Test of 1998, rain meant Boxing Day was lost to the weather before 12 wickets fell on day two, 10 on day three, and a staggering 18 on day four - a day that belonged to Dean Headley. Australia were cruising on 103-2, chasing only 175 for a victory that would have given them a 3-0 series lead. But pace bowler Headley had Justin Langer brilliantly caught by a diving Mark Ramprakash at square leg during a blistering spell of 5-9 that left Australia teetering on 140-7. Australia claimed the extra half-hour as Steve Waugh inched the hosts to within 14 runs of their target, at which point Headley had Matt Nicholson caught behind. Darren Gough claimed the final two wickets in the following over to wrap up a pulsating 12-run victory, while man of the match Headley finished with a career-best 6-60. It ended a marathon four-hour session at the end of a day that featured eight hours and two minutes of play - the longest in Test history. What they said: ""Headley's irresistible spell on the final day at Melbourne provided the highlight of the tour."" Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. Steve Waugh's 29th Test century equalled Sir Donald Bradman's tally for Australia Captain Steve Waugh was under pressure for his place and Australia were in the midst of a collapse when he arrived at the crease at 56-3, just before tea on day two of the fifth Test in Sydney. But he raced through the gears, passing 50 from only 61 deliveries and becoming only the third player in history to reach 10,000 Test runs. He made it to 95 with one over of the day remaining - to be bowled by off-spinner Richard Dawson. An expectant SCG - his home ground - chanted Waugh's name as the over began with three dot balls. Waugh scored three off the fourth. Adam Gilchrist's single gave Waugh the strike back. On 98, he drove the final delivery of the day through cover for four. He leapt in celebration, the crowd roared and Waugh's place in the pantheon of greats was assured. What they said: ""That was the most sensational piece of individually constructed piece of cricketing theatre that I have ever seen."" Commentator Mark Nicholas. Warne took 708 Test wickets, including a record 195 in Ashes Tests Leg-spinner Shane Warne tormented England throughout his career, sparking collapses and spreading panic for the best part of 15 years. Although his 'Ball of the Century' to Mike Gatting at Old Trafford in 1993 remains his most famous Ashes delivery, Warne's finest moment on home soil was arguably his hat-trick in Melbourne in 1994. The setting was Warne's home ground, the iconic MCG - a month after he had been on a hat-trick in the first Test at Brisbane but failed to remove England number 11 Phil Tufnell. In England's second innings, Phil DeFreitas was lbw playing back to a top-spinner, Darren Gough was caught behind off the glove as he lunged at a big leg-break, and Devon Malcolm - with seven Australians camped round the bat and the crowd roaring - was brilliantly caught by a diving David Boon at short leg. It was the first Ashes hat-trick for 90 years. Boon was mobbed by Warne and his jubilant team-mates and Australia wrapped up a crushing 295-run win moments later. They went on to win the series 2-1 and Warne finished with 27 wickets. What they said: ""I closed my eyes and bowled my stock ball - a leg-spinner with a bit more overspin in the hope that it would bounce a bit more."" Shane Warne. Tyson took 76 wickets in only 17 Tests at an average of 18.56 The legendary Donald Bradman described England's Frank Tyson as the ""fastest bowler I have ever seen"". Richie Benaud, who witnessed more Tests as player and broadcaster than anyone else, agreed. In an injury-hit career, Tyson burned briefly, but brightest in the 1954-55 Ashes when he was picked ahead of Fred Trueman. Len Hutton's England lost the first Test in Brisbane, but Tyson - playing his first full Test series - was at the centre of a stunning comeback that helped them win 4-1. Hit on the head by rival pace bowler Ray Lindwall in the second Test at Sydney, Tyson took six wickets in the second innings, and he returned figures of 7-27 on a treacherous Melbourne pitch in the third Test. Not without reason was he nicknamed 'Typhoon'. Tyson finished the series with 28 wickets at an average of 20.82, but injuries restricted him to only 11 more Test appearances. What they said: ""When he came on I was standing 50 yards back at slip; I was closer to the fence than the stumps."" England team-mate Tom Graveney. Steve Waugh spun the coin, Nasser Hussain chose to field, and Australia made hay A decision that Nasser Hussain has never been allowed to forget. Winning the toss in the first Test in Brisbane, England captain Hussain shocked almost everyone by asking the home side to bat first on a true surface and in benign conditions. England bowled poorly, fielded abysmally and Australia ended the day on 364-2 thanks to centuries from Matthew Hayden and Ricky Ponting. England's agony at the Gabba was compounded by an injury to pace bowler Simon Jones, who ruptured ligaments in his knee when he slid to save a boundary. It kept him out of cricket for more than a year. Australia won the first Test by 384 runs, the second and third by an innings and the fourth by five wickets. Only an England win in Sydney prevented a 5-0 whitewash. What they said: ""The ball swung a bit at first, but by the fifth or sixth over nothing was happening and the world was closing in on me.

Spread to UST,Thousands of primary pupils face closed schools,2024-09-25,2021-01-04,By Sean Coughlan,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-55525681,"Thousands of pupils have not started primary school as expected - with local closures in several parts of England. Head teachers warned of a ""confusing picture"" with some schools staying shut after teachers' union safety warnings about the risk of Covid infections. A joint letter from education unions called for a ""pause"" in reopening schools, accusing the government of ""creating chaos"". The Department for Education said closing should only be a ""last resort"". Adding to the uncertainty, some local authorities have argued against reopening and some individual primary schools have remained closed for most pupils - in addition to those schools already required to stay shut because of high coronavirus levels. There are so far no official national figures for how many schools have not have fully opened, apart from for vulnerable and key workers' children - but local reports include: Health Secretary Matt Hancock said school was the ""right place"" for children, wherever possible. ""When it comes to schools, we've taken the decision not to reopen schools in some of the most affected areas. ""But these are difficult balances - and people will have very mixed emotions,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. If schools are closed, Labour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds has called for support for parents unable to work because of childcare problems. Vicky Smith from Hertfordshire faces an anxious personal dilemma about sending her daughter back to primary school - as she is worried about the risk of infection to her seriously ill father, who also lives with them. ""I want to send my kids to school because all her friends are there, but what if she brings it home?,"" she says. ""Chances are if she gives it to her granddad, she might not have a granddad. It's not so much we think our children are in danger - it's the people they are going to bring it down to."" Vicky also says even in Tier 4 the current restrictions do not seem to be particularly strict. ""You can still go to work and go to school, it doesn't feel safe.  ""My dad is quite happy for her to go to school, but how is she going to feel if she gives it to her granddad. I don't know what to do.  ""I don't want to get a big fine and I don't want to stop her learning. But I also feel… I just don't know what to do."" Secondary schools are staying closed this week except for vulnerable and key workers' children - and in local authorities with high levels of coronavirus, including across London, primary schools are also not open to most pupils. But reopening primary schools in other areas, including for some in Tier 4, has been challenged, with the biggest teachers' union, the National Education Union, calling for teaching to be moved online for the first two weeks of term. The NEU has advised teachers they can say they are not going to teach classes in school because of concerns over safety. A joint letter from education unions, including teachers and support staff, says bringing pupils back to school ""risks increasing the infection rate"" and means exposing school staff to ""serious risk of ill-health"".  The letter, co-ordinated by the TUC, calls for priority access to Covid vaccines for school staff and to move lessons online ""while Covid-secure working arrangements are reviewed"". Any school closures should be kept to an ""absolute minimum"", said Amanda Spielman, head of the Ofsted education watchdog, because ""children's lives can't just be put on hold while we wait for vaccination programmes"". But the wife of a primary school teacher in Harrow who caught Covid towards the end of last term, and was hospitalised over Christmas, said protecting staff had to be a priority.  ""Teachers are passionate and loyal but somebody needs to fight for them,"" she told the BBC. Mungo Sheppard, head teacher of Ash Green primary school in Calderdale, says his school opened as planned on Monday - without staff staying away, but with higher than usual numbers of missing pupils. Of the school's 500 pupils, Mr Sheppard says 75 are off, mostly with ""Covid-related"" issues, compared with 15 absent at the end of last term. ""We also have, for the first time since September, children whose parents have taken the decision to keep them at home due to anxieties linked to the new variant and rising rates,"" he said. But the head teacher says their efforts have been hampered by last-minute decisions at a national level. ""It has been incredibly difficult to make these decisions and communicate them in a tiny timeframe and within a holiday,"" says Mr Sheppard. Some local authorities have backed schools deciding not to open - and others have questioned the decision to keep schools open in some areas, when other nearby schools have been told to shut. Kent County Council called for a delay in reopening primary schools in four parts of the county. But a message on Twitter from the Conservative MP for Folkestone and Hythe, Damian Collins, suggested further changes were on the way. After a meeting with School Standards Minister Nick Gibb, Mr Collins said the ""decision about which schools will be required to stay open will be reviewed in the next few days by the Department for Education"". Julian Rose, head of West Chiltington School in West Sussex, has an inset day on Monday and is expecting to open on Tuesday. He says ""some very anxious"" parents have been in touch about children going back when the area is in Tier 4. ""I think many feel astonished that we are still open when operating under Tier 4,"" says Mr Rose. And he says the school will ""not have a full complement of staff in attendance"". A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Children's education has consistently been a national priority, which is why we want classrooms to reopen wherever possible in the new term. ""Schools will continue to implement appropriate safety measures to help mitigate the risk of transmission."" Are you a parent of schoolchildren? Or are you a teacher?

Spread to UST,Uncovering caves full of treasure,2024-09-25,2015-02-23,Jonathan Glancey,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150223-uncovering-caves-full-of-treasure,"The Ajanta Caves were a sanctuary for Buddhist monks that was forgotten, along with its stunning riches, for nearly 1,500 years. Jonathan Glancey investigates. The Ajanta Caves, 30 spellbinding Buddhist prayer halls and monasteries carved, as if by sorcery, into a horseshoe-shaped rock face in a mountainous region of India’s Maharashtra state, 450km (280 miles) east of Mumbai, were ‘discovered’ by accident in 1819. Unknown for more than 1,000 years except to wild animals, insects, flood waters, prodigious foliage and perhaps the local Bhil people, this magnificent work of art, architecture and contemplation, was abandoned by those who created it as long ago as AD 500. In 1983 it was designated a Unesco World Heritage Site. John Smith, a young British cavalry officer, was on a tiger hunt when he spotted the mouth of a cave high above the Waghora (Tiger) River that could only have been man made. Scrambling up with his party, Smith entered the cave and, branding a flaming grass torch, encountered a great vaulted and colonnaded hall, its walls covered in faded paintings. Beneath a dome, a timeless praying Buddha fronted a mound-like shrine, or stupa. Smith carved his name on a statue of a Bodhisattva, a figure representing one of the past lives of the Buddha before he achieved Nirvana, or union with the divine spirit. Since then, thousands of people have added their names as the Ajanta caves – a gallery of the oldest and some of the finest of all Buddhist art – has gained fame and become a compelling tourist attraction. News of Smith’s find spread quickly. In 1844, Major Robert Gill was commissioned by the Royal Asiatic Society to create reproductions on canvas of the wall paintings. This was the beginning of measures to reveal and document the prayer halls (chaityagrihas) and monasteries (viharas) that had, it seems, been hewn from solid rock in two phases, the first – five prayer halls – between the 1st  and 2nd  centuries BC and, the second – 25 monasteries, or monks’ lodgings – in the 5th Century AD. Gill worked in truly difficult conditions. Not only was it often unbearably hot, but this was still tiger country, and the fierce Bhil people had never come to terms with invaders, whether Hindu or Moghul emperors or 19th Century British military. Lost to time What Gill and other visitors saw, having climbed ropes and ladders, to reach the caves – the original stone stairs had long gone – was architecture of a very high order and sculpture and paintings that took the breath away. Here, Buddhist monks had gazed on thousands of lustrous images of the lives the Buddha – Siddhartha Gautama – had lived before this 6th Century Indian prince took up teaching and inspired a way of thinking and being practiced by hundreds of millions around the world today. Between images of the Buddha, were sensuous representations of glamorous princes and princesses, of animals, palaces, silks, jewellery, of lovemaking and life in all its mortal richness. Some of the images shocked Victorian sensibilities and are still condemned by religious zealots unable to comprehend that what these Indian artists saw was a joyous vision of natural fecundity and divine beauty. Along with the1st Century AD architecture, these paintings showed remarkable affinities to classical Greek art. This was not coincidence, but evidence of a Greco-Indian culture that had spread from the 4th Century BC expeditions of Alexander the Great. It stretched through Hellenistic kingdoms and trade routes from the Mediterranean to Persia, Afghanistan and India – with Ajanta along the way – to distant China and Japan. Twenty-seven of Gill’s canvases were displayed in the Indian Court of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, south London; in 1866, 23 were destroyed by fire. Newly armed with a camera as well as brushes, Gill set to work again. Meanwhile, the Royal Cave Temple Commission founded by the Royal Asiatic Society in 1848 had led to the foundation in 1861 of the Archaeological Survey of India. Concern for the treasures of Ajanta grew, as did the number of intrepid experts and treasure hunters, some of whom did more than carve their names on statues: they scraped paintings from walls which crumbled into dust. One of the few known surviving paintings to have left Ajanta intact is in the care of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts today. It had been sold in 1924 for £1,000 at Sotheby’s in London. The Government of Bombay commissioned new copies of the Ajanta cave paintings in 1872 from John Griffiths, principal of the Bombay School of Art. Griffiths and his students produced 300 paintings, only for a third to go up in flames at London’s Imperial Institute in 1885. In 1909, Lady Herringham, suffragette and art patron, began further copies with help from the Calcutta School of Art, and from the late 1920s the Indian art historian Ghulam Yazdani made a comprehensive photographic survey of the art of Ajanta, published in four volumes between 1930 and 1955. That was the year the surviving Griffiths paintings were put in store by the Victoria & Albert Museum. Inaccessible and forgotten for half a century, in 2005 81 were uncovered and restored. Searching for understanding Since 1999, a team led by Rajdeo Singh of the Archaeological Survey of India, using new methods developed in Japan, have revealed the intense colours and sheer beauty of many of the 1st Century AD portraits along with the subtlety of their artists’ use of perspective, shading and other three-dimensional techniques including the use of bright stones, notably lapis lazuli from Afghanistan. Their meticulous restoration raised anew questions asked many times over the past 200 years. How did the artists paint so well, with such precise use of colour, in the dark recesses of these rock-carved prayer halls and monasteries? Just how many architects, masons, sculptors and painters would have been at work between from circa AD 460-500 when so much of this glorious place, paid for by merchants and courtiers during the reign of the Vakataka dynasty emperor Harisena, was created? And, in those brief years before the fall of the Vakataka empire and its patronage of Buddhist art, could this really have been a place of quiet contemplation when it must have been one vast building site? The many archaeological ventures over the past two centuries seeking to answer these questions, as well as to uncover, document and conserve this feast of Buddhist creativity have added immeasurably to Ajanta’s fame, along with the tramp of ever increasing tourists. In 2013, four replica caves, created by the Mumbai-based designer Rakesh Rathod, were opened at the visitor centre 4km (2.5 miles) from the rock face. The idea was to reduce numbers heading to the precious chaityagrihas and viharas. The fake caves, however, have not been a success: evidently, visitors want the real thing even though many clearly revel in the shopping bazaar and food stalls greeting anyone making pilgrimages to Ajanta today. And, yet the serenity of the sleeping Buddha lying in one of the caves, the summer and winter solstice sunlight illuminating statues of the praying Buddha, the spellbinding architecture and the compelling beauty of the wall paintings lift Ajanta above such worldly concerns. This might be a tourist magnet, yet thanks to generations of conservationists, Ajanta remains a gateway to Nirvana.

Spread to UST,Your favourite Ashes tour moment,2024-09-25,2017-12-08,Mark Mitchener,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/41643205,"England's James Anderson, Graeme Swann and Alastair Cook celebrate retaining the Ashes in Melbourne in 2010 It's official - England's demolition of Australia in Melbourne in 2010-11 is your favourite Ashes tour moment. Of the 25,000 BBC Sport users who voted online, 31% chose England's perfect Boxing Day as their highlight from more than a century of Ashes contests. Steve Harmison's first-ball wide in the first Test in 2006-07 was the second most popular choice, while England's three-run win in Melbourne in 1982 pipped the infamous 1932-33 'Bodyline' series into third. Here's the full run-down... Chris Tremlett and Tim Bresnan were not in England's XI for the first two Tests Win the toss, put them in, bowl them out, and overhaul their total without losing a wicket. Is this the nearest England's travelling fans will ever come to a perfect first day? England captain Andrew Strauss was vindicated in fielding first as pace bowlers Chris Tremlett (4-26), James Anderson (4-44) and Tim Bresnan (2-25) gave a seam and swing bowling masterclass to bowl Australia out for 98, their lowest Test score against England at the MCG. All 10 wickets fell to catches behind the wicket - six to wicketkeeper Matt Prior and four to the slip cordon. It meant England still had 47 overs to face. But Strauss and Alastair Cook did so with little fuss, ending the day on 157-0 as Australia's pace attack misfired and Mitchell Johnson was taunted mercilessly by the Barmy Army. England went on to win by an innings in little more than four days to retain the Ashes. What they said: ""In Andrew Strauss' wildest dreams, he couldn't have hoped it would turn out like this."" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew. Harmison's first ball went straight to his close friend Andrew Flintoff - at second slip ""The Harmison ball"" - three words that still strike fear into any England supporter. Confidence was high among the thousands of fans who travelled down under following the euphoria of recapturing the urn in 2005. After Australia chose to bat in the first Test in Brisbane, skipper Andrew Flintoff threw the ball to Steve Harmison, who had terrorised Australia's top order on the morning of the first Test in 2005. Harmison charged in at Justin Langer... and bowled a delivery so wide that it was caught by Flintoff at second slip. It is the worst - and most famous - first ball in history. The tone was set. Australia racked up 602-9 declared en route to a 277-run win at the Gabba and romped to a 5-0 whitewash. What they said: ""I froze. I let the enormity of the occasion get to me. My whole body was nervous. I could not get my hands to stop sweating."" Steve Harmison. England's three-run win equalled a Test record for the narrowest victory, although it was surpassed in 1993 and 2005 This was one of the closest Tests of all time - only 10 runs separated the scores of the four innings. Australia had two days to score 292 for victory, and were still 74 short when last man Jeff Thomson joined Allan Border. England captain Bob Willis spread his field for established batsman Border, offering him singles so England could target tailender Thomson, but the pair chipped away at the target, and eventually, with four runs needed, he turned to England's talisman. ""Ian Botham is going to have one last crack at Jeff Thomson,"" Henry Blofeld told Test Match Special listeners. Thomson flashed at a wide delivery, the ball flew off the edge, second slip Chris Tavare could only parry the ball, but Geoff Miller ran behind him at first slip to complete the catch. It was Botham's 100th wicket against Australia, and England had sneaked home. What they said: ""It became heart-stopping stuff. We were down to the last throw of the dice when I handed the ball to Botham."" England captain Bob Willis. Bill Woodfull - pictured here taking evasive action in the fourth Test in Brisbane - was hit over the heart in Adelaide, but while an orthodox field was in place The 'Bodyline' series of 1932-33 has gone down in history as one of the most famous, or infamous, Test series after England captain Douglas Jardine devised a 'leg theory' strategy to nullify the threat posed by Australia's Don Bradman, the best batsman in the world. His weapons of choice were Nottinghamshire fast bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce, who bowled short-pitched deliveries at the batsman's body with several close fielders posted on the leg side. The biggest flashpoint came at Adelaide. Larwood struck captain Bill Woodfull over the heart, while wicketkeeper Bert Oldfield retired hurt with a fractured skull. England cruised to victory, but the rest of the game was overshadowed by a rancorous exchange of cables between the Australian board, which considered England's tactics ""unsportsmanlike"", and the MCC, which furiously demanded the word be retracted. The controversy led to the Laws of Cricket being changed to limit aggressive and dangerous bowling. What they said: ""In Australia to this day, the word Bodyline carries the stench of underhand or unsportsmanlike behaviour, with the series regarded as Australian cricket's most controversial."" David Studham, Australian National Sports Museum. Mitchell Johnson's 313 Test wickets put him fourth on Australia's all-time list If ever a series deserved to be named after one player, this was it. Mitchell Johnson's figures alone make scary enough reading: 37 wickets at an average of 13.97 in five Tests. Imagine what it was like to face him from 22 yards, a growling, moustachioed wrecking ball charging in and producing what several respected judges said was the fastest bowling they had ever seen. Johnson's 7-40 in the first innings in Adelaide were his most impressive figures, but perhaps the psychological damage inflicted in the series opener in Brisbane was even more telling. It said much for the hold that he held over the England batsmen that a second 5-0 whitewash in three Ashes tours looked likely long before the series was over. What they said: ""I heard Stuart Broad, James Anderson and Graeme Swann say they were scared. When you've got that, you know that a bloke in the other team is doing damage."" Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen. Stuart MacGill was the second of Gough's three hat-trick victims Australia won the toss in the final Test in Sydney and the first day was dominated by a stand of 190 by the Waugh twins as Mark (121) and Steve (96) made hay on their home ground. However, there was to be a brief moment of magic for England's travelling fans. Darren Gough had been a mainstay of England's attack as they struggled for most of the 1990s, but the Barnsley pace bowler wrote his name into Ashes history at the SCG. With three deliveries left in an over, Gough had Ian Healy caught behind with one that climbed; Stuart MacGill had his middle stump removed by a searing yorker that swung out late; and, roared on by the England fans, Gough pegged back Colin Miller's off stump with another. What they said: ""The ball to Miller ended up being probably the best I've bowled all series."" Darren Gough. Elton John (centre) entertains Phil DeFreitas (l) and Phil Edmonds (r) A squad containing Ian Botham, David Gower and Allan Lamb was never likely to struggle on the social side of an overseas tour. The 1986-87 series proved to be successful on and off the field for England, who made a mockery of this comment in one newspaper: ""There are only three things wrong with this England team. They can't bat, can't bowl and can't field."" Mike Gatting's side confounded their critics to win the series 2-1 and retain the urn. Botham, as ever, reserved his best performances for the 'old enemy', while opener Chris Broad - six months after son Stuart was born - hit centuries in three successive Tests. Phil DeFreitas gets into the spirit during the Christmas Day fancy dress party Off the field, the team partied hard. Pop star Elton John spent time with the squad for much of the tour, and acted as DJ for the victory party after the Ashes were clinched in Melbourne. The traditional Christmas Day fancy-dress party, a staple of winter tours in those days, was particularly memorable, the star of the show being seam bowler Phil DeFreitas dressed as singer Diana Ross. It was England's last Ashes success for some time - they would not win it again until 2005. What they said: ""David Gower and Allan Lamb were having this drinks race. When we got on the coach, Gower was spewing out of the window, Lamby was stopping the driver to go to Pizza Hut."" Phil DeFreitas. Damien Fleming, trapped lbw, was the fifth of Dean Headley's six wickets In the Melbourne Test of 1998, rain meant Boxing Day was lost to the weather before 12 wickets fell on day two, 10 on day three, and a staggering 18 on day four - a day that belonged to Dean Headley. Australia were cruising on 103-2, chasing only 175 for a victory that would have given them a 3-0 series lead. But pace bowler Headley had Justin Langer brilliantly caught by a diving Mark Ramprakash at square leg during a blistering spell of 5-9 that left Australia teetering on 140-7. Australia claimed the extra half-hour as Steve Waugh inched the hosts to within 14 runs of their target, at which point Headley had Matt Nicholson caught behind. Darren Gough claimed the final two wickets in the following over to wrap up a pulsating 12-run victory, while man of the match Headley finished with a career-best 6-60. It ended a marathon four-hour session at the end of a day that featured eight hours and two minutes of play - the longest in Test history. What they said: ""Headley's irresistible spell on the final day at Melbourne provided the highlight of the tour."" Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. Steve Waugh's 29th Test century equalled Sir Donald Bradman's tally for Australia Captain Steve Waugh was under pressure for his place and Australia were in the midst of a collapse when he arrived at the crease at 56-3, just before tea on day two of the fifth Test in Sydney. But he raced through the gears, passing 50 from only 61 deliveries and becoming only the third player in history to reach 10,000 Test runs. He made it to 95 with one over of the day remaining - to be bowled by off-spinner Richard Dawson. An expectant SCG - his home ground - chanted Waugh's name as the over began with three dot balls. Waugh scored three off the fourth. Adam Gilchrist's single gave Waugh the strike back. On 98, he drove the final delivery of the day through cover for four. He leapt in celebration, the crowd roared and Waugh's place in the pantheon of greats was assured. What they said: ""That was the most sensational piece of individually constructed piece of cricketing theatre that I have ever seen."" Commentator Mark Nicholas. Warne took 708 Test wickets, including a record 195 in Ashes Tests Leg-spinner Shane Warne tormented England throughout his career, sparking collapses and spreading panic for the best part of 15 years. Although his 'Ball of the Century' to Mike Gatting at Old Trafford in 1993 remains his most famous Ashes delivery, Warne's finest moment on home soil was arguably his hat-trick in Melbourne in 1994. The setting was Warne's home ground, the iconic MCG - a month after he had been on a hat-trick in the first Test at Brisbane but failed to remove England number 11 Phil Tufnell. In England's second innings, Phil DeFreitas was lbw playing back to a top-spinner, Darren Gough was caught behind off the glove as he lunged at a big leg-break, and Devon Malcolm - with seven Australians camped round the bat and the crowd roaring - was brilliantly caught by a diving David Boon at short leg. It was the first Ashes hat-trick for 90 years. Boon was mobbed by Warne and his jubilant team-mates and Australia wrapped up a crushing 295-run win moments later. They went on to win the series 2-1 and Warne finished with 27 wickets. What they said: ""I closed my eyes and bowled my stock ball - a leg-spinner with a bit more overspin in the hope that it would bounce a bit more."" Shane Warne. Tyson took 76 wickets in only 17 Tests at an average of 18.56 The legendary Donald Bradman described England's Frank Tyson as the ""fastest bowler I have ever seen"". Richie Benaud, who witnessed more Tests as player and broadcaster than anyone else, agreed. In an injury-hit career, Tyson burned briefly, but brightest in the 1954-55 Ashes when he was picked ahead of Fred Trueman. Len Hutton's England lost the first Test in Brisbane, but Tyson - playing his first full Test series - was at the centre of a stunning comeback that helped them win 4-1. Hit on the head by rival pace bowler Ray Lindwall in the second Test at Sydney, Tyson took six wickets in the second innings, and he returned figures of 7-27 on a treacherous Melbourne pitch in the third Test. Not without reason was he nicknamed 'Typhoon'. Tyson finished the series with 28 wickets at an average of 20.82, but injuries restricted him to only 11 more Test appearances. What they said: ""When he came on I was standing 50 yards back at slip; I was closer to the fence than the stumps."" England team-mate Tom Graveney. Steve Waugh spun the coin, Nasser Hussain chose to field, and Australia made hay A decision that Nasser Hussain has never been allowed to forget. Winning the toss in the first Test in Brisbane, England captain Hussain shocked almost everyone by asking the home side to bat first on a true surface and in benign conditions. England bowled poorly, fielded abysmally and Australia ended the day on 364-2 thanks to centuries from Matthew Hayden and Ricky Ponting. England's agony at the Gabba was compounded by an injury to pace bowler Simon Jones, who ruptured ligaments in his knee when he slid to save a boundary. It kept him out of cricket for more than a year. Australia won the first Test by 384 runs, the second and third by an innings and the fourth by five wickets. Only an England win in Sydney prevented a 5-0 whitewash. What they said: ""The ball swung a bit at first, but by the fifth or sixth over nothing was happening and the world was closing in on me. I thought to myself: 'Oh God, Nass, what have you done?'"" Nasser Hussain.

Spread to UST,Covid vaccine priority list 'overlooks teachers',2024-09-25,2021-01-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-55632961,"The priority list for the coronavirus vaccine overlooks the role of teachers and other front-line workers, an MP has said. Charlotte Appleyard, a Derbyshire teacher, launched a petition for teachers, school and childcare staff to be prioritised for the jab. It has gained more than 460,000 signatures, prompting a discussion among MPs on Monday. The government said its priority is saving lives. Ms Appleyard's petition said putting teachers higher on the list would protect children and their families, reduce school closures and allow them to return to normality faster. Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, opening the debate, said it was not about ""leapfrogging"" others but ensuring teachers are considered too.  Ms Antoniazzi, MP for Gower and herself a former teacher, said research by a teaching union had found a ""three to four"" times higher rate of the virus among teachers than the general population, adding there is a lot of opportunity for it to spread in schools. She added: ""This is not about leapfrogging others that deserve the vaccine.  ""[Charlotte Appleyard] wants consideration about where they are placed on that list.  ""Only NHS staff and healthcare workers have been considered priority groups by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) but I and many others think this overlooks the role teachers and front-line workers have played during this pandemic."" In response, vaccine rollout minister Nadhim Zahawi said the government is ""following the science"" and the JCVI's recommendations in choosing who to vaccinate in the first phase. ""I understand the sentiment behind the petition,"" he added. ""[But] this is about saving as many lives as possible as quickly as possible. ""There is no evidence that teachers or childcare workers are at higher risk of mortality. We are protecting against death in this first phase.""  Speaking to Radio 4 on Tuesday Mr Zahawi said teachers, along with other front-line workers, would be ""top of the list"" once they had finished the first phase of vaccinations.

Spread to UST,The fairytale forests reduced to wasteland,2024-09-25,2019-08-04,By Steve Rosenberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49224776,"The village of Podymakhino is blessed with a stunning location.  The great Siberian river, the Lena, flows past here. And, stretching into the distance, is lush green forest - the taiga. It's a picture postcard kind of place. Suddenly the tranquil scene is interrupted by the sound of a helicopter. When it flies into view, I can see a giant bucket suspended on a cable. It's a hint of the drama unfolding over the hills - the battle against fire.  Forest fires in Siberia are common. But this summer unusually hot weather, dry thunderstorms and strong winds have combined to spark an emergency - in Siberia wildfires have engulfed an area the size of Belgium.    Reaching the blazes can be difficult. Most of the fires are in remote areas. In recent days, army planes and helicopters from the Russian emergency service have been dropping water on the flames. But often it's up to local communities to do what they can to contain the threat.  In Podymakhino I meet Gennady Esin. He runs a small farm and timber business, but by necessity he's a firefighter, too, now. Gennady and his team agree to take me into the taiga to show me the situation there. We set off on a military-style off-road truck, bumping along a dirt track.  Soon we're deep in the forest, surrounded by silver birch, cedar and pine trees.  I spot smoke rising from the earth. The forest is smouldering. Small flames are licking at bushes and shrubs. The fire is greatest to one side of the track. ""We've used a bulldozer is create a fireline, a gap, in order to stop the fire spreading,"" Gennady explains. ""In this gap, we've removed vegetation, like dry moss, leaves and twigs, anything combustible. We have to keep monitoring the situation to make sure that sparks don't cross the fireline."" This natural barrier has slowed the spread of the fire. But it hasn't stopped it completely. I can see burning, too, on the other side of the fireline.  Gennady's team has limited resources. A forester called Sergei walks round with a simple pump, extinguishing flames whenever he spots them. But catching all danger points in time is almost impossible. Fire can appear unexpectedly. In the forest one smouldering bush I was looking at suddenly burst into flames.  Another fire-fighting helicopter flies over.  ""Wouldn't it be more effective,"" I ask Gennady, ""to spray the forest from the air with tons of water?""  He shakes his head and points to a dead tree trunk lying on its side. Smoke is rising from one end.  ""If the embers are burning inside dead wood like this,"" he tells me, ""then dropping water from a plane or helicopter won't affect that.""  I can see that one part of the forest has been badly affected by fire - reduced to a charred wasteland strewn with burnt trunks and branches.  Due to the forest fires, a state of emergency is in place across Irkutsk region and in other parts of Siberia. Clouds of smoke have been spreading to towns and cities. In Ust-Kut, where I've been staying - one hour's drive from Podymakhino - a rare rainy day has provided temporary relief from the smog. But the smell of burning is returning.  ""There was so much smoke here. At one point we couldn't see the sun through it,"" Ust-Kut pensioner Nadezhda Mikhailovna tells me. ""I'm still sneezing because of all that smoke. We've only had one rainy day in weeks.""  How much longer will the forests burn? ""That depends on Nature,"" Gennady tells me. ""If it stays dry, then the fires will continue. In Siberia forests can burn until rain in October, or the first snow."""
Spread to UST,"UK tests pass government's 100,000-a-day target",2024-09-25,2020-05-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52508836,"The UK provided more than 122,000 coronavirus tests on the last day of April, passing the government's target, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said. Mr Hancock said the 100,000 target was ""audacious"", but testing was needed to get Britain ""back on her feet"". The figure includes 40,000 tests sent out, including directly to people's homes,  which may not yet have been taken. Mr Hancock set the goal on 2 April, when the UK was on 10,000 tests a day. Some 27,510 people have now died in UK hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus. Of the 122,347 tests provided in the 24 hours up to Friday morning, the number of people tested was fewer - at just over 70,000 - as has been the case since the testing programme began. This is because some people need to be tested more than once to get a reliable result. The total testing figure includes 27,497 kits which were delivered to people's homes and also 12,872 tests that were sent out to centres such as hospitals and NHS sites. However, these may not have been actually used or sent back to a lab. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth suggested the government had been misleading. ""This isn't a time for quibbling but actually 39,000 of these tests have simply been posted out so it's not quite that the government have hit their commitment,"" he told the BBC News channel. ""I don't think posting out the tests is the same as carrying out tests but nonetheless it is welcome that testing has increased."" Prior to 28 April, there was no reference to how tests were counted, but on 28 April guidance on the government website said home tests and satellite tests were being included. At the daily Downing Street briefing, Prof John Newton - a scientist advising the government on testing - said there had been ""no change to the way tests are counted"". ""As we've developed new ways of delivering tests, we've taken advice from officials as to how they should be counted,"" Prof Newton said. ""So, the tests that are done within the control of the programme - which is the great majority - are counted when the tests are undertaken in our laboratories. ""But, for any test which goes outside the control of the programme, they're counted when they leave the programme - so that's the tests that are mailed out to people at home and the test that's gone out on the satellite."" The headline figures certainly look impressive - 122,000 tests in a day. Just a week ago around 25,000 were being recorded and a month ago it stood at 10,000. It is testament to the hard work that has been done behind the scenes by a partnership of government, scientists and the private sector - with a helping hand from the military.  But has the government been a little creative with its counting? It has included home-testing kits sent out to individuals as well as the satellite kits - these are batches of tests sent out to care homes and other settings where there are lots of people who need testing.  Some, no doubt, will never be returned.  A week ago these made little difference to the figures - only a few thousand a day were being sent out. But now they account for around a third of the tests. In his opening remarks, the health secretary suggested the government's 100,000 target had had a ""galvanising effect"".  He said the testing capacity built since then would ""help every single person in this country"", and would ""help us to unlock the lockdown"". Mr Hancock said the government's ""next mission"" was its test, track and trace operation and work was already under way to roll it out. ""By mid-May, we will have an initial 18,000 contact tracers in place,"" he said.  ""The combination of contact tracers and new technology, through our new Covid-19 NHS app, will help tell us where the virus is spreading and help everyone to control new infections."" Mr Hancock added that the next phase would allow the government ""to reassert, as much as is safely possible, the liberty of us all"". The Department of Health established a testing network, including three ""mega labs"" to test samples, almost 50 drive-through centres, a home-testing service and mobile testing units, as part of the drive to achieve the government's target. Meanwhile, Mr Hancock also expanded the list of people eligible for testing throughout the month. At first, across the UK, the focus was on testing the sickest patients in hospitals, followed by health, care and emergency services staff. As of last week, other essential workers and their families in England became eligible for testing, if they showed symptoms. Testing was further expanded in England earlier this week to millions more people, with symptoms including over-65s, those who have to leave home to work, and people living with someone in these groups. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced earlier that testing will be expanded to over-65s with symptoms and also all those in care homes where there has been an outbreak. And on Friday, the Welsh government extended coronavirus testing to people in care homes even if they are not showing symptoms of the disease. In other developments:"
Spread to UST,Week ahead in Parliament,2024-09-25,2018-02-23,By Mark D'Arcy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-43169995,"Parliament's Brexit phoney war continues this week, with key pieces of legislation being held back by the government. The Taxation (Cross Border Trade) Bill and the Trade Bill have both cleared their Commons committee stages, but they may now be marooned in parliamentary limbo until after Easter, while the fragmented tribes of Commons Remainers plot to attach toxic (to the government, anyway) amendments. Proposals on another key Brexit issue - immigration - float in the clouds nearby.  In the Lords, peers have barely begun their detailed scrutiny of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, and serious attempts to amend it won't start until after Easter.  So much for all the talk of Parliament being swamped by the legislative implications of the Leave vote. Instead, our lawmakers are sweeping up the last vestiges of uncontroversial measures about space ports and nuclear safeguards, and remarking to each other in the tones of a 1950s western, that it's ""quiet, too quiet."" Labour's flirtation with the idea of supporting Britain establishing ""a"" customs union with the EU may have dramatic implications for these and other bills when they do come to the wicket. If Labour whips in favour of amendments along those lines, the government could be in trouble, and Remain Conservatives may face a painful choice between their party and their euro-principles. But that is for the future. Next week there is a bit of novelty to divert MPs, in the form of two days of ""Estimates"" debates. The novel bit is that they will actually get to debate, er, the estimates, the government's detailed plans for spending taxpayers' money. For years Estimates Days were rather strange occasions, on which the Commons would be presented with a select committee report or two to debate, before rubber stamping plans to spend billions of pounds of public money. If any MP had the temerity to stray into the substance of what they were voting on, and suggest that more might be spent on X, and less on Y, they would be ruled out of order by the chair.  For a Parliament that once fought a civil war, and indeed beheaded a king, for the right to control the public purse strings, this seemed a little feeble. And now, some deft behind the scenes re-jigging has given MPs control over the subjects to be debated on Estimates Days. They can pitch ideas for the debates to the Backbench Business Committee, which then chooses the subjects for four debates, each of three hours, spread across Monday and Tuesday, next week. It is a quiet triumph for backbench and select committee power. The chosen subjects are spending on defence, homelessness, the Department for Exiting the EU, and transport. MPs will be able to talk about the spending plans in these areas to their hearts' content. Ministers will then have to respond and justify why, for example, various rail electrification schemes have been put on ice, or parry claims that too much infrastructure spending goes to London.  What they won't be able to do is actually change the spending plans but the hope is that the fear of a rough ride from the Commons will mean MPs can exert some leverage over ministers. We shall see.  Here's my rundown of the week ahead:  The Commons meets at 2.30 pm for Home Office Questions, and any post-weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions will normally follow from 3.30pm Then comes the first revamped Estimates Day (see above). It is divided into two three-hour debates. The first is on the Ministry of Defence, where MPs, including the Defence Committee Chair Julian Lewis, will seek to press the Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson, on the level of defence spending. Dr Lewis wants to see Britain spending 3 per cent of GDP, as it did until the mid 1990s, rather than the NATO minimum of 2 per cent. The threatened cuts to the Royal Marines look certain to feature, as well. (The following day, MPs will vote on authorising spending of £8,852,638,000, £1,363,500,000, and £1,703,385,000 for defence purposes.)  Next there's a debate on the estimates for DExEU - the Brexit department. This is an umbrella term for a debate on the cost of implementing Brexit, the day to day activities and the practical spending on transitional arrangements, as the Brexit process moves into a critical six months.   The adjournment debate, led by Labour's Liz McInnes, is on the future of diabetes care, treatment and prevention. In Westminster Hall (4.30 pm) MPs debate e-petition 200205 ""End the export of live farm animals after Brexit."" The petition, signed by 78,884 people, says the transport of live animals exported from the UK causes immense suffering. It adds that the trade is governed by EU law, not the UK Government, and that the Government should plan legislation to ban the export of live farm animals in favour of carcass-only trade and introduce this as soon as Britain leaves the EU. There's a bit of a rail theme on the committee corridor, with Public Accounts (4 pm) looking at rail franchising in the UK based on a report by the public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, which notes an improved performance in the management of franchises, since the collapse of the West Coast Main Line competition, but highlights continuing risks over the rail infrastructure improvement programme. The Committee will explore those issues with Bernadette Kelly, the Permanent Secretary at the Department for Transport, plus witnesses from Network Rail and major franchise holders.  In the Lords (2.30 pm) peers warm up for their second day of detailed debate on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill with questions to ministers on the National Child Obesity Strategy, representations opposing electrical safety checks in the private rented housing and establishing the proposed new Northern Forest.   Then comes the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill where big Labour amendments on reciprocal health rights for British and EU citizens and on UK participation in the student exchange programme, Erasmus, are next up for debate. Peers may get to Lord Goldsmith's amendment on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. One emerging feature of these debates is the rough treatment of the Brexit minister Lord Callanan. he is regularly getting biffed by peers who accuse him of failing to answer the points they have made. Perhaps it is just the result of the debates dragging on past midnight, but he seems to be becoming a bit of a target. MPs begin (11.30 am) with Treasury Questions followed by the second of the new-look Estimates Days, focussing on homelessness.  This was called for by the Public Accounts Committee, in the wake of their report on homelessness, published last year. This should be a wide ranging debate involving several government departments, including Communities and Local Government, Work and Pensions and Health. The idea is to look at the factors driving the current rise in rough sleeping and homelessness generally. The PAC was critical of the way the government spends the £1.1 billion allocated to homelessness prevention, but the system is likely to change when the Homelessness Reduction Act comes into force in April.  The second debate will be on transport where the issue under scrutiny will be some of the government's big infrastructure decisions on rail electrification, as well as the geographical balance of the spending. Are the regions being short-changed in favour of London?   My committee pick is the Brexit hearing (9.15am) with Pascal Lamy, the former Director General of the World Trade Organisation which will doubtless explore the implications of the UK trading with the EU on WTO terms, rather than with the kind of bespoke deal the government is seeking. In the Lords (2.30 pm) question-time features what appears to be the hot new fashion among soft Brexit/Remain parliamentarians: the possibility of UK membership of the European Free Trade Agency. The Labour peer Lord Lea of Crondall, a former vice president of the European TUC, will ask if membership of EFTA could be a way of remaining in the European Single Market, post-Brexit. Then, peers will deal with Commons amendments to the Space Industry Bill. The main change, which will probably be rubber-stamped with minimal delay, was a requirement for an environmental assessment as part of the process for licensing a space port. Then they will turn to the detail of the Laser Misuse (Vehicles) Bill , which introduces an offence of shining or directing a laser beam towards a vehicle which dazzles or distracts the person with control of the vehicle.   Next comes the second reading of the Haulage Permits and Trailer Registration Bill - a Brexit bill which gives powers to support UK hauliers operating internationally after the UK leaves the EU.  It would allow the government to set up a permit scheme for hauliers if required as part of a deal with the EU, ensuring UK hauliers can obtain the necessary paperwork to provide services to and from EU countries.  In the Commons (11.30 am) business begins with international development questions, with Prime Minister's Questions at noon.  The Labour MP John Mann has a Ten Minute Rule Bill to make social media service providers liable in defamation and libel actions - a major change which would have a dramatic impact on what could be published online in the UK The main debate is on a motion on the independent complaints and grievance policy that the House authorities want to introduce. Te motion, which has cross party support, endorses the recommendations of the working group which drew up the policy and sets in train the work needed to implement it. It includes several elements. One is drawing up a behaviour code for Parliament that covers bullying and harassment, and sexual harassment, and applies to everyone working there. There are also plans to set up the independent complaints scheme which will underpin the code, devise procedures for allegations of sexual harassment and to identify any necessary amendments to the Standing Orders of the House. Then there's the novelty of some opposed private business. It's the report stage of the The Middle Level Bill deals with navigation issues in the Fens. Some MPs have objected to it going through without debate. In Westminster Hall, my eye was caught by Dr Rupa Huq's debate (2.30 - 4 pm) on anti-corruption strategy and the illegal wildlife trade - focusing on the vast profits from dealing in products from endangered species, like ivory and rhino horn, and the link to money laundering. My committee pick is the Northern Ireland Affairs hearing (9.30am) on devolution and democracy in Northern Ireland. MPs will be asking the Northern Ireland Secretary, Karen Bradley what happens now, after the failure of attempts to reinstate devolved government. With talk in some quarters that the Good Friday Agreement, which mandates all-party coalition government in Stormont, needs to be revised, this will be a highly sensitive session. In the Lords after question-time (3pm) peers grind on with day three of their detailed consideration of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill. Watch out for amendments on animal sentience - perhaps one of the surprise Brexit issues. Other issues include future treatment of retained law, such as employment protections, and guidance for domestic courts MPs kick off (9.30 am) with transport questions, which is followed by the revival of a Commons tradition. The St David's Day debate on Welsh Affairs used to be a fixture, since it was first proposed by Megan Lloyd George in 1944,  but with the advent of the Backbench Business Committee, in 2010, it was no longer a guaranteed part of the Commons calendar.  Its return follows strong pressure from Welsh MPs for a chance to raise issues about Brexit, and the implications of a hard border with the Irish Republic. There is also concern that the electrified rail link to London stops at Cardiff, and at delays in giving the go-ahead to the Swansea tidal lagoon project, where a government announcement is thought to be due soon.  These are all part of the staple diet at Welsh questions, but the Labour MP Albert Owen, one of the prime movers behind the debate, wants to press the Welsh Secretary, Alun Cairns, to use his influence to make progress on all these issues.   There's an interesting-looking adjournment debate, on the future of ATMs led by the Conservative, Simon Hoare, who is worried that they are beginning to disappear from rural areas, restricting people's access to cash. He blames changes in the money paid by LINK to the operators of ATMs, and he warns that over-reliance on digital banking is misplaced in areas where broadband speed is slow and mobile coverage is patchy.   In Westminster Hall (1.30pm) the DUP's Jim Shannon leads a debate on freedom of religion and belief . He is chair of the all party parliamentary group on international freedom of religion or belief. In the Lords (11 am) watch out for the question from Lord Sherbourne of Didsbury, the former Political Secretary to  Margaret Thatcher, on the effectiveness of Police and Crime Commissioners in holding their chief constables and police forces to account.  The main debate in the Lords is the second committee stage day on the Nuclear Safeguards Bill, where the main points at key issue are freedom of movement, ONR independence and funding, and a sunset clause.  There's also a short debate on the use of facial recognition technology in security and policing, led by the Green Party's Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb, She argues the system is flawed, gives too many false results, and is intrusive to innocent people. She shares the view of the pressure group Big Brother Watch that  ""facial recognition cameras are essentially biometric checkpoints - no different to DNA or fingerprint checkpoints. They biometrically assess and check the identities of passers-by, turning us all into walking ID cards."" Neither House is sitting on Friday."

Spread to UST,The 'brutal' migrant route made tougher by pandemic,2024-09-25,2020-10-06,By Manuel Rueda,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-54418542,"Ángel García breathed heavily through his mouth as he hiked out of Pamplona, a scenic town nested in the Andes Mountains and located 2,300 meters above sea level. With his belongings stuffed into a blue back-pack and a red gym bag that hung from his right shoulder, the 21-year-old was making a 1,600km (1,000 mile) trek to the Colombian city of Cali, where he was hoping to live with a cousin and find construction work. ""This has been brutal"" said Mr García, who left the Venezuelan city of Valencia in the last week of September without any money for the bus fare. ""Nobody wants to give us a lift here. Every day we are hungry and we're cold."" Mr García, who was travelling with his partner, said that he left Venezuela with about $1 (£0.75) in his pocket. It was all he could save from his job as a butcher, which paid about $10 a week. Now he is among thousands of Venezuelans who are walking towards cities in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru as the economies of these South American countries pick up after almost six months of restrictions imposed to curb the coronavirus pandemic.  More than five million Venezuelans have left their country since 2015 according to the United Nations, with the poorest walking and hitchhiking for days along mountainous roads that connect cities like Bogotá, Cali, Quito and Lima. But migrants say this route has become tougher and more dangerous since the pandemic broke out. And it is not just because of the lack of lorry drivers willing to provide free lifts.  In Colombia, shelters built along the main migrant routes have been forced to close by municipal governments trying to avoid large indoor gatherings. Land border closures imposed by the governments of Colombia, Ecuador and Peru meanwhile, have forced many migrants to turn to criminal groups that control illegal border crossings. ""I was in a group of four people and we paid 160,000 pesos ($45; £32) to cross the border"" said Verónica Gómez, a Venezuelan dental assistant who arrived in Colombia in September and was attempting to hitchhike to Peru.   ""They call it a collaboration but it's just an elegant way of charging you"" her son, Yurfran said.      Venezuelan migrants walking along the road that leads out of the Colombian border city of Cúcuta said they paid fees of anywhere from $1 to $20 to groups controlling illegal border crossings, while those without cash paid by ""donating"" their mobile phones. David Smolanksy, the commissioner for Venezuelan migrants and refugees at the Organization of American States, said that border closures could have even more severe consequences for desperate migrants. ""These Venezuelans who take the illegal crossings expose themselves to recruitment from armed groups"" he said in a news conference. ""They can also be kidnapped or assassinated.""  The closure of shelters meanwhile, has been particularly tough on migrants travelling with children. In Pamplona, at least 100 Venezuelan migrants sleep on pavements each night, braving night-time temperatures that can reach 5C (41F). Some said they had been stranded in the small town for days and would not leave until they received money transfers from relatives for bus tickets. Others waited to get a ride that would take them beyond the Páramo de Berlín, a plateau located at 4,000m (1,300ft) altitude where night-time temperatures can fall well below freezing and migrants risk dying from hypothermia. Before the pandemic, there were four shelters along the 120km road which leads out of Pamplona, climbs up to the plateau, and descends into the warm city of Bucaramanga. All of them are now closed. ""If the shelters were open we could try to walk through the páramo,"" said Johan Guerra, a 42-year-old migrant who was travelling with his wife and his six-year-old child and was promised work at a coffee farm near Medellín. He had been sleeping on a pavement in Pamplona for three days. But humanitarian groups said that since the pandemic started it has been difficult for migrants to get any sort of help.  ""Some perceive migrants as people who might be infected with coronavirus, so there is more rejection towards them"" said Giselle Pérez, a psychologist working for a project that helps migrants and is financed by Caritas France.  Every week her team drives along the road that leads out of Pamplona and hands out bags with energy bars, water and cold-weather gear.  ""It's harder now for migrants to get rides or even water from homes along the road"" Ms Pérez said.  Despite these challenges the number of Venezuelan migrants entering Colombia appears to be increasing.  Social workers in Pamplona recorded more than 2,500 migrants passing through the town in September, although that does not include those who get there on buses.   Colombian immigration officials said in September that they expect 200,000 migrants from Venezuela to arrive in the country before the end of this year.  The Colombian government says that at the beginning of the pandemic approximately 100,000 Venezuelans returned home after losing their jobs. But with the minimum wage in Venezuela currently worth $2 a month, there is a big incentive to migrate to Colombia and other South American countries, where basic wages are about 100 times higher.  ""Life was unaffordable in Venezuela"" Mr García said. ""I would spend all my salary on a kilo of rice, some flour, eggs and cheese."""

Spread to UST,No walkies pug piles on the pounds,2024-09-25,2019-02-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-47073384,"An podgy pug ballooned to the same weight as a toddler when her former owner did not take her out for walks. Twelve-year-old Sugar, who weighs in at a hefty 1st 12lbs (11.9kg), has been put on a strict diet and exercise regimen to help her lose weight. She has shed about 2.2lbs (1kg) since rescuer Steve Jones, from Caerphilly, took her in, but has some way to go before reaching a healthy weight. Animal charity the PDSA said obesity in pets can cause various health problems. Excess weight in flat-faced breeds such as Pugs and French Bulldogs can make it difficult for the animals to breathe, it said. Mr Jones said Sugar, who suffers with poor vision and deafness, recently had all of her teeth removed.  Her previous owner was partially sighted, he said, meaning Sugar could not be walked.  His other dog, a healthy Bichon Frise called Winston, is walked four times a day, but Sugar struggles to make it through just one, Mr Jones said.  ""I take Sugar out as well but we have to go at her pace and it takes a lot longer so she is walked once a day at the moment,"" said Mr Jones. ""Since she's had her bad teeth removed she seems healthier and happier, so we're going to try and increase her exercise."" According to the Kennel Club, the ideal weight for a pug is between 14 and 18 lbs (6.3 and 8.1kg). About 40% of cats and dogs in the UK are overweight or obese, so here are some tips from PDSA to get your porky pets in shape.  The PDSA said obesity can reduce a dog's life expectancy by about two years and six months.  PDSA vet Olivia Anderson-Nathan said: ""Obesity has been a huge problem among UK pets for a number of years and sadly there is no sign of improvement.

Spread to UST,Alagiah 'overwhelmed' by viewers' support,2024-09-25,2019-01-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-46987789,"George Alagiah has said he is ""overwhelmed"" by supportive comments from viewers welcoming his return to BBC One's News at Six.  The 63-year-old's bowel cancer returned in December 2017, forcing him to take time away from work to receive treatment. He wrote on Twitter that the cancer was ""in a holding pattern"", which meant he could work again.  Fellow newsreader Sophie Raworth confirmed his return on Twitter. Alagiah replied to the tweet, writing: ""There goes my hope of slipping back into the studio unnoticed! Thanks to all for good wishes.""  After the news he added he is ""determined to get behind that studio desk as often as I can"". After Alagiah's initial diagnosis in 2014, the disease spread to his liver and lymph nodes, which needed treatment with several rounds of chemotherapy and three large operations, including one to remove most of his liver.  He returned to work in 2015, but again had to take more time out in 2017 when he was told that his stage four bowel cancer had returned. Upon his return on Wednesday evening, viewers and fellow colleagues appeared delighted, with many complimenting his new beard. Labour MP David Lammy wrote on Twitter: ""So pleased to see George Alagiah back where he belongs. One of the best in the business.""  Veteran BBC broadcaster John Simpson added: ""It's an absolute delight to see George Alagiah reading the news again - one of the finest and most thoughtful of my colleagues."" The BBC's health editor Hugh Pym said: ""Great to see George Alagiah back on air on 6pm news after cancer treatment - welcome back!""

Spread to UST,Thousands of primary pupils face closed schools,2024-09-25,2021-01-04,By Sean Coughlan,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-55525681,"Thousands of pupils have not started primary school as expected - with local closures in several parts of England. Head teachers warned of a ""confusing picture"" with some schools staying shut after teachers' union safety warnings about the risk of Covid infections. A joint letter from education unions called for a ""pause"" in reopening schools, accusing the government of ""creating chaos"". The Department for Education said closing should only be a ""last resort"". Adding to the uncertainty, some local authorities have argued against reopening and some individual primary schools have remained closed for most pupils - in addition to those schools already required to stay shut because of high coronavirus levels. There are so far no official national figures for how many schools have not have fully opened, apart from for vulnerable and key workers' children - but local reports include: Health Secretary Matt Hancock said school was the ""right place"" for children, wherever possible. ""When it comes to schools, we've taken the decision not to reopen schools in some of the most affected areas. ""But these are difficult balances - and people will have very mixed emotions,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. If schools are closed, Labour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds has called for support for parents unable to work because of childcare problems. Vicky Smith from Hertfordshire faces an anxious personal dilemma about sending her daughter back to primary school - as she is worried about the risk of infection to her seriously ill father, who also lives with them. ""I want to send my kids to school because all her friends are there, but what if she brings it home?,"" she says. ""Chances are if she gives it to her granddad, she might not have a granddad. It's not so much we think our children are in danger - it's the people they are going to bring it down to."" Vicky also says even in Tier 4 the current restrictions do not seem to be particularly strict. ""You can still go to work and go to school, it doesn't feel safe.  ""My dad is quite happy for her to go to school, but how is she going to feel if she gives it to her granddad. I don't know what to do.  ""I don't want to get a big fine and I don't want to stop her learning. But I also feel… I just don't know what to do."" Secondary schools are staying closed this week except for vulnerable and key workers' children - and in local authorities with high levels of coronavirus, including across London, primary schools are also not open to most pupils. But reopening primary schools in other areas, including for some in Tier 4, has been challenged, with the biggest teachers' union, the National Education Union, calling for teaching to be moved online for the first two weeks of term. The NEU has advised teachers they can say they are not going to teach classes in school because of concerns over safety. A joint letter from education unions, including teachers and support staff, says bringing pupils back to school ""risks increasing the infection rate"" and means exposing school staff to ""serious risk of ill-health"".  The letter, co-ordinated by the TUC, calls for priority access to Covid vaccines for school staff and to move lessons online ""while Covid-secure working arrangements are reviewed"". Any school closures should be kept to an ""absolute minimum"", said Amanda Spielman, head of the Ofsted education watchdog, because ""children's lives can't just be put on hold while we wait for vaccination programmes"". But the wife of a primary school teacher in Harrow who caught Covid towards the end of last term, and was hospitalised over Christmas, said protecting staff had to be a priority.  ""Teachers are passionate and loyal but somebody needs to fight for them,"" she told the BBC. Mungo Sheppard, head teacher of Ash Green primary school in Calderdale, says his school opened as planned on Monday - without staff staying away, but with higher than usual numbers of missing pupils. Of the school's 500 pupils, Mr Sheppard says 75 are off, mostly with ""Covid-related"" issues, compared with 15 absent at the end of last term. ""We also have, for the first time since September, children whose parents have taken the decision to keep them at home due to anxieties linked to the new variant and rising rates,"" he said. But the head teacher says their efforts have been hampered by last-minute decisions at a national level. ""It has been incredibly difficult to make these decisions and communicate them in a tiny timeframe and within a holiday,"" says Mr Sheppard. Some local authorities have backed schools deciding not to open - and others have questioned the decision to keep schools open in some areas, when other nearby schools have been told to shut. Kent County Council called for a delay in reopening primary schools in four parts of the county. But a message on Twitter from the Conservative MP for Folkestone and Hythe, Damian Collins, suggested further changes were on the way. After a meeting with School Standards Minister Nick Gibb, Mr Collins said the ""decision about which schools will be required to stay open will be reviewed in the next few days by the Department for Education"". Julian Rose, head of West Chiltington School in West Sussex, has an inset day on Monday and is expecting to open on Tuesday. He says ""some very anxious"" parents have been in touch about children going back when the area is in Tier 4. ""I think many feel astonished that we are still open when operating under Tier 4,"" says Mr Rose. And he says the school will ""not have a full complement of staff in attendance"". A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Children's education has consistently been a national priority, which is why we want classrooms to reopen wherever possible in the new term. ""Schools will continue to implement appropriate safety measures to help mitigate the risk of transmission."" Are you a parent of schoolchildren? Or are you a teacher?

Spread to UST,Newcastle United 1-4 Manchester United,2024-09-25,2020-10-16,Saj Chowdhury,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/54489181,"Marcus Rashford was one of Manchester United's best players and scored their fourth deep into stoppage time Manchester United scored three late goals at Newcastle to earn victory and help ease the misery inflicted by the heavy defeat against Tottenham. It was an incredible final few minutes for a team who looked as if they had blown their chance of three points following Bruno Fernandes' failure from the penalty spot in the 58th minute. United needed a positive reaction following that 6-1 thumping by Spurs before the international break, but their hopes suffered a blow when Emil Krafth's cross came off defender Luke Shaw and beat keeper David de Gea. Harry Maguire, who like his side has endured an unsettled period, equalised to haul the visitors back into the game.  And it looked as if the match was set to turn in their favour in the second half when referee Craig Pawson, after consulting the pitch-side monitor, judged Jamal Lewis to have fouled Marcus Rashford and awarded a penalty. However, Fernandes, who previously had a 100% record from the spot for United, saw his fierce strike brilliantly pushed away by Karl Darlow. The Portugal midfielder was not to be denied though and with four minutes remaining he finally beat the Magpies keeper with a thumping finish, before Aaron Wan-Bissaka, with his first for the club, and Rashford ensured United's second win of the season.

You may want to read Twitter’s cookie policy, external and privacy policy, external before accepting. To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’. There were sub-plots coming into this match, centring around how United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would have his team set up after the defeat by Spurs, and how Maguire would perform. The Norwegian stuck by his skipper, whose form has been inconsistent this season and who had been sent off playing for England during the recent international break. The centre-back produced arguably his most confident display of the season and it was somewhat poetic that his precision header brought his side back into the match. The other person in the United camp who experienced both bitter and sweet was Fernandes. He had previously scored 10 out of 10 from the spot for the Red Devils but his run was brought to an emphatic stop by the flying Darlow. But the visitors did not allow their heads to drop, unlike at Old Trafford two weeks ago, and breached the final line of defence once again when Fernandes smacked his angled strike high past the past the Magpies keeper after a glorious move down the left. Wan-Bissaka, on his 50th appearance for the club, produced an equally thunderous finish from the right before Rashford slotted in a well deserved goal for himself.  The England striker, 22, without his familiar strike partners Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood, once again produced a very mature display. David de Gea made a remarkable save from Callum Wilson in the second half The scoreline reads 4-1, but against one of the 'big six', Magpies boss Steve Bruce's side fought fire with fire, particularly in the first half. French winger Allan Saint-Maximin, who dazzled against Burnley in the 3-1 win, starred again - albeit in spurts - and was integral to the move that led to the opener. He then provided the cross for striker Callum Wilson which should have resulted in Newcastle's second, but instead resulted in one of the saves of the season from De Gea. Darlow, 30, made several good stops and continued until the end of the match despite appearing to be suffering from an injury in the final quarter of the game. But even at full fitness the keeper could not have done much about the late goals though, as his team-mates in front of him tired, allowing their opponents to exploits the gaps in defence. This video can not be played 'We showed great resilience' - Solskjaer Newcastle manager Steve Bruce speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: ""They were a handful all night. Some of their forward players and their movement, we found it difficult. They scored from a free-kick we had and broke away [for the second goal] and then towards the end we were a bit naive. ""Darlow has been fantastic. He was brave when we needed him to be. You know your goalkeeper will have to play well against the big teams, I hope he will be OK next week. ""I thought we were a little bit too easy at times to play against. We will go away really, really disappointed because we were 10 minutes away and it could have gone either way when it gets that late. ""It is a work in progress for us. We have tried to change and with that it will take time. The defeat looks worse than it really was."" Newcastle conceded four goals at home in the Premier League for the first time since 5 April 2014, also against Manchester United (4-0). Manchester United enjoyed their 10th comeback win against Newcastle in the Premier League, the most by any side against a single opponent in the competition. Newcastle are without a clean sheet in seven Premier League home games, their longest such run without a shut-out on home soil since February 2014 (eight). Manchester United have been awarded 17 penalties in the Premier League since the start of last season, five more than any other side in the competition (12 scored). Manchester United have scored five own goals against Newcastle in the Premier League (Henning Berg, Wes Brown, Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Luke Shaw), only two sides have scored more against a single opponent (Sunderland v Man Utd and Liverpool v Tottenham). Mata has been directly involved in nine goals against Newcastle United in the Premier League (four goals, five assists); against no other side has he had a hand in more (also nine v Norwich). Fernandes has been directly involved in 20 goals in his 18 Premier League appearances for Manchester United (11 goals, 9 assists), scoring in each of his last three games. Wan-Bissaka became the 116th different player to score for Manchester United in the Premier League in what is his 38th league appearance for the club. Rashford registered three goal involvements in a single Premier League game for the third time (one goal, two assists), also doing so against Fulham in December 2018 and Arsenal in February 2016. Manchester United are at Paris St-Germain in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00 BST) and then host Chelsea at home next Saturday (17:30 BST). Newcastle are Wolves next Sunday (16:30 GMT).

Spread to UST,Muted celebrations as Hogmanay curtailed by Covid,2024-09-25,2022-01-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-59846640,"Scotland's world famous Hogmanay celebrations were muted for a second year after a Covid surge caused the cancellation of major events. The highest profile casualty was Edinburgh's street party and the midnight fireworks. Despite the restrictions about 1,000 people climbed to the top of Calton Hill to toast 2022. Before Christmas, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to ""stay at home as much as possible."" Those who did celebrate outside enjoyed mild conditions on what the Met Office said was, provisionally, the warmest New Year's Eve on record. The peak temperature recorded was 16.5 degrees in the Welsh town of Bala, Gwynedd. Hogmanay street parties across Scotland were called off after crowds at outdoor public events were capped at 500 from 26 December.  The restrictions, which will be in place for at least three weeks, also saw numbers at indoor public events limited to 100 standing or 200 seated. They were introduced following the rapid spread of the Omicron variant which has resulted in a record-breaking number of positive cases. The current 10-day isolation rules, which apply to both positive cases and all household contacts, also meant it was a subdued start to the year for thousands of individuals and families across Scotland. The traditional New Year Loony Dook, which normally sees hundreds of hardy revellers defy the chills of the Firth of Forth in South Queensferry, was also cancelled although many took part in unofficial New Year dips at various locations across Scotland. Despite the pandemic some people were not deterred and travelled thousands of miles to party in Edinburgh and make the most of scaled-down New Year celebration. Brenda Jane Baxter-Vell, from Zimbabwe, travelled to Edinburgh with her friend Captain Kevin Pope, having lost her husband to Covid-19 in November and her father earlier in the year. Mrs Baxter-Vell, speaking outside a bar on the Royal Mile, said: ""We have a lot of family history in Scotland and will spend our time tracking it down."" Captain Pope, formerly of the 1st Kings Own Scottish Borderers, said: ""We booked and paid for the torchlight march to Calton Hill and are very disappointed. ""In the true spirit of flexibility, though, we have made plans within the guidance and restrictions."" Hannah Vorchmann, 52, from Gdynia in Poland, said the £500 she and her husband paid for Hogmanay night in an Edinburgh hotel was a lot for them. Mrs Vorchmann added: ""We saw on the internet that the street celebrations in Edinburgh were off but we could not cancel and flew in today and leave at 4pm on New Year's Day. ""Everything is so beautiful and we'll be back next year."" Eileen and Chris Chalmers, from Dreghorn in Ayrshire, had a few days extra holiday to use. Mrs Chalmers said: ""We specifically chose to visit Edinburgh and the site at Mortonhall, in our campervan, because the large scale festivities were cancelled. ""It seemed an ideal time to come to the city."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had previously said the restrictions were necessary during the current surge in Covid cases because ""large events put an additional burden on emergency services"". The latest daily figures showed a further 11,962 cases of coronavirus had been recorded in Scotland - with 22.6% of tests coming back positive. Thirteen further deaths were reported in Friday's statistics, taking the total number of people who have died within 28 days of a positive test to 9,858. Meanwhile, 859 people were in hospital with coronavirus on Thursday, up from 810 the previous day, with those in intensive care rising by two to 36. Piper Dave Tunstall, aged 44, who caught Covid-19 earlier in the year, drove to the capital from Paisley to busk on the Royal Mile. ""Busking with my pipes is helping pay the bills at the moment,"" said Mr Tunstall, ""I play the double bass in a band called Langan but work is short. ""In previous Hogmanays we have played gigs in London,"" he added. ""It is great to be able to bring music to people at this time of year."" Some Scots travelled south across the border to celebrate in England which does not have the same restrictions on gatherings.  A young woman from Glasgow who was interviewed by the BBC in Carlisle said she was there ""because there's no restrictions - and all our friends have Covid"". Despite the absence of restrictions, locals in the English town reported that the streets did seem quieter than normal at New Year."
Spread to UST,Care homes face staffing exodus over Covid jabs,2024-09-25,2021-06-30,By Alpa Patel,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-57573142,"A care home manager from north London has said he thinks he will lose staff after the government said all carers must have the Covid-19 vaccine. Jonathan Beacham, who manages Eastbrook House in Enfield, said trying to persuade reluctant staff to have the jab put him in a ""difficult position"". London has the highest number of unvaccinated care home staff in the UK. Under the plans, workers face being redeployed away from front-line care or potentially losing their job. Mr Beecham said he was worried about recruiting staff later this year when the policy would be in place.  ""I hope it's not enforced and maybe they can find another way to encourage staff to be vaccinated,"" he said. ""It would be such a shame to lose staff that have been here for three or more years and done a very good job, to leave because of something put upon them.""    He added he had fears families might decide to not place their relatives in a care home based on a low uptake of the vaccine. There are currently more than 100,000 care home staff vacancies in England. According to government statistics, there are 1,020 residential and 368 nursing homes in London. NHS statistics from 777 care homes in London that have reported data shows: One carer told the BBC she thought workers were being bullied. The carer, who did not want to be named, said: ""It's wrong, it's like actually bullying us, they are abusing us to have it."" Although she has had the vaccine, she said it was ""totally unacceptable"" to force carers to, while those who work in the NHS were not.  ""If I didn't have the vaccine and they were pushing like they are now, I would leave,"" she said.  ""In this low paid job that we are not recognised for, we are being bullied and it's not fair.""     Another carer, who had not had the vaccine, said she was still hesitant as she wanted to see if there were any long-term effects. ""I feel pressured, I've got a lot of thinking to do,"" she added. ""I will probably get it but I don't want to be forced. I want it to be my own decision.""   But Alex, whose 94-year-old mother Alice is at the care home, said it was not very reassuring knowing his mother was being looked after by people who had not been vaccinated.  ""I'm vaccinated so I can see my mum. My mum has been vaccinated to protect other residents, and the staff have been vaccinated, it's a give and take.""    Nadra Ahmed, from the National Care Association, said she did not believe the vaccinations should be compulsory at this stage. She added any policy should come from the perspective of the whole system of health and care home workers.  Employment lawyer Sinead Kelly also warned staff may be able to challenge any dismissals as there could be a ""reason not to have a vaccine and in particular reasons that relate to protected characteristics such as religion and beliefs,"" she said. The Department of Health and Social Care said the decision was made ""following extensive public consultation with thousands of staff, providers, residents and families"".  ""We continue to work to drive vaccine uptake among adult social care staff and care home staff specifically, working with national and local stakeholders, including care home managers."" "
Spread to UST,Medics fly in to answer Portugal's Covid emergency,2024-09-25,2021-02-04,By Alison Roberts,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55902317,"The sight of a German military plane touching down in Lisbon on Wednesday, carrying intensive care specialists and ventilators to help save lives in Portugal's embattled hospitals, recalls the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in Europe.  Last spring, when Italy was overwhelmed by the first wave of infections, it was helped out by several other European countries taking in patients - even if many Italians felt it was too little, too late. Now, almost a year on, it is Portugal's turn.  The country's national health service is overwhelmed. There's a shortage of beds and specialist nurses, and in one hospital last week, potentially life-threatening problems in an overburdened oxygen system. Portugal got off relatively lightly in that first wave, although it later caught up in terms of confirmed cases relative to population.  Now, though, the situation here is dramatically worse, with a giant third wave in January that has seen the country top global rankings for new cases and deaths associated with Covid-19.  Daily new cases have recently been around 10 times their peak of last spring, and January accounted for 45% of all coronavirus deaths since the pandemic began. The lockdown imposed in mainland Portugal on 15 January does now seem to be reducing the transmission rate, but there is still a huge number of active cases. ""However low the R [rate] is, if the number of cases is high it is very difficult to get them down,"" said Ricardo Mexia, president of the Portuguese Association of Public Health Doctors. ""That's the problem now."" Active cases: 164,513 Hospital cases: 6,684; Intensive care: 877 Deaths: 13,257 Total number of vaccine doses (1st and 2nd): 350,945 Portuguese population: 10.3 million Source: DGS/Publico, 3 February 2021 Ricardo Mexia blamed the January surge mainly on the decision to ease coronavirus restrictions over Christmas, although he also noted the rapid spread of the UK variant that had brought significantly more younger patients into hospital with Covid-19. The government, for its part, cited that more contagious variant, which now predominates among new cases, as its main reason for imposing a full lockdown. In a sign of how fluid the situation is, just days after that announcement, it backtracked on its pledge to keep schools open, instead suspending face-to-face classes. With no date for schools to reopen, remote learning is to start up from 8 February. Meanwhile, the number of patients in hospital with Covid-19 continues to set new records and is currently more than five times the peak of last spring. With barely half a dozen intensive care beds free in Portugal, the issue is not so much a lack of beds as shortages of specialist staff and equipment.  The medical staff, 50 ventilators and 150 beds flown in from Germany will help, but it merely highlights the tens of thousands of Portuguese nurses - including many specialists - who have emigrated in recent years. The situation is most acute in the Lisbon region, which is seeing around half of new cases and where hospitals have been struggling. A hospital in Amadora, just north of the capital, last week had to hurriedly transfer dozens of patients to other units in the region because of its overloaded oxygen network.  Across the River Tagus, ambulances this past weekend queued for more than 12 hours outside the main hospital in Almada, as its emergency department struggled with the flood of patients. Civil defence forces have since set up triage tents to free up ambulances. Prime Minister António Costa visited a Lisbon health centre on Wednesday to mark the start of vaccinations for people aged 80 and over who are not living in care homes. But that was later overshadowed by the resignation by the head of the vaccination taskforce. Although Mr Costa has insisted that lockdown is now paying off, the minister of health, Marta Temido, has warned the public that the crisis is far from over. ""This will be another week with a lot of pressure in terms of admissions and the next two weeks will probably be very difficult where intensive care is concerned,"" she said."
Spread to UST,What's a 'Science Princess' doing in an ice field in Alaska?,2024-09-25,2019-07-29,By Dhruti Shah,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-49149441,"While Celeste Labedz knew quite a few fellow scientists would appreciate the picture of her dressed up as a ""glaciologist Princess Elsa"", she had no idea the image would become a viral hit with more than 10,000 ""likes"" on Twitter. She tweeted:  ""I firmly believe that kids should not be taught that girly things and sciencey things are mutually exclusive. Therefore, I packed a cape with my fieldwork gear just to show what glaciologist Princess Elsa would look like. #SciencePrincess #TheColdNeverBotheredMeAnyway"". The cryoseismologist told BBC News: ""I posted the picture because I thought it would resonate with other scientists.  ""I was heading out to Alaska's Juneau Icefield to carry out research and I thought it would be a lot of fun. ""The cape folded up really small so I had it in my backpack. When we had a break, I took it out.  ""I wasn't expecting it to have the effect it had and to spread so far. It's had such a positive response. People are showing it to their kids and that makes me happy."" The reaction was so overwhelming she posted several other images from her trip, along with a link to Nasa facts about glaciers. Celeste and her mum, Cynthia, had originally made the cape to use in a Halloween costume depicting Princess Elsa from the Disney film.   And when she had the idea to pose in the field, Celeste asked Cynthia to send the cape over from her home state of Nebraska to the California Institute of Technology, in Pasadena, so she could fit it in her baggage for the journey to Alaska. ""I loved Cinderella while growing up but Princess Elsa is my favourite Disney character - she loves ice,"" Celeste said. Having posed for the picture, Celeste had to wait before posting it to Twitter, as there was no mobile phone signal on the glacier. She used a digital camera to take all the photos while out on the trip. ""Once I got back, it was about sifting through and sorting the ones for research out first and then looking through the Elsa pictures,"" she said. ""It took a few days. But I also spent quite a lot of time thinking about what I was going to write."" That photo of Celeste standing in the ice field - where she was investigating the use of seismometers to detect earthquakes on glaciers - also prompted others to showcase their pictures, with scientists sharing their own versions of what it's like to be a ""Science Princess"" and parents highlighting how helpful Celeste's image was for children needing a role model. ""It was amazing,"" Celeste said. ""I loved seeing some of the biologists holding furry animals. One was with a dog, another with an alligator."" Jakob responded: ""Oh my God I love it. My girls are huge Elsa fans (... duh), and are struggling a lot with gender prejudices from other kids. So showing them this will definitely give them courage to follow their dreams: astronaut dinosaur breeder and volcano plumber. Yeah, they are still young."" Celeste, whose dream is to visit glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica, said: ""Women have been excluded for a long time both historically and socially. There is a lack of role models and science is bound by historical notions that it's a white, male, heterosexual, able-bodied environment.  ""It can be exclusionary if you have the opposite of any of these characteristics and I want to encourage people with intersecting identities in everything that I do. ""I would like people to think carefully about what they think a scientist should look like."" Her own interest in science was encouraged by her parents. Her father worked at the University of Nebraska State Museum. ""I basically grew up in a natural history museum,"" Celeste said. ""I do science on ice. I'm studying geophysics and my research is focused on trying to figure out how useful seismology can be to help understand glaciers."" However, the trip on which she took the picture that's gone viral was one that had to be unexpectedly cut short. ""Unfortunately it wasn't that cold,"" Celeste said. ""We've been having a warmer summer season and climate change does play a big role in this.  ""On the glacier, you normally get temperatures up to 55-60F [12-15C] but we had several days where we were closer to 70F. ""I had to cut my fieldwork short as it was just too hot."""

The 63-year-old's bowel cancer returned in December 2017, forcing him to take time away from work to receive treatment. He wrote on Twitter that the cancer was ""in a holding pattern"", which meant he could work again.  Fellow newsreader Sophie Raworth confirmed his return on Twitter. Alagiah replied to the tweet, writing: ""There goes my hope of slipping back into the studio unnoticed! Thanks to all for good wishes.""  After the news he added he is ""determined to get behind that studio desk as often as I can"". After Alagiah's initial diagnosis in 2014, the disease spread to his liver and lymph nodes, which needed treatment with several rounds of chemotherapy and three large operations, including one to remove most of his liver.  He returned to work in 2015, but again had to take more time out in 2017 when he was told that his stage four bowel cancer had returned. Upon his return on Wednesday evening, viewers and fellow colleagues appeared delighted, with many complimenting his new beard. Labour MP David Lammy wrote on Twitter: ""So pleased to see George Alagiah back where he belongs. One of the best in the business.""

Spread to UST,How Capt Sir Tom Moore became a nation's hero,2024-09-25,2021-02-02,By Helen Burchell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-52324058,"Captain Sir Tom Moore won the nation's hearts with his extraordinary fundraising efforts for National Health Service charities. The retired Army officer served in India and Myanmar, also known as Burma, during World War Two but it was by walking laps around his garden that he became known to millions. When he was 99, he was catapulted into the global spotlight with his attempt to raise an initial £1,000 for charity. Early in April 2020, with the aid of his walking frame and a steely determination, he vowed to complete 100 laps of his patio before his 100th birthday at the end of that month. The war veteran was inspired to help the health service after receiving treatment for skin cancer of the head, and a broken hip after a fall in 2018. He described the NHS staff who helped him through this as ""marvellous"", and pledged to help those same ""super"" people who were working on the front line during the coronavirus pandemic. His family thought reaching the £1,000 mark would be ""a real stretch"" but, as press coverage of his efforts increased, so did the donations. By the time he completed his 100 laps - on 16 April 2020 - Captain Tom, as he had become affectionately known, had raised more than £12m for NHS Charities Together. In 2007, he had moved from Kent to Bedfordshire to be with his youngest daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, and her family. It was here, in Marston Moretaine, that the idea of raising relatively modest funds for a charity supporting the NHS was hatched. Capt Sir Tom began walking - planning on 10 laps at a time of the 25-metre (82ft) loop in his back garden - and the donations began mounting up. Every million was another milestone, but the veteran, who became a well-known face on national television, took it all in his stride. Ever modest about the challenge he had set himself, Capt Sir Tom was nevertheless astounded by the generosity of donors, describing it as ""completely out of this world"". ""It's all for the sake of the nurses and the NHS we have, because they are doing such a magnificent job,"" he said at the time. ""Every penny that we get, they deserve every one of it."" He was described as a ""one-man fundraising machine"" by the Duke of Cambridge, while both the prime minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Capt Sir Tom was ""an inspiration"" to everyone. Not only did his efforts encourage thousands to donate to the fundraising appeal, but he inspired many to join his campaign to raise both awareness and money for those working in, and supporting, the NHS. From a teenage girl learning to walk again on a treadmill as part of her recovery from a stroke, to a non-verbal boy with autism - who wrote ""He is a hero to us,"" as he embarked on his own challenge to walk for the NHS - people set themselves their own challenges, buoyed by the former soldier. Age, it seemed, was no barrier - as Capt Sir Tom was proving. Dozens dusted off their own walking frames and took to the streets to prove they could play their own part in the drive to raise funds. One woman completed a marathon by walking laps near her Berkshire home, at the age of 104. ""Tom, I've done it,"" she laughed, as she finished her challenge. A week before his 100th birthday, Capt Sir Tom became the oldest person ever to get to number one in the UK singles charts when his duet of You'll Never Walk Alone - with singer Michael Ball - took the top spot. His 100th birthday on 30 April 2020 was marked with an RAF flypast, personal birthday greetings from the Queen and prime minister, and he was made an honorary colonel of the British Army. ""I'm still Captain Tom, that's who I really am but if people choose to call me colonel, well, thank you very much,"" he replied. The following month it was announced he would be awarded a knighthood for his fundraising efforts and would be known as Captain Sir Thomas Moore ""under Ministry of Defence protocol"". On 17 July 2020, he was knighted in the grounds of Windsor Castle, in the Queen's first official engagement in person since the lockdown period began in March. His youngest daughter said at the time of his fundraising efforts that her father had become a ""beacon of hope"" during challenging times. And indeed, Capt Sir Tom always seemed to know just the right thing to say to buoy the nation's spirits as the public tried to abide by government regulations to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. ""To all those people who are finding it difficult at the moment, the sun will shine on you again, and the clouds will go away,"" he said. ""Tomorrow will be a good day"" - another example of his positivity - became a hashtag on social media posts. The proud Yorkshireman completed his 100 laps of his garden live on television in April 2020, with a Guard of Honour from 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment and a rousing round of applause from his family. By the time he closed his fundraising page at midnight on his 100th birthday, Capt Sir Tom had raised £32,794,701 for charities supporting the NHS, from more than one-and-a-half-million global donors.

Spread to UST,Prince William hails veteran's £19m NHS fundraiser,2024-09-25,2020-04-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-52321262,"A 99-year-old war veteran who has raised more than £19m for the NHS has been hailed as a ""one-man fundraising machine"" by the Duke of Cambridge. Captain Tom Moore originally aimed to raise just £1,000 for NHS Charities Together by completing 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday. More than 950,000 people have now made donations to his JustGiving page.  More than half a million people have called for Capt Tom to be knighted in a petition to the Honours Committee.  The petition, which was set up earlier this week, has received more than 553,000 signatures after his efforts grabbed the nation's attention.  As he finished the challenge on Thursday, Capt Tom said it was ""an absolutely fantastic sum of money"".  In a tweet, he said he would be doing ""less walking"" on Friday but would be talking to TV channels in the United States, Argentina, Europe and the Middle East. Speaking to BBC Radio 2 he said the sum of money was ""absolutely enormous"" and ""very difficult to imagine"". He also thanked everyone who had donated for their support. ""I say thank you very much indeed. I appreciate it because the object for which we're donating is so important and so necessary... I think you're all so kind and thoughtful contributing to this cause,"" he said. The total includes an undisclosed donation from the Duke of Cambridge, who with the Duchess of Cambridge recorded a special video message for the veteran. Prince William said: ""It's amazing and what I love also is that he's a 99-year-old war vet.  ""He's been around a long time, he knows everything and it's wonderful that everyone has been inspired by his story and his determination. ""He's a one-man fundraising machine and God knows what the final total will be. But good on him, and I hope it keeps going."" In response, Capt Tom said: ""It's absolutely amazing that my super prince can say something like that."" He also said it was ""a moment we will never forget"". Capt Tom, who is originally from Keighley in West Yorkshire, has seemingly risen from nowhere to the status of near national treasure. Keighley Town Council has tweeted that it will ""honour the fundraising hero"" with the freedom of the town. Tributes and messages of congratulations have continued to pour in, including from sporting stars. England football team captain, Harry Kane, said: ""You've been a huge help for the NHS who really need it at this vital time so you're a true inspiration."" F1 champion Lewis Hamilton said he was ""blown away by his amazing achievement"" and ""we could all learn something"" from him. Capt Tom began raising funds to thank NHS staff who helped him with treatment for cancer and a broken hip. With the aid of a walking frame, he completed 100 laps of the 25-metre (82ft) loop in his garden in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, in 10-lap chunks well before his birthday on 30 April. NHS Charities Together said it was ""truly inspired and humbled"" by his efforts. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Spread to UST,Newcastle United 1-4 Manchester United,2024-09-25,2020-10-16,Saj Chowdhury,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/54489181,"Marcus Rashford was one of Manchester United's best players and scored their fourth deep into stoppage time Manchester United scored three late goals at Newcastle to earn victory and help ease the misery inflicted by the heavy defeat against Tottenham. It was an incredible final few minutes for a team who looked as if they had blown their chance of three points following Bruno Fernandes' failure from the penalty spot in the 58th minute. United needed a positive reaction following that 6-1 thumping by Spurs before the international break, but their hopes suffered a blow when Emil Krafth's cross came off defender Luke Shaw and beat keeper David de Gea. Harry Maguire, who like his side has endured an unsettled period, equalised to haul the visitors back into the game.  And it looked as if the match was set to turn in their favour in the second half when referee Craig Pawson, after consulting the pitch-side monitor, judged Jamal Lewis to have fouled Marcus Rashford and awarded a penalty. However, Fernandes, who previously had a 100% record from the spot for United, saw his fierce strike brilliantly pushed away by Karl Darlow. The Portugal midfielder was not to be denied though and with four minutes remaining he finally beat the Magpies keeper with a thumping finish, before Aaron Wan-Bissaka, with his first for the club, and Rashford ensured United's second win of the season.

There were sub-plots coming into this match, centring around how United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would have his team set up after the defeat by Spurs, and how Maguire would perform. The Norwegian stuck by his skipper, whose form has been inconsistent this season and who had been sent off playing for England during the recent international break. The centre-back produced arguably his most confident display of the season and it was somewhat poetic that his precision header brought his side back into the match. The other person in the United camp who experienced both bitter and sweet was Fernandes. He had previously scored 10 out of 10 from the spot for the Red Devils but his run was brought to an emphatic stop by the flying Darlow. But the visitors did not allow their heads to drop, unlike at Old Trafford two weeks ago, and breached the final line of defence once again when Fernandes smacked his angled strike high past the past the Magpies keeper after a glorious move down the left. Wan-Bissaka, on his 50th appearance for the club, produced an equally thunderous finish from the right before Rashford slotted in a well deserved goal for himself.  The England striker, 22, without his familiar strike partners Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood, once again produced a very mature display. David de Gea made a remarkable save from Callum Wilson in the second half The scoreline reads 4-1, but against one of the 'big six', Magpies boss Steve Bruce's side fought fire with fire, particularly in the first half. French winger Allan Saint-Maximin, who dazzled against Burnley in the 3-1 win, starred again - albeit in spurts - and was integral to the move that led to the opener. He then provided the cross for striker Callum Wilson which should have resulted in Newcastle's second, but instead resulted in one of the saves of the season from De Gea. Darlow, 30, made several good stops and continued until the end of the match despite appearing to be suffering from an injury in the final quarter of the game. But even at full fitness the keeper could not have done much about the late goals though, as his team-mates in front of him tired, allowing their opponents to exploits the gaps in defence. This video can not be played 'We showed great resilience' - Solskjaer Newcastle manager Steve Bruce speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: ""They were a handful all night. Some of their forward players and their movement, we found it difficult. They scored from a free-kick we had and broke away [for the second goal] and then towards the end we were a bit naive. ""Darlow has been fantastic. He was brave when we needed him to be. You know your goalkeeper will have to play well against the big teams, I hope he will be OK next week. ""I thought we were a little bit too easy at times to play against. We will go away really, really disappointed because we were 10 minutes away and it could have gone either way when it gets that late. ""It is a work in progress for us. We have tried to change and with that it will take time. The defeat looks worse than it really was."" Newcastle conceded four goals at home in the Premier League for the first time since 5 April 2014, also against Manchester United (4-0). Manchester United enjoyed their 10th comeback win against Newcastle in the Premier League, the most by any side against a single opponent in the competition. Newcastle are without a clean sheet in seven Premier League home games, their longest such run without a shut-out on home soil since February 2014 (eight). Manchester United have been awarded 17 penalties in the Premier League since the start of last season, five more than any other side in the competition (12 scored). Manchester United have scored five own goals against Newcastle in the Premier League (Henning Berg, Wes Brown, Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Luke Shaw), only two sides have scored more against a single opponent (Sunderland v Man Utd and Liverpool v Tottenham). Mata has been directly involved in nine goals against Newcastle United in the Premier League (four goals, five assists); against no other side has he had a hand in more (also nine v Norwich). Fernandes has been directly involved in 20 goals in his 18 Premier League appearances for Manchester United (11 goals, 9 assists), scoring in each of his last three games. Wan-Bissaka became the 116th different player to score for Manchester United in the Premier League in what is his 38th league appearance for the club. Rashford registered three goal involvements in a single Premier League game for the third time (one goal, two assists), also doing so against Fulham in December 2018 and Arsenal in February 2016. Manchester United are at Paris St-Germain in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00 BST) and then host Chelsea at home next Saturday (17:30 BST). Newcastle are Wolves next Sunday (16:30 GMT).

It is a third delay to the biennial event which should have taken place in 2020 before being postponed by a year due to Covid-19. The plan was to hold the championships in the Algerian city of Oran between the 1st and 5th June 2021 before it was then  moved to Algiers and set to take place 22-26 June. The Confederation of African Athletics are yet to make a public statement about this latest setback for the continental showpiece. With the Olympics set to begin in Tokyo in July the news will come as a blow to athletes across the continent who were hoping to use the championships in a final bid to achieve the qualifying standard for The Games. The sport's global governing body, World Athletics, has set 29 June 2021 as the deadline for reaching the qualifying mark to take part at the 2020 Olympics. The Algerian Ministry of Youth and Sports (MJS) said in a statement the delay came ""due to the health situation, marked by a resurgence in the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and the risk of circulation of new variant(s)."" The ministry added it was ""following the recommendations of the scientific monitoring committee of the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic."" ""The MJS called on the Algerian Athletics Federation (FAA) to make the necessary arrangements to inform the officials of the Confederation of African Athletics in order to agree new dates for the holding of these championships as soon as the health situation improves.""

Spread to UST,The myths of 21st Century friendship,2024-09-25,2022-03-04,Rebecca Roache,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220302-the-myths-and-reality-of-modern-friendship,"Over the past couple of years, digital connection has mattered more than ever, writes the philosopher Rebecca Roache. So, how is the nature of friendship changing? During the Covid-19 lockdowns, I watched how my children responded to the fact that they couldn't see their friends in person. No face-to-face conversations. No playdates. No visiting friends. If the lockdown had happened a couple of decades earlier, any contact with people we didn't live with would have taken place via phone calls, email or letter-writing. But in the 2020s, things are different. My daughter and her friends played a game on their phones while discussing their strategy in a WhatsApp group. My son, who is yet to reach the developmental milestone of smartphone ownership, chatted with his classmates via Google Classroom. Both kids grew noticeably shy during lockdown, but their nervousness about speaking to friends they hadn't seen for a while was cured by using video-calling platforms with built-in games: after a few minutes of wordless, giggling competition in which they became unicorns and caught donuts on their virtual nose-horns, they had loosened up to discuss serious matters like Pokémon and Mario Kart.  None of this technology existed a generation ago. When I was their age, non-face-to-face, real-time interactions with friends would take place over the phone in the downstairs hallway at home, where everyone could hear what I was saying and where I could talk for no longer than 10 minutes before an agitated parent started muttering about phone bills and ""blocking the line"". There were no donut-catching unicorns, although I was free to challenge my wits by attempting to untangle the spiral cable that linked the phone to the handset. Phone calls with friends were an occasional treat, not an everyday occurrence. Lockdown in my childhood would have been a very different social experience. How different, though? Are the differences in the ways we interact with our friends today versus a generation ago merely superficial, comparable to the difference between writing a letter to a friend on lined versus unlined paper? Or is there something about contemporary friendships that is fundamentally different to the friendships of yesteryear – and if so, how might friendship continue to change in the future? You may also like: It's common these days to complain that friendships aren't what they used to be. That restaurants are filled with people staring at their phones instead of talking. That selfie culture has turned us into narcissists who care more about managing our own PR than about being present with each other. That today's friendships are somehow more conditional than they were in the past, as we organise ourselves online into ""echo chambers"" of like-minded individuals and reject differing views. Even the word ""friend"" has been transformed by social media: there's a new sense in which being friends with someone just means having clicked ""accept"" on their friend request, without ever saying hello. There's a pervasive anxiety that true friendship is in decline, and that technology is to blame. Headlines like ""The Era of Antisocial Social Media"" and ""Your Smartphone is Making You Stupid, Antisocial and Unhealthy"" are familiar fare.   Pessimists might wonder where this is all going to end. Perhaps we'll find ourselves in a cynical world where we interact only with people who serve us, where we don't recognise our friends without their Snapchat filters, and where we don't form genuine connections with anyone. But are these concerns really justified? Anxiety about the dystopian effects of new technology on friendship is as old as the written word. Older, in fact: for Socrates, the written word was itself part of the problem. Well over 2,000 years ago, Socrates supposedly expressed scepticism about letter-writing as a route to wisdom, favouring face-to-face interaction with peers. And at the beginning of 20th Century, concerns were raised that landline telephones would dilute interaction, or foster unhealthy social behaviours. From our contemporary perspective, in which letters or telephones are about as benign as it's possible for technology to get, such concerns strike us as quaint. Of course they don't undermine friendship. On the contrary, they promote it: letters and phone between distant friends are exactly the sorts of wholesome institutions that hand-wringers about social media are afraid will die out.  So, does social media threaten friendship, or promote it? In a 2012 paper, Shannon Vallor considers whether the sorts of friendships people have on Facebook can be real friendships, and she concludes that yes, they can. Her argument does not rest upon new-fangled ideas about friendship. Rather, she uses Aristotle's conception, which is over 2,000 years old. For Aristotle, friendship requires having certain virtues, including those of reciprocity, empathy, self-knowledge (in the sense of understanding our place in the world, including our place in our relations with others), and participating in a shared life. Could scepticism about social media's impact on friendship be biased? It is, after all, often expressed by people whose early friendships were not formed around social media, which may make them more likely to ignore the positives. People like us Even if interacting through a screen is not destroying friendships, many people fear that the way in which we use digital technology to choose and nurture our friends encourages low-quality social connections. One such fear relates to echo chambers: those groups of like-minded individuals into which we sort ourselves, with the result that cross-fertilisation of ideas is reduced and people become more polarised and entrenched in their views. Some scholars claim that online echo chambers have serious implications for liberal democracy. But from a friendship point of view, they are nothing new. Long before the internet, people's social interactions were largely confined to like-minded others. Communities would spring up around places of religious worship, the marketplace, sports teams, workplaces and educational establishments, and along class, gender, and ethnic lines. It's simply not true, then, that in the days before digitally-mediated friendship, people drew their friends from all walks of life. Perhaps we are all missing out as a result. But even if we are, the fact that the internet enables us to connect with similar people has some great benefits for friendship. It enables us to tap into support and solidarity that might not otherwise be available, either because people with the right sort of shared experiences would be difficult to find offline, or because the shared experiences in question are so intimate that we're reluctant to discuss them – a reluctance that is eased by interacting online. I rely heavily on this sort of community myself: for several years I've belonged to a private Facebook group of single mothers working in academia. The friendships I've made – which are spread across the world – along with the support I've given and received, have been hugely positive additions to my life. It seems plausible that the view that echo chambers are bad for friendship is based partly in a view that friendship is – or ought to be – deeper than shared interests and experiences. We have long been moved by stories of friendships and romances between people from diverse, often conflicting, groups. Perhaps the most iconic romantic couple, Romeo and Juliet, belonged to feuding families. The friendship between Nelson Mandela, while imprisoned for conspiring to overthrow South Africa's apartheid government, and a young, initially pro-apartheid, white prison guard captured the public's attention and was the focus of a film, Goodbye Bafana. In 2014, Arab-American journalist Sulome Anderson tweeted a photo of herself kissing her Jewish boyfriend, Jeremy, while holding a sign reading ""Jews and Arabs REFUSE to be ENEMIES"". The photo went viral. These examples illustrate that we are captivated by the idea of looking beyond our friends' (perhaps unpalatable) views and interests, and loving the person behind them. It's certainly true that the best friendships don't stand or fall with shared interests. If you initially connected with your oldest friend over your shared love of 90s American boy bands but parted ways when one of you lost interest in Boyz II Men, it would be hard not to conclude that your friendship didn't run very deep. But this doesn't entail that there is anything wrong with seeking out connections based on shared interests. A deep, loving, supportive friendship of many years is not made any less deep, loving, and supportive because the friends in question initially connected through their boy band obsession. Friendships, friendships, everywhere … What about the idea that we now live in a world in which friendship is debased? In which social media encourage us to value quantity over quality, and to project images of glossy perfection at the expense of forming deep, intimate connections? The concern that quantity of friendships comes at the expense of quality is – like the other concerns we've discussed so far – not at all new. In an essay entitled ""On Having Many Friends"", the 1st-century Greek philosopher Plutarch wrote: ""What then is the coin of friendship? It is goodwill and graciousness combined with virtue, than which nature has nothing more rare. It follows, then, that a strong mutual friendship with many persons is impossible, but, just as rivers whose waters are divided among branches and channels flow weak and thin, so affection, naturally strong in a soul, if portioned out among many persons become utterly enfeebled.""  A couple of millennia later, Abba sang, ""Facing 20,000 of your friends / How can anyone be so lonely?"" in their 1980 single, ""Super Trouper"". And in 2009, Eoghan Quigg – a former contestant on the British talent show The X Factor – released a single, ""28,000 Friends"", with the lines, ""You and your 28,000 friends / YouTube, Facebook, Myspace, IM"" and ""How does it feel to be alone? / So many friends that you don't know"". According to our digital timescales, Quigg's reference to Myspace is its own brand of ancient – but we might wonder whether the technology that has emerged over the past couple of decades encourages us to spread our friendships more thinly than ever. Does Quigg have more reason to gripe about this than Plutarch did? The answer is that, while empirical evidence supports the claim that we are incapable of having a great many close friendships, it’s far from clear that social media's capacity to multiply our social connections is reducing the quality of our friendships.  The anthropologist Robin Dunbar studied social groups over the centuries and found that the number of stable social connections that individuals can maintain has remained fairly constant, at roughly 150. This figure – which has come to be known as Dunbar’s Number – denotes, more or less, ""the number of people you would not feel embarrassed about joining uninvited for a drink if you happened to bump into them in a bar"". There are subdivisions within this. We each tend to have three to five people who constitute ""the small nucleus of really good friends to whom you go in times of trouble"", and a ""sympathy group"" of 12-15 people ""whose death tomorrow would leave you distraught"" – but, Dunbar argues, we simply lack the cognitive capacity to inflate these groups. ""[I]f a new person comes into your life,"" Dunbar explains, ""someone has to drop down into the next level to make room for them"". Since the number of friends we can have is limited by our cognitive capacity, not even the ease of making online connections can enable us to expand it. Commenting on social media, Dunbar remarks that ""there is an issue about what really counts as a friend"". Those who have very large numbers – that's to say, larger than about 200 – invariably know little or nothing about the individuals on their list,"" he adds. The fact that Dunbar's Number is – as Dunbar sees it – limited by our cognitive capacities points to a possible way in which friendship might look different in the future. Cognitive capacities – including attention, memory, perception, and decision-making – relate to the mental processing of information. We use various strategies and tools to help us improve these capacities. We drink coffee to help us focus, wear glasses to improve our vision, write lists to help us remember things, and so on. The improvements we make as a result are relatively modest, and often short-lived. However, many believe that, in the near future, we will be able to make far more drastic improvements to our cognitive capacities using technologies like drugs, transcranial electrical stimulation, brain implants, and genetic engineering. The results could see human cognitive capacities far exceed anything we've seen before. In that case, perhaps we might be able to maintain close friendships with significantly more people. But given that even cognitively enhanced versions of ourselves would be constrained by the number of hours we have for socialising, increasing our number of close friends would need to involve wringing more intimacy from the time we spend with each friend. Or, it could be that a cognitively enhanced world would come with other changes, such as a reduction in working hours, which could free up more time for friends.  On the other hand, even with the cognitive capacity to have more close friendships, perhaps many would value having fewer friends. Romantic relationships provide an analogy: having the capacity to maintain multiple partners apparently does not result in most people wanting to live non-monogamously. So, a cognitively enhanced future of friendship might end up looking different to the way friendship looks now – but equally, it might not. It might seem that, by encouraging us to use the term ""friend"" to refer to hundreds or even thousands of people with whom we have only very superficial connections, social media is (to use Plutarch’'s metaphor) devaluing the coin of friendship. Facebook friends are, after all, often friends in name only – especially for those users whose friends run into the hundreds or thousands. But using ""friend"" to refer to people one does not know particularly well is nothing new. In her study of social connections in 18th-Century England, Naomi Tadmor explains that a few centuries ago, a person would count as friends not only those with whom they had relatively intimate emotional relationships, but also family, household staff, employers, and so on. She points to the term ""Society of Friends""  – still used to today as a term for Quakers – as an example of this wider use of the term. Despite changes over the years in whether certain people with whom we have relatively loose social connections count as friends, there has remained a stable core. The handful of people who constitute Dunbar’s ""small nucleus"" and the dozen or so who make up the ""sympathy group"" have always counted as friends. But changes in our views about what we owe our friends hint at what might become of these smaller, intimate groups. Consider our views about loyalty. It's good to be loyal to our friends – but in professional contexts, we use terms like ""cronyism"" and ""nepotism"" to condemn loyalty to friends. Tadmor explains that things were different in the past. In the 18th Century, serving one's friends was viewed as a virtue, even in politics. Just as giving one's friends a shoo-in for a job in politics was virtuous three centuries ago but objectionable today, perhaps some practices that today count as virtuous will one day be viewed as objectionable. Today, nobody raises an eyebrow at a lawyer who gives out free advice to friends (but not strangers) or a hairdresser who styles his friends' hair (but not strangers' hair) for free. Providing strangers, free of charge, with the sort of help that they would otherwise have to pay for is kind, but not expected or required. Things might change in the future. Perhaps giving friends the benefit of one's skills while denying it to strangers will be viewed as cronyism in the centuries to come. What would a future world with different ideas about what we owe to our friends look like? Well, probably not that different to today's world. It's also not like contemporary friendship is the same thing all over the globe. Friendships in individualist cultures – typical of English-speaking countries and much of Western Europe – differs in several important ways from friendships in Arab, East Asian, African, and Latin American countries where there is a more collectivist culture. For example, reciprocity between friends is typically valued more in individualist than in collectivist cultures. Individualists don't like to be indebted to friends by not returning favours; collectivists don't view such interactions in terms of favours and instead view those who resist accepting help from friends as aloof and egotistical. Behaviour between friends that, in individualist cultures, is seen as inappropriately interfering – like correcting a friend's class notes – is deemed considerate and caring in collectivist cultures. Those in collectivist cultures tend to be confident that their close friendships will endure without nurturing by saying positive things; as a result, they speak to their friends with a frankness that would be viewed as cold in individualist cultures. As the psychologist Roger Baumgarte – from whose survey of cross-cultural friendship research I've drawn these observations – remarks, these cultural differences reveal that even what it means to be a close friend varies by culture. The future of friendship What should be our lesson from all this? The mediums and technologies that enable friendship may change, but much stays the same. The phonecalls and handwritten letters of a few decades ago might seem more wholesome than today's WhatsApp texts, but their function is similar. This can be jarring: when I see my children poring over their iPads, I have to remind myself that although they may look withdrawn and solitary, most of their screen time in fact centres around interacting with friends. Tempting as it is to lock away their electronics forever and send them outside with a skipping rope, doing that would likely result in their being excluded from an important community – and while spending every waking hour hunched over a smartphone is not a recipe for a fulfilling life, neither is spending every waking moment writing letters. The kids are all right. * Rebecca Roache is a philosopher at Royal Holloway, University of London and host of The Academic Imperfectionist podcast.

Spread to UST,A Tudors tour of London,2024-09-25,2011-01-14,Matt Bolton,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20110111-a-tudors-tour-of-london,"Follow young Henry VIII’s favourite, and notorious, spots around the city. For centuries, King Henry VIII was mainly remembered as an obese Pope-hater with a penchant for executing anything that moved, especially if it was married to him. But the revival of interest in Tudor-era London, inspired by the success of the recent drama series The Tudors, has also transformed Henry’s portly image in unexpected ways. He is now a sex symbol. Jonathan Rhys Meyers's young Henry is a suave lothario, prowling the streets of Tudor London in pursuit of his next mistress. And the city itself, portrayed in the series as a seething cesspit of murder, intrigue and passion, more than lives up to its ruler's charisma. While much has inevitably changed since Henry's reign, the outline of Tudor London is still visible within the sprawl of the modern city. The obvious place to start is at the Tower of London (www.hrp.org.uk/toweroflondon), sitting ominously on the edge of today's financial district. Previously used as a royal residence, Henry transformed it into a death-row prison. His second wife, Anne Boleyn, was executed here in 1536. Visitors can see the royal Crown Jewels and graffiti purported to have been scratched into the wall by the nine-day Queen, Lady Jane Grey, beheaded in 1554. Henry's bloodlust was matched only by his love for opulent palaces.  The Thames was lined with the turrets of royal residences, from the Palace of Whitehall - whose only remaining section, the Banqueting House, is at the corner of Horse Guards Avenue (hrp.org.uk/banquetinghouse) -  to Hampton Court in Richmond (www.hrp.org.uk/hamptoncourtpalace). Here, no less than five Henry VIII impersonators are on hand to show visitors around the King's Apartments, Tudor kitchens and the notoriously tricky maze. The young Henry's favourite Palace, however, was at Greenwich, where he held lavish parties and jaunting contests. The Palace was demolished in the 17th Century, but its remains continue to be found - a section of the tiled floor of the Tudor chapel was discovered in 2006. Artefacts from the Palace are on display at the ""Discover Greenwich"" visitor centre (www.oldroyalnavalcollege.org/discover-greenwich), which also offers the chance to try on a suit of Tudor armour. To the west of the city lies Syon House (www.syonpark.co.uk), originally the site of a medieval abbey. Henry's fifth wife, Catherine Howard, was exiled here in 1541 before being executed the following year. After Henry's own death in 1547, his body spent the night at Syon, en route to burial at Windsor. Legend has it that the King's corpse exploded during the night, with dogs found licking up his remains - a little divine judgement, perhaps. Syon House is open to visitors for most of the year, and archaeological digs continue to uncover Tudor remains. Across town, a trip to Homerton High Street in Hackney is rewarded by the finest example of a Tudor manor house in the city. Sutton House (www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-suttonhouse) was built by a royal courtier at a time when Hackney had more fields than fried chicken shops. The interior remains much as it was in Henry's day, with oak-panelled rooms, Tudor windows and carved fireplaces. Perhaps the only person from the Tudor era more famous than Henry is the Bard himself, William Shakespeare. Theatre was banished from within the walls of the Tudor city for fear audiences would spread the plague, and so Shakespeare's career began just outside, in what is now the East End. In between the bars on Shoreditch's Curtain Road lies a small plaque announcing that this was once the home of ""The Theatre"", the first dedicated theatre in London (knowledgeoflondon.com/theatre.html). It was here that Romeo and Juliet got its first outing. In 1598, after a dispute with the landlord, the owners of The Theatre dismantled it overnight and moved it across the river. Renamed the Globe, it went on to become the most famous theatre in the world. Shakespeare was born and did the majority of his work during the reign of Elizabeth 1st, the last Tudor monarch, and so was at the forefront of Elizabethan culture. However, historians do not believe the pair ever met - whatever Shakespeare in Love might say!   The Tudors is currently airing on BBC America.   "
Spread to UST,Exploring the history of catacombs,2024-09-25,2012-10-26,Suemedha Sood,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20121025-exploring-the-history-of-catacombs,"Beneath the city streets that travellers walk on each day, dark labyrinths of underground tunnels transport travellers to a time when millions of people were buried underground. Beneath the
city streets that travellers walk on each day, dark labyrinths of underground catacombs
are passageways to the past, to a time when the ghostly tunnels served as
burial grounds for millions of people.  The
catacombs of Rome, which date back to the 1st Century and were among the first ever built,
were constructed as underground tombs, first by Jewish communities and then by Christian
communities. There are only six known Jewish catacombs and around 40 or more
Christian catacombs.  In Ancient
Rome, it was not permitted for bodies to be buried within the city walls. So while
pagans cremated their dead, Christians, who were not legally allowed to practice
their religion, turned to underground cemeteries, built beneath land owned by
the city’s few rich Christian families. The Jewish population was already
implementing this practice when Christians began doing so around the 2nd
Century.  The use of
catacombs in Rome expanded during the 2nd and 3rd Centuries, as the illegal religion of
Christianity grew in popularity. Some areas of the tunnels even became shrines for
martyrs buried there. But after Christianity was legalized in 313 AD, funerals
moved above ground, and by the 5th Century, the use of catacombs as
grave sites dwindled, though they were still revered as sacred sites where pilgrims
would come to worship.  The Rome catacombs
then fell victim to pillaging by Germanic invaders around the early 9th Century.
As a result, relics of Christian martyrs and saints were moved from the catacombs to churches in
the city centre. Eventually, the underground burial tunnels were abandoned
altogether – only to be rediscovered via excavations in the 1600s. Today,
travellers from all over the world visit Rome to explore its 600km network of catacombs,
spread out over five storeys underground near the Park of the Tombs of Via
Latina. Dedicated to Christian saints, they are adorned with some of the
earliest Christian artwork in the world, dating back to the 2nd
Century, featuring paintings on the tunnel walls that depict ancient life.
Sacred catacombs open to the public include the Catacombs of Priscilla (Via
Salaria, 430), the Catacombs of St Callixtus (Via Appia Antica, 110-126)
and the Catacombs of St Agnes (Via Nomentana, 349). The Vatican provides details on how to visit
these and other holy burial sites. A few Jewish catacombs, including the catacombs
on the Vigna Randanini and those in the Villa Torlonia, are also open to the
public -- though
some by appointment.   Centuries
later in Paris, catacombs emerged as a creative and discreet solution to a dire public health problem. In
the late 1700s, mass graves in the Les Halles district, such as those in the
now closed Saints Innocents Cemetery, were overcrowded with improperly disposed
of bodies ,
creating unsanitary conditions that led to the spread of disease. Saint
Innocents was shut down, and in 1786 the Paris police moved all the remains
buried in the cemetery to an underground network of ancient limestone quarries
– the now infamous Catacombs of Paris, located south of the former city gate near Place
Denfert-Rochereau.  The eerie
tunnels -- a significant portion of which is open to the public as a museum -- took on other uses over the
course of history. During World War II, for instance, some sections became
hideouts for French Resistance fighters, while other areas were converted by
German soldiers into bunkers. Today, Paris’s nearly 300km of catacombs lie 30m under
the ground’s surface and still house the remains of around six million people.  The world’s
longest network of underground tunnels, extending more than 2,400km, can be
found in Odessa, Ukraine, where the catacombs were formed around the 1830s as a
result of limestone mining. As in Paris, the tunnels were used as bunkers and
hideouts by soldiers during World War II, and a portion of the catacombs is open
to the public via the Museum of Partisan Glory.  The
catacombs of Malta are designated as a World Heritage Site for their role in
Paleochristian history. Carved from the rock underneath the city of Rabat,
likely beginning around the 3rd Century, the tunnels show how rural
family burials took place among Christian, Jewish and Pagan communities. The
complex network of passageways provided graves for 1,000 people and extended
over about 5,700sqkm. Heritage Malta provides information on visiting St Paul’s Catacombs located near St Paul’s Church
and Grotto.   In
Alexandria, Egypt, the Catacombs of Kom el-Shoqafa were originally built for just one rich family around the
2nd Century, but eventually housed more 300 mummies. Open to the
public, the three-story tomb about 30m under the ground, features
elaborate carvings illustrating scenes from Egyptian mythology, including one
relief depicting the jackal-headed god, Anubis.  Travelwise is a BBC Travel column that goes behind the travel stories to

Spread to UST,The world’s most expensive ham,2024-09-25,2018-11-15,Max Duncan,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20181114-the-worlds-most-expensive-ham,"A tiny organic farm in south-western Spain produces unconventional ham that sells for €4,100 (£3,600) a leg, and is recognised by Guinness World Records as the world’s most expensive. Jamón – the Spanish word for ham – has been consumed on the pork-loving Iberian Peninsula for at least 2,000 years. The Roman poet Martial wrote about dining on it in the 1st Century AD in what is now Spain. Since then, in many rural areas of the country, the slaughter of a pig has long been cause for celebration, and the hind legs would often be salted and dried for later consumption as jamón. To this day, jamón is an essential part of the nation’s food culture. From quiet villages to bustling cities, it is spread out on plates to kick off long family meals, picked at by friends in bars and stuffed into late-morning sandwiches. The Spanish consume some 160,000 tonnes of it a year, and as the rest of the world catches on, exports of it are rising.     Of all the ham produced in Spain, jamón ibérico (made from the black Iberian breed of pigs) is often the most prized, on account of its distinctive flavour. It is officially recognised in various ‘denomenacións de origen’, geographical indicators similar to the appellation d'origine contrôlée used in France for wine and other products. One such region with its own denominación de origen is Jabugo, the area around a small town of the same name in Andalucía, which is famously devoted to producing the ham. Jamón ibérico de bellota (jamón from pigs fed on bellota, or acorns) tends to be the most gourmet version and is produced across the various regions, including Jabugo. Rather than being produced from animals raised purely on feed, to be recognised as ‘de bellota’, the pigs must graze only on fresh pasture and acorns that fall from oak trees for at least 61 days of the year (though the acorn period usually extends longer than two months). To help consumers navigate this complex set of factors, Spain introduced a colour-coding system in 2014 that categorises jamón according to quality, with a black label being the highest. Many of these acorn-producing oak trees grow on a savannah-like grassland called a dehesa. Found only in central and southern Spain and in various areas of neighbouring Portugal, the dehesa is a unique agrosilvopastoral (agriculture-forestry-grazing) system created and maintained by the interaction between low-density animal grazing, traditional arable farming and forests of mostly holm and cork oaks. The dehesa has evolved from naturally occurring woodlands that have been altered by the grazing of livestock like pigs, goats and bulls. This grazing prevents shrubs from growing, but preserves the prairie and large oak trees, some of which are used for farming cork. The ecosystem is high in biodiversity, including deer and birds of prey. Iberian pigs can roam freely on the grasslands and feed on the acorns that carpet the ground in autumn and winter. Eduardo Donato used to be a property developer from Catalonia, on the opposite side of the country, but came to the area near Jabugo in 1989 in search of a quiet life in connection with nature. He acquired a plot of land with little plan but to enjoy the peace and quiet and raise horses. But after observing his farming neighbours raise pigs, in 1995 he bought 10 pigs that were a rare spotted variety of the Iberian breed from the local government, which had kept them to help preserve the variety. Taking advice from the other farmers, he started to breed them and eventually produced his first jamón almost a decade later. Unlike his neighbours, he decided to raise them organically, without antibiotics or hormones to boost growth and using feed produced without chemicals. This was almost unheard of at the time, but he persisted and still continues to farm this way at his company, Dehesa Maladúa. Donato says the organic process, the rare breed and unique environment justify the jaw-dropping price of €4,100 (£3,600) a leg, which makes his jamón the world’s most expensive according to Guinness World Records. Donato’s farm is located in the Sierra de Aracena and Picos de Aroche Natural Park, part of a Unesco-protected biosphere reserve. This well-preserved and maintained dehesa ecosystem contains giant cork oak trees that are hundreds of years old. It would be impossible for farmers like Donato to recreate the conditions of the dehesa elsewhere because it takes so long to grow trees big enough to produce the quantity of acorns needed to feed the pigs. He and his pigs therefore have no choice but to live in harmony with this fragile environment on which they rely, but to which they also contribute The fallen acorns that carpet the dehesa give the meat its complex flavour and aroma for which jamón ibérico de bellota is famous. Acorns are high in oleic acid, a fatty acid also found in olives, that is believed to be good for health, according to the US’ National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The different species of oak tree found in the forest produce acorns at different times, so the pigs have a constant supply from mid-autumn until early spring. For the rest of the year, the pigs feed on grass, olives, nuts, berries and roots that they come across in the dehesa, as well as organic cereals and legumes, which Donato feeds them. Pigs of the Iberian breed are typically black. But the 200 or so pigs at Dehesa Maladúa are a reddish brown with dark spots. This extremely rare variety of the Iberian breed is called ‘Manchado de Jabugo’ – ‘spotted Jabugo’ in English – which was pushed to near extinction due to a preference for black varieties, which were more easily accepted by consumers and easier to breed and raise. According to Donato, pigs from the Manchado de Jabugo variety, when raised organically, need three years to reach the ideal slaughter weight of around 170kg – more than twice as long as most Iberian pigs raised using regular, non-organic methods. Pigs that have reached their ideal weight are slaughtered at the end of winter after spending three to four months eating nothing but acorns, grass and other plants. Much of the meat is used for regular cuts and sausages, while the hind legs are cured to make jamón. While good jamón is traditionally cured for at least three years, Donato spends up to seven drying his in a local, family-run cellar. The legs are first buried in salt for around a week before being washed and hung in a temperature-controlled room where they stay for three months. From there, they are hung for up to a year and a half in an airy room at the top of the storehouse, where the windows are left open to allow the mountain breezes in. After that, the legs are moved to the basement, where they spend another four to five years curing. Eventually they are cleaned up, boxed and ready to be sold. For years, connoisseurs of fine jamón ibérico would only eat meat from the legs of black Iberian pigs. In 2016, however, Donato’s reddish-brown jamón won a ‘best new product’ award at Biofach, the world’s leading organic food trade fair held each year in Germany. For him, the award was something of a vindication. Jamón carving is an art in its own right, and professional carvers are often employed by high-end restaurants and at special events. The meat should be sliced incredibly thin and, if possible, be served immediately, at room temperature, to ensure that the flavour is fresh and the fat is soft enough to melt in the mouth. Cuts from different parts of a good leg have distinct flavours and textures that can be appreciated in a tasting session, much like those for wine. Fattier cuts from near the hip have a rich, buttery taste, while drier cuts found closer to the hoof have a sweet, nutty flavour. And just like wine, a good jamón reflects the quality of the environment from where it came. We make money to live; we don’t live to make money,” Donato said. And that’s why Donato has no plans to expand.

Spread to UST,Uncovering caves full of treasure,2024-09-25,2015-02-23,Jonathan Glancey,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150223-uncovering-caves-full-of-treasure,"The Ajanta Caves were a sanctuary for Buddhist monks that was forgotten, along with its stunning riches, for nearly 1,500 years. Jonathan Glancey investigates. The Ajanta Caves, 30 spellbinding Buddhist prayer halls and monasteries carved, as if by sorcery, into a horseshoe-shaped rock face in a mountainous region of India’s Maharashtra state, 450km (280 miles) east of Mumbai, were ‘discovered’ by accident in 1819. Unknown for more than 1,000 years except to wild animals, insects, flood waters, prodigious foliage and perhaps the local Bhil people, this magnificent work of art, architecture and contemplation, was abandoned by those who created it as long ago as AD 500. In 1983 it was designated a Unesco World Heritage Site. John Smith, a young British cavalry officer, was on a tiger hunt when he spotted the mouth of a cave high above the Waghora (Tiger) River that could only have been man made. Scrambling up with his party, Smith entered the cave and, branding a flaming grass torch, encountered a great vaulted and colonnaded hall, its walls covered in faded paintings. Beneath a dome, a timeless praying Buddha fronted a mound-like shrine, or stupa. Smith carved his name on a statue of a Bodhisattva, a figure representing one of the past lives of the Buddha before he achieved Nirvana, or union with the divine spirit. Since then, thousands of people have added their names as the Ajanta caves – a gallery of the oldest and some of the finest of all Buddhist art – has gained fame and become a compelling tourist attraction. News of Smith’s find spread quickly. In 1844, Major Robert Gill was commissioned by the Royal Asiatic Society to create reproductions on canvas of the wall paintings. This was the beginning of measures to reveal and document the prayer halls (chaityagrihas) and monasteries (viharas) that had, it seems, been hewn from solid rock in two phases, the first – five prayer halls – between the 1st  and 2nd  centuries BC and, the second – 25 monasteries, or monks’ lodgings – in the 5th Century AD. Gill worked in truly difficult conditions. Not only was it often unbearably hot, but this was still tiger country, and the fierce Bhil people had never come to terms with invaders, whether Hindu or Moghul emperors or 19th Century British military. Lost to time What Gill and other visitors saw, having climbed ropes and ladders, to reach the caves – the original stone stairs had long gone – was architecture of a very high order and sculpture and paintings that took the breath away. Here, Buddhist monks had gazed on thousands of lustrous images of the lives the Buddha – Siddhartha Gautama – had lived before this 6th Century Indian prince took up teaching and inspired a way of thinking and being practiced by hundreds of millions around the world today. Between images of the Buddha, were sensuous representations of glamorous princes and princesses, of animals, palaces, silks, jewellery, of lovemaking and life in all its mortal richness. Some of the images shocked Victorian sensibilities and are still condemned by religious zealots unable to comprehend that what these Indian artists saw was a joyous vision of natural fecundity and divine beauty. Along with the1st Century AD architecture, these paintings showed remarkable affinities to classical Greek art. This was not coincidence, but evidence of a Greco-Indian culture that had spread from the 4th Century BC expeditions of Alexander the Great. It stretched through Hellenistic kingdoms and trade routes from the Mediterranean to Persia, Afghanistan and India – with Ajanta along the way – to distant China and Japan. Twenty-seven of Gill’s canvases were displayed in the Indian Court of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, south London; in 1866, 23 were destroyed by fire. Newly armed with a camera as well as brushes, Gill set to work again. Meanwhile, the Royal Cave Temple Commission founded by the Royal Asiatic Society in 1848 had led to the foundation in 1861 of the Archaeological Survey of India. Concern for the treasures of Ajanta grew, as did the number of intrepid experts and treasure hunters, some of whom did more than carve their names on statues: they scraped paintings from walls which crumbled into dust. One of the few known surviving paintings to have left Ajanta intact is in the care of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts today. It had been sold in 1924 for £1,000 at Sotheby’s in London. The Government of Bombay commissioned new copies of the Ajanta cave paintings in 1872 from John Griffiths, principal of the Bombay School of Art. Griffiths and his students produced 300 paintings, only for a third to go up in flames at London’s Imperial Institute in 1885. In 1909, Lady Herringham, suffragette and art patron, began further copies with help from the Calcutta School of Art, and from the late 1920s the Indian art historian Ghulam Yazdani made a comprehensive photographic survey of the art of Ajanta, published in four volumes between 1930 and 1955. That was the year the surviving Griffiths paintings were put in store by the Victoria & Albert Museum. Inaccessible and forgotten for half a century, in 2005 81 were uncovered and restored. Searching for understanding Since 1999, a team led by Rajdeo Singh of the Archaeological Survey of India, using new methods developed in Japan, have revealed the intense colours and sheer beauty of many of the 1st Century AD portraits along with the subtlety of their artists’ use of perspective, shading and other three-dimensional techniques including the use of bright stones, notably lapis lazuli from Afghanistan. Their meticulous restoration raised anew questions asked many times over the past 200 years. How did the artists paint so well, with such precise use of colour, in the dark recesses of these rock-carved prayer halls and monasteries? Just how many architects, masons, sculptors and painters would have been at work between from circa AD 460-500 when so much of this glorious place, paid for by merchants and courtiers during the reign of the Vakataka dynasty emperor Harisena, was created? And, in those brief years before the fall of the Vakataka empire and its patronage of Buddhist art, could this really have been a place of quiet contemplation when it must have been one vast building site? The many archaeological ventures over the past two centuries seeking to answer these questions, as well as to uncover, document and conserve this feast of Buddhist creativity have added immeasurably to Ajanta’s fame, along with the tramp of ever increasing tourists. In 2013, four replica caves, created by the Mumbai-based designer Rakesh Rathod, were opened at the visitor centre 4km (2.5 miles) from the rock face. The idea was to reduce numbers heading to the precious chaityagrihas and viharas. The fake caves, however, have not been a success: evidently, visitors want the real thing even though many clearly revel in the shopping bazaar and food stalls greeting anyone making pilgrimages to Ajanta today. And, yet the serenity of the sleeping Buddha lying in one of the caves, the summer and winter solstice sunlight illuminating statues of the praying Buddha, the spellbinding architecture and the compelling beauty of the wall paintings lift Ajanta above such worldly concerns. This might be a tourist magnet, yet thanks to generations of conservationists, Ajanta remains a gateway to Nirvana.

Spread to UST,The symbol that spread around the world,2024-09-25,2021-06-24,Matthew Wilson,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210623-the-halo-a-symbol-that-spread-around-the-world,"After first appearing in the religious art of ancient Iran, the disc halo migrated across cultures at an astonishing pace, aided by trade on the Silk Roads. Matt Wilson explores how a simple symbol connects Jesus, Buddha and Apollo. Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism and Greek mythology are usually regarded as utterly distinct religions, largely defined by their differences. But if you just look at them, you will see a symbol that connects them all – the halo. More like this:  - The symbol with a secret meaning  - One of our earliest human symbols  - The ancient symbol that spanned millennia This aura around a holy figure's head expresses their glory or divinity and can be seen in art across the world. There are many variants, including rayed haloes (like that on the Statue of Liberty) and flaming haloes (which feature in some Islamic Ottoman, Mughal and Persian art), but the most distinctive and ubiquitous is the circular disc halo. Why was this symbol invented? It has been conjectured that it could have originally been a type of crown motif. Alternatively, it may have been a symbol of a divine aura emanating from the mind of a deity. Perhaps it was a simple decorative embellishment. One amusing proposal was that it derived from protective plates fixed to statues of gods to protect their heads from bird droppings.   Investigating the function of the original circular halo in religious art only takes us back as far as the 1st Century BC. It had not featured in any prior religion, and yet it became a fixed piece of religious iconography across Eurasia within a few centuries. It is likely to have evolved from very early art traditions. In ancient Egypt, the solar deity Ra was commonly shown with a circular disc representing the sun – although this was above his head rather than behind it. Meanwhile, some artefacts from the city of Mohenjo-daro (in the Indus valley), created in the 2000s BC, feature what look like rayed auras. However, these are inscribed around the whole bodies of holy figures, rather than just their heads. Likewise in the art of ancient Greece there are occasional representations of rayed crowns of light surrounding the heads of mythological heroes to suggest their unique divine powers. But the distinctive circular disc halo is an invention of a later date and presumably the result of unique religious ideas. The earliest examples of a disc halo come from the 300s BC in the religious art of ancient Iran. It seems to have been conceived as a distinguishing feature of Mithra, deity of light in the Zoroastrian religion. It has been contested that the concept of divine glory (known as 'Khvarenah') in Zoroastrianism is intimately connected with the radiance of the sun, and that the halo was the pictorial means of relating this quality to Mithra, just as it had been for Ra. In terms of art history, the sheer speed at which the disc halo migrated across cultures makes it particularly noteworthy as a piece of religious iconography. By the 100s AD – just over a couple of hundred years after its creation – it could be seen in such far-flung locations as the Tunisian town of El Djem, the Turkish city of Samosata and the Pakistani city of Sahri-Bahlol. By the 400s, haloes had been embedded in Christian art in Rome and Buddhist art in China. Somehow, in a matter of a few centuries, they had become Eurasia's universal religious symbol of divinity. So how did the halo's influence spread across the world and between religions? The initial movement of this piece of religious iconography is outwards east and west from its birthplace in Iran, in the hands of some of the past's most powerful empires. In the First Century AD, the Indo-Scythians (nomads from Iran) and the Kushans (from Bactria, Afghanistan) invaded the regions to their southeast, the territories now covered by modern-day Pakistan, Afghanistan and northern India. Both empires, which were steeped in ancient Iranian cultural history, brought coinage with them that represented Mithra with a halo. This youthful and attractive god with his divine radiance had an obvious appeal to a growing number of people around the Hindu Kush. So much so that the iconography of Buddha – even from the earliest visual representations of him, such as the Bimaran reliquary (which might date from the late First Century AD), show him with a Mithraic halo. Meanwhile Mithra was also winning the hearts of the invading Roman Empire to the west – to the extent that Mithraism evolved into a major Roman religion. Mithras later influenced the iconography of another Roman deity – Sol Invictus (the ""sun unconquered""). Both gods combined graceful masculine physiques with divine powers, linked to the sun's radiance and authority, and so were worshipped by the most powerful members of society, especially the Roman Emperors. Constantine (Emperor 306-337CE) recognised the iconographical power of the halo, so he and his successors arrogantly appropriated it and used it in artistic representations of themselves. Then, with the growing acceptance of Christianity in the Roman Empire, artists began to represent Jesus with a halo, now regarded as the highest symbol of divinely sanctioned authority. This new arrival in Christian iconography occurred from around the 300s AD, more than two centuries after it had appeared in Buddhism. It was a signal of Christianity's metamorphosis from a marginalised religion to an official power structure in the west. The halo has stuck in Christian art ever since, although it has undergone some adaptation over the years. God the Father can sometimes be seen crowned with a triangular halo, Jesus a cross-shaped halo and living saints a square halo. Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism peacefully coexisted in India in the first millennium AD, and the three religions shared ideas and artistic iconography, including haloes. The earliest sculpted representations of haloes in Indian religious art come from the two great centres of art production, Gandhara (on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan) and Mathura (90 miles south of Delhi). Trading in ideas In late antiquity and the Middle Ages, Gandhara stood at the centre of an immense network of trading routes that stretched to China in the east and the Mediterranean in the west. Buddhist monasteries appeared along the key junctures of the trade highways to serve as religious versions of caravanserais. They offered a place for merchants to rest, pray and recuperate, and became the springboards from which Buddhism spread overland to China, where artists replicated the religion's iconography. By the 500s AD, haloes were appearing in art in Korea and Japan, indicating the arrival of Buddhism in these regions too. The same dissemination occurred for Hinduism which spread across Asia via overland and maritime trade paths, bringing religious attitudes and artistic styles to Indonesia, Malaysia and other South East Asian territories. These wide-spread arteries of trade, which linked east to west in late antiquity and the Middle Ages, are often referred to as the ""Silk Roads"", after the luxury goods shipped along them. But alongside exotic merchandise, these routes also transported religions, knowledge and iconography. The disc halo is an icon of this dynamic interchange of ideas that existed in the distant past. It started life as a Zoroastrian sign of solar divinity but was spread across Eurasia by ancient empires and trade networks that connected the edges of the known world. In the 21st Century, it is also a powerful reminder of humanity's shared cultural heritage.

Spread to UST,Film star MPs hit back at 'outfit trolls',2024-09-25,2019-05-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48442663,"Two Indian female film stars, recently elected as MPs, hit back after being trolled for wearing ""western clothes"" to their first day in parliament.  Mimi Chakraborty, 30, and Nusrat Jehan, 29, tweeted photos of themselves in trousers and shirts - and drew Twitter flak for looking ""vulgar"". ""I represent the youth and they would be proud that I wear what they do,"" Chakraborty told the BBC.   Both women won by huge margins in the eastern state of West Bengal.  The two are famous actresses in the Bengali film industry, known as Tollywood. They were among 17 women who were given tickets by the Trinamool Congress Party.  It was the first time women accounted for 41% of candidates fielded by a political party.  On their first day at the parliament in capital Delhi, Chakraborty and Jehan posed with wide smiles in front of the imposing building - they looked chic and comfortable, with their sunglasses on and their hair pulled back.  ""My clothes are not important. Just like my win was a befitting answer to the critics who questioned my candidature, my work will be an answer to these trolls. It will be an uphill battle, but I am prepared,"" Jehan told the BBC's Divya Arya.  ""These people are so worried about our clothes but they don't care about MPs who have criminal cases against them, who are corrupt and stained but wear saintly clothes,"" Chakraborty added.  The two women certainly looked different from the typical Indian female MP. For one, not many women this young have been elected to India's parliament - and most women MPs tend to wear traditional attire like saris.  But not everyone was offended by their sartorial sense. Several people have jumped to their defence since news of the trolling spread. But the chatter has not fazed either of the young MPs, who only see this as yet another challenge.  ""It takes time for people to absorb change. When a young male MP wears jeans and t-shirt no one objects, but they have a problem if a woman does the same,"" Chakraborty says. ""We have also got a lot of support on social media. It is time that people understand the change. It won't happen in a fortnight but it has begun,"" Jehan says."
Spread to UST,Grandma's act of kindness for stillborn baby,2024-09-25,2018-10-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45959424,"On 13 October an act of kindness joined four strangers in Jacksonville, Florida in a story they will probably never forget. It started with the quiet gesture by a grandmother called Vanessa Philips who went to a local bakery to anonymously pay for the birthday cake of a child turning one. Her daughter-in-law had suffered a stillbirth a year earlier, and she wanted to ""pay it forward"" by paying for another child's cake in memory of her grandson. After the story was shared on social media, the BBC spoke to the family who unexpectedly received the gift. Kesha Campbell, 33, said she went to the Publix bakery before her son David's 1st birthday party to pay for the cake she had ordered. When the shop told her it was already paid for, she insisted it was a mistake, before eventually accepting the cake. ""I just took it as a blessing and went on with my day,"" she explained, and took the cake home where David enjoyed his party. In the meantime, Nick DeClemente, the customer service assistant who had served Vanessa Philips, had been so moved by her story that he posted it on Facebook. A week later, Mrs Campbell's friend was sent the post by a friend. ""When I saw my son's name and the cake on the receipt, I was so shocked,"" she said.  The donor's identity later came out in local media.  ""I found the lady and thanked her,"" said Mrs Campbell. ""God bless her heart and that beautiful baby soul."" Nick DeClemente explained that in 20 years working in retail, this is the first time a customer had made a gesture like this.  ""For women whose children are stillborn, it's a hard pill to swallow, but somehow they are finding ways to pay tribute to their children who they lost,"" he explained. He said when Mrs Philips paid for the cake, it was a ""really nice moment"" that made his day. ""I have a child on the way, so it was emotional and very heartfelt to speak to Vanessa. I wanted spread the message about what she was doing for her stillborn grandson."" Mrs Philips told local news network Action News Jax that last year her pregnant daughter-in-law found out that her five-and-half-month-old baby's heartbeat had stopped. This month, to honour the baby, who they called Christian, they wanted to buy a birthday cake for another family ""to make their little boy happy"". Mrs Philips' son and daughter-in-law now have a six-week-old daughter called Harper. The story prompted many women on social media to share their stories of stillbirth.  ""It especially touched my heart because I have a son that died at three weeks of age and to this day, my mum never mentions him, honours his birthday or anything. It still hurts 25 years later,"" wrote one. Another woman commented, ""You will never know the pain and the day-to-day new way of life after losing a child that you had so many hopes and dreams. I did have my Rainbow Baby Gavin and he truly saved my life."" Mr DeClemente said the act of kindness made a difference there are many ""depressing stories"" written about Jacksonville, which was the site of a mass shooting at a video game tournament in August. ""Often we just see negative news all day long, and I wanted to contribute something positive for once,"" he commented. ""I hope that people find peace through it and find their own good deed to do."" By Georgina Rannard, BBC UGC & Social News"
Spread to UST,How Capt Sir Tom Moore became a nation's hero,2024-09-25,2021-02-02,By Helen Burchell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-52324058,"Captain Sir Tom Moore won the nation's hearts with his extraordinary fundraising efforts for National Health Service charities. The retired Army officer served in India and Myanmar, also known as Burma, during World War Two but it was by walking laps around his garden that he became known to millions. When he was 99, he was catapulted into the global spotlight with his attempt to raise an initial £1,000 for charity. Early in April 2020, with the aid of his walking frame and a steely determination, he vowed to complete 100 laps of his patio before his 100th birthday at the end of that month. The war veteran was inspired to help the health service after receiving treatment for skin cancer of the head, and a broken hip after a fall in 2018. He described the NHS staff who helped him through this as ""marvellous"", and pledged to help those same ""super"" people who were working on the front line during the coronavirus pandemic. His family thought reaching the £1,000 mark would be ""a real stretch"" but, as press coverage of his efforts increased, so did the donations. By the time he completed his 100 laps - on 16 April 2020 - Captain Tom, as he had become affectionately known, had raised more than £12m for NHS Charities Together. In 2007, he had moved from Kent to Bedfordshire to be with his youngest daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, and her family. It was here, in Marston Moretaine, that the idea of raising relatively modest funds for a charity supporting the NHS was hatched. Capt Sir Tom began walking - planning on 10 laps at a time of the 25-metre (82ft) loop in his back garden - and the donations began mounting up. Every million was another milestone, but the veteran, who became a well-known face on national television, took it all in his stride. Ever modest about the challenge he had set himself, Capt Sir Tom was nevertheless astounded by the generosity of donors, describing it as ""completely out of this world"". ""It's all for the sake of the nurses and the NHS we have, because they are doing such a magnificent job,"" he said at the time. ""Every penny that we get, they deserve every one of it."" He was described as a ""one-man fundraising machine"" by the Duke of Cambridge, while both the prime minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Capt Sir Tom was ""an inspiration"" to everyone. Not only did his efforts encourage thousands to donate to the fundraising appeal, but he inspired many to join his campaign to raise both awareness and money for those working in, and supporting, the NHS. From a teenage girl learning to walk again on a treadmill as part of her recovery from a stroke, to a non-verbal boy with autism - who wrote ""He is a hero to us,"" as he embarked on his own challenge to walk for the NHS - people set themselves their own challenges, buoyed by the former soldier. Age, it seemed, was no barrier - as Capt Sir Tom was proving. Dozens dusted off their own walking frames and took to the streets to prove they could play their own part in the drive to raise funds. One woman completed a marathon by walking laps near her Berkshire home, at the age of 104. ""Tom, I've done it,"" she laughed, as she finished her challenge. A week before his 100th birthday, Capt Sir Tom became the oldest person ever to get to number one in the UK singles charts when his duet of You'll Never Walk Alone - with singer Michael Ball - took the top spot. His 100th birthday on 30 April 2020 was marked with an RAF flypast, personal birthday greetings from the Queen and prime minister, and he was made an honorary colonel of the British Army. ""I'm still Captain Tom, that's who I really am but if people choose to call me colonel, well, thank you very much,"" he replied. The following month it was announced he would be awarded a knighthood for his fundraising efforts and would be known as Captain Sir Thomas Moore ""under Ministry of Defence protocol"". On 17 July 2020, he was knighted in the grounds of Windsor Castle, in the Queen's first official engagement in person since the lockdown period began in March. His youngest daughter said at the time of his fundraising efforts that her father had become a ""beacon of hope"" during challenging times. And indeed, Capt Sir Tom always seemed to know just the right thing to say to buoy the nation's spirits as the public tried to abide by government regulations to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. ""To all those people who are finding it difficult at the moment, the sun will shine on you again, and the clouds will go away,"" he said. ""Tomorrow will be a good day"" - another example of his positivity - became a hashtag on social media posts. The proud Yorkshireman completed his 100 laps of his garden live on television in April 2020, with a Guard of Honour from 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment and a rousing round of applause from his family. By the time he closed his fundraising page at midnight on his 100th birthday, Capt Sir Tom had raised £32,794,701 for charities supporting the NHS, from more than one-and-a-half-million global donors.

It is a third delay to the biennial event which should have taken place in 2020 before being postponed by a year due to Covid-19. The plan was to hold the championships in the Algerian city of Oran between the 1st and 5th June 2021 before it was then  moved to Algiers and set to take place 22-26 June. The Confederation of African Athletics are yet to make a public statement about this latest setback for the continental showpiece. With the Olympics set to begin in Tokyo in July the news will come as a blow to athletes across the continent who were hoping to use the championships in a final bid to achieve the qualifying standard for The Games. The sport's global governing body, World Athletics, has set 29 June 2021 as the deadline for reaching the qualifying mark to take part at the 2020 Olympics. The Algerian Ministry of Youth and Sports (MJS) said in a statement the delay came ""due to the health situation, marked by a resurgence in the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and the risk of circulation of new variant(s)."" The ministry added it was ""following the recommendations of the scientific monitoring committee of the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic."" ""The MJS called on the Algerian Athletics Federation (FAA) to make the necessary arrangements to inform the officials of the Confederation of African Athletics in order to agree new dates for the holding of these championships as soon as the health situation improves."" The African Athletics Championships were last held in the Nigerian city of Asaba in 2018."
Spread to UST,Why are some in Spain upset about a Jesus poster?,2024-09-25,2024-02-05,Nafeesah Allen,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240205-sexualised-jesus-painting-sparks-controversy-in-spain,"Conservatives in Spain call a recent rendition of Jesus ""sexualised"". Art experts don't get what the fuss is about. Spanish artist Salustiano García Cruz's depiction of a handsome, youthful Jesus – for whom his own son served as the model – on a poster in Seville has become the source of controversy. The painting, which shows a young and muscular Jesus in a loincloth, has critics – largely conservatives on social media – calling the image ""offensive"", ""evil"", and too ""sexualised"" for Holy Week. More like this: -The literary scandal that rocked US high society  -The works too scandalous for display  -Netflix's Griselda: Who's real and who is not? Barcelona gallerist Artur Ramon tells BBC Culture that this version of Jesus is so controversial because, in southern Spanish tradition, Christ is normally represented as suffering, drenched in blood. ""This"", on the other hand, ""is an idealised Neoplatonic Christ that's more in the Italian Renaissance tradition,"" says Ramon. But opinions are split – and the social media outcry is certainly not representative of Seville as a whole. Many, including Seville mayor José Luis Sanz, find the controversy itself to be ""artificial."" Sanz told the AP: “I like the poster...Some posters are riskier, some more classical, some are more daring."" ""It's a Christ that I would say is effeminate or androgynous in a way,"" Ramon continues. ""Spain is a country that is still quite homophobic, and people don't like that he is represented in this way for a festival that marks the passion of Christ in his final moments of life."" That said, Spain was one of the first nations in the world to legalise gay marriage and adoption for same-sex couples back in 2005, and the most recent rankings from both Gay Times UK and Global Citizen Solutions place Spain in the top five most LGBTQ+-friendly countries around the world.  There has also been pushback against drawing conclusions about sexuality based solely on appearance; Garcia himself responded to such commentary in an interview with El Mundo: ""A gay Christ because he looks sweet and is handsome, come on! We are in the 21st Century,"" he said. Ramon says Seville's strong Catholic tradition makes it ripe for this kind of debate to take place there. Seville's Catholic Archdiocese dates back to the Apolistic Age, the years roughly between Christ's death and the 1st Century. The city sits within the autonomous region of Andalusia, which was ruled by Muslim Moors from the eighth through to the 15th Century. The Spanish Reconquest restored Catholicism to the region, although it still remains an important holy site for Judaism and Islam, too. Ramon says the debate over García's non-suffering Jesus hasn't spread to Madrid or Barcelona, and it's not likely to – in those metropolitan cities, people are open to differing views, he says. Andalusian curator and teacher Pedro Alarcón of Casa Sostoa disagrees. ""I think that, in general, people are very disconcerted, with the presentation of a beauty that they have seen as 'very current'"", Alarcón tells BBC Culture. ""The image of Christ responds precisely to some canons of idealization and archetype of classical beauty, which have always been followed throughout the history of art to represent the iconography of the resurrected one. Like some kind of Apollo...I think what is disconcerting is that he looks like a boy posing for a collection of any brand."" ""I think that actually, many people don't care,"" Alarcón continues. ""And then there is a very religious sector…that does see it as something different and perhaps intolerable. And they don't know how to express it, and they certainly have no references. In the end, they easily fall into saying that something is sacrilegious or blasphemous."" Garcia himself told Atlas News Agency, ""There is nothing revolutionary in the painting. There is contemporaneity, but all the elements that I have used are elements that have been used in the last seven centuries in sacred art."" Art historian Morgan Haigh echoes the sentiments that there's nothing shocking going on here, adding that the controversy ""seems to me… a huge overreaction to an image of Christ which, whilst unusual to see in our own times, does not especially stand out as an exception in the history of art. Biblical figures and saints have often been made attractive or 'sexy' in art history, whether it's images of the scantily-clad young Saint Sebastian pierced by arrows, the naked body of Mary Magdalene covered only by her hair, or the muscular torso of Christ in works by Michelangelo and others."" Haigh says García's painting is as close to the real Christ as any by Raphael, Leonardo or Titian. And in the grand scheme of ecclesiastical art, this isn't the first rendition of Christ that's garnered negative attention. When compared to Andres Serrano's intentionally vulgar 1989 Piss Christ, for example, García's image appears quite tame. The debate over what Christ might have looked like is longstanding in both religious and art circles. Professor of religious studies and theological studies at the University of Waterloo in Canada, Alicia Batten, tells BBC Culture that images of Christ within the Christian tradition have always varied, usually reflecting the values of the artists and societies that produce them. ""Given the dominance of particular notions of masculinity in many 'western' cultures, it is not surprising that some are upset with this image from Spain. The image apparently challenges some peoples' ideal of who Christ should be, and indeed, their notion of what it means to be a man.""    It's important to remember why Garcia's painting was made in the first place: to draw people into the Church over Easter. Haigh says he'd imagine “the Popes of the Baroque period would be over the moon if a painting made people engage with how Jesus might or might not have looked."" While the controversy has certainly garnered public attention, only time will tell if Salustiano García's latest work actually met the objective of getting more people to attend Easter Mass. ""What is clear"", Alarcón adds, is that what's potentially controversial ""is not the question of nudity – far from it. Precisely, the artist has used a cloth of purity, which is literally taken from a Christ procession in Seville. That is to say: This Christ is just as naked as any other who goes out during Holy Week.""

Spread to UST,Dettori to put dark days behind him,2024-09-25,2013-06-02,Frank Keogh,https://www.bbc.com/sport/horse-racing/22744279,"Frankie Dettori says he wants to put ""the worst period of his career"" behind him as he returns from a drugs ban. The 42-year-old plans to be in action at several racetracks this week after finishing down the field on First Cornerstone in Sunday's French Derby. This video can not be played Frankie Dettori 'very comfortable' after return The three-time champion jockey told the BBC he has set a target of 100 winners for the season, and believes he can continue at the top until he is 50. ""The last 18 months have been the worst of my life in terms of work,"" he said. ""Now it's just a case of restarting again and getting the love back."" Dettori was banned from racing for six months after testing positive for cocaine at Longchamp in France last year. He said he let his family down by taking the drug in a moment of weakness during a period where he had slipped down the pecking order at Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin racing operation. His role as number one jockey was no longer guaranteed and the 18-year partnership ended in October, before news of his positive test emerged. Dettori, who is now riding as a freelance, returned at Epsom on Friday with three rides and, after his French trip, is expecting a busy week. ""I'm at Windsor on Monday, Yarmouth Tuesday, Kempton on Wednesday, and  Sandown on Thursday,"" said Dettori in his first interview since his comeback. Dettori rode out for Godolphin's Irish rivals Ballydoyle at their Tipperary base run by trainer Aidan O'Brien earlier in the month, and it is understood he may travel to Ireland for Leopardstown's evening meeting on Friday. After winning the Derby at Epsom with Ruler Of The World on Saturday, O'Brien hinted that Dettori could soon be riding some of his horses on the track. Dettori had been linked with a potential Derby ride for the Ballydoyle team, possibly on Ruler Of The World, but a delay in getting the all-clear to return from France Galop, French racing's rulers, meant his first rides came 11 days later than his original comeback target of 20 May. ""Frankie has a talent that you are born with. The lads make all the decision and they are usually common sense,"" O'Brien told the BBC. 'He hasn't ridden for six months so going into something like that (the Derby) would have been like a tennis player going straight into Wimbledon. 'We are very lucky we have great riders and Frankie is there now as well. He is available to everybody and he'll be better for the experience.'  Dettori prefers not to talk about the issue with France Galop, but hopes his return to the country will pay off in a race he has won three times before, including in 2007 when he triumphed on Lawman 24 hours after his only Epsom Derby win, with Authorized. ""I was contacted last week about the ride. It's a race that has been quite lucky for me and looks wide open,"" he said.  Citing the recent success in the United States of 50-year-old jockey Gary Stevens, Dettori believes he has several years left at the top of racing. ""It's quite scary going into the unknown. I'm starting from scratch again but think I can ride until I'm 50. Look at Gary Stevens,"" he said. ""I'm still in my prime and will carry on as long as I can, with all the major races as my target."" Asked about specific future goals and the possibility at some stage of bidding for a fourth champion jockey title, Dettori replied: ""It's not something I have thought about too much really. ""I've got to be realistic, try to ride as many winners as I can, without burning myself out. ""If it happened that I had a great start, a purple patch, then I might pursue it but at this stage I will try to get 100 winners this season."" The Italian-born rider, who famously rode seven winners on the same card at odds of more than 25,000-1 at Ascot in 1996, is looking forward to riding at the five-day Royal Ascot meeting which starts on 18 June. ""Royal Ascot is around the corner so I'm concentrating on that. It is my favourite meeting, I have ridden 50 winners there, and it's the ultimate - the Olympics of horse racing,"" he said. But he is unsure whether he will ride again for Godolphin, which has seen its own drugs problems, with trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni banned for eight years in April for doping racehorses. ""Whether that happens is not down to me. I'll just continue to spread myself around a bit,"" he added.

Spread to UST,Eight of the best bagels in New York City,2024-09-25,2024-04-14,Margherita Bassi,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240413-the-eight-best-bagels-in-nyc-according-to-the-citys-bagel-ambassador,"Bagel Ambassador Sam Silverman shares his top bagel destinations in New York City, from beloved hole-in-the-wall Absolute Bagels to the award-winning Popup Bagels. With their endless variations of savoury and sweet flavours, toppings and fillings, bagels are one of New York City's most iconic foods. Whether it's the simple ""everything"" bagel with plain cream cheese or the more creative French toast bagel with peanut butter, chances are that if a New Yorker is looking for a quick hot bite, they'll head to their favourite bagel joint. We talked to Sam Silverman, the city's ""Bagel Ambassador,"" to find the best bagels in town, and got a history lesson, too: though bagels are now considered quintessential New York food, they have a surprisingly dark past. Bagels originated in 17th-Century Poland, where anti-Semitic laws forbade the Jewish community from baking bread. ""The loophole to get around it was that they would boil their dough before they baked it, and so it wasn't technically considered bread,"" says Silverman. Boiling the dough before baking it is what gives bagels their characteristic crunchy outside and chewy inside, so what started as a loophole to discriminatory legislation would become exactly what makes bagels special. When Eastern European immigrants arrived in New York and Montreal in the 1900s, Jewish families brought this unique recipe with them. Bagels have been a staple in both cities ever since. The SpeciaList Sam Silverman is the CEO of BagelUp, a trade organization for the global bagel industry. Silverman and his team lead a variety of bagel activities, including bagel baking classes and bagel walking tours around the city. He is recognised as New York's ""Bagel Ambassador"" and one of Brooklyn's 50 Most Fascinating People of 2023 by Brooklyn Magazine. Silverman started New York's first BagelFest in 2019 and now leads bagel baking classes and bagel walking tours around the city, among other bagel-related activities, but the iconic carb has been his favourite food since childhood. ""My family called me a 'bageltarian' because I had a bagel with virtually every single meal,"" he says. Here are New York City's Bagel Ambassador's go-to bagel destinations in the Big Apple. 1. Best for groups: Utopia Bagels  At the top of Silverman's list is Utopia Bagels, which has been making bagels in Whitestone, Queens, for over four decades. ""They are one of the most impressive bagel operations that I have ever seen – they hand roll over 100,000 bagels per week,"" Silverman says. ""They have over 50 staff members and an enormous oven that's been in the space since the shop opened that just creates the perfect crisp on a New York bagel."" Over the last decade, Utopia Bagels has acquired the neighbouring businesses to expand the shop into a space large enough to accommodate its growing popularity. Plans are underway to open a second location in Manhattan in the summer of 2024, and Silverman guaranteed that all the hype is worth it. ""My personal favourite bagel in the city is a hot bagel straight out of the Utopia Bagels' oven. It is unrivalled,"" he says. Website: https://www.utopiabagelsny.com/ Address: 1909 Utopia Parkway, Whitestone, NY 11357 Phone: (718) 352 2586 Instagram: @utopiabagels 2. Best for on-the-go: Popup Bagels Popup Bagels is the youngest bagel destination on this list but has quickly risen through the bagel ranks. The business started as a pandemic project in owner Adam Goldberg's backyard in Connecticut. Since then, they've become two-time champions of the Best Bagel Award at the Brooklyn BagelFest and opened a shop in Greenwich Village, with two more on the way in 2024. Sam Silverman's best bagel tips ""They have a unique model that is different from virtually every other shop in the city,"" Silverman says. ""They do not make bagel sandwiches. Their key is small-batch, fresh-out-the-oven bagels, and then you just rip and dip the bagel with a schmear [of cream cheese]."" Popup bagels are also lighter and crispier than the classic New York Bagel, which tends to be denser and larger. ""Although they are a new trendy shop, they're definitely here to stay,"" says Silverman. In true grab-and-go style, there's no seating in the shop, but the space doesn't need a big footprint to make a big impact. ""They just raised 8 million dollars of funding to expand nationally, including from a bunch of celebrity investors,"" says Silverman.

Best for bagel sandwiches: Ess-a-bagel  Ess-a-bagel has been around for over 40 years and has become known as the trailblazer of New York bagel shops. According to Silverman, they were the first to make jumbo fluffy bagels, which is the bagel type that the city is known for today and make for the best bagel sandwiches. ""They're an institution,"" Silverman says. ""If someone is coming to the city and they want to get a classic New York bagel, they're probably gonna go to Ess-a-bagel."" Ess-a-bagel has four locations throughout the city: three in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn, which means visitors to the city will almost always find an Ess-a-bagel nearby. The challenge, however, is the monumental line that forms out the door at all hours of the day. Luckily, Silverman has a hack. ""They actually have a second separate line for customers ordering only bagels and cream cheese,"" he says. ""That means no bagel sandwiches, but you get to skip the entire line, and they're always fresh out of the oven. You won't regret it.""

Best for crunchy bagel skin: Absolute Bagels  ""Absolute Bagels is an absolute institution on the Upper West Side,"" says Silverman. ""Anybody who grew up there will swear they make the best bagels in the city."" Their secret to success is also making hot fresh bagels all day long, and they have perfected the thin crunchy outside. Absolute Bagels is a hole in the wall with, unfortunately, no hack to the long line that usually snakes down the block, but Silverman is adamant that it is the best shop in the Upper West Side. ""I don't know how they do it,"" he says. ""But they're able to achieve that perfectly crisp bagel skin which makes them one of the best in the city."" Address: 2788 Broadway, New York, NY 10025 Phone: (212) 932 2052 Facebook: Absolute-Bagels 5. Best for French toast bagels: Tompkins Square Bagels As the name might suggest, Tompkins Square Bagels started near Tompkins Square Park in the East Village and now has three locations stretching to Union Square. The original shop has been making bagels for over a decade and has become known for having one of the warmest and most inviting atmospheres of any bagel destination in the city. The owner and operator Christopher Pugliese worked in fine dining before moving to bagels, which taught him the importance of a warm ambiance and good service. ""He always says that he's not in the bagel business, he's in the happiness business,"" Silverman says. ""He believes his job is to make every single person that walks through the door as happy as they can be."" That means that in addition to making delicious bagels, there's great attention to detail. The kitchen is open space, so customers can see their bagels made in real-time, and Silverman describes the cream cheese display as ""absolutely gorgeous"". And while Silverman's go-to is a savoury bagel, he has a weakness for one of their sweet offerings. ""The French toast Bagel at Tompkins Square Bagels is hands down the best French toast bagel in the city, and one of the best sweet bagels out there,"" he says. ""Anytime I send people to Tompkins, I tell them to get two bagels – a savoury, and then the French toast for dessert. You'll thank me later.""

Best for Instagram-worthy bagels: Liberty Bagels  Liberty Bagels is home to the iconic rainbow bagel: the oft-Instagrammed sweet bagel tinged with unicorn-esque swirls of food colouring. Their bagel roller Osiel Escobar has been making rainbow bagels longer than anyone else in the city, and uses a secret ingredient that Silverman is yet to discover. Liberty Bagels also go all out for special occasions, says Silverman. ""For example, they'll do pink and white bagels for Valentine's Day and red-white-and-blue bagels for Fourth of July."" It goes without saying that their savoury bagels are also delicious; they won the best New York bagel at the second Brooklyn BagelFest. Silverman suggests a similar move to his tip for Tompkins Square Bagels: ""You gotta get a savoury and a rainbow bagel for dessert."" Sixty percent of the people Silverman takes on his bagel tour prefer the birthday cake cream cheese spread with the rainbow bagel, but Silverman says that it also pairs well with peanut butter and Nutella or a fruit cream cheese. Website: https://libertybagels.com/ Address/Phone: 16 E 58th St, New York, NY 10022 [(212) 355 0900]; 708 9th Ave #1, New York, NY 10019 [(212) 246 2004]; 260 W 35th St, New York, NY 10001 [(212) 279 1124]; 32 Broadway, New York, NY 10004 [(212) 381 1290] Instagram: @libertybagelsny 7. Best for cream cheese flavours: Bagel Pub According to Silverman, Bagel Pub has ""hands down"" the best cream cheese selection in New York City, as well as some creative flavours like guacamole, za'atar, honey bacon sriracha and cucumber dill. ""It looks like a gelateria,"" Silverman says, ""but it's actually a bagel shop, and they have fantastic bagels too."" Bagel Pub's signature bagel is the pumpernickel everything bagel. Unlike other hole-in-the-wall shops, Bagel Pub's six locations are also trendy destinations. The chain commissioned local artists to recreate famous paintings with bagels as their muse, like the quirky ""Bagelisa"" (inspired by the Mona Lisa), so customers can enjoy the setting as much as their go-to bagel sandwich.

Best for old-school New York bagels: Bagel Hole  Bagel Hole is a Brooklyn institution in the Park Slope neighbourhood that has been around for over three decades. Their specialty is old-school style New York Bagels, which means smaller and crispier, but just as delicious. Their old-school style extends to more than just their bagels, however. ""There is zero ambiance,"" Silverman admitted of the hole-in-the-wall eatery. ""It showcases a caricature of bad New York service, while being completely genuine. For example, you can't take pictures in there. They were also probably the last bagel shop in the city to buy a toaster – fresh bagels should never be toasted, and it used to be that bagel shops didn't have one at all. Bagel Hole held out the longest.""

Spread to UST,US airman pleads guilty to Pentagon documents leak,2024-09-25,2024-03-04,By Mike Wendling,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68473868,"An Air National Guard member has pleaded guilty to posting dozens of classified documents online in one of highest-profile intelligence leaks in recent years. Prosecutors recommend that Jack Teixeira, 22, be sentenced to up to 16 years and eight months in prison. While working at an Air National Guard base, he posted documents to Discord, a platform popular with gamers. The material included maps, satellite images and intelligence on US allies. Teixeira pleaded guilty to six counts of wilful retention and transmission of national defence information in a US federal court in Boston on Monday.  Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. However, under the terms of a plea deal, prosecutors said they would ask for 200 months in prison - which Teixeira has agreed not to contest. At minimum, he will serve 11 years and pay a fine of $50,000 (£39,000). Teixeira also agreed to be debriefed by intelligence and defence officials.  During the hearing he spoke briefly to confirm his agreement to the plea deal.  US prosecutor Joshua Levy told reporters that the government is seeking a ""very serious sentence"" in order to send ""a powerful deterrent message"".  ""One of the reasons this case is so serious is that once things are posted on the internet, shared on the internet, it's almost impossible to track down what happens to every document,"" Mr Levy said. Teixeira's attorney Michael Bachrach called his client ""very much a kid"" and said that his youth played a ""significant role"" in his actions. Mr Bachrach said he hoped to be able to successfully argue for a jail term of 11 years at a sentencing hearing scheduled for 27 September. Teixeira initially began sharing information in late 2022 to a small community of gun and military enthusiasts on a Discord server, or chatroom. Initially the documents stayed within the group - and Teixeira expressed frustration that his online friends did not realise their significance - but the information was soon re-shared to more public channels. Eventually, the documents spread to fringe message boards and bigger social media networks, and were picked up by pro-Kremlin Telegram channels and military bloggers. Some copies of the documents were later altered by others, for instance to inflate Ukrainian casualty figures.  Teixeira was warned by supervisors after he was seen making notes while looking at classified documents, prosecutors said, and he posed specific questions based on classified intelligence during a briefing. Teixeira was based at the Otis Air National Guard Base, near his home a little more than an hour south of Boston, Massachusetts. He worked as a cyber-defence operations journeyman - an information technology job maintaining the Air Force communications network - and held the rank of Airman 1st Class. Despite his junior role, he had a top-secret security clearance. The leak prompted an investigation and led the Pentagon to examine its systems for handling classified information.  The Air Force disciplined 15 of its members in connection with the case in December.  A report from the Air Force's inspector general said officers were aware of Teixeira's ""intelligence-seeking activities"" and failed to stop him, and that leaders in his unit knew of up to four instances of ""questionable activity"" involving his access to classified material. Several officers knew of other incidents, the report said, but did not report them, fearing that security officials would ""overreact"". But the report also said Teixeira's supervisors did not know the full extent of his online activity. The report said there was a lack of supervision during overnight shifts at the base, when a three-person crew was responsible for answering phones and ensuring the heating and air conditioning systems were operating. Teixeira would print and smuggle out classified documents when working those shifts. Screenshots of the classified information appeared to showed creased printouts photographed at his home.  In court filings, prosecutors said Teixeira was once suspended from high school after a classmate overheard him making racial threats and discussing weapons. Even though Teixeira said he was talking about a video game, local police then denied him a firearms identification card needed to purchase weapons. He was eventually approved, however, and authorities found a number of guns when they searched his house after his arrest.  Prosecutors also said he attempted to destroy evidence, smashing his tablet, laptop and Xbox and encouraging members of a Discord chat room  to delete their messages as authorities closed in. Teixeira's family has a history of military service. His stepfather served 34 years in the Air Force, and his mother previously worked for non-profit organisations focused on veterans. Both attended his plea hearing on Monday. In a statement the family said Teixeira was ""a good person"" who has ""has taken responsibility for his part in this"". They said the Air Force Inspector General report revealed ""shocking details"" about lack of training and oversight at the base, and that they hoped ""substantive changes are made to stop this from ever happening again."""

Spread to UST,The last male of an extinct species,2024-09-25,2024-01-24,Riley Farrell,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240124-the-photo-of-sudan-the-last-male-northern-white-rhino,"Sudan, the world's last male northern white rhino, died in 2018. In his final years, he became a global celebrity and conservation icon, helping raise awareness about the brutality of poaching. There was a lot of hope riding on Sudan, the last male northern white rhinoceros. He was labelled the ""world's most eligible bachelor"" by the dating app Tinder, the ""most famous rhino"" by various news outlets and a ""gentle giant"" by the armed guards who watched over him 24-hours-a-day. But Sudan's life carried the baggage of a species decimated by poaching. In the Ol Pejeta conservancy at the foot of Mount Kenya, AFP photojournalist Tony Karumba captured a celebrated snapshot of Sudan on 5 December 2016, approximately 15 months before the rhino's death. At the forefront of Karumba's image is the tender relationship between the humans at the conservancy and Sudan. The photo is iconic but not iconoclastic, exemplifying an ordinary moment of the all-too-late-yet-genuine care that northern white rhinos received from the species that decimated them. Once lost, gone forever, only to live in photos like Karumba's photo series.  Sign up to Future Earth Sign up to the Future Earth newsletter to get essential climate news and hopeful developments in your inbox every Tuesday from Carl Nasman. This email is currently available to non-UK readers. In the UK? Sign up for newsletters here. As Sudan was released from his pen to pasture, Karumba captured his pictures. ""There's trust and love all over that moment,"" says Karumba. ""Being in Sudan's presence always felt for me like a visit with a sage; his demeanour, despite his behemoth self, had a way of conveying a calm patience with me and though his minders would always be hovering just outside my camera's frame, he [Sudan] was accepting of my wary intrusions and poised as though he was aware of his symbolism as the last icon of his subspecies."" The photo showcases Sudan's craniate profile and his two horns, a trait characterising the white rhino subspecies, shaved off to deter poachers. Sudan's carer calms the two-and-a-half-tonned (2,500 kg)animal, whose head is longer than the man's torso. Karumba's vantage, his low viewpoint on Sudan, ""emphasised the power and the stature of the rhino,"" says Michael Pritchard, programmes director at the Royal Photographic Society in the UK. ""The power of this photograph is the interaction between this impressive animal and this human,"" says Pritchard. ""There's a kindness, a relationship."" Sudan spent most of his life at the Safari Park Dvůr Králové in the Czech Republic from 1975 to 2009. He was then moved to the highly surveilled Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Laikipia, Kenya, which was a last-ditch effort to encourage procreation with the remaining females of his subspecies. It didn't work. Sudan died on 19 March 2018, age 45, crushing hopes of saving the northern white rhinos from extinction. Only two female northern white rhinos – both former zoo animals called Najin and Fatu – remain alive at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. Both are incapable of sustaining a pregnancy and the subspecies is now ""functionally extinct"". But there is now new hope that it might be possible to resurect the northern white rhino after scientists have achieved the world's first IVF pregnancy in a closely-related subspecies, the southern white rhino. They hope to repeat this with northern white rhinos next. (Read more about the achievement from BBC News.) ""We are very confident that we will be able to create northern white rhinos in the same manner and that we will be able to save the species,"" Susanne Holtze, a scientist at Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Germany, which is part of the Biorescue project, a consortium working to save the white rhino species, told BBC News.  ""Sudan was one of those news stories that went around the world,"" says Pritchard. ""His photos show that we're changing the world in a way that numbers, statistics or government meetings can't do. That's the power of photography: to engage with a public that might not respond to facts and figures."" The photos themselves are ""straightforward,"" Pritchard continues. But it's the context around the photographs that struck him. Sudan's story became much bigger than Sudan. ""We're looking at something that is no longer with us both on an individual level but, more importantly, on a species level,"" says Pritchard. Once the world caught a glimpse of the functional face of extinction, it could not get enough. Sudan's publicity campaign won him fans around the globe, visits from tourists and donations for conservation efforts. When news of his passing spread, politicians and celebrities posted pictures of themselves meeting Sudan. On 20 December 2020, Google launched a Doodle on its homepage in remembrance of Sudan, who casts a long shadow in the illustration, which appeared in the search bars of every continent except Antarctica. ""It leaves me happy and feeling accomplished that my efforts to document the glimpses I had of Sudan were and still are so well received,"" says Karumba. ""Repeatedly, our coverage of Sudan seemed to create a buzz, garnering interest from mainstream media and conservation circles."" Sudan – and his ageing likeness – showed people how vulnerable rhinos are, says Karumba, who interacted with Sudan throughout his final decade at the Kenyan conservancy.   Rhinos, the biological equivalent of armour-plated tanks with an anachronistic dinosaurian demeanour, are deceptively docile. ""I remember being surprised at how calm he was, as I snapped photos of him and the females back then,"" Karumba wrote of his first encounter with Sudan. ""We were hustling and bustling all around him and climbing on his crate to try and get a good picture. But he was completely calm."" Why are northern white rhinos extinct in the wild? Illegal poaching, fueled by the increasing demand for keratin-rich rhino horn in traditional medicinal practices, has devastated the African rhino population. In 1960, there were still 2,360 wild northern white rhinos but by 2008 the subspecies was extinct in the wild. From beyond the grave, Sudan went from a representative of optimism to a cautionary tale, cemented in conservation iconography, says sustainability economistat the University of Oxford Michael 't Sas-Rolfes. When Sas-Rolfes met Sudan in Kenya at an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) African Rhino Specialist Group meeting towards the end of the rhino's life in 2013, ""it was like the walking dead"". Rhinos are what Sas-Rolfes calls a ""charismatic"" endangered species. Other charismatic examples include elephants, big cats and bears, which all capture the public's imagination, he says. Charismatic wildlife walks the fragile line between being revered and feared, hoisted by attention from economically developed countries. Look no further than branding to see charismatic wildlife take the stage. Beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, emergent international wildlife non-profits like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) launched its Save the Rhino campaign, says Sas-Rolfes. ""Our relationship with charismatic wildlife is complex, but they've always been held in high esteem,"" he says. ""NGOs have capitalised on the powerful imagery to raise funds."" William Fowlds, a wildlife veterinarian and conservationist, has first-hand witnessed the bloody repercussions of poaching in South Africa, which is home to more rhinos than any other country. In 2022, 448 rhinos were illegally killed, compared to 451 in 2021 in South Africa, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The amount of brutality afflicted against the rhino depends on the experience-level of the poacher, who typically uses a saw or a machete to hack its horn off, Fowlds says. ""Pieces of face and flesh fly off its body, landing multiple metres away from the rhino, blood splattering on vegetation around,"" he says. ""You can see by the marks on the ground where the animal tried to get away."" One word springs to mind when Fowlds looks at the photo of Sudan: loneliness. ""We've invaded their world. We've destroyed their habitat. We've separated them from each other. Now, we've arrived at a time when there are very few of them left on the planet,"" he says. Rhinos are social and soft-natured, Fowlds says. Intelligent, too, with varied personalities. ""Like Sudan's handler in this picture, people who see the photo feel up close and are privileged to spend time with the last of his kind,"" Fowlds says. ""They're vulnerable. Obviously, the numbers at the hands of humans reflect that."" Fowlds brings up another famous, albeit happier, rhino story. Her name is Thandi, a female southern white rhino who was disfigured by poachers on 2 March 2012. Two other rhinos were attacked, both died. Thandi improved – much to the surprise of veterinarians involved, like Fowlds. After this rescue and rehabilitation, she has gone on to give birth to multiple babies and wears her facial scars with pride. Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. Sudan and Thandi have phenomenal stories, Fowlds says. Both of their faces are important in the fight against poaching. They represent the first step of awareness. ""They inspire many people, including myself, to do more for rhinos,"" Fowlds says. ""When you see a creature like that fighting to survive, we realise we should get behind them and fight just as hard."" The story of rhino poaching is evolving – and extremely human, says US-based rhino conservation specialist Katie Lawton. The easiest comparison is narcotics or arms trafficking, Lawton says. A rhinoceros horn is more valuable by weight than gold, diamonds or cocaine. Wildlife crime is a big business. Subsistence poachers, driven by poverty and hunger, are paid to poach by commercial, syndicate organisations. Targeting the individual subsistence poachers doing the dirty work will not address the systemic framework of demand, Lawton says. It's easy for audiences from industrialised nations to see the issue of poaching from an unconsciously colonial lens and expect governments to solve the issue, Fowlds says. But the crisis here is deep-rooted, historical and socio-economic. ""The problem with endangered species like rhinos is that you don't have time to fix those long-game problems, because there will be no rhinos left by the time you have changed those socio-economic circumstances,"" Fowlds says. Is the rhino horn trade still legal today? Under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (Cites), global trade of rhino horns has been banned since 1977. However, countries like South Africa have overturned the ban to allow domestic trade, based on commercial rhino breeders' argument that legal trade would prevent poaching. ""Symbolically, Sudan made me think, 'I don't want it to get to that point,'"" Lawton says. ""And it won't, ever again."" Overall, rhino poaching rates have declined since 2018, when Sudan died. Trade data indicates the lowest annual estimate of rhino horns entering illegal trade markets since 2013. The combination of conservation and biological management initiatives resulted in a total of 6,487 black rhinos in all of Africa. There are now 16,803 white rhinos on Earth, all except two are southern white rhinos. The first viable IVF pregnancy in a southern white rhino has raised hope that these animals could be brought back from the brink.  ""That picture of Sudan encapsulates the relationship between the animal kingdom and mankind,"" says Pritchard. ""Perhaps the negative side, but also there's a positive relationship between man and rhinos that we should all be striving for. Ultimately, I see it as a positive picture."" ""Sharing these moments of the very special environment that our planet is blessed with is a motivation to keep venturing into the wonders of nature's wilds, showing the characters in it that make it worth experiencing and preserving,"" says Karumba. --  If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

Spread to UST,How invasion plunged Iraq into decades of chaos,2024-09-25,2023-03-20,By Jeremy Bowen,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-64976144,"The invasion of March 2003 was a catastrophe for Iraq and its people.  More proof of that, measured in broken lives, was at a suspected site of a mass grave in the desert outside Sinjar, not far from the border with Syria.  Survivors of one of Iraq's damaged communities, the Yazidis, looked on as the earth in a marble quarry was excavated. On a wire fence around the site were photos of dozens of people, mostly men, who had been killed by jihadists from the Islamic State group. They were from Zile-li, a village near the quarry, where 1,800 men were taken and killed on 3 August 2014.  The Yazidis revere both the Quran and the Bible; their religion is influenced by both Christianity and Islam. Islamic State considered them to be infidels and carried out a genocidal assault. It happened after the Americans and British had ended their occupation, but a direct line links the massacre to the invasion, and the disastrous years that followed.  Among those watching the excavation was Naif Jasso, the Sheikh of Kocho, a Yazidi community that suffered an even worse attack than Zile-li. He said that in Kocho, 517 people out of a population of 1,250 were killed by jihadists from IS, also known as ISIS or Daesh.  In Zile-li, men were separated from their families at gunpoint and shot dead at the quarry. Sofian Saleh, who was 16 at the time, was among the crowd at the excavation. He is one of only two men from Zile-li who survived. As he waited for death with his father, brother and 20 to 30 other men, he saw another group shot dead. Their bodies tumbled down a cliff into the quarry. Then it was their turn.  ""They tied our hands from behind before the shooting. They took us and threw us on the ground,"" he said.  Sofian's father and brother were killed, but he survived because bodies fell on him, covering him up.  Islamic State was using its favourite tactic. First, they killed the men, then took the women as slaves. Children were removed from their mothers to be indoctrinated as IS recruits. A mother sitting near the suspected grave wept as she remembered the baby ripped from her and given to a jihadist family.  Next to the wire fence around the site, Suad Daoud Chatto, a woman in her 20s, stood with a poster. On it were the faces of nine men from her extended family who were killed, and two missing female relatives. She said jihadists captured her in 2014 when she was 16, along with many other women and girls, and held her in Syria. She remained until 2019, when she was rescued as the Caliphate collapsed.  ""They were like barbarians, they kept us in handcuffs for a long time. Our hands were still tied even during the meals,"" she said. ""They married me off many times… they were marrying the slaves. They did not spare anyone. We were all raped. They were killing people before our eyes. They killed all the Yazidi men - they killed eight of my uncles. They destroyed many families."" In the end, only a few bags of human bones were found at the site. Dozens of others are still to excavated.  By the time IS rampaged through Iraq in the summer of 2014, the US and the UK had ended their occupation. Jihadist ideology existed long before the invasion, and had inspired the 9/11 attacks.  But far from destroying the ideology of Osama Bin Laden and the jihadist extremists, the years of chaos and brutality set off in 2003 turbo-charged murderous jihadist violence. Al-Qaeda, broken for a while by an alliance between the Americans and Sunni tribes, regenerated into the even more barbarous IS.  Iraq is more stable so far this year than it has been for a long while. Baghdad, Mosul and other cities are much safer. But Iraqis feel the results of the invasion every day. Its consequences have shaped and blighted millions of lives and changed their country profoundly.   It is a grim irony that the invasion has dropped out of political and public debate in the US, which conceived and led it, and in the UK, its closest ally in the coalition. The Americans and British bear a heavy responsibility for what happened after the invasion, and its consequences also affect them.  Iraq's tyrant, Saddam Hussein, was well worth overthrowing - he had imprisoned and killed thousands of Iraqis, even using chemical weapons against rebellious Kurds. The problem was how it was done, the way the US and UK ignored international law, and the violence that gripped Iraq after the Bush administration failed to make a plan to fill the power vacuum created by regime change.  The past 20 years since the invasion, coming on top of Saddam's dictatorship, add up to almost half a century of torture for the Iraqi people.   Even for those who were there, it is hard to recreate the febrile atmosphere of ""fear, power and hubris"", as one historian put it recently, that gripped the US in the 18 months between al-Qaeda's 9/11 attacks in 2001 and the invasion of Iraq.  I was in New York a few days after the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were destroyed, as F-15 jets patrolled above Manhattan. It was a visible demonstration of American force, as the biggest military power on the planet worked out how to respond.  The shock of the attacks swiftly produced George W Bush's declaration of ""war on terror"" against al-Qaeda and its jihadist fellow travellers. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair chartered Concorde to cross the Atlantic to offer support. He believed Britain's best guarantee of influence in the world was to stay close to the White House.  They moved fast against al-Qaeda's network in Afghanistan. Before the end of the year, a US-led coalition removed the Taliban regime from power when it refused to give up al-Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden. Kabul was not enough for America.  President Bush and his advisors saw a global threat to the US. They thought states that opposed them could make deadly alliances with al-Qaeda and its imitators. The biggest target in their sights was Iraq. Saddam Hussein had been a thorn in America's side ever since he sent his army into Kuwait in 1990. Without any evidence, the Americans tried to manufacture a link between Saddam and al-Qaeda when none existed. In reality the Iraqi leader, a secular dictator, saw religious extremists as a threat. The president's father, George HW Bush, decided not to remove Saddam from power in Baghdad after the Iraqi occupiers were driven out of Kuwait by an international coalition assembled by the US in 1991. The first President Bush and his advisors saw trouble ahead if they continued to Baghdad. A long, belligerent occupation of Iraq looked like a morass and they had no UN authorisation to topple the regime.  I was in Baghdad when the ceasefire was declared. Regime officials I knew could not believe that Saddam's dictatorship had survived.  Twelve years later, by 2003, America's rage and arrogance of power blinded the second President Bush to the realities that had constrained his father. When the US and UK could not persuade the UN Security Council to pass a resolution explicitly authorising invasion and regime change, Messrs Bush and Blair claimed earlier resolutions gave them the authority they needed.  Among many who did not buy their argument was the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In a BBC interview 18 months after the invasion, he said it was ""not in conformity"" with the UN Charter - in other words, illegal. France and other Nato allies refused to join the invasion. Tony Blair ignored huge protests in the UK. His decision to go to war dogged the rest of his political career.  No president or prime minister faces a bigger decision than going to war. George Bush and Tony Blair embarked on a war of choice that killed hundreds of thousands of people. The justifications for the invasion were soon shown to be untrue. The weapons of mass destruction that Tony Blair insisted, eloquently, made Saddam a clear and present danger, turned out not to exist. It was a failure not just of intelligence but of leadership.   The Americans called the huge air raids that started their offensive ""shock and awe"". Neo-conservatives around George W Bush deluded themselves that democracy, and regional stability, could be imposed through the barrel of a gun. Overwhelming US force would not just safeguard America, it would stabilise the Middle East too, and democracy would spread through Syria, Iran and beyond, like a good virus.   Saddam was removed within weeks. Iraqis were in no mood to be grateful. In Saddam's last decade as leader, the vast majority of them had been impoverished by sanctions authorised by the UN, but driven hardest by the US and UK. The Americans, the British and their allies were unable to bring peace to the streets. Nightmarish years started with wholesale looting, revenge attacks and crime.  An insurgency against the occupation turned into a sectarian civil war. Iraqis turned against each other as the Americans imposed a system of government that split power along ethnic and sectarian lines - between the country's three main groups, Shia Muslims, Kurds and Sunni Muslims. Armed militias fought each other, the occupiers, and killed each other's civilians.  Jihadist groups moved in to exploit the chaos and kill foreigners. Before the Americans managed to kill him, a brutal Sunni extremist from Jordan, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, targeted attacks to turn the insurgency against the occupation into a sectarian civil war. Shia death squads retaliated with their own reign of terror.  No-one knows exactly how many Iraqis have died as a result of the 2003 invasion. Estimates are all in the hundreds of thousands. The tide of violent sectarianism continues to rumble around the Middle East.  The geopolitical legacy of the invasion is still shaping events. Unwittingly, the Americans turned the balance of power in Iraq in Iran's favour by overthrowing Saddam Hussein, who was considered a Sunni bulwark against the Islamic Republic. Removing him empowered Shia politicians who were close to Tehran. Militias armed and trained by Iran are among the most powerful forces in Iraq and have representatives in government.  The US and UK's fear of causing another disaster hamstrung their response to the Arab uprisings of 2011, and especially the war against his own people launched by President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.  Disorder in Iraq, where the population is growing fast, fuels the trade in people-smuggling to Europe. According to the British Home Office, Iraqis are the fourth largest national group crossing the English Channel in small boats. The UK Refugee Council says the vast majority whose cases have been processed are granted asylum as refugees.  American and British leaders do not dwell on the invasion these days, but others have not forgotten. One reason why much of the global south stayed neutral after Russia invaded Ukraine, ignoring appeals to uphold international law, was the memory of how the US, the UK and Western allies who joined the coalition ignored it as they steamrollered opposition to their invasion of Iraq.   It is a sign of how bad the past 20 years have been that Saddam nostalgia is well established in Iraq, not just among his own Sunni community. People complain that at least you knew where you were with the old dictator. He was an equal opportunities killer of anyone he saw as an enemy, including his own son-in-law.  In a queue for diesel in a camp near Mosul, a 48-year-old Sunni named Mohammed, raged against the Shia-led government in Baghdad and against the years of sectarian killing that followed the invasion.  ""We wish that Saddam's rule could come back, even for one day. Saddam was a dictator, and it was one man's rule - correct. But he was not killing the people based on whether they were Shia, Sunni, Kurdish, or Yazidi.""  Iraq has signs of hope. Parts of towns and villages are still in ruins, but they feel safer, even though Iraqis still face threats that would be considered a national crisis in the West. Well-trained anti-terrorist units are containing IS jihadist cells, who still manage to carry out bombings and ambushes. Even so, shopkeepers are hoping for a bumper Ramadan, their busiest time of the year.  Longer term, the biggest legacy of the invasion for Iraq might be the political system that the Americans instigated, which divides power along ethnic and sectarian lines. As developed by Iraqi politicians, it has offered prodigious chances for corruption.   Estimates of the amount stolen since 2003 range from $150bn (£124bn) to $320bn (£264bn). Most Iraqis, of all sects, who have not benefited from the bonanza of theft, face constant power cuts, bad water, and inadequate medical care, in hospitals that were once considered to be as good as ones in Europe. Walk down most streets and you will see children working or begging, instead of going to school. Iraq used to have one of the best educational systems in the Middle East. Iraq's latest prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, has promised a new start. His biggest challenge is keeping his promise to tackle corruption, the cancer that is eating the country from within. He even did a broadcast surrounded by piles of confiscated banknotes that were being returned to Iraq's treasury.  But the people that matter most are the innocent victims. Not just the dead, but millions of Iraqis, and others in the Middle East whose lives were made much worse because of the invasion and its consequences.  At the mass grave near Sinjar, Yazidi activists appealed for international protection. Survivors said that the IS jihadists who carried out the genocidal massacres in 2014 had Iraqi accents, some from Tel Afar, a nearby town.  Farhad Barakat, a 25-year-old Yazidi activist who survived because he managed to escape to Mount Sinjar, said they were still scared of their neighbours. The killers, he said, were from their ""surrounding clans or tribes, Arab clans. So how it that possible? The ones who killed us, raped the Yazidi women, they were Iraqis.""

Spread to UST,Who can I meet and where? Your questions answered,2024-09-25,2020-05-29,By Claire Diamond,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-52809580,"With Scotland introducing the first phase of its lockdown easing strategy on Friday, more than 1,300 of you have sent in questions about how the new rules will work. Here are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions.  In phase one, the guidance says you are allowed to meet members of one other household at a time - so you can meet different people on different days.  While this will not be the law, the Scottish government strongly recommends you don't meet with more than one other household per day. You should keep meetings to a maximum of eight people, and members of different households should stay two metres apart at all times - so no hugs. It needs to be outdoors and people should not go into someone else's house - although you are allowed to meet in private gardens as well as public spaces like parks.  You should avoid touching the same surfaces - these could act as a ""bridge"" for the virus to transmit between households. For example, if you are having a picnic each household should bring its own food and crockery. Yes, this is the only exception to the rule that you should not enter someone else's house.  It would be permitted according to the guidance. It says: ""If you must go through a house to access a garden, do that quickly and without touching surfaces"". While it's OK for one other household to meet you outside - for example in your garden - per day, they should not come into your house, and they should ""avoid using shared facilities such as bathrooms"".  This is because the risk of spreading the virus is higher inside, and it could be transmitted by or to you when you touch surfaces.  There is no legal limit on how far you can travel to meet another household, but you are encouraged to stay local - the Scottish government suggests that about five miles from your home is what it would consider local. It's down to you if you choose to travel further. The reason you are asked to stay close to home is because the further you travel the more likely that you'll need to go to the bathroom. The guidance warns against this, as you ""risk leaving the virus"" behind in the house.   Yes, when you meet up with another household then young children need stay two metres away from people from the other household at all times.  They could pick up the virus from or spread it to the other household, just like an adult could. Similarly you should not allow children to share toys with those outside their household as surfaces can act as a bridge to transmit the virus between the two households. You can now travel short distances for non-contact outdoor leisure activities including golf, tennis, bowls and fishing.  However, you should remain in your local area. The Scottish government suggest that within five miles of your home would be what they consider local. You wouldn't be breaking the law if you travelled further, it's really a question of judgement.  The first minister acknowledged that this was a ""particularly difficult"" issue, and said her government are ""specifically"" looking at providing an answer.  She cannot provide a date at the moment, but hopes to be able to address the situation in the ""not too distant future"". For now, she implores people to live as ""sensibly and safely as possible"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""The Scottish government wants to see if guidance can be modified soon but for now the safest advice for people in different households, whatever the relationship is, is to follow physical distancing to avoid the virus easily spreading between different households."" Looking at the route map gives some indication of how much interaction will be allowed in each phase.  In stage two, you will be allowed into someone else's house, but the guidance says you should still stay two metres apart.  It is not until phase four that the guidelines don't recommend physical distancing from those you don't live in the same house as. In phase one, you should continue to work from home wherever possible and it is not recommended that grandparents look after their grandchildren.  Grandparents tend to be older and are therefore particularly vulnerable to becoming seriously ill with coronavirus.  From next Wednesday, child minding services and outdoor nurseries will be able to reopen.  Not in phase one. During this phase, the Scottish government's guidelines say only ""preparation"" will take place for the ""safe reopening of the housing market"".  They acknowledge it's ""difficult and frustrating"" for anyone stuck mid-process, but say it won't be until phase two that it is anticipated there will be a relaxation of restrictions on moving.  Places of worship will not be reopening in phase one. It's not until phase two that places of worship will be allowed to open, and even then it will only be for private prayer with physical distancing.  In phase three, places of worship can open to extended groups but you will still need to stay two metres apart from other worshippers.  How long we will spend in each phase is not clear - there are a lot of moving parts that can impact how quickly we can move from one phase to another.  So although the restrictions will be reviewed every three weeks a single phase may span more than one review period - some could be lifted earlier than planned but some could be lifted later. What can happen in each place of worship during each phase will depend on a number of factors - including the size and layout, the size of the congregation and what rituals each faith wants to carry out.   It's very difficult to say at this stage what will be safe in October. A lot will depend on the individual characteristics of ceremony and reception venues and how many people they can safely accommodate.  No marriage ceremonies will be allowed to take place in phase one.  But in phase two, ceremonies will be allowed to take place again but the number of attendees will be limited.  It's not until phase three that restrictions will be relaxed to beyond close family.  How long we will spend in each phase is not clear - there are a lot of moving parts that can impact how quickly we can move from one phase to another.  So although the restrictions will be reviewed every three weeks a single phase may span more than one review period - some could be lifted earlier than planned but some could be lifted later.

Spread to UST,"'We are living, breathing art'",2024-09-25,2022-02-01,By Rachael McMenemy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-60161722,"Coming out of season one of RuPaul's Drag Race UK Cheryl Hole was ready to turn up the heat on her career. Then ""Miss Pandemica hit"" and she went from performing in clubs to having to stream online from her living room. Looking back she says lockdown encouraged her to push boundaries.  In RuPaul's Drag Race UK vs The World, part of BBC Three's line-up on the night the channel returns to TV on Tuesday, Cheryl and other UK queens Blu Hydrangea and Baga Chipz compete with artistes from shows around the world - everywhere from the USA to Thailand.  As true Drag Race fans know there's more to the artform than runway looks, lip-sync battles and a proper tuck, with Cheryl saying drag really is everywhere  - if you are paying attention. After season one, Cheryl was ready to show how much she'd grown as an artist.  ""I was just so excited to get out there. I'm a hustler through and through. I think that's true of every Essex person, we're a grafter, we get things done,"" she said. As Covid spread and lockdown happened, Cheryl was not going to let all that hard work go to waste - no clubs, no problem.  She said: ""I was just ready to tour and perform because that's where my heart is and then of course Miss Pandemica comes in and we're locked inside our houses.  ""So what do I do? I start doing digital shows from my living room."" ""It was a very strange experience, obviously we're so used to applause and smiley faces and interactions and suddenly you're performing to a green dot and you've got a comment feed of people being like 'yes that was amazing' so that was some adjusting."" The lack of audience ""took the pressure off"" and gave her the confidence to try new material.  ""Now, as an artist, if the crowd isn't feeling something, then I turn it up, I amp up what I'm doing. It felt very free to just perform how you wanted."" ""I was lucky we had that time locked up in a house,"" she said. ""It was unfortunate circumstances but, as a creative, it really pushed me to try different things, to go explore different avenues and I think if I didn't have that I still would have been stuck in a box of things I thought I could only do. ""I'm pushing boundaries."" However, as freeing and fun as digital shows might have been she was only ""doing drag from the waist up"", and there's nothing like being back in front of a crowd.  ""It was so much fun to see people again!"" And now she's ready to show the world Cheryl 2.0, represent Essex and put on a performance that shows drag as a true artform.  She said: ""Drag is one of those artforms that people don't realise they've had their entire lives; from pantomime dames to Lily Savage on your Saturday night TV and Dame Edna Everage.  ""I think shows like Drag Race have put drag on the 'mainstream' platform. It's become visible again and it's become a viable art form, whereas people would have just put it to the side to pubs and clubs."" After nearly 10 years of drag, Cheryl said she is ""honoured"" to part of UK drag's evolution and journey.  ""At the end of the day we are just artists, putting our craft out to the world, no different from an artist in the Louvre painting or a sculpture at the Tate Modern.  ""We are living, breathing art that is there to enjoy and obviously we love people to watch - so come and enjoy the show."" Cheryl wants to show the world what Essex is all about and says she's ready to win the Race. She said: ""When I got that call to come back for round two, the remix, I was so excited because there's been so much growth and evolution in my drag since the first show that I was so ready to show Cheryl 2.0 and that I wasn't so mediocre anymore."" Realising this was a truly international competition with queens from all over the world taking part, Cheryl said she knew she had to bring her A game.  ""I knew I had to represent my Essex to the best and show the absolute glamour we have to bring.  ""I'm just glad I've had two years to step up my wardrobe and show people the fully fledged Essex glamour."" But there's more to the show than individual queens and Cheryl says the opportunity to see culturally-different approaches to drag was ""fascinating"".  ""It was so incredible learning from all these different people because the way that people approach drag in Thailand versus Holland versus Canada it's just fascinating, especially in the times that we've been through,"" she said. Cheryl promises it will ""blow your minds because there is so much talent, so much drama and so many popcorn moments that you are just going to be on the edge of your seat every single Tuesday without fail.""

Captain Tom Moore's eldest daughter Lucy Teixeira watched from her home in Berkshire as his target of £1,000 for walking 100 laps of his garden grew. She said visiting him was ""100% the first thing"" she would do when lockdown restrictions were lifted. ""I am just lucky in that I have been able to see him on TV,"" she said. Capt Tom completed 100 laps of the 25-metre (82ft) loop in his garden in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, well before the deadline of his 100th birthday on 30 April and raised millions for NHS Charities Together. Ms Teixeira, 51, who lives in Reading, normally visits him every month and said it has been difficult not being able to, especially with his 100th birthday coming up. ""It's very painful not to be with him at the moment,"" the mother of two said. ""But I want to compliment team Tom as my sister and her family have done a sterling job supporting him through this. ""I am one of those families who can't be with someone and I feel their pain as well, but at least I've seen film crews talking to him. ""I have already sent him his birthday card - ahead of the millions he'll probably get - but on the day we'll probably watch it on TV."" Ms Teixeira said her father's efforts were ""typically him"" and ""he never sits still"". ""How many 99-year-olds order a running machine? That raised a few eyebrows when it arrived,"" she said. ""But he wanted to improve his ability to walk in the winter because he knew he'd be sitting around more. ""It's amazing what my little old dad has done and captured everybody's hearts and minds with the result of supporting the NHS at this most critical time.

Spread to UST,How Captain Tom became nation's 'beacon of light',2024-09-25,2020-06-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-53178431,"A lot has happened since Britain went into lockdown 100 days ago, but one man was labelled ""a beacon of light through the fog of coronavirus"".  The pandemic has changed everyone's lives, some tragically, but those are the words of Prime Minister Boris Johnson when fundraiser and veteran Captain Tom Moore was awarded a knighthood. Capt Tom started his momentous fundraising effort back in early April when he pledged to complete the 2.5km (1.6 miles), 100-lap garden challenge at his home in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire by his 100th birthday on 30 April.  Fundraising for NHS Charities Together, the then 99-year-old said he was doing it ""for the sake of the nurses and the NHS"". Born in Keighley, Yorkshire, and a veteran of World War Two, Capt Tom was inspired after receiving treatment for skin cancer and a broken hip after a fall in 2018. Capt Tom's efforts soon reached the eyes and ears of a nation shorn of positive news as the death toll of the coronavirus pandemic increased throughout April. TV appearances followed and by the middle of the month he had teamed up with Michael Ball to release a fundraising cover of You'll Never Walk Alone. ""Every penny that we get, they [the NHS] deserve,"" he said, as the total exceeded £5m. By 17 April, it had topped £17m as he completed his 100 laps ahead of schedule, declaring: ""I never dreamt I would be involved in such an occasion as this."" Tom-mania was sweeping the nation. Garage murals, patchwork collages, knitted dolls and balloon models were just some of the ways people paid tribute. Artist Adam Salisbury said Capt Tom's incredible story had been ""the only thing that's made me feel alive and good about myself"" during the lockdown. And Rick Minns painted his tribute on the mud-covered van he uses as a canvas before declaring: ""Captain Tom has become the captain of all of us."" On 30 April, Capt Tom celebrated his 100th birthday - and what a day. With his fundraising efforts passing £32m, he was honoured with an RAF flypast and a birthday greeting from the Queen. As if that was not enough, Capt Tom become Colonel Tom, while he was flooded with hundreds of thousands of birthday cards and tributes ranging from a commemorative postbox, the Freedom of the City of London and becoming an honorary England cricketer. Capt Tom closed his fundraising page soon afterwards, with the final total an astounding £32,794,701. The money has started to be used to help comfort and care for NHS workers through the turbulent times, such as by creating spaces to relax, snacks for staff and pop-up shops. His efforts inspired many others, including former nurse Joan Rich who set out to complete 102 laps of her local park before her 102nd birthday. Tony Hudgell, a five-year-old boy who had to have both legs amputated as a result of neglect by his birth parents, was also captivated by Capt Tom. His adoptive father Mark said: ""Tony saw Capt Tom on the television walking with his walking frame and at that time it was the type of frame Tony was using.  ""He looked at it and said 'I can do that'."" Using prosthetics, Tony took up a 10km walking challenge to fundraise for the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which saved his life. He has raised more than £1m, having been first inspired by someone he ""kept wanting to watch on YouTube"". ""Captain Tom is one of his heroes now,"" said Mr Hudgell. The inevitable knighthood followed, with Capt Tom declaring himself ""delighted and overawed"". After completing his 100 laps, he had a message for the British public in the midst of the pandemic. ""To all those people who are finding it difficult at the moment... the sun will shine on you again, and the clouds will go away."" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Spread to UST,Hattie the Fatty hungry for a home,2024-09-25,2018-09-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-45691914,"An obese dog once said to be Britain's largest has halved her weight and is looking for a home. Hattie made headlines around the world after she was taken in by Gables Farm Dogs and Cats Home in Plymouth, Devon, earlier this year.  Nicknamed ""Hattie the Fatty"", the plump pooch weighed almost 40kg (6st) when she was rescued by the RSPCA. The hefty hound, who had been living on a diet of hamburgers, has now slimmed to 23kg (3st). Manager Ruth Rickard said she recalled mistaking the portly pup for a ""pot-bellied pig"" when she first arrived. Staff put the colossal canine on a strict regime of diet and exercise to help her lose the weight safely. The charity also set up a fundraising campaign to help cover her vet bills, including cataracts surgery, medicine and a possible ""tummy tuck"" to rid her of any excess skin.  Eight-year-old Hattie's story spread far and wide and as a result the centre smashed its fundraising target by 338%.  The charity said the leftover money would go towards any new owner's future vet bills. ""We'll be able to fund all her diabetic treatment for the rest of her life now because we were able to raise so much money,"" Ms Rickard said."
Spread to UST,Johnson: Send children to school on Monday,2024-09-25,2021-01-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-55521580,"Parents should send children to primary school on Monday if they are open, the prime minister has said, responding to concerns over rising Covid-19 cases. Boris Johnson said there was ""no doubt in my mind that schools are safe"" but did not rule out further closures. Several councils have written to the education secretary asking for schools in their area to be told to stay shut, following closures in London. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""inevitable"" more schools will shut. Mr Johnson told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show the risk to children was ""very, very low"" and the benefit of education was ""so huge"". The prime minister also indicated that tougher regional measures may be required in parts of the country in the coming weeks to curb rising infections.  The two-week school closures in London and south-east England were ""exceptional"" due to the fast-spreading new variant of Covid-19, he said. Most primary schools in England are expected to open on Monday. However, unions are telling primary school staff it is unsafe to return to work and are calling for remote learning to be introduced across all primaries. A growing number of councils in England are calling on the government to delay the reopening of primary schools, with local authorities in Wolverhampton, Cumbria and Kent asking for a delay to the start of term on Monday. Brighton and Hove Council has advised primary schools to stay closed meaning Gemma Cocker's five-year-old son Charlie will not be going to school while her daughter Lyla, who is four, may still be able to go to nursery. Gemma and her husband have been working from home since March, but now they will once again have to add childcare to the mix. ""We'll try to home-school him,"" she said of Charlie. ""He regressed a little bit last time, he's young in the year."" Mrs Cocker, 36, added: ""The whole thing is ridiculous, can a decision just be made? At a time when many parents are returning to work next week, to have this uncertainty is adding to already stressed out families.  ""Morally, I think they should close, but practically, no. It's a hard one."" Read more here. Mr Johnson said that while school closures would be kept ""under constant review"", the government would be ""driven by public health considerations and by the massive importance of education"". ""And if you think about the history of the pandemic, we've kept schools going for a long, long time in areas where the pandemic has really been at really high levels,"" he said. Sir Keir said tighter measures needed to be introduced nationally in the next 24 hours and criticised the PM for ""hinting"" at further restrictions coming into force. The Labour leader said he did not want to ""add to the chaos"" that would be caused by schools closing on Monday, but said it was ""inevitable"" more would have to shut.  ""The government needs to plan for children's learning but also for working parents,"" Sir Keir added. On Friday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced that all of London's primaries would remain shut to most pupils, after pressure from local councils to reverse an earlier decision to keep only schools in certain boroughs closed.  Mr Johnson said his message to councils and schools was to be ""guided by the public health advice"" which at the moment is ""that schools are safe in those areas where we're not being driven by the new variant to close them"". But he said ""we've got to be humble in the face of the impact of this new variant of the virus"" and warned there would be ""a very difficult few weeks and months"" until the vaccine comes into effect. Keeping schools open for all pupils has been one of the red lines ever since the first national lockdown. All the evidence so far suggests primary school children have one of the lowest levels of infection when it comes to symptomatic cases.  If you include asymptomatic infection the picture changes, but the evidence suggests such cases are less likely to lead to onward spread. And, of course, the risk of serious illness in this group is pretty rare.  The rise of the new variant has increased cases generally, although Public Health England says there is still no evidence yet that this new variant transmits more in children than other variants. There is understandable concern about teachers. Research by the Office for National Statistics suggests they have been at no greater risk of infection than other professions working outside the home. The new variant could, of course, change this, which is why the unions are concerned. The prime minister admitted the tier system in England may need to get tougher and ""clearly school closures which we had to do in March is one of those things"" but added it was ""not necessarily something we want to do"". Asked whether exams should be cancelled, Mr Johnson did not answer directly but said ""we've got to be realistic"" about the pace at which the new variant was spreading and its impact on the NHS. The National Education Union has advised its members it is not safe to work in primary schools and said all schools should remain closed for a further two weeks, while other major teaching unions have called for a period of remote learning while safety measures are put in place.  In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has asked for the Scottish Parliament to be recalled so she can make an ""urgent statement"", with her deputy John Swinney tweeting that ministers would meet ""to consider the current advice in relation to schools and early learning"".  Head teachers in Wales as well as England have begun legal action to force ministers to reveal data behind the decision for some schools to reopen - which the Department for Education said is based on new infections and pressure on the NHS in local areas. Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England, called for teachers to be vaccinated ""as a priority"", as she said that any school closure should be for ""the absolute minimum of time and that time must be used very well"". Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said ""children's lives can't just be put on hold"", echoing the point that school closures should be kept to an ""absolute minimum"". Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said the government's ""top-down"" and ""blanket"" approach to schools reopening should be changed to allow head teachers to make decisions based on local public health advice. Most primary schools in England will return on 4 January, but in London and some surrounding areas they will not open for most pupils until 18 January. Secondary schools in England will stagger their return with pupils taking exams in 2021 starting on 11 January, and other year groups returning in person on 18 January.   In Wales, local councils have been told they can be ""flexible"" with when they open - with many schools aiming to return for face-to-face lessons from 11 January.  In Northern Ireland, primary school pupils will be taught online until 11 January. In secondary schools, years 8 to 11 will be taught online throughout January. Years 12 to 14 will return to school after the first week of January.  In Scotland, the Christmas holidays have been extended to 11 January, and the following week will be online learning only. A full return to face-to-face learning is planned for 18 January but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned measures may have to go further with a cabinet meeting to be held on Monday.

Spread to UST,After Veganuary comes Februdairy,2024-09-25,2018-02-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-42990941,"The dairy industry has launched a campaign to try to promote cow products in the UK.  Februdairy was launched by an ex-vegan animal scientist in response to the Veganuary campaign. This is the first year it has run, and at the moment consists mostly of a hashtag campaign on social media and a Twitter account with 1,700 followers. The campaign is also attempting a viral challenge where people drink a pint of milk and then nominate their friends. ""There's been a lot of bad press around the dairy and meat industry,"" says Abi, a supporter of the Februdairy campaign who works for an agricultural supplier in Sussex. ""People tend to read things online and generalise farmers into the idea that they all run farms in an intensive factory way."" For her, the movement is needed to ""make people see that there is so much propaganda."" The 26-year-old argues that social media has led to the spread of misinformation about sustainable, local farming practises.  ""There's a big myth that every single male-born calf is shot at birth. Some are - a lot aren't,"" she says. Abi's partner runs a farm in Sussex which takes on male calves that can't be used for milk. ""They are reared for beef. They stay on until they are about two."" Abi says she has had some abuse online when she tweets about the campaign, but wants to get a clear message out on behalf of the industry. ""Obviously, vegans are on the rise, which nobody has any problems with,"" she says. ""It's the fact that they come out in force to slate farmers, using this false propaganda. ""It's essential that farmers have that voice now more than ever."" Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here"

For the first time, all teams in the tournament are offering some form of contract to the majority of their players. After last year's World Cup was played a year late because of Covid-19, the 2025 tournament in England already feels close and a new cycle has brought change for many teams. Here is everything you need to know about each side before the Women's Six Nations begins on Saturday. Last year: 1st, Grand Slam England are chasing a fifth straight Championship title and have not lost a Women's Six Nations match since France beat them in 2018. They arrive in this year's tournament with the wound of a narrow World Cup final defeat by New Zealand still fresh. A new era is around the corner, with record caps holder and captain Sarah Hunter retiring after Saturday's opener against Scotland and head coach Simon Middleton stepping down at the end of the tournament. A new face will have to come in at fly-half too as Zoe Harrison is out for the rest of the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament and Helena Rowland is still recovering from a foot injury sustained in England's World Cup campaign. Holly Aitchison - previously a centre for England - is expected to take the reins. England have been professional since 2019 and flanker Alex Matthews says they want to ""grow the gap"" with other teams now that contracts are becoming widespread. France will be the Red Roses' toughest opponents and their encounter at Twickenham - for which 35,000 tickets have already been sold - takes place on 29 April and is likely to be the tournament decider. Lock Zoe Aldcroft said England ""have to get over"" their heartbreaking World Cup defeat ""to be able to move forward"". ""The new girls coming in have brought a really positive vibe,"" added Aldcroft. ""We're on the next journey now. We can't dwell on anything that happened before. It's all about going forward to 2025."" England captain Hunter announces retirement How to follow the Women's Six Nations on the BBC Wales v Ireland will be on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and England v Scotland will be on 5 Live Lat year: 2nd France's task will be, once again, to stop the England machine rumbling to another title. Les Bleues narrowly missed out on a World Cup final last year and have had a shake-up since. New coaches Gaelle Mignot and David Ortiz have come in. Star scrum-half Laure Sansus has retired and fly-half Caroline Drouin is focusing on sevens. France great Jessy Tremouliere will retire from international rugby at the end of the tournament and new captain Audrey Forlani said ""we're going to make sure she finishes on a high"". Last year: 3rd Expectations are higher for Wales as they enter their second year of having professional contracts, with 25 full-time players this year. Wales are likely to once again be in the battle for third place, with the gap to England and France not yet narrowed. That battle has increased importance this year because World Rugby have launched a new global women's competition called WXV. That competition will have three tiers and the top three teams in the Six Nations will compete in the top tier of WXV. Wales captain Hannah Jones denied that contracts brought pressure to perform, but said the extra time professionalism brings has had a big impact. ""You've got time to eat, time to recover, time to pick up those conversations with coaches that you probably would have had to leave,"" she added. How Hunter's record-breaking career grew the game Listen to Rugby Union Weekly's Sarah Hunter special Last year: 4th Ireland have also joined the contracts party, but not all players took the union up on them. That may have been due to the level of pay and the fact that you have to play in Ireland rather than, for example, in England's more competitive Premier 15s league. A new World Cup cycle is a fresh start after Ireland failed to qualify for the 2022 tournament - but the side will be missing several players who are with the sevens side as they bid for Olympic qualification. Captain Nichola Fryday wants more than last year's fourth-place finish She said: ""We want to keep building and getting that WXV qualification will be key for us. ""We've got a core group of experienced players that have been there the last few years. We're in a better place than last year."" Last year: 5th Italy have a new coach in Giovanni Ranieri, while former captain Manuela Furlan has retired. The Azzurre reached the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time last year and are also looking to build on increased investment from their union. They have the toughest possible Six Nations start in France and England, something forward Silvia Turani jokeed will be ""a nice warm-up"". Last year: 6th Last year was the year Scotland came close. So close that they earned losing bonus points against Wales, Italy and Ireland, but a lack of wins still left them bottom of the pile. Captain Rachel Malcolm says they have had increased sports psychology support as they look to turn last-gasp defeats into victory. ""Close isn't good enough for us anymore,"" she said. ""We need to find a way to turn those results so we're on the right side of them."" Malcolm also suggested her team will produce something new in attack, with Chris Laidlaw joining as attack coach. ""Hopefully you'll see a slightly more exciting attack looking to move the ball a bit more and spread it a bit wider and manipulate defences a bit more,"" added Malcolm.

""We're standing more council candidates than we ever have before, we're standing in every council across Wales."" The Green Party won just 1.2% of the vote - 12,441 votes - in the last council elections in 2017, but enough to gain one council seat in Powys. At last year's Senedd election the party gained its highest ever vote share in a Cardiff Bay election, but it was not enough to win a seat.  Despite losing 0.7% of its vote at constituency level, it increased its regional vote share by 1.4%, with 48,714 votes. ""Our ambition is building on our best ever Senedd result last year to get that breakthrough and get Greens elected on councils across Wales,"" said Mr Slaughter. ""I'm confident it will be double figures and I'm also confident it'll be quite evenly spread across Wales."" This year the party has come to an agreement with Plaid Cymru in Cardiff to field candidates representing both parties - standing as ""Common Ground Alliance"" candidates. Mr Slaughter said the arrangement is ""very specific"" to the capital.  ""We're standing together as one party in Cardiff to deliver that change that Cardiff really needs. But I must stress it is just in Cardiff.""  ""People appreciate parties working together and I'm hopeful that it's the start of more cooperation at different levels, not necessarily at this extreme level, but at different levels across Wales.""  Councillors will be elected in each of the 22 local authorities in Wales next month. There are also elections in parts of England, in Scotland and Northern Ireland."
Spread to UST,Internet-famous cat Lil Bub dies,2024-09-25,2019-12-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50638540,"Lil Bub, one of the internet's most famous cats, has died aged eight. The cat's owner, Mike Bridavsky, announced her death to millions of followers on social media on Monday. Lil Bub was best known for her unusual appearance - bulbous eyes and a protruding tongue. She was rescued as a feral kitten and was born with several disorders, including dwarfism.  Mr Bridavsky said she helped raise more than $700,000 (£540,000) for animal charities during her lifetime. ""Bub has made a huge difference in the world of animal welfare, and in the lives of millions of people worldwide,"" a post on Instagram said. Lil Bub found online fame because of her unique appearance. Her feline dwarfism meant she stayed kitten-sized throughout her life.  She was also polydactyl, with an extra toe on each paw, and had an underdeveloped jaw and no teeth which caused her tongue to always hang out.  Mr Bridavsky originally adopted Lil Bub as the ""runt"" of a litter of kittens found by a friend inside a tool-shed in Indiana. In an interview, he described her ""one of nature's happiest accidents"" and insisted she lived a happy, healthy life despite her various health issues.  He created a Tumblr blog for the cat in 2011 and she went viral after photographs of her ended up on the front page of discussion website Reddit.  The attention led to news articles about her and invitations to appear on US television programmes.  Lil Bub went on to gain endorsement deals, merchandise lines and even her own YouTube show and documentary series.  Her owner used her fame to raise money for charity, including help for other cats with special needs through the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Before her death, Lil Bub had been suffering from a bone infection which her owner had been sharing updates about to her 2.4m Instagram followers.  Mr Bridavsky announced on Monday that she had unexpectedly died in her sleep on Sunday morning.  The owner said his cat had ""spread a message of determination, positivity, and perseverance to people all over the world"" during her life.  Tens of thousands of people have commented and shared the online posts announcing the cat's death.  Among those responding on Facebook - where she had more than three million followers - were people who work for animal charities which have benefited from the funds raised by Lil Bub's owner in his cat's name.

Spread to UST,Biden expands border wall - but can it stop crossings?,2024-09-25,2023-10-06,By Bernd Debusmann Jr,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67024002,"At first glance, Starr County in Texas is a quiet place.  Its gently rolling hills are blanketed with low-growing mesquite and shrubs intersected by small gullies and streams, and many of its small, sleepy towns seem plucked from old Westerns.  But the US border with Mexico is never far off. On peaceful days in towns like Roma, residents and visitors can clearly hear loud chatting, children playing or roosters crowing across the Rio Grande.  For decades, the county's environment, proximity to the river and access to highways have made it a busy crossing point for migrants - and now, a focus of the heated debate over border security in the US.  On Wednesday, the Biden administration announced it would build an approximately 20-mile (32km) section of border wall in the area, an announcement that stood in stark contrast to then-candidate Joe Biden's 2020 declaration that he would not build ""another foot of wall"" as president. He halted construction on his first day in office.  While President Biden and administration officials have claimed that the new border wall section is being built begrudgingly - because of funds specifically appropriated by the Donald Trump administration in 2019 - the announcement has once again sparked intense debate over the controversial border control measure that was once a signature policy of then-president Trump.  In total, the former president ordered renovations and fortification of just under 460 miles (740km) of border wall, although only about 50 miles (80km) were new. Since he left office, Mr Trump and some Republican lawmakers have called for additional border barriers to be built amid rising migrant figures at the southern border.  Whether or not border walls can be effective has become a hotly contested and intensely political debate. While Department of Homeland Security data released in late 2020 suggests that new walls reduced illegal entry in some sectors by nearly 90%, academic studies have suggested more modest returns.  One analysis of data from the Cato Institute, for example, found Border Patrol saw more detentions and successful illegal crossings even before the Trump administration ended, suggesting the wall was ultimately unsuccessful.  A third study, published in the  American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, found that border barriers reduced migration by 35%. However, the study found no data to suggest that the barriers are more effective than using the funding to hire more border agents.  The Biden administration, for its part, has repeatedly and unequivocally said it does not believe the barriers are effective.  Doris Meissner, the former commissioner of the now-defunct US Immigration and Naturalization Service, told the BBC that the barriers can be effective are ""redirecting"" flows of migrants to more easily patrolled areas  ""The idea of having a barrier there [Starr County] is that the Border Patrol's agents and vehicles don't need to be spread out over huge distances, but distances where people are crossing,"" said Ms Meissner, now a senior fellow at the Washington DC-based Migration Policy Institute. ""That seems to be what they're thinking about with this proposal.""  The term ""wall"" itself is a misnomer. On its website, Customs and Border Patrol describes the border barrier as including everything from picket fences to concrete and steel levees and, in places, ""Normandy barriers"" - large metal barricades solely designed to stop vehicle intrusions, but passable for people on foot.  According to CBP, the new wall construction will consist of 18-foot (5.4m) steel fence panels placed in portable concrete barriers, bolstered by ""detection technology"" and lighting.  Experts note that even sectors with tall, solid barriers are by no means impenetrable. Migrants often find ways to climb the barriers using ladders or ropes or cut and climb through them.  ""It's really just more of a speed bump. It'll probably just take another few minutes to get into the US,"" said Adam Isacson, a researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America.  ""This is not at all an insurmountable barrier. It's harder to get kids over, or the old or disabled, and a lot more people die or are badly injured falling from it. But it does not seem to deter people"".  Walls, Mr Isaacson added, are also ""irrelevant if your goal is to turn yourself in"" and formally seek asylum - which in recent months has constituted a ""significant majority"" of the total number of migrant detentions. Once across the international boundary, asylum seekers are legally permitted to challenge deportation.  Along the border - where communities are long used to being at the frontlines of the immigration debate - news of the border extension has elicited mixed feelings.  Several residents of border towns told the BBC that while they want a strong border they are opposed to a wall, or that they are open to the idea but are concerned about how it is implemented. One of them, Eagle Pass activist Jessie Fuentes, said that he ""fought hard"" against previous border wall construction efforts, but ultimately felt that the barriers were ""well engineered"" and ""set up strategically"".  ""Fences serve a purpose,"" he said. ""If it's going to help CBP control or set up a route where migrants can find shelter or relief, then that's a good thing....but it shouldn't make people think we're walling off everything. It's a tough one."" Alex Garcia, a resident of Webb County - which neighbours Starr County - said that he ""understands"" the need for a barrier but is worried for the environmental impact and the fact that migrants ""could hurt themselves"" attempting to cross.  As a concept, border ""walls"" pre-date both President Biden and former President Trump. Every recent US president has built or enhanced portions of barriers along the border, including 128 miles constructed during the Obama administration. These barriers, experts note, have had little long-term impact on the migration flows and triggers that ultimately determine how many migrants arrive at the US-Mexico border.  Arturo Sarukhan, who served as Mexico's ambassador to the US between 2007 and 2013, said that ""you can't enforce your way out of a migration crisis"" regardless of ""red-meat politicking and dog-whistle narratives"" or a ""need to neutralise electoral pimping of the issue"".  ""You can't tackle 21st Century challenges with 1st century BCE solutions,"" he said. ""The only effect this will have is to further drive up profits for organized crime smuggling and trafficking people and play Whack-a-Mole with migration flows and crossing patterns into the US towards more perilous routes and border regions"".

Spread to UST,Who can I meet and where? Your questions answered,2024-09-25,2020-05-29,By Claire Diamond,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-52809580,"With Scotland introducing the first phase of its lockdown easing strategy on Friday, more than 1,300 of you have sent in questions about how the new rules will work. Here are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions.  In phase one, the guidance says you are allowed to meet members of one other household at a time - so you can meet different people on different days.  While this will not be the law, the Scottish government strongly recommends you don't meet with more than one other household per day. You should keep meetings to a maximum of eight people, and members of different households should stay two metres apart at all times - so no hugs. It needs to be outdoors and people should not go into someone else's house - although you are allowed to meet in private gardens as well as public spaces like parks.  You should avoid touching the same surfaces - these could act as a ""bridge"" for the virus to transmit between households. For example, if you are having a picnic each household should bring its own food and crockery. Yes, this is the only exception to the rule that you should not enter someone else's house.  It would be permitted according to the guidance. It says: ""If you must go through a house to access a garden, do that quickly and without touching surfaces"". While it's OK for one other household to meet you outside - for example in your garden - per day, they should not come into your house, and they should ""avoid using shared facilities such as bathrooms"".  This is because the risk of spreading the virus is higher inside, and it could be transmitted by or to you when you touch surfaces.  There is no legal limit on how far you can travel to meet another household, but you are encouraged to stay local - the Scottish government suggests that about five miles from your home is what it would consider local. It's down to you if you choose to travel further. The reason you are asked to stay close to home is because the further you travel the more likely that you'll need to go to the bathroom. The guidance warns against this, as you ""risk leaving the virus"" behind in the house.   Yes, when you meet up with another household then young children need stay two metres away from people from the other household at all times.  They could pick up the virus from or spread it to the other household, just like an adult could. Similarly you should not allow children to share toys with those outside their household as surfaces can act as a bridge to transmit the virus between the two households. You can now travel short distances for non-contact outdoor leisure activities including golf, tennis, bowls and fishing.  However, you should remain in your local area. The Scottish government suggest that within five miles of your home would be what they consider local. You wouldn't be breaking the law if you travelled further, it's really a question of judgement.  The first minister acknowledged that this was a ""particularly difficult"" issue, and said her government are ""specifically"" looking at providing an answer.  She cannot provide a date at the moment, but hopes to be able to address the situation in the ""not too distant future"". For now, she implores people to live as ""sensibly and safely as possible"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""The Scottish government wants to see if guidance can be modified soon but for now the safest advice for people in different households, whatever the relationship is, is to follow physical distancing to avoid the virus easily spreading between different households."" Looking at the route map gives some indication of how much interaction will be allowed in each phase.  In stage two, you will be allowed into someone else's house, but the guidance says you should still stay two metres apart.  It is not until phase four that the guidelines don't recommend physical distancing from those you don't live in the same house as. In phase one, you should continue to work from home wherever possible and it is not recommended that grandparents look after their grandchildren.  Grandparents tend to be older and are therefore particularly vulnerable to becoming seriously ill with coronavirus.  From next Wednesday, child minding services and outdoor nurseries will be able to reopen.  Not in phase one. During this phase, the Scottish government's guidelines say only ""preparation"" will take place for the ""safe reopening of the housing market"".  They acknowledge it's ""difficult and frustrating"" for anyone stuck mid-process, but say it won't be until phase two that it is anticipated there will be a relaxation of restrictions on moving.  Places of worship will not be reopening in phase one. It's not until phase two that places of worship will be allowed to open, and even then it will only be for private prayer with physical distancing.  In phase three, places of worship can open to extended groups but you will still need to stay two metres apart from other worshippers.  How long we will spend in each phase is not clear - there are a lot of moving parts that can impact how quickly we can move from one phase to another.  So although the restrictions will be reviewed every three weeks a single phase may span more than one review period - some could be lifted earlier than planned but some could be lifted later. What can happen in each place of worship during each phase will depend on a number of factors - including the size and layout, the size of the congregation and what rituals each faith wants to carry out.   It's very difficult to say at this stage what will be safe in October. A lot will depend on the individual characteristics of ceremony and reception venues and how many people they can safely accommodate.  No marriage ceremonies will be allowed to take place in phase one.  But in phase two, ceremonies will be allowed to take place again but the number of attendees will be limited.  It's not until phase three that restrictions will be relaxed to beyond close family.  How long we will spend in each phase is not clear - there are a lot of moving parts that can impact how quickly we can move from one phase to another.  So although the restrictions will be reviewed every three weeks a single phase may span more than one review period - some could be lifted earlier than planned but some could be lifted later.

Spread to UST,US politician 'milkshaked' for first time,2024-09-25,2019-06-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48503820,"A US lawmaker has had a milkshake thrown at him in an alleged attack that appears to have spread from the UK. Republican congressman Matt Gaetz was hit by the flying drink cup as he was leaving a restaurant in Pensacola, Florida, on Saturday. Amanda Kondrat'yev, 35, who ran against Mr Gaetz as a Democrat in 2016, was charged with battery assault. Several British politicians and candidates have had milkshakes thrown at them in the last year. Pro-Brexit leader Nigel Farage has been targeted by creamy projectiles in recent months, leading police to request that some businesses suspend sales of the drinks when political rallies are being held nearby. In Saturday's incident, which may be the first ""milkshaking"" of a political figure on American soil, Mr Gaetz was leaving a town hall-style event, part of his three-day ""Won't Back Down"" tour, at the Brew Ha Ha restaurant. Video of the alleged attack was filmed and posted on social media. In the video, Mr Gaetz appears to point the assailant out to security after some of the beverage's contents landed on his sleeve. He later tweeted: ""Clearly it takes more than a drink to slow down our great team."" Bail for Ms Kondrat'yev, 35, was set at $1,000 (£800). She took to Facebook to fundraise for her legal expenses following her release. ""Not sure how much court stuff costs but I was charged with Battery today for allegedly milkshaking Congressman Matt Gaetz,"" she wrote in a fundraiser on Facebook that had pulled in more than $1,000 by Monday. Referencing ""Eggboy"", an Australian teen who raised thousands of dollars after smashing an egg on a far-right senator, she wrote that ""excess proceeds"" would be donated to a worthy cause or ""something to offset the damage done by having [expletive] Republicans in charge here"". This is not the first time that Mr Gaetz, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, has crossed paths with Ms Kondrat'yev. In 2016, she ran against him to represent Florida's 1st District, but withdrew her candidacy before the election. During the race, Mr Gaetz challenged her to a public debate after she sued the city of Pensacola to try to remove a Christian cross from a public park. According to Florida media, Ms Kondrat'yev accepted the invitation, but the debate never took place."
Spread to UST,How invasion plunged Iraq into decades of chaos,2024-09-25,2023-03-20,By Jeremy Bowen,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-64976144,"The invasion of March 2003 was a catastrophe for Iraq and its people.  More proof of that, measured in broken lives, was at a suspected site of a mass grave in the desert outside Sinjar, not far from the border with Syria.  Survivors of one of Iraq's damaged communities, the Yazidis, looked on as the earth in a marble quarry was excavated. On a wire fence around the site were photos of dozens of people, mostly men, who had been killed by jihadists from the Islamic State group. They were from Zile-li, a village near the quarry, where 1,800 men were taken and killed on 3 August 2014.  The Yazidis revere both the Quran and the Bible; their religion is influenced by both Christianity and Islam. Islamic State considered them to be infidels and carried out a genocidal assault. It happened after the Americans and British had ended their occupation, but a direct line links the massacre to the invasion, and the disastrous years that followed.  Among those watching the excavation was Naif Jasso, the Sheikh of Kocho, a Yazidi community that suffered an even worse attack than Zile-li. He said that in Kocho, 517 people out of a population of 1,250 were killed by jihadists from IS, also known as ISIS or Daesh.  In Zile-li, men were separated from their families at gunpoint and shot dead at the quarry. Sofian Saleh, who was 16 at the time, was among the crowd at the excavation. He is one of only two men from Zile-li who survived. As he waited for death with his father, brother and 20 to 30 other men, he saw another group shot dead. Their bodies tumbled down a cliff into the quarry. Then it was their turn.  ""They tied our hands from behind before the shooting. They took us and threw us on the ground,"" he said.  Sofian's father and brother were killed, but he survived because bodies fell on him, covering him up.  Islamic State was using its favourite tactic. First, they killed the men, then took the women as slaves. Children were removed from their mothers to be indoctrinated as IS recruits. A mother sitting near the suspected grave wept as she remembered the baby ripped from her and given to a jihadist family.  Next to the wire fence around the site, Suad Daoud Chatto, a woman in her 20s, stood with a poster. On it were the faces of nine men from her extended family who were killed, and two missing female relatives. She said jihadists captured her in 2014 when she was 16, along with many other women and girls, and held her in Syria. She remained until 2019, when she was rescued as the Caliphate collapsed.  ""They were like barbarians, they kept us in handcuffs for a long time. Our hands were still tied even during the meals,"" she said. ""They married me off many times… they were marrying the slaves. They did not spare anyone. We were all raped. They were killing people before our eyes. They killed all the Yazidi men - they killed eight of my uncles. They destroyed many families."" In the end, only a few bags of human bones were found at the site. Dozens of others are still to excavated.  By the time IS rampaged through Iraq in the summer of 2014, the US and the UK had ended their occupation. Jihadist ideology existed long before the invasion, and had inspired the 9/11 attacks.  But far from destroying the ideology of Osama Bin Laden and the jihadist extremists, the years of chaos and brutality set off in 2003 turbo-charged murderous jihadist violence. Al-Qaeda, broken for a while by an alliance between the Americans and Sunni tribes, regenerated into the even more barbarous IS.  Iraq is more stable so far this year than it has been for a long while. Baghdad, Mosul and other cities are much safer. But Iraqis feel the results of the invasion every day. Its consequences have shaped and blighted millions of lives and changed their country profoundly.   It is a grim irony that the invasion has dropped out of political and public debate in the US, which conceived and led it, and in the UK, its closest ally in the coalition. The Americans and British bear a heavy responsibility for what happened after the invasion, and its consequences also affect them.  Iraq's tyrant, Saddam Hussein, was well worth overthrowing - he had imprisoned and killed thousands of Iraqis, even using chemical weapons against rebellious Kurds. The problem was how it was done, the way the US and UK ignored international law, and the violence that gripped Iraq after the Bush administration failed to make a plan to fill the power vacuum created by regime change.  The past 20 years since the invasion, coming on top of Saddam's dictatorship, add up to almost half a century of torture for the Iraqi people.   Even for those who were there, it is hard to recreate the febrile atmosphere of ""fear, power and hubris"", as one historian put it recently, that gripped the US in the 18 months between al-Qaeda's 9/11 attacks in 2001 and the invasion of Iraq.  I was in New York a few days after the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were destroyed, as F-15 jets patrolled above Manhattan. It was a visible demonstration of American force, as the biggest military power on the planet worked out how to respond.  The shock of the attacks swiftly produced George W Bush's declaration of ""war on terror"" against al-Qaeda and its jihadist fellow travellers. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair chartered Concorde to cross the Atlantic to offer support. He believed Britain's best guarantee of influence in the world was to stay close to the White House.  They moved fast against al-Qaeda's network in Afghanistan. Before the end of the year, a US-led coalition removed the Taliban regime from power when it refused to give up al-Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden. Kabul was not enough for America.  President Bush and his advisors saw a global threat to the US. They thought states that opposed them could make deadly alliances with al-Qaeda and its imitators. The biggest target in their sights was Iraq. Saddam Hussein had been a thorn in America's side ever since he sent his army into Kuwait in 1990. Without any evidence, the Americans tried to manufacture a link between Saddam and al-Qaeda when none existed. In reality the Iraqi leader, a secular dictator, saw religious extremists as a threat. The president's father, George HW Bush, decided not to remove Saddam from power in Baghdad after the Iraqi occupiers were driven out of Kuwait by an international coalition assembled by the US in 1991. The first President Bush and his advisors saw trouble ahead if they continued to Baghdad. A long, belligerent occupation of Iraq looked like a morass and they had no UN authorisation to topple the regime.  I was in Baghdad when the ceasefire was declared. Regime officials I knew could not believe that Saddam's dictatorship had survived.  Twelve years later, by 2003, America's rage and arrogance of power blinded the second President Bush to the realities that had constrained his father. When the US and UK could not persuade the UN Security Council to pass a resolution explicitly authorising invasion and regime change, Messrs Bush and Blair claimed earlier resolutions gave them the authority they needed.  Among many who did not buy their argument was the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In a BBC interview 18 months after the invasion, he said it was ""not in conformity"" with the UN Charter - in other words, illegal. France and other Nato allies refused to join the invasion. Tony Blair ignored huge protests in the UK. His decision to go to war dogged the rest of his political career.  No president or prime minister faces a bigger decision than going to war. George Bush and Tony Blair embarked on a war of choice that killed hundreds of thousands of people. The justifications for the invasion were soon shown to be untrue. The weapons of mass destruction that Tony Blair insisted, eloquently, made Saddam a clear and present danger, turned out not to exist. It was a failure not just of intelligence but of leadership.   The Americans called the huge air raids that started their offensive ""shock and awe"". Neo-conservatives around George W Bush deluded themselves that democracy, and regional stability, could be imposed through the barrel of a gun. Overwhelming US force would not just safeguard America, it would stabilise the Middle East too, and democracy would spread through Syria, Iran and beyond, like a good virus.   Saddam was removed within weeks. Iraqis were in no mood to be grateful. In Saddam's last decade as leader, the vast majority of them had been impoverished by sanctions authorised by the UN, but driven hardest by the US and UK. The Americans, the British and their allies were unable to bring peace to the streets. Nightmarish years started with wholesale looting, revenge attacks and crime.  An insurgency against the occupation turned into a sectarian civil war. Iraqis turned against each other as the Americans imposed a system of government that split power along ethnic and sectarian lines - between the country's three main groups, Shia Muslims, Kurds and Sunni Muslims. Armed militias fought each other, the occupiers, and killed each other's civilians.  Jihadist groups moved in to exploit the chaos and kill foreigners. Before the Americans managed to kill him, a brutal Sunni extremist from Jordan, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, targeted attacks to turn the insurgency against the occupation into a sectarian civil war. Shia death squads retaliated with their own reign of terror.  No-one knows exactly how many Iraqis have died as a result of the 2003 invasion. Estimates are all in the hundreds of thousands. The tide of violent sectarianism continues to rumble around the Middle East.  The geopolitical legacy of the invasion is still shaping events. Unwittingly, the Americans turned the balance of power in Iraq in Iran's favour by overthrowing Saddam Hussein, who was considered a Sunni bulwark against the Islamic Republic. Removing him empowered Shia politicians who were close to Tehran. Militias armed and trained by Iran are among the most powerful forces in Iraq and have representatives in government.  The US and UK's fear of causing another disaster hamstrung their response to the Arab uprisings of 2011, and especially the war against his own people launched by President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.  Disorder in Iraq, where the population is growing fast, fuels the trade in people-smuggling to Europe. According to the British Home Office, Iraqis are the fourth largest national group crossing the English Channel in small boats. The UK Refugee Council says the vast majority whose cases have been processed are granted asylum as refugees.  American and British leaders do not dwell on the invasion these days, but others have not forgotten. One reason why much of the global south stayed neutral after Russia invaded Ukraine, ignoring appeals to uphold international law, was the memory of how the US, the UK and Western allies who joined the coalition ignored it as they steamrollered opposition to their invasion of Iraq.   It is a sign of how bad the past 20 years have been that Saddam nostalgia is well established in Iraq, not just among his own Sunni community. People complain that at least you knew where you were with the old dictator. He was an equal opportunities killer of anyone he saw as an enemy, including his own son-in-law.  In a queue for diesel in a camp near Mosul, a 48-year-old Sunni named Mohammed, raged against the Shia-led government in Baghdad and against the years of sectarian killing that followed the invasion.  ""We wish that Saddam's rule could come back, even for one day. Saddam was a dictator, and it was one man's rule - correct. But he was not killing the people based on whether they were Shia, Sunni, Kurdish, or Yazidi.""  Iraq has signs of hope. Parts of towns and villages are still in ruins, but they feel safer, even though Iraqis still face threats that would be considered a national crisis in the West. Well-trained anti-terrorist units are containing IS jihadist cells, who still manage to carry out bombings and ambushes. Even so, shopkeepers are hoping for a bumper Ramadan, their busiest time of the year.  Longer term, the biggest legacy of the invasion for Iraq might be the political system that the Americans instigated, which divides power along ethnic and sectarian lines. As developed by Iraqi politicians, it has offered prodigious chances for corruption.   Estimates of the amount stolen since 2003 range from $150bn (£124bn) to $320bn (£264bn). Most Iraqis, of all sects, who have not benefited from the bonanza of theft, face constant power cuts, bad water, and inadequate medical care, in hospitals that were once considered to be as good as ones in Europe. Walk down most streets and you will see children working or begging, instead of going to school. Iraq used to have one of the best educational systems in the Middle East. Iraq's latest prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, has promised a new start. His biggest challenge is keeping his promise to tackle corruption, the cancer that is eating the country from within.

A joint education union statement called on the government to ""step back"" from a 1 June start date. In the House of Commons, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson warned against ""scaremongering"" over safety. But his department's chief scientific adviser cast doubt on suggestions the virus spreads less among children. Mr Williamson, facing questions from MPs on reopening schools, rejected fears over safety and said it was the most disadvantaged who were losing out from schools being closed. ""Sometimes scaremongering, making people fear, is really unfair and not a welcome pressure to be placed on families, children and teachers alike,"" he told MPs. Mr Williamson said that pupils, like teachers, would be a priority for testing if they or their families showed symptoms. The Liberal Democrats' education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, challenged the education secretary to publish the scientific evidence on which the return to school was based. But the Department for Education's chief scientific adviser, Osama Rahman, appearing before the Science and Technology Committee, said decisions around opening schools, such as which year groups went back first, had not been taken by the department. Asked whether he had assessed the safety guidance given to schools and how it might be implemented, the DFE's scientific adviser told MPs: ""I haven't."" As such he was unable to say what evidence was behind the decision to reopen schools - or to say how many under-18s had died from the virus. And Mr Rahman told MPs there was only ""low confidence"" in evidence suggesting that children transmit Covid-19 any less than adults. ""As a former teacher listening to this I don't think the profession is going to be at all satisfied by what they are hearing at the moment,"" said Scottish National Party MP Carol Monaghan. Patrick Roach, leader of the Nasuwt teachers' union, said the DFE adviser's comments were ""truly shocking and disturbing"". The Department for Education later circulated a letter from Mr Rahman in which he said he had been ""closely involved"" in advising on reopening schools - and that he had ""full confidence in in the plan to reopen education institutions for all the reasons set out by the government"". In their joint statement, nine unions, including the National Education Union and the National Association of Head Teachers, rejected the plans for a phased return of primary school pupils after half term - saying it was still too early to be safe. The unions called for a delay until a ""full roll-out of a national test and trace scheme"" was in place and there were extra resources for cleaning, protective equipment and risk assessments. The joint statement said that ""classrooms of four and five-year olds could become sources of Covid-19 transmission and spread"". ""We call on the government to step back from the 1st June and work with us to create the conditions for a safe return to schools."" But Mr Williamson told MPs that opening schools was the ""responsible"" course of action, now the virus was ""past the peak"" and that safety was uppermost in how it was being planned. ""The best place for children to be educated and to learn is in school,"" he said, particularly for the disadvantaged who would be most likely to fall further behind. Instead of a fixed date for a return, Labour's shadow education secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, argued that schools should reopen only when there was clear evidence it was safe. ""The guidance provided so far does not yet provide the clear assurances over safety that are needed,"" she told MPs. She said that families were still worried about the implications of pupils going back to school, such as for relatives who might have illnesses. In Wales, the First Minister Mark Drakeford has said schools would not open on 1 June. In Scotland, it is not expected that schools will re-open before the summer holidays. In Northern Ireland, Education Minister Peter Weir has spoken of a possible phased return of schools in September."

The hoard of 300 potins, which are an early version of a coin, were found in Hillingdon, following a storm which helped reveal their position. Archaeologists have dated them to the 1st century BC, at a time when the Romans were beginning to establish themselves in Britain. The discovery has been described as a ""once-in-a-lifetime find"". Each of the potins are about 3cm (1.2 in) in diameter and are based on coins struck in Marseille, France, about 2,175 years ago. On one side they show a stylised image of the head of Greek god Apollo, while a charging bull is on the other. Emma Tetlow, historic environment lead for HS2's main contractors Skanska, Costain and Strabag, explained how her team had been ""coming to the end of our archaeological work... when we found a patch of soil that was a very different colour"" following a storm which had altered the ground conditions. ""The patch of soil was dark greeny-blue, which suggests oxidised metal, and when we checked more closely, we could see loosely packed metal discs."" She described the discovery as ""a once-in-a-lifetime find"". The potins, which have been named the ""Hillingdon Hoard"", were taken to Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery to be cleaned and preserved so specialists to investigate them further. Coins were not thought to have been used for the exchange of goods and service at the time and archaeologists believe the hoard may have been used to mark the boundary of a property or was an offering to the gods. Hoards are also thought to have been buried in isolated locations as emergency savings for times of crisis. Potins like these from the late Iron Age like have been found previously but in much smaller quantities meaning this find is considered very significant. The value of the hoard has yet to be determined and a coroner is to decide whether they can be considered ""treasure"", meaning they can be acquired by a museum. Helen Wass, HS2's head of heritage, said the discovery ""provides us with more information about how our ancestors lived and settled in London""."

O'Neil, confirmed as head coach during the World Cup after impressing as caretaker, said: ""That's the first time since I've taken charge that we fell well below the standards that we've set, and the standards that we need.

What did you make of Bournemouth's display? Have your say here How highly did you rate Palace's display? Send your views here Palace had not registered a shot on target in their previous two games, but there was no subtlety about either goal, with both created by Michael Olise's pinpoint delivery from corners. The opener came when Jordan Ayew was left virtually unmarked at the near post from Olise's left-wing delivery, leaving him the easy task of planting a downward header across goal and into the net. The Eagles doubled their lead when Olise's delivery from the opposite side was driven perfectly into the path of Eberechi Eze, who had space on the edge of the area to blast the ball past Mark Travers. With much of the game played in driving rain, Bournemouth struggled to find any fluency and created few clear-cut opportunities, although Dominic Solanke stung the palms of visiting goalkeeper Vicente Guaita after the break. Reaction to Saturday's action in the Premier League This video can not be played Palace played well from first to 90th minute - Vieira Vieira described Boxing Day's defeat at ""one of the worst days"" since he arrived as Palace manager. Forced into two changes after seeing two of his defenders sent off during the 3-0 home loss against Fulham, he resisted any temptation to make more alterations despite failing to score in five of their past six away games, and was rewarded with a no-nonsense display. Marc Guehi, back from a suspension of his own, marshalled the retooled Eagles defence well against the aerial threat of Kieffer Moore and the guile of Solanke. The defence and midfield were quick to pounce on second balls, while their frontrunners always posed a threat on the break. ""Michael Olise is a young player, sometimes he will make mistakes and miss something, but I don't have any doubt about putting him in the starting XI,"" added Vieira. ""Today he was disciplined, and he has grown as a player."" Even after Vieira had substituted both goalscorers in the 74th minute, a third Palace goal looked more likely than a reply from the hosts as the Eagles closed out their first league win outside London since April. Bournemouth's ownership group now includes Hollywood actor Michael B Jordan and Vegas Golden Knights owner Bill Foley New owner Bill Foley and minority owner Michael B Jordan were introduced to the Bournemouth crowd before the game, with a touch of Las Vegas glitz added to the pre-match atmosphere as half a dozen pitchside flamethrowers, more usually seen around the boundary in Twenty20 cricket, greeted the players' arrival on to the pitch. When Foley travelled to Dorset in October to sign the takeover paperwork, he watched O'Neil's side come from behind to beat Leicester 2-1, but a Hollywood-style comeback looked very unlikely after the second goal left Palace in full charge. And a year which featured the highs of promotion to the top flight, and the lows including a 9-0 thumping at Liverpool, concluded with something of a damp squib.

Spread to UST,Why Afghanistan is more dangerous than ever,2024-09-25,2018-09-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45507560,"Huge death tolls that would once have made headlines are becoming commonplace in Afghanistan, as the Taliban and other militant groups flex their muscles daily against a US-backed military struggling to cope. There remains no clear end in sight for a war that has turned into a bloody stalemate, as the BBC World Service's Dawood Azami explains. Since the US-led invasion in 2001, Afghanistan has never been as insecure as it is now. The Taliban control more territory than at any point since the removal of their regime 17 years ago. The Afghan war has already become the longest war in US history. With the passage of time, the conflict has not only become more intense - it has also become more complicated. The attacks are becoming bigger, more frequent, more widespread and much deadlier. Both sides - the Taliban and the US/Nato-backed Afghan government - are trying to gain the upper hand. On 10 August, the Taliban entered Ghazni, a strategic provincial capital on a key highway south of Kabul, before the Afghan security forces supported by US advisors and air strikes pushed them back. On 15 May, the Taliban entered the capital of Farah province in western Afghanistan, close to the Iranian border.  Many Taliban fighters are killed and injured as they are pushed back after attacks on provincial capitals, but such attacks have a huge propaganda value for the group and boost their morale and recruitment. The insurgents also take weapons and vehicles with them as they retreat. Many other towns and district centres remain under constant Taliban threat. Large parts of provinces like Helmand and Kandahar - where hundreds of US, UK and other foreign troops were killed - are now under Taliban control. Meanwhile, civilian casualties are at an unprecedented level. According to the UN, more than 10,000 civilians were killed or injured in 2017, and the number is expected to be even higher in 2018.  It has been a year since President Trump unveiled a new strategy for Afghanistan, vowing that the US would ""fight to win"". The Trump administration has sought to put pressure on the Taliban in four ways to break the stalemate, roll back the group and eventually force them to sit down for talks with the Afghan government. But these efforts have largely failed: Counting the cost of Trump's air war in Afghanistan Why are more troops going to Afghanistan? There are five major factors responsible for the intensification of the Afghanistan conflict. Given the high frequency and spread of Taliban violence, the Afghan security forces are overstretched and, in some cases, overwhelmed. Afghan forces have been fighting hard to stop the Taliban's expansion. But their casualty rate remains alarmingly high and appears to be increasing. Questions have been raised about the lack of robust and inspiring leadership, the timely supply of logistics, and corruption. The bickering between political and government leaders in Kabul is also having a negative impact on the smooth running of the government and the security situation. The two factions who formed the National Unity Government (NUG) after the 2014 presidential election have not yet truly united. Despite being in power for four years, the government in Kabul remains internally divided on several issues. Parliamentary polls, which have already been delayed by more than three years, are scheduled for 20 October 2018. The increasing violence has fuelled speculation over whether the elections will be held on time. There are already concerns about widespread fraud and pre-poll manipulation. There are also questions about how representative the next parliament will be if polls are not conducted in many parts of the country due to violence and intimidation. Presidential elections, which are due to take place in April 2019, will be an even bigger challenge.  If not handled properly, both elections will test the strength of government institutions and pose a big challenge for overall political stability in Afghanistan. All sides now seem to be convinced that the conflict in Afghanistan cannot be solved by military means alone. A consensus is slowly building to start talks, with all parties saying that they want a negotiated settlement. A window of opportunity opened after an unprecedented three-day ceasefire in June, followed by a meeting between US officials and Taliban representatives in Qatar in July. This was the first time in seven years that the two sides met for face-to-face talks. They are scheduled to meet again soon. It is an acknowledgement that, despite the aggressive US military campaign, no one side can win the war. But there are still disagreements over the format, included the parties and framework for comprehensive peace negotiations. For meaningful progress to be made and trust to be built, compromise and flexibility will be required from all sides.  The other major challenge is the co-operation of regional players. Peace in Afghanistan and the wider region can only be achieved through a multilateral mechanism involving the US as well as major regional players, including Pakistan, Russia, Iran, China, India and Saudi Arabia. But in the end, it will be the dialogue among Afghans themselves which will determine the political future of their war-torn Afghanistan. "

Spread to UST,Cosmic vibrations sensed from unusual star merger,2024-09-25,2020-01-07,By Jonathan Amos,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51020604,"Scientists have observed gravitational waves emanating from the collision of two dense, dead stars. It's the second time the international Ligo-Virgo collaboration of laser labs has picked up such a signal. What makes this one different, though, is the combined mass of the two merging neutron stars - at three and a half times that of our Sun. A coalescing system this big has never been seen in our galaxy and challenges researchers' expectations. All the previously known so-called binary neutron stars detected by radio telescopes have been no larger than 2.7 times the mass of the Sun.  ""So, if you're trying to explain how these systems are formed, you have to also explain why such a thing that we now know exists has never been seen in [our] galaxy. Or is there some reason radio surveys are blind to it?"" said Katerina Chatziioannou from the Flatiron Institute, New York. The union of the two neutron stars almost certainly produced a black hole.  Gravitational waves - Ripples in the fabric of space-time Dr Chatziioannou was speaking at the 235th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Honolulu, Hawaii. She is part of the worldwide scientific collaboration to detect the ripples in space-time that result when massive bodies accelerate. The project uses three laser interferometers - in Washington State and Louisiana in the US, and near Pisa in Italy. These facilities now routinely ""listen"" to the cosmos for the telltale vibrations that come from cataclysmic cosmic events. Virtually all of the collaboration's earlier detections have been the consequence of black hole collisions. The one exception was the neutron star merger sensed in August 2017. That gravitational waves event was accompanied by a flash of light spread across many wavelengths, and analysed by multiple telescopes. In contrast, the new detection, made on 25 April last year, was void of a detectable signal in the electromagnetic spectrum. This may just have been bad luck, however. The detection was made in the first instance in only one of the three labs - which makes it much harder to pinpoint on the sky where an event has occurred. Normally, the collaboration likes to see a signal sensed across all its laser instruments, but such is the confidence now in the labs' performance that scientists will always sit up and take notice when their algorithms post an alert from even just one lab. ""There's clear separation between the noise we've seen the detectors producing and what signals look like,"" Dr Chatziioannou told reporters. ""This is what makes us confident that this is a real signal of astrophysical origin."" Although on the day only the Ligo-Louisiana laser instrument flagged GW190425, as it has now been designated, subsequent reanalysis of the data showed the signal was present also in the recordings made by the Italian Virgo facility. The gravitational waves event is calculated to have occurred about 500 million light-years from Earth - about four times further away than the 2017 neutron star merger (GW170817).  Scientists are already producing ideas for why the total mass of the new system is higher than previously observed.  Most of these suggestions relate to very special formation circumstances, but researchers concede the possibility that one or both objects could also be light-weight black holes. This requires a whole new level of conjecture, however.  What is clear is how spectacularly well the laser interferometers are performing.  It is easy to forget that before the first historic detection of gravitational waves in September 2015, there were many who doubted the technical feasibility of sensing what are incredibly weak signals. In the first two observing runs, which ran through periods in 2015-2017 - a total of 11 gravitational wave events were picked up. In the current campaign, which began in April last year and ends in April this year - more than 40 ""candidate"" detections have been made so far. About one a week. These events still need further review before they can be confirmed, but the number speaks to the remarkable sensitivity and stability being achieved by the laser instruments.  Again, nearly all of the candidates are considered to be collisions of black holes. Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"

Boris Johnson said there was ""no doubt in my mind that schools are safe"" but did not rule out further closures. Several councils have written to the education secretary asking for schools in their area to be told to stay shut, following closures in London. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""inevitable"" more schools will shut. Mr Johnson told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show the risk to children was ""very, very low"" and the benefit of education was ""so huge"". The prime minister also indicated that tougher regional measures may be required in parts of the country in the coming weeks to curb rising infections.  The two-week school closures in London and south-east England were ""exceptional"" due to the fast-spreading new variant of Covid-19, he said. Most primary schools in England are expected to open on Monday. However, unions are telling primary school staff it is unsafe to return to work and are calling for remote learning to be introduced across all primaries. A growing number of councils in England are calling on the government to delay the reopening of primary schools, with local authorities in Wolverhampton, Cumbria and Kent asking for a delay to the start of term on Monday. Brighton and Hove Council has advised primary schools to stay closed meaning Gemma Cocker's five-year-old son Charlie will not be going to school while her daughter Lyla, who is four, may still be able to go to nursery. Gemma and her husband have been working from home since March, but now they will once again have to add childcare to the mix. ""We'll try to home-school him,"" she said of Charlie. ""He regressed a little bit last time, he's young in the year."" Mrs Cocker, 36, added: ""The whole thing is ridiculous, can a decision just be made? At a time when many parents are returning to work next week, to have this uncertainty is adding to already stressed out families.  ""Morally, I think they should close, but practically, no. It's a hard one."" Read more here. Mr Johnson said that while school closures would be kept ""under constant review"", the government would be ""driven by public health considerations and by the massive importance of education"". ""And if you think about the history of the pandemic, we've kept schools going for a long, long time in areas where the pandemic has really been at really high levels,"" he said. Sir Keir said tighter measures needed to be introduced nationally in the next 24 hours and criticised the PM for ""hinting"" at further restrictions coming into force. The Labour leader said he did not want to ""add to the chaos"" that would be caused by schools closing on Monday, but said it was ""inevitable"" more would have to shut.  ""The government needs to plan for children's learning but also for working parents,"" Sir Keir added. On Friday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced that all of London's primaries would remain shut to most pupils, after pressure from local councils to reverse an earlier decision to keep only schools in certain boroughs closed.  Mr Johnson said his message to councils and schools was to be ""guided by the public health advice"" which at the moment is ""that schools are safe in those areas where we're not being driven by the new variant to close them"". But he said ""we've got to be humble in the face of the impact of this new variant of the virus"" and warned there would be ""a very difficult few weeks and months"" until the vaccine comes into effect. Keeping schools open for all pupils has been one of the red lines ever since the first national lockdown. All the evidence so far suggests primary school children have one of the lowest levels of infection when it comes to symptomatic cases.  If you include asymptomatic infection the picture changes, but the evidence suggests such cases are less likely to lead to onward spread. And, of course, the risk of serious illness in this group is pretty rare.  The rise of the new variant has increased cases generally, although Public Health England says there is still no evidence yet that this new variant transmits more in children than other variants. There is understandable concern about teachers. Research by the Office for National Statistics suggests they have been at no greater risk of infection than other professions working outside the home. The new variant could, of course, change this, which is why the unions are concerned. The prime minister admitted the tier system in England may need to get tougher and ""clearly school closures which we had to do in March is one of those things"" but added it was ""not necessarily something we want to do"". Asked whether exams should be cancelled, Mr Johnson did not answer directly but said ""we've got to be realistic"" about the pace at which the new variant was spreading and its impact on the NHS. The National Education Union has advised its members it is not safe to work in primary schools and said all schools should remain closed for a further two weeks, while other major teaching unions have called for a period of remote learning while safety measures are put in place.  In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has asked for the Scottish Parliament to be recalled so she can make an ""urgent statement"", with her deputy John Swinney tweeting that ministers would meet ""to consider the current advice in relation to schools and early learning"".  Head teachers in Wales as well as England have begun legal action to force ministers to reveal data behind the decision for some schools to reopen - which the Department for Education said is based on new infections and pressure on the NHS in local areas. Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England, called for teachers to be vaccinated ""as a priority"", as she said that any school closure should be for ""the absolute minimum of time and that time must be used very well"". Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said ""children's lives can't just be put on hold"", echoing the point that school closures should be kept to an ""absolute minimum"". Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said the government's ""top-down"" and ""blanket"" approach to schools reopening should be changed to allow head teachers to make decisions based on local public health advice. Most primary schools in England will return on 4 January, but in London and some surrounding areas they will not open for most pupils until 18 January. Secondary schools in England will stagger their return with pupils taking exams in 2021 starting on 11 January, and other year groups returning in person on 18 January.   In Wales, local councils have been told they can be ""flexible"" with when they open - with many schools aiming to return for face-to-face lessons from 11 January.  In Northern Ireland, primary school pupils will be taught online until 11 January. In secondary schools, years 8 to 11 will be taught online throughout January. Years 12 to 14 will return to school after the first week of January.  In Scotland, the Christmas holidays have been extended to 11 January, and the following week will be online learning only. A full return to face-to-face learning is planned for 18 January but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned measures may have to go further with a cabinet meeting to be held on Monday.

Republican congressman Matt Gaetz was hit by the flying drink cup as he was leaving a restaurant in Pensacola, Florida, on Saturday. Amanda Kondrat'yev, 35, who ran against Mr Gaetz as a Democrat in 2016, was charged with battery assault. Several British politicians and candidates have had milkshakes thrown at them in the last year. Pro-Brexit leader Nigel Farage has been targeted by creamy projectiles in recent months, leading police to request that some businesses suspend sales of the drinks when political rallies are being held nearby. In Saturday's incident, which may be the first ""milkshaking"" of a political figure on American soil, Mr Gaetz was leaving a town hall-style event, part of his three-day ""Won't Back Down"" tour, at the Brew Ha Ha restaurant. Video of the alleged attack was filmed and posted on social media. In the video, Mr Gaetz appears to point the assailant out to security after some of the beverage's contents landed on his sleeve. He later tweeted: ""Clearly it takes more than a drink to slow down our great team."" Bail for Ms Kondrat'yev, 35, was set at $1,000 (£800). She took to Facebook to fundraise for her legal expenses following her release. ""Not sure how much court stuff costs but I was charged with Battery today for allegedly milkshaking Congressman Matt Gaetz,"" she wrote in a fundraiser on Facebook that had pulled in more than $1,000 by Monday. Referencing ""Eggboy"", an Australian teen who raised thousands of dollars after smashing an egg on a far-right senator, she wrote that ""excess proceeds"" would be donated to a worthy cause or ""something to offset the damage done by having [expletive] Republicans in charge here"". This is not the first time that Mr Gaetz, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, has crossed paths with Ms Kondrat'yev. In 2016, she ran against him to represent Florida's 1st District, but withdrew her candidacy before the election. During the race, Mr Gaetz challenged her to a public debate after she sued the city of Pensacola to try to remove a Christian cross from a public park. According to Florida media, Ms Kondrat'yev accepted the invitation, but the debate never took place."

The pandemic has changed everyone's lives, some tragically, but those are the words of Prime Minister Boris Johnson when fundraiser and veteran Captain Tom Moore was awarded a knighthood. Capt Tom started his momentous fundraising effort back in early April when he pledged to complete the 2.5km (1.6 miles), 100-lap garden challenge at his home in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire by his 100th birthday on 30 April.  Fundraising for NHS Charities Together, the then 99-year-old said he was doing it ""for the sake of the nurses and the NHS"". Born in Keighley, Yorkshire, and a veteran of World War Two, Capt Tom was inspired after receiving treatment for skin cancer and a broken hip after a fall in 2018. Capt Tom's efforts soon reached the eyes and ears of a nation shorn of positive news as the death toll of the coronavirus pandemic increased throughout April. TV appearances followed and by the middle of the month he had teamed up with Michael Ball to release a fundraising cover of You'll Never Walk Alone. ""Every penny that we get, they [the NHS] deserve,"" he said, as the total exceeded £5m. By 17 April, it had topped £17m as he completed his 100 laps ahead of schedule, declaring: ""I never dreamt I would be involved in such an occasion as this."" Tom-mania was sweeping the nation. Garage murals, patchwork collages, knitted dolls and balloon models were just some of the ways people paid tribute. Artist Adam Salisbury said Capt Tom's incredible story had been ""the only thing that's made me feel alive and good about myself"" during the lockdown. And Rick Minns painted his tribute on the mud-covered van he uses as a canvas before declaring: ""Captain Tom has become the captain of all of us."" On 30 April, Capt Tom celebrated his 100th birthday - and what a day. With his fundraising efforts passing £32m, he was honoured with an RAF flypast and a birthday greeting from the Queen. As if that was not enough, Capt Tom become Colonel Tom, while he was flooded with hundreds of thousands of birthday cards and tributes ranging from a commemorative postbox, the Freedom of the City of London and becoming an honorary England cricketer. Capt Tom closed his fundraising page soon afterwards, with the final total an astounding £32,794,701. The money has started to be used to help comfort and care for NHS workers through the turbulent times, such as by creating spaces to relax, snacks for staff and pop-up shops. His efforts inspired many others, including former nurse Joan Rich who set out to complete 102 laps of her local park before her 102nd birthday. Tony Hudgell, a five-year-old boy who had to have both legs amputated as a result of neglect by his birth parents, was also captivated by Capt Tom. His adoptive father Mark said: ""Tony saw Capt Tom on the television walking with his walking frame and at that time it was the type of frame Tony was using.  ""He looked at it and said 'I can do that'."" Using prosthetics, Tony took up a 10km walking challenge to fundraise for the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which saved his life. He has raised more than £1m, having been first inspired by someone he ""kept wanting to watch on YouTube"". ""Captain Tom is one of his heroes now,"" said Mr Hudgell. The inevitable knighthood followed, with Capt Tom declaring himself ""delighted and overawed"". After completing his 100 laps, he had a message for the British public in the midst of the pandemic. ""To all those people who are finding it difficult at the moment... the sun will shine on you again, and the clouds will go away."" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Februdairy was launched by an ex-vegan animal scientist in response to the Veganuary campaign. This is the first year it has run, and at the moment consists mostly of a hashtag campaign on social media and a Twitter account with 1,700 followers. The campaign is also attempting a viral challenge where people drink a pint of milk and then nominate their friends. ""There's been a lot of bad press around the dairy and meat industry,"" says Abi, a supporter of the Februdairy campaign who works for an agricultural supplier in Sussex. ""People tend to read things online and generalise farmers into the idea that they all run farms in an intensive factory way."" For her, the movement is needed to ""make people see that there is so much propaganda."" The 26-year-old argues that social media has led to the spread of misinformation about sustainable, local farming practises.  ""There's a big myth that every single male-born calf is shot at birth. Some are - a lot aren't,"" she says. Abi's partner runs a farm in Sussex which takes on male calves that can't be used for milk. ""They are reared for beef. They stay on until they are about two."" Abi says she has had some abuse online when she tweets about the campaign, but wants to get a clear message out on behalf of the industry. ""Obviously, vegans are on the rise, which nobody has any problems with,"" she says. ""It's the fact that they come out in force to slate farmers, using this false propaganda. ""It's essential that farmers have that voice now more than ever."" Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here"

Captain Tom Moore's eldest daughter Lucy Teixeira watched from her home in Berkshire as his target of £1,000 for walking 100 laps of his garden grew. She said visiting him was ""100% the first thing"" she would do when lockdown restrictions were lifted. ""I am just lucky in that I have been able to see him on TV,"" she said. Capt Tom completed 100 laps of the 25-metre (82ft) loop in his garden in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, well before the deadline of his 100th birthday on 30 April and raised millions for NHS Charities Together. Ms Teixeira, 51, who lives in Reading, normally visits him every month and said it has been difficult not being able to, especially with his 100th birthday coming up. ""It's very painful not to be with him at the moment,"" the mother of two said. ""But I want to compliment team Tom as my sister and her family have done a sterling job supporting him through this. ""I am one of those families who can't be with someone and I feel their pain as well, but at least I've seen film crews talking to him. ""I have already sent him his birthday card - ahead of the millions he'll probably get - but on the day we'll probably watch it on TV."" Ms Teixeira said her father's efforts were ""typically him"" and ""he never sits still"". ""How many 99-year-olds order a running machine? That raised a few eyebrows when it arrived,"" she said. ""But he wanted to improve his ability to walk in the winter because he knew he'd be sitting around more. ""It's amazing what my little old dad has done and captured everybody's hearts and minds with the result of supporting the NHS at this most critical time.

Hattie made headlines around the world after she was taken in by Gables Farm Dogs and Cats Home in Plymouth, Devon, earlier this year.  Nicknamed ""Hattie the Fatty"", the plump pooch weighed almost 40kg (6st) when she was rescued by the RSPCA. The hefty hound, who had been living on a diet of hamburgers, has now slimmed to 23kg (3st). Manager Ruth Rickard said she recalled mistaking the portly pup for a ""pot-bellied pig"" when she first arrived. Staff put the colossal canine on a strict regime of diet and exercise to help her lose the weight safely. The charity also set up a fundraising campaign to help cover her vet bills, including cataracts surgery, medicine and a possible ""tummy tuck"" to rid her of any excess skin.  Eight-year-old Hattie's story spread far and wide and as a result the centre smashed its fundraising target by 338%.

For the first time, all teams in the tournament are offering some form of contract to the majority of their players. After last year's World Cup was played a year late because of Covid-19, the 2025 tournament in England already feels close and a new cycle has brought change for many teams. Here is everything you need to know about each side before the Women's Six Nations begins on Saturday. Last year: 1st, Grand Slam England are chasing a fifth straight Championship title and have not lost a Women's Six Nations match since France beat them in 2018. They arrive in this year's tournament with the wound of a narrow World Cup final defeat by New Zealand still fresh. A new era is around the corner, with record caps holder and captain Sarah Hunter retiring after Saturday's opener against Scotland and head coach Simon Middleton stepping down at the end of the tournament. A new face will have to come in at fly-half too as Zoe Harrison is out for the rest of the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament and Helena Rowland is still recovering from a foot injury sustained in England's World Cup campaign. Holly Aitchison - previously a centre for England - is expected to take the reins. England have been professional since 2019 and flanker Alex Matthews says they want to ""grow the gap"" with other teams now that contracts are becoming widespread. France will be the Red Roses' toughest opponents and their encounter at Twickenham - for which 35,000 tickets have already been sold - takes place on 29 April and is likely to be the tournament decider. Lock Zoe Aldcroft said England ""have to get over"" their heartbreaking World Cup defeat ""to be able to move forward"". ""The new girls coming in have brought a really positive vibe,"" added Aldcroft. ""We're on the next journey now. We can't dwell on anything that happened before. It's all about going forward to 2025."" England captain Hunter announces retirement How to follow the Women's Six Nations on the BBC Wales v Ireland will be on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and England v Scotland will be on 5 Live Lat year: 2nd France's task will be, once again, to stop the England machine rumbling to another title. Les Bleues narrowly missed out on a World Cup final last year and have had a shake-up since. New coaches Gaelle Mignot and David Ortiz have come in. Star scrum-half Laure Sansus has retired and fly-half Caroline Drouin is focusing on sevens. France great Jessy Tremouliere will retire from international rugby at the end of the tournament and new captain Audrey Forlani said ""we're going to make sure she finishes on a high"". Last year: 3rd Expectations are higher for Wales as they enter their second year of having professional contracts, with 25 full-time players this year. Wales are likely to once again be in the battle for third place, with the gap to England and France not yet narrowed. That battle has increased importance this year because World Rugby have launched a new global women's competition called WXV. That competition will have three tiers and the top three teams in the Six Nations will compete in the top tier of WXV. Wales captain Hannah Jones denied that contracts brought pressure to perform, but said the extra time professionalism brings has had a big impact. ""You've got time to eat, time to recover, time to pick up those conversations with coaches that you probably would have had to leave,"" she added. How Hunter's record-breaking career grew the game Listen to Rugby Union Weekly's Sarah Hunter special Last year: 4th Ireland have also joined the contracts party, but not all players took the union up on them. That may have been due to the level of pay and the fact that you have to play in Ireland rather than, for example, in England's more competitive Premier 15s league. A new World Cup cycle is a fresh start after Ireland failed to qualify for the 2022 tournament - but the side will be missing several players who are with the sevens side as they bid for Olympic qualification. Captain Nichola Fryday wants more than last year's fourth-place finish She said: ""We want to keep building and getting that WXV qualification will be key for us. ""We've got a core group of experienced players that have been there the last few years. We're in a better place than last year."" Last year: 5th Italy have a new coach in Giovanni Ranieri, while former captain Manuela Furlan has retired. The Azzurre reached the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time last year and are also looking to build on increased investment from their union. They have the toughest possible Six Nations start in France and England, something forward Silvia Turani jokeed will be ""a nice warm-up"". Last year: 6th Last year was the year Scotland came close. So close that they earned losing bonus points against Wales, Italy and Ireland, but a lack of wins still left them bottom of the pile. Captain Rachel Malcolm says they have had increased sports psychology support as they look to turn last-gasp defeats into victory. ""Close isn't good enough for us anymore,"" she said. ""We need to find a way to turn those results so we're on the right side of them."" Malcolm also suggested her team will produce something new in attack, with Chris Laidlaw joining as attack coach. ""Hopefully you'll see a slightly more exciting attack looking to move the ball a bit more and spread it a bit wider and manipulate defences a bit more,"" added Malcolm.

Mr Slaughter described the party as the ""critical green voice in the room"". ""We've seen councils across Wales declare climate emergencies,"" he said. ""The right noises get made, but the actions aren't being delivered.

I think that's true of every Essex person, we're a grafter, we get things done,"" she said. As Covid spread and lockdown happened, Cheryl was not going to let all that hard work go to waste - no clubs, no problem.  She said: ""I was just ready to tour and perform because that's where my heart is and then of course Miss Pandemica comes in and we're locked inside our houses.  ""So what do I do? I start doing digital shows from my living room."" ""It was a very strange experience, obviously we're so used to applause and smiley faces and interactions and suddenly you're performing to a green dot and you've got a comment feed of people being like 'yes that was amazing' so that was some adjusting."" The lack of audience ""took the pressure off"" and gave her the confidence to try new material.  ""Now, as an artist, if the crowd isn't feeling something, then I turn it up, I amp up what I'm doing. It felt very free to just perform how you wanted."" ""I was lucky we had that time locked up in a house,"" she said. ""It was unfortunate circumstances but, as a creative, it really pushed me to try different things, to go explore different avenues and I think if I didn't have that I still would have been stuck in a box of things I thought I could only do. ""I'm pushing boundaries."" However, as freeing and fun as digital shows might have been she was only ""doing drag from the waist up"", and there's nothing like being back in front of a crowd.  ""It was so much fun to see people again!"" And now she's ready to show the world Cheryl 2.0, represent Essex and put on a performance that shows drag as a true artform.  She said: ""Drag is one of those artforms that people don't realise they've had their entire lives; from pantomime dames to Lily Savage on your Saturday night TV and Dame Edna Everage.  ""I think shows like Drag Race have put drag on the 'mainstream' platform. It's become visible again and it's become a viable art form, whereas people would have just put it to the side to pubs and clubs."" After nearly 10 years of drag, Cheryl said she is ""honoured"" to part of UK drag's evolution and journey.  ""At the end of the day we are just artists, putting our craft out to the world, no different from an artist in the Louvre painting or a sculpture at the Tate Modern.  ""We are living, breathing art that is there to enjoy and obviously we love people to watch - so come and enjoy the show."" Cheryl wants to show the world what Essex is all about and says she's ready to win the Race. She said: ""When I got that call to come back for round two, the remix, I was so excited because there's been so much growth and evolution in my drag since the first show that I was so ready to show Cheryl 2.0 and that I wasn't so mediocre anymore."" Realising this was a truly international competition with queens from all over the world taking part, Cheryl said she knew she had to bring her A game.  ""I knew I had to represent my Essex to the best and show the absolute glamour we have to bring.  ""I'm just glad I've had two years to step up my wardrobe and show people the fully fledged Essex glamour."" But there's more to the show than individual queens and Cheryl says the opportunity to see culturally-different approaches to drag was ""fascinating"".  ""It was so incredible learning from all these different people because the way that people approach drag in Thailand versus Holland versus Canada it's just fascinating, especially in the times that we've been through,"" she said. Cheryl promises it will ""blow your minds because there is so much talent, so much drama and so many popcorn moments that you are just going to be on the edge of your seat every single Tuesday without fail.""

Spread to UST,Five ways China's past has shaped its present,2024-09-25,2018-04-19,By Prof Rana Mitter,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-43714279,"To understand today's headlines about China's approach to issues such as trade, foreign policy or internet censorship, turn to its past.  The country is perhaps more aware of its own history than any other major society on earth. That remembering is certainly partial - events like Mao's Cultural Revolution are still very difficult to discuss within China itself. But it is striking how many echoes of the past can be found in its present.   China remembers a time when it was forced to trade against its will. Today it regards Western efforts to open its markets as a reminder of that unhappy period. The US and China are currently in a dispute over whether China is selling into the US while closing its own markets to American goods. Yet the balance of trade hasn't always been in China's favour.    In Beijing, there are long memories of a period, nearly a century and a half ago, when China had little control over its own trade.  Britain attacked China in a series of Opium Wars, starting in 1839.  In the decades that followed, Britain founded an institution called the Imperial Maritime Customs Service to fix tariffs on goods imported into China.   It was part of the Chinese government, but it was a very British institution, run not by a mandarin from Beijing, but a man from Portadown.  Sir Robert Hart ended up becoming inspector-general of the Customs of China, which became a fiefdom for Brits for a century afterwards. Hart was honest and helped to generate a great deal of income for China.   But the memories of that time still rankle.  It was very different in the Ming dynasty, in the early 15th Century, when Admiral Zheng took seven great fleets to South East Asia, Ceylon and even the coast of East Africa to trade and show off China's might.  Zheng He's voyages were partly about making an impression. Few other empires could boast the massive fleets that it sent out across the oceans, and it was also an opportunity for strange and wonderful items be brought back to Beijing - such as China's first giraffe.  However, trade was also important, particularly in other parts of Asia. And Zhen could, and did, fight when he wanted to, defeating at least one ruler of Ceylon. Yet his voyages were a rare example of a state-driven maritime project. Most of China's overseas trade for the next few centuries would be unofficial. China has always been concerned to keep states on its borders pacified. That's part of the reason it deals so warily with an unpredictable North Korea today. This is not the first time that China has had problems with those on its borders.  In fact, history reveals it has had worse neighbours than North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who recently made a surprise visit to Beijing, his first known foreign trip since taking office in 2011. During the Song dynasty in 1127, a woman named Li Qingzhao fled her home in the city of Kaifeng. We know her story because she was one of China's finest poets, and her works are still widely read. She went on the run because her state was under attack.   A people from the north, the Jurchen, had burst into China after a long period of uneasy alliance with the ruling Song dynasty's emperor. The elite of China's civilisation had to spread themselves across the country as cities burned.   Li Qingzhao saw her beloved art collection scattered between various cities. Her dynasty's fate was an object lesson that appeasing the neighbours may work for only so long.   For some time, the Jin dynasty ruled Northern China, and the Song founded a new realm in the south. But in the end, both fell to a new conqueror, the Mongols.   The shifting lines on the map show that the definition of China has changed over time. Chinese culture is associated with certain ideas such as language, history and ethical systems like Confucianism.   However, other peoples, including Manchus and Mongols from the north, have taken China's throne at various points, ruling the country using the same ideas and principles upon which their ethnic Chinese counterparts relied.   These neighbours did not always stay put. But sometimes they embraced and exercised Chinese values just as effectively as the people from whom they took them.   Today China's internet censors politically sensitive material, and those who utter political truths deemed problematic by the authorities may be arrested or worse.   The difficulty of speaking truth to power has long been an issue. China's historians have often felt they had to write what the state wanted rather than what they thought was important.  But Sima Qian - often dubbed China's ""grand historian"" - chose a different path. The author of one of the most important works chronicling China's past, in the 1st Century BC, he dared to defend a general who had lost a battle.  In doing so he was held to have snubbed the emperor, and was sentenced to castration.   Yet he left behind a legacy which has shaped the writing of history in China to this day.   His Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) mixed different types of sources, critiqued figures from the historical past, and also used the techniques of oral history to find out directly from participants what had actually happened.   All of this was a very new way of doing history, but it set a precedent for later writers: if you were willing to risk your safety, you could write history ""warts and all"", rather than censoring yourself.  Modern China is much more tolerant of religious practice than in the days of Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution - within limits -  but past experience makes it cautious about faith-driven movements which could potentially spiral out of control and pose a challenge to the government. Records show that openness to religion has long been part of Chinese history.  At the height of the Tang dynasty in the 7th Century, the Empress Wu Zetian embraced Buddhism as a way of pushing back against what she must have regarded as the stifling norms of China's Confucian traditions.   In the Ming dynasty, the Jesuit Matteo Ricci arrived at court and was treated as a respected interlocutor, although there was perhaps more interest in his knowledge of Western science than his slightly wan attempts to convert his listeners.   But faith has always been a dangerous business.  In the late 19th Century, China was convulsed by a rebellion started by Hong Xiuquan, a man who claimed to be Jesus's younger brother.  The Taiping rebellion promised to bring a kingdom of heavenly peace to China but actually led to one of the bloodiest civil wars in history, killing as many as 20 million people, according to some accounts.  Government troops initially failed to tame the rebels, and had to allow local soldiers to reform themselves before they eventually put down the Taiping with great cruelty in 1864.  Christianity would be at the centre of another uprising some decades later. In 1900, peasant rebels calling themselves Boxers would appear in north China, calling for death to Christian missionaries and converts, the latter being characterised as traitors to China.   At first, the Imperial Court backed them, which led to the death of many Chinese Christians, before the uprising was eventually put down.  Through much of the following century, and to the present day, the Chinese state has veered between tolerance of religion, and the fear that it may upend the state. Today China seeks to become a world hub for new technology. A century ago it went through an earlier industrial revolution - and women were central to both. China is a world leader when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), voice recognition, and big data.  A large number of the smartphones around the world are built with Chinese-made chips. Many of the factories which manufacture them are staffed by young women who often endure horrific conditions of work, but who are also finding a place in the industrial market economy for the first time.   They have inherited the experience of the young women who came 100 years ago to the factories that sprang up in Shanghai and the Yangtze delta.   They were not making computer chips, but silk and cotton threads.   Work was hard and likely to cause lung disease or physical injury, and conditions in the workers' dormitories were spartan.  Yet the women also recalled the pleasure of having their own wages, however, small, and the ability to visit a fair or theatre on a rare holiday.  Some made the journey to look - probably not buy - at the shiny new department stores in central Shanghai, one of the ultimate symbols of modernity.   Today, on Nanjing Road in that city, you can still see China's new working and middle class enjoying a wide range of consumer goods as part of China's contemporary tech-driven economy. We are living through another significantly transformative era for China. Future historians will note that a country that was poor and inward-looking in 1978 became - within a quarter of a century - the second biggest economy in the world.   They will also note that China was the most important country to push back against what had seemed like an inevitable tide of democratisation.  Perhaps other factors such as the one-child policy (now ended) and the use of AI surveillance may catch future writers' attention. Or maybe it will be something else to do with the environment, space exploration or economic growth, which is not yet even obvious to us.  One thing is almost certain - a century from now, China will still be a place of fascination for those who live there and those who live with it, and its rich history will continue to inform its present and future direction.

The hoard of 300 potins, which are an early version of a coin, were found in Hillingdon, following a storm which helped reveal their position. Archaeologists have dated them to the 1st century BC, at a time when the Romans were beginning to establish themselves in Britain. The discovery has been described as a ""once-in-a-lifetime find"". Each of the potins are about 3cm (1.2 in) in diameter and are based on coins struck in Marseille, France, about 2,175 years ago. On one side they show a stylised image of the head of Greek god Apollo, while a charging bull is on the other. Emma Tetlow, historic environment lead for HS2's main contractors Skanska, Costain and Strabag, explained how her team had been ""coming to the end of our archaeological work... when we found a patch of soil that was a very different colour"" following a storm which had altered the ground conditions. ""The patch of soil was dark greeny-blue, which suggests oxidised metal, and when we checked more closely, we could see loosely packed metal discs."" She described the discovery as ""a once-in-a-lifetime find"". The potins, which have been named the ""Hillingdon Hoard"", were taken to Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery to be cleaned and preserved so specialists to investigate them further. Coins were not thought to have been used for the exchange of goods and service at the time and archaeologists believe the hoard may have been used to mark the boundary of a property or was an offering to the gods. Hoards are also thought to have been buried in isolated locations as emergency savings for times of crisis. Potins like these from the late Iron Age like have been found previously but in much smaller quantities meaning this find is considered very significant. The value of the hoard has yet to be determined and a coroner is to decide whether they can be considered ""treasure"", meaning they can be acquired by a museum. Helen Wass, HS2's head of heritage, said the discovery ""provides us with more information about how our ancestors lived and settled in London""."
Spread to UST,"'Not safe to reopen schools,' warn teachers' unions",2024-09-25,2020-05-13,By Sean Coughlan,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-52650259,"Plans to reopen primary schools in England do not have adequate safety measures and need to be halted, warns an alliance of school teachers' unions. A joint education union statement called on the government to ""step back"" from a 1 June start date. In the House of Commons, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson warned against ""scaremongering"" over safety. But his department's chief scientific adviser cast doubt on suggestions the virus spreads less among children. Mr Williamson, facing questions from MPs on reopening schools, rejected fears over safety and said it was the most disadvantaged who were losing out from schools being closed. ""Sometimes scaremongering, making people fear, is really unfair and not a welcome pressure to be placed on families, children and teachers alike,"" he told MPs. Mr Williamson said that pupils, like teachers, would be a priority for testing if they or their families showed symptoms. The Liberal Democrats' education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, challenged the education secretary to publish the scientific evidence on which the return to school was based. But the Department for Education's chief scientific adviser, Osama Rahman, appearing before the Science and Technology Committee, said decisions around opening schools, such as which year groups went back first, had not been taken by the department. Asked whether he had assessed the safety guidance given to schools and how it might be implemented, the DFE's scientific adviser told MPs: ""I haven't."" As such he was unable to say what evidence was behind the decision to reopen schools - or to say how many under-18s had died from the virus. And Mr Rahman told MPs there was only ""low confidence"" in evidence suggesting that children transmit Covid-19 any less than adults. ""As a former teacher listening to this I don't think the profession is going to be at all satisfied by what they are hearing at the moment,"" said Scottish National Party MP Carol Monaghan. Patrick Roach, leader of the Nasuwt teachers' union, said the DFE adviser's comments were ""truly shocking and disturbing"". The Department for Education later circulated a letter from Mr Rahman in which he said he had been ""closely involved"" in advising on reopening schools - and that he had ""full confidence in in the plan to reopen education institutions for all the reasons set out by the government"". In their joint statement, nine unions, including the National Education Union and the National Association of Head Teachers, rejected the plans for a phased return of primary school pupils after half term - saying it was still too early to be safe. The unions called for a delay until a ""full roll-out of a national test and trace scheme"" was in place and there were extra resources for cleaning, protective equipment and risk assessments. The joint statement said that ""classrooms of four and five-year olds could become sources of Covid-19 transmission and spread"". ""We call on the government to step back from the 1st June and work with us to create the conditions for a safe return to schools."" But Mr Williamson told MPs that opening schools was the ""responsible"" course of action, now the virus was ""past the peak"" and that safety was uppermost in how it was being planned. ""The best place for children to be educated and to learn is in school,"" he said, particularly for the disadvantaged who would be most likely to fall further behind. Instead of a fixed date for a return, Labour's shadow education secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, argued that schools should reopen only when there was clear evidence it was safe. ""The guidance provided so far does not yet provide the clear assurances over safety that are needed,"" she told MPs. She said that families were still worried about the implications of pupils going back to school, such as for relatives who might have illnesses. In Wales, the First Minister Mark Drakeford has said schools would not open on 1 June. In Scotland, it is not expected that schools will re-open before the summer holidays. In Northern Ireland, Education Minister Peter Weir has spoken of a possible phased return of schools in September."

It features the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and his two daughters, Katharine and Ellie. Vicar of Dibley co-writer Paul Mayhew-Archer and young author Frasier Cox and his mum Karina. KATE - It's time for your regular dose of Disability Talk for July 2018. Conversation big and small - hold on, are they calling me big because you're small? SIMON - I'm not even getting involved. KATE - Humour and that variety of honesty you know and love us for. I'm Kate Monaghan. SIMON - And I'm Simon Minty. We have six guests around the table today and I have a feeling we'll be jumping into all kinds of fascinating conversations. No pressure everyone. There's gaining a disability later in life, dealing with mental health difficulties from an early age, compassion, sitcoms, refugees, books and the Church. KATE - So much going on here.  SIMON - It's packed. KATE - Yeah. Anyway, let's introduce our guests. Now we are very honoured to have with us the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and his two daughters, Katharine and Ellie. Hello everybody. ALL - Hi. KATE - How are we all today? KATHARINE - Good. KATE - Good? ELLIE - Good, yeah. JUSTIN - I'm very well. KATE - Now, your press office call you ABC. You're known as Your Grace, Archbishop; what are we supposed to call you? JUSTIN - I'm very relaxed with Justin. KATE - Okay, Justin. SIMON - That works for us.  KATE - Simon, are you happy with Justin? SIMON - Very much so. KATE - Okay, good. Katharine and Ellie what do you call him? Do you have to call him Father? [Laughter] Your Grace, father or dad, what? KATHARINE - He insists on formal terms only, so Your Grace is generally what we go with.  KATE - Archbishop dad? JUSTIN - Ellie, tell the truth.  ELLIE - I call him sometimes dad. Well, I call him dad or daddy, depending on what we're talking about.  KATE - Nice. SIMON - So, he's daddy when you want something and… ELLIE - No.  FRASIER - Depending what mood you're in. ELLIE - It's more because I'm a daddy's girl!  KATE - Nice. SIMON - Next along the table is ten year old Frasier Cox and mum Karina. Hello Frasier. FRASIER- Hello. SIMON - You recently published a book.  FRASIER- Yes. SIMON - Can you tell me what it's called? FRASIER- I did. So, I published a book called There's a Boy Just Like Me, and it centres around a boy who knows another boy who happens to be a refugee. SIMON - I just had a little look at it and it's all about what they've got in common.  FRASIER- Yeah, it sort of talks about what they've got in common and how they relate to each other. And then it sort of starts talking about how they're different in a way, but if anything that brings them closer together, and how it shows that we're all human on the inside despite what we're going through.  SIMON - Awesome. Mum, Frasier is on the autistic spectrum but seems to have put paid to that stereotype which says autistic people don't have empathy. KARINA - Yeah. Autism is definitely a huge spectrum but he has a lot of compassion. And I think it's actually helped in lots of ways because he just has anxiety, and that anxiety means that he then worries about everyone else as well as himself. KATE - And last, but not least, Paul Mayhew-Archer. As a writer and producer of comedy he has credits which include Mrs Brown's Boys, My Hero and Spitting Image. But seeing as we've got the Archbishop of Canterbury here we should also mention that you co-wrote the Vicar of Dibley with Richard Curtis. And it came about because Richard wanted to see if you could write a comedy about a good person. Is comedy generally only about bad people then? PAUL - Well, the central characters of comedies tend to be deeply flawed, irritating, angry people if you think of Black Adder or Basil Fawlty or people like that. But actually you can do comedy about very good people because one of the problems they have is that they can't say no, so they will end up having four Christmas lunches because they can't let anybody down.  JUSTIN - That was a memorable episode. Mrs Brown's Boys though I think she's quite a sympathetic character. PAUL - She is a sympathetic character underlying it all. She's actually - it's about motherhood.  JUSTIN - Yeah.  KATE - Does the Archbishop of Canterbury watch Mrs Brown's Boys then? JUSTIN - I watched it whenever it was last on, was it Saturday, Friday, I can't remember. It's a good way of unwinding.  SIMON - It doesn't unwind everybody. It sort of gets me a little bit itchy. PAUL - There was one reviewer who wrote, ""I'm sorry, after I watched this I had to go and have a shower to get myself completely clean."" And I thought that's taking it a little bit far, isn't it? JUSTIN - That's the kind of thing they say about me. [Laughter] KATE - Right, so next month Paul you'll be at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival with a new show about a relatively new thing for you, which is living with Parkinson's. And we'll be talking to you about that a little bit later. But first of all, Archbishop Justin, Mr Welby… SIMON - You're so excited aren't you, Kate? KATE - I am very excited about having you here.  SIMON - You're just so excited! KATE - But to put you at ease we've decided - and I say we, I decided - to give you a quick-fire quiz. Now, this is very quick and I want your first answers only. Don't look at your press officer just because she's through there to try and save you. No saving from this.  JUSTIN - I was just checking she's not having a sort of heart attack. PAUL - She will. KATE - Are you ready for this? JUSTIN - I am.  KATE - Okay, first answers only. Ready? Chips or chocolate? JUSTIN - Chocolate. KATE - Mum or dad? JUSTIN - Mum. KATE - Matthew, Mark, Luke or John? JUSTIN - John. KATE - Vicar of Dibley or Father Ted? JUSTIN - Father Ted. ALL - Ooh!  PAUL - I'm going now! [Laughter] KATE - Bye. SIMON - That's the problem with honesty. KATE - Back Street Boys or S Club 7? JUSTIN - S Club 7. I've no idea what you're talking about! KATE - Text or phone call? SIMON - Your daughters are exasperated.  KATE - Text or phone call? JUSTIN - Ooh, text. KATE - Mary or Joseph? JUSTIN - Mary.  KATE - Carpentry or oil investments? JUSTIN - Oh, neither. Boring.  KATE - Christmas or Easter?  JUSTIN - Easter.  KATE - Okay. Harsh? Too harsh? SIMON - No, I wanted to ask supplementary questions with every answer but we've got to move on.  JUSTIN - There you go.  SIMON - Thank you for doing that. So, we've got you here, Justin, because on 13th July you are hosting a conference at Lambeth Palace about disabled people and the Church. And there are two great words that jump out to me from the press release about the event, and they are value and belonging. Lots of people listening might be used to the idea that the Church is there to help, and we know Jesus often healed the sick and the lame, but this seems to be a strong new message that the Church of England is putting out around inclusion. Can you tell me a little bit more?  JUSTIN - I think it's something I'm very aware of, partly through family, partly though observation that the Church has, over the years, not been very good at inclusion. And we have some basic problems: you have 9,000 listed buildings, most built over 900 years ago, and they have steps and things and there's not a lot you can do about that.  SIMON - Getting in is tricky. JUSTIN - Did you know - sorry, I go off on my hobbyhorse very quickly - did you know that certainly up till about four years ago, and I think it's still true, that heritage preservation overalls disability access? SIMON - Uh-huh, we did know.  KATE - Yeah.  JUSTIN - And I think that's not good enough.  KATE - Yeah.  JUSTIN - Anyway, so I've got that comment in. Secondly, Katharine's experience and Ellie's experience with learning difficulties and dyspraxia and mental health has really brought it to the front of my mind. And thirdly, like all of us either we have particular disabilities or we know lots of people with disabilities and the Church needs to include them and make them welcome. And there's still an attitude that if you're not, you know that illusion of being without disability, that somehow you're not fit for instance to be ordained. And it's just rubbish. SIMON - You think that personal connection, sometimes this happens that it's the family connection that brings it a little bit more present, or do you think that you might have done this anyway, is this a perfect storm? JUSTIN - I think I would have done it anyway because this is something that's been on my mind for a long time. But I think the family connection gives it an emotional edge.  KATE - I'm very interested in your thoughts and feelings on healing. Because I know that Jesus did a lot of healing, and as a Christian I've been in church, and obviously I have a disability, and people say to me, well have you prayed enough about it, have you let me pray for you about it. And I often think, well stop asking, stop talking to me. Is it that my faith isn't strong enough to be healed? What is your opinion on it? JUSTIN - I think, well first of all I've often prayed with people for healing, and for me the problem with healing is not that God never heals or that God always heals, it's just that God just seems sometimes to heal.  KATE - Yeah.  JUSTIN - And I've prayed with people and seen people where there's been a significant change, and that's fantastic, but not in any of the things that have affected me or the family most deeply. So, I live in that same confusion.  And I know exactly what you mean: I've had times when something's been going on and people have said, well could we pray for you, and if I wasn't the Archbishop I'd have actually said, I'd really prefer that you didn't. KATE - [Laughs] JUSTIN - But I feel that I can't always say that.  KATE - Yeah.  JUSTIN - What I notice about Jesus is he never treats people other than with perfect respect and love and affection. So he never manipulates, he never puts pressure on them, he never treats them in any way other than you or I would want to be treated. And obviously it's right to pray, praying is simply about bringing what's in your heart before God, letting him change what's in your heart. And sometimes he changes the situation you've brought as well.  KATE - And have you prayed for healing for Katharine and Ellie? JUSTIN - Yes. I haven't prayed - I haven't talked to Ellie about this - I pray for Katharine's mental health a lot, every day. I haven't prayed that Ellie - we had this discussion once around the table when Ellie wasn't there.  ELLIE - That's nice.  JUSTIN - Which we should have probably done.  KATE - Talk about and not to. JUSTIN - Because someone had asked me the question. We talk about a lot of things in the family and I said, what do people think. And one of your, it was your younger sister said, but if God changed Ellie she wouldn't be Ellie, and we love Ellie. So, there's that thing that Ellie's Ellie, she's precious.  KATE - And Ellie how do you feel about that? Would you want to be prayed for? ELLIE - It's a difficult one because sometimes when it comes down to the topic of healing and stuff, especially the last few weeks I would say, I have felt a bit like, well if God heals why am I still dyspraxic, why do I still find it really difficult to do things. But at the same time it doesn't change the way I trust God, the way I believe in God, it's just something… healing is a topic that I find quite difficult really to get my head around.  KATE - Absolutely, I completely agree. SIMON - There's that distinction of if you're having a very acute or a very difficult time and people want you to be well; but that's very different from just being and living with a disability, which doesn't need healing. That's when we want to get better access because that would be the solution.  JUSTIN - That's right. That puts it very well.  SIMON - It depends where they're at. I have a question for the modern church. I think it was a date, I met a young lady not so long ago.  KATE - Hold on, you think it was a date. Were you on a date or were you not on a date, Simon? SIMON - I thought it was, I don't think she did. [Laughter] And she revealed to me that she does healing hands. And I was like, oh this is interesting. And then she went on and said, but I can't always get there because it's a lot of travel so I do it down the phone. Does that count? Can you do healing down the phone? Paul? PAUL - Well, I have a friend who's in Yorkshire and she sends me healing. But I don't think it's down the phone. I think it's just through the ether. SIMON - WiFi. [Laughter] PAUL - It's just a… JUSTIN - YouTube. PAUL - And she certainly doesn't text it do I don't know. And I don't quite know whether it's having an effect or not, because I don't know when she's sending it.  SIMON - Yes. PAUL - So, is it on a day when I'm feeling a bit better. I don't understand.  KATE - Justin, can we have healing down the phone or via text message?  JUSTIN - Well, healing isn't the… no one heals anyone in that way. It's God who does the healing, and God can do it any way God likes to do it.  PAUL - Can I ask, has your faith been tested at times by…? JUSTIN - Oh hugely. It's reasonably well, well very widely known that one of our children died in a car crash. And in the five days she was in hospital, it's a long time ago now, everyone in the church and we were praying, everyone was praying. And then we've had various serious illnesses. A year later one of our children was very, very seriously ill. And yes, there have been moments where it's been a huge test.  But I start with the fact that Jesus rose from the dead, and then I say I'm going to have to put a lot of these things onto a list that I'm going to ask awkward questions about when I meet him.  PAUL - Right, yes. But you're prepared for that? JUSTIN - Yeah. I just say well, you read the bible and life's not simple. And obviously not everyone gets healed because all the apostles are dead, so you can draw the conclusions really: they all died of something.  PAUL - Yes.  JUSTIN - I remember one of the episodes - the only reason I said Father Ted… PAUL - No, no, that's perfectly all right.  JUSTIN - I'm really worried about that. PAUL - I love Father Ted. JUSTIN - It's just that she's so very good at what she does. And I was in a rural parish and I'd just occasionally feel I wish I was a bit better at what I'd done. [Laughter] She said something about this, she has a lot of questions to ask God. PAUL - Yes. JUSTIN - You know you did those little dialogues at the very end.  PAUL - In the vestry, yes.  JUSTIN - The vestry sort of things, and that often comes up in that kind of thing. They were great.  KATE - Can I just bring Katharine in now? You live with mental health problems.  KATHARINE - Uh-huh. KATE - Do you find that that tests your faith and your maybe belief in healing or just generally belief in God? Because we all know what it's like to have a very dark time.  KATHARINE - Yeah. Healing is one of my kind of hobbyhorses really when it comes to Church and inclusion and welcome, because if it's the first response when people hear that you're having a hard time - and I've had it lot where someone comes up to you, you're talking to someone after the service and they say, how are you, and I tend to say how I am, which is not always good - I find that often the response will either to be to walk away, kind of looking a bit uncomfortable, not without saying anything but be like, ""Oh right, that sounds hard, I've just got to um, uh…"" SIMON - It's a sort of conversation stopper.  KATHARINE - Yeah. Or to offer to pray for healing. And I think with mental health, as with any disability, if your first response is, can I pray for your healing, then you're not listening. Because actually: A, you don't need to say to someone you're praying for their healing for God to be able to work; God's bigger than that; and B, it really shuts down the conversation. I now actually only let a very few people pray for my healing because I've had so many really awful experiences of things that people have said and the way that they've behaved. They don't do it on purpose, they're trying to help, they're trying to be helpful, but they're not listening. And inclusion and welcome in church is about so much more than accessibility physically. It's about… KATE - Like what? Can you think of a time when it's happened?  KATHARINE - What people have said to me? KATE - Yes, and you've had to… KATHARINE - I was once prayed for, I went up for pray and someone prayed an addiction to negative thinking off me. And I'm like, I'm not addicted to negative thinking, I'm depressed and anxious medically so. And actually it's a chemical thing going on with me, it's not an addiction. And that was really unhelpful. And even though theologically I think I'm reasonably aware of the fact that that's just not an accurate way to pray for someone, even then I felt very unsettled by that and I went and got somebody else to pray for me, to pray the prayer that had just been prayed off me.  SIMON - No. A counter prayer.  KATHARINE - Yeah. Please counteract this ridiculous person's prayer. [Laughter] I think there's so much more that you can do as a first response to somebody who is coming to you with these kinds of issues.  KATE - And what would you like that first response to be? KATHARINE - Well, things like I once spoke to a church where you'd arrive and there'd be four people on the door to welcome you, so you'd already be like welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, and you're like ah. And if you're really anxious, I would rather come in and get my bearings. So, you've already been bombarded by people that you don't necessarily know, who are all smiling and being very friendly. And then you go in and there was the café right at the back, so you go in to a whole crowd of people, you've got no time to get your bearings.  And something as simple as that, as just having one person on the door to say, ""Hi, welcome"" and you can get in and you have space to work out where things are before you have to get involved in meeting people or doing whatever, just that gives you that moment to catch your breath.  KATE - And Ellie, how would you like to be welcomed? Like coming into church what would help you, what would you like to see? ELLIE - I'd quite them to be a bit more aware of who is coming in, not to be kind of there. Just look out for who might need a bit of assistance. Don't come over and make a big fuss, because this can be quite in your face. Just be a little more welcoming. And if you notice there's someone new in your church who might look a bit shy or they're struggling to stand for a whole service pay attention and take it in. Don't be overbearing but gently go over and ask, is there anything I can help you with.  But in the church I go to now I sit at the back because I don't really feel comfortable. They're very friendly in my church, but sometimes I can feel a bit out of place there, so I tend to sit at the back. If anyone comes over that's great, if they don't, I go to work afterwards anyway, so… Yeah. SIMON - I always think there's that tricky bit with disability when someone, and it's not always religious, it could be generally when they're coming over and trying to be kind to you but actually it's a bit too much. ELLIE - Yes. SIMON - And then you've got to be careful how you push back, because you don't want to become rude, but at the same time it's a bit… I mean, broadening it out, Justin, in terms of the conference and how the church can be more accessible for those people who might not fit in at the moment, what are some of the things you're hoping for? JUSTIN  - Well what we've worked very hard at for the conference is that there are various disability groups within the Church of England, and I think we've got pretty well all of them coming. It'll now turn out of course that we miss someone, but I think we've done our best to get everyone there. And I've got to sort of switch from transmit to receive at this conference and not only listen to the stories, but listen to people's suggestions and think, okay, let's put together how we're going to work at the culture, how we're going to change things. What are the things we can change quickly? What are the things that will take longer? I mean, I find it absolutely extraordinary that ancient buildings, that disability access comes second to heritage. I really find that bizarre, because that means that people come into these fabulous, amazing spaces, and I've run, I've been in charge of two cathedrals, or one cathedral, and second in charge of another cathedral, and the negotiations you have to go through so that someone with, for instance a mobility issue, is able to get and see the things that everybody else can. Well, that's one way of saying we don't care about you, isn't it?  KATE - Right at the access point.  JUSTIN - Right at the access point.  KATHARINE - That's before you even get into the cathedral. JUSTIN - So we'll listen to that, we'll try and come to some common views, but the main thing, I'll be sitting there listening and taking lots of notes, and thinking okay, how between us in the church can we…? What happens in the parishes, on the whole, people are brilliant, because people, they do care for people.  SIMON - And they know people and it's… yes. JUSTIN - They know people and they say, ""Oh, it's Ellie,"" you know, or they say, oh it's, you know. And there's a real acceptance, but what we need is for that not to be in spite of the institution but to be because of the institution, if that makes any sense. SIMON - Well yes, it's a kind of a rule or a policy that might be a little bit old. I'm thinking of some disabled friends who, the nature of their condition would mean, I don't know, involuntary noises or sounds and movements and so on.  JUSTIN - Yes, absolutely.  SIMON - Could you see a day where they can come, they can pray, and they'll be making exclamations? I'm thinking of Jess Thom with her Tourettes. It's almost like a relaxed performance in the theatre. Do you think this will come? JUSTIN - I think we can… Yes, I mean there'll be many parish churches where that would be fine, once they got to know someone. And you do have to go through a process of educating people.  KATHARINE - To get rid of the frowns. JUSTIN - Get rid of the frowns and the tuts.  SIMON - I thought the tuts.  JUSTIN - The tutting churches. KATHARINE - But that's the problem, because actually you need to educate first, because if someone goes in and the first week they're there they get tutted at then they're not going to come back.  PAUL - They won't come back.  JUSTIN - They won't come back, that's exactly the point.  KATHARINE - So you've already shut someone out at that point. KATE - Paul? PAUL - And it's what you were saying about the fact that if people come across and say can we do anything, the more open that question is, rather than saying we assume we know what you need, that's the worst thing you can…  KATHARINE - It's about listening.  KATE - Katharine? KATHARINE - I mean the thing that Ellie said about standing or sitting in church, you know, I often find it uncomfortable if everyone else is standing to sing and I, you know, I've got chronic fatigue as well, and I then need to sit down, then you can feel quite uncomfortable, like people are looking at you like you're not paying attention or not engaging properly or something.  JUSTIN - Funnily enough, I've just noticed in the last six months to a year that increasingly I'm finding in more and more services people are saying, where it says in the service sheet please stand, stand if it's convenient, if it's not, don't worry.   SIMON - That was the Paralympics. Stand if you can.  JUSTIN - Stand if you can. And that's a very small thing but it doesn't half change… change the atmosphere.  PAUL - Because none of those things matter do they? JUSTIN - No, it doesn't matter tuppence.  SIMON - Well, also when I've been in church and everyone stands it makes no difference whether I'm standing or sitting, I'm the same height, because of my height. So I don't bother, but I've also thought, well I know God's going to be fine with this, this really isn't the critical bit, it's just the other people. So that's the bit we need to maybe unravel. KATHARINE - It's culture and attitudes and understanding that everyone's needs and capabilities are different and that everyone's style of church or way of connecting with God is different as well. Because actually, I find it a lot easier to focus on God if I'm sitting down, because I'm so tired that if I'm standing up I'm thinking about how I'm going to remain standing, rather than focusing on God.  KATE - Absolutely. And there are some great churches out there that do things really well, you know.  KATHARINE - There are some brilliant ones.  KATE - It's not all churches. Some churches, there's a long way to go, but other churches are fabulous and brilliant.  SIMON - The Church of England Disability Conference will take place on July 13th. I hope it goes really well.  JUSTIN - Thank you.  SIMON - A bit of a handbrake turn away from disability matters for a second. Justin, this is my mum's question. You'll be christening Prince Louis soon, these big occasions, what are they like for you? JUSTIN - Er… very nerve wracking. You know, if you're at the wedding don't drop the rings and if you're at the baptism don't drop the baby. It kind of matters. No, it's huge fun. The baptism, they're a wonderful family, there's lots of love and it'll be a great occasion, I'm looking forward to it. It's a huge privilege to do it.  KATE - And did you get some tips from Bishop Michael Curry for the next sermon? JUSTIN - I'm not preaching at that service. [Laughter] Yes, if I could preach like Michael I'd be really, really happy. No, it was just fabulous.  KATE - It was quite the moment wasn't it?  JUSTIN - It was spectacular. It was spectacular. I saw… what really… the following Monday I think it was, one of the biggest national selling newspapers printed the entire sermon verbatim and put at the top to their readers, 'Cut this out, put it on your wall, and when you're feeling down read it'. SIMON - Goodness. JUSTIN - And, you know, I don't know. If I could get there I'd be a very happy bunny. [Laughs]  KATE - Now Archbishop Justin, Katharine and Ellie are going to stay with us and dip into our discussions for the rest of the programme. But now we're moving on to talk to you, Frasier, and mum, Karina. And I do think Archbishop Justin might be particularly interested in your book, because he's talked a lot about how we should be helping child refugees in particular. Now, Frasier, you beat 1,300 other children in a competition to get your story published by The Book People. 1,300 other kids? FRASIER - Yeah. KATE - That's quite something. Now have you always enjoyed writing?  FRASIER - Yes, I've always enjoyed it. My love of books, which I definitely do have, has really converted into a love of making books and a love of writing, yeah.  KATE - And how did you get into this competition then? Where did this story idea come from and what made you enter it? FRASIER- Well, originally the story itself was actually a piece of homework, and I did it and we just had to write a story, and I think through my passion, I've always had a passion for these refugees, and I thought this was the perfect way to sort of express my passion. So the homework did really well and I thought, you know what, this has a really good message, I could spread it on. So I tried to find some sort of way to get it to do something else. So when I saw the competition I thought that was my perfect opportunity.  KATE - And what's your book about?  FRASIER- So, it's about this boy who lives in a country that doesn't have refugees, and what happened is he knows about this other boy who has come to this country who happens to be a refugee. And he starts thinking about this boy and he thinks about how they're the same and then he starts thinking about how they're different. And that leads up to how it shows that they're the same on the inside and it shows how, not just those two boys, all of us as humans are all human on the inside and we can all come together as a community.  SIMON - So the comments from people who have bought the book on the website had pretty similar words of praise. Here's an example. ""I am stunned that this book was written by a nine year old boy. The story is beautifully written, it carries a powerful message, and the illustrations are stunning. My children, who are ten and six, love the story, and my ten year old was incredibly inspired by Frasier's journey to becoming a published author. Highly recommended."" So what do you think about that then?  FRASIER- I think that when I entered it and when it won, when I was seeing it being published and seeing the illustrations and just the book itself evolve into what it is today, I was really thinking about the message that I put into it, and I was actually wondering how the book is going to incorporate that message. Because I think one of the most important things about my book is how it sort of spreads this message and show and educates these people about these refugees and why it's important to help them. So when I saw the response from everyone I was very happy, because I knew that the thing that I'd worked hard to get taken in has worked, and my cunning plan has worked. [Laughter] KATE - It certainly has. How do you think your kind of autism and Asperger's played into being able to write this story? FRASIER- Well, as having Asperger's, people with Asperger's have anxiety and it affects how we think about other people and it makes us feel very worried about some people. And I think when I found out about refugees when I was much, much younger Mum was getting some stuff together to donate and I kept asking her all these questions. And I wanted to know why it was happening, because I just suddenly became really passionate when I found out why is this happening; are they going to be okay? And I think that really does relate to my Asperger's.  PAUL - Can I ask, what's the downside of your Asperger's? Because it just seems to me you've written this extraordinary book and you're extraordinarily eloquent talking about it, I mean it just seems like… KARINA- It's other people. PAUL - It's other people.  KARINA - Yes, it's just the non-understanding and the non-compassion from everyone else.  PAUL - And how does that express itself? How do they… ? KARINA- I think it's just that, you know, he's great, I love him obviously, I've always known that he was autistic since he was tiny, but he was my first child, so I've always… PAUL - But what is it other people do then? KARINA - I've always understood him because he's my first child. He's always been that way, but other people don't. He's non neurotypical and other people will only understand neurotypical people. So if he goes into a classroom and actually doesn't want to socialise with the other children, wants to go off and play with something and they'll be like, oh he's a bit strange, he's a bit weird. And that's not the case, and he knows that, but it's other people that think that. KATE - Does it bother you? FRASIER- Yeah, it really does. Yeah, I find it quite easy to get offended by these people who don't understand because it isn't actually my fault, and what these people just need to know is they need to know that actually on the inside I'm a really nice person and on the inside I've got the same potential as them. And it really bugs me that not everyone is as understanding.  PAUL - So the truth is that it's the other people who are disabled isn't it, because they don't have the ability to understand you?  FRASIER- Yes. KATHARINE - Ellie's had very similar experiences with other people haven't you? ELLIE - Yeah.  KATHARINE - Other people not understanding you and making assumptions.  FRASIER- Yeah, it's hard though. They just think because we're not the same as everyone else that we're just odd and that's not the case. SIMON- You're nodding, Ellie. ELLIE - Exactly. You're exactly right. I have struggled a lot, people have looked at me and basically I know the look now. It's literally like you're not disabled, why are you sitting there? Or, why can't you do this? Because dyspraxia is unseen… KATHARINE - And learning difficulties. ELLIE - And learning difficulties are unseen, I've been discriminated against quite a few times because they don't understand it.  KATHARINE - She had a ticket inspector on a bus once tell her she shouldn't have her disability travel card.  KATE - Justin, that must be hard for you. SIMON - Yeah, so Dad?  JUSTIN - Yes. We were... KATHARINE - Can I just say, Dad did a very good Dad face there?  ELLIE - I've never seen Mum so angry. KATHARINE - Dad angry face.  JUSTIN- We were… But you must have this as Frasier's mum. KARINA- I do, and actually both of my other children have disabilities as well, so between the three of them you get it all the time. JUSTIN- You get it all the time, and Frasier, I mean, it's the same, when Ellie says you can't see it can you?  FRASIER- Yeah. JUSTIN- Because if you're sitting on a bus nobody would look at you and say, ""Oh, he's got Asperger's.""  FRASIER- Yeah.  JUSTIN- And then they don't make any allowances. And when they do see there's a difference they don't treat you as though you're just a human being like every other human being.  FRASIER- Yeah. What we need them to think is when they do find out we've got Asperger's and we've got all sorts of different things they then need to then go, okay, well we completely understand, we're going to support you, but we're not going to support you so much that we treat you as if you're not human. And that's what some people do, they don't treat us like an ordinary human, which if anything helps us with that.  SIMON - I suspect you've got something in common with Archbishop Justin, in the sense of your sense of injustice. The fact you've written about refugees and there's that lovely story about you with the homeless person saying, ""Why don't we just build a home?"" Is that part of your Asperger's, or is that just you being a good person? KATE - A kind person.  FRASIER- Yeah, I think my Asperger's, I see the world differently, so when I see these people, these people who are being greedy, who are taking while others don't have, all of that, I just don't understand how they think that. And it's a bit of a struggle because you find it hard to understand other humans. And yeah, I definitely think that. KATE - Justin, do you think younger people are sort of more compassionate than us older people? JUSTIN - I know a lot of people say that, but I don't think so. KATE - No? JUSTIN - No, I think schools and places can be incredibly cruel. I think one of the things I'm very passionate about though is, again from our own experience and from being a school governor and chair of governors and so on in a comprehensive school when the children were growing up where we were living, is the introduction of not separating people with disabilities completely so that people get used… People as they go through school, they don't think, that's Frasier who's Asperger's, they think that's my mate Frasier. Or they don't think that's Ellie, you know, Ellis who's got dyspraxia… KATHARINE - From the bottom set. That's the thing that I hated, the bottom set, you always ended up in the bottom set with all the naughty children as well.  ELLIE - Yes. JUSTIN - Yes, I'd forgotten that.  KATHARINE - You either have the naughty children or just lots of other children with lots of complicated issues, and then actually, because there's so many children in one class who need more attention you don't get the attention. JUSTIN - If you're quiet or if you sit a bit by yourself then you don't get the attention so much.  FRASIER- Yeah, that's quite annoying, because like usually when the teacher puts us all in tables she always puts me with all the other children with autism, all the other children with ADHD and things, and I just think that's not what I want. I don't want to be separated.  ELLIE - It's not fair.  FRASIER- Yeah. I want to have help, but I don't just want to be categorised and separated from everyone else, I just want to feel normal.  JUSTIN - Because you're you, you're not a thing. You're not a category, you're a person. FRASIER- Yeah. PAUL - There's an assumption they know best isn't there? And they don't know.  KARINA - I have to stick up for his teacher at the moment though, because she doesn't do that.  FRASIER- No, I meant some teachers. She does not do that at all.  PAUL - That's fantastic.  FRASIER- Some teachers have done that in the past. JUSTIN- But you see, I was really struck by something you said, you see the world differently. And leadership, and what it takes to change things is often… And the thing I always worry about myself is I just see a problem, you see possibilities and solutions, and that means you can take a lead in a way that lots of other people can't. I think that's absolutely spectacular. As you've done with the book.  FRASIER - Thank you.  KATE - What do you think, Frasier? Next Archbishop of Canterbury? Would you like that job? What do you reckon? FRASIER- Yeah, yeah, definitely. [Laughter] Some sort of leadership would be fantastic.  SIMON - I think you'd be pretty good at it. You've got a second book already lined up. This one features the famous Downing Street cat, Larry. Can you tell us a little bit about that?  FRASIER - So this one I still want to have some kind of message in, but it's less on the serious side, and I want to try and make it funny in a way. And it's about this cat called Larry who is actually a real cat who is what they call The Chief Mouser, and he/she would live in Number 10, Downing Street and because they're such old buildings they have lots of rodents and their job is to get rid of the rodents. And that is actually a real thing and Larry is a real cat. And I just thought what must it be like to live on Downing Street, and I'm going to try and write it from their perspective and… KATE - And hear all their political meetings and things.  FRASIER - Yeah. He's going to go on an adventure.  SIMON - But will Larry have your mind? So Larry will be able to see how to solve some of these issues as well hopefully? FRASIER- Yeah, yeah. SIMON - But funny. FRASIERYeah.  KARINA - I've read a few bits that he's done already and spoken about it with him. PAUL - Is it good? KARINA - It is good. He's done one bit where, so Larry overhears… I'm sorry, I'm giving away all your secrets. FRASIER- No! [Laughter] KARINA- But Larry overhears the world leaders having a conversation that he doesn't agree with and they're having an argument and he's very cross about it and then he talks about how he's friends with all sort of animals across London and he doesn't understand why the world leaders are cross when he can be friends with all of these other people.  SIMON- Frasier, you need to become friends with Paul… as well as taking Archbishop Justin's job, you need to become friends with Paul, he's written satire all about politics with 'Weekending' and 'Spitting Image'. This is ringing bells for you from your earlier writing days? PAUL - Yes, absolutely.  JUSTIN - That's amazing. KATE - Frasier and mum, Karina, thank you so much for joining us. Now, 'There's a Boy Just Like Me', which is your book, is available now on The Book People's website, and at least 35% of the money made will go to the charity, Save The Children. SIMON - Are you staying with us? KARINA - Yes, we can stay. SIMON - That's great. Paul Mayhew-Archer has one of those memorable names which you may remember from the end of radio comedy shows in the '80s because he's produced hundreds of them. For television he's worked variously as script editor, producer or writer on some of the classic comedies we've already referenced today. Catching up with him now, he's about to perform a one man show at the Edinburgh Fringe… Oh, a little bit of a hesitation… PAUL - Nervous. [Laughs]  SIMON - And as we've heard, it's about how he now lives with Parkinson's. A month at the Fringe is going to be quite physically demanding. PAUL - 25 shows in 26 days, yes.  SIMON - And this is your first time for stand-up? PAUL - First time ever. So yes, my first go at stand-up really was last year. There was a Parkinson's fund raiser at the Albert Hall and I did two minutes there.  KATE - Your first gig was at the Albert Hall? [Laughter] SIMON - Yeah, not bad.  PAUL - Yeah I know, it's downhill all the way really. My second one was at the Comedy Store in London, that was ten minutes, and now it's at a little place, the Underbelly Friesian in Edinburgh. And then probably it'll be a sort of toilet somewhere, if I'm continuing on my downward path. FRASIER- Yes, I'm just going to have a little play at the Albert Hall and then I'm going to go back home, playing at some shop somewhere. PAUL - Yes, exactly. SIMON - So the terror just doing stand-up comedy, but then the Parkinson's, is this going to have an impact? Do you have to manage it? PAUL - Well, I do have to manage it, yes. It's strange, because I'm on tablets and people with Parkinson's are on or off, and when you're on and the tablets have kicked in… I'm on at the moment, you'll be pleased to know, so the tablets have kicked in and I'm sort of fully functioning, and then when the tablets wear off I sort of go a bit wobbly and slow and I start slurring a bit. And I was doing a… I won't go into details. Anyway, I was doing a charity thing at a golf club, very elderly golfers, and half way through my tablets suddenly wore off and I couldn't… My brain just went AWOL, and all I could think of was my wife saying, ""Whatever you do, don't tell that story.""  And that was the only story I could think of, and so I told… I'm not going to tell you what that story is, [laughter] you'll have to come and see the show to find out. Because all I can say is I looked round the golfers as I was telling this story, and it was like that moment in 'The Producers' when the audience is watching 'Springtime for Hitler', sort of gobsmacked looks of absolute horror. And one golfer, who went ""Yeugh"". I'm sorry, I can't tell you.   KATE - I assume you didn't get asked back then? PAUL - I have not been asked back. [Laughs]  FRASIER- Have you recorded that, because if so, I'm giving you my email address.  PAUL - I will personally send you a copy of it.  SIMON - Will you reference your Parkinson's in your show? PAUL - Yes. SIMON - And forgive my clumsiness, are you going to time it so perhaps the drugs sort of wear off towards the end so you get a bit more authentic at the end? PAUL - Strangely, that's a bit too much of a risk for me I think. The thing is, if the show goes well it should be an hour. And if the pills have worn off it'll be five hours, which is, you know, but fantastic value for money when you think about it.  But it's quite important to me, because I did a documentary a couple of years ago. I'd never done a documentary before in my life, and I did this documentary called, 'Parkinson's: The Funny Side' because from the moment I was diagnosed I decided somehow to find the funny side in it, and to think of it in terms of jokes. And because I do that it makes me feel better. SIMON - You won an award for this? PAUL - I did, I won best [laughs], I won Best Documentary Presenter of the Year at the Grierson Awards, which is a very prestigious documentary award.  SIMON - So first documentary…  PAUL - I'd beaten Louis Theroux. SIMON - Sorry, I talked over you. First documentary you win an award, first stand up gig, Royal Albert Hall. PAUL - Yeah, I know. Yes, it's weird. And now I'm sitting next to the Archbishop of Canterbury. You know, this Parkinson's has opened up all sorts of amazing opportunities for me in the way that I… JUSTIN - It's the other way, I think being Archbishop of Canterbury has opened up enormous opportunities for me. I'm sitting next to you, the person who wrote 'Vicar of Dibley'.  SIMON - How do you balance it, Paul? Because I have a very good friend, diagnosed with cancer very recently, and I spoke to her for the first time and all she was doing was making jokes. And after about 20 minutes I said, ""We've got to stop the jokes, I want to talk to you seriously about it.""  PAUL - Yes. SIMON - And I know I do jokes to sort of just relax people. How do you balance that? PAUL - Well, I mean, the thing is… Well, it's interesting you should mention cancer, because one of the reasons I talk about the funny side of Parkinson's, and I talk a bit about the serious side as well, is because it springs from the death of my mum, because my mum died when I was 20 of cancer. And she'd sort of had one form of cancer or another all my life, and we never talked about it. It was in that era, this was 45 years ago, 50 years ago, never spoke about it at all. I didn't know whether she knew she was dying at the end, so we never said goodbye because we couldn't have that conversation.  And it wasn't until I was sort of… Strangely, I was having counselling when I was in my 40s and I was talking about my weird family, because my father subsequently married my wife's mother, so I'm married to my step sister and I am my son's uncle. So get your heads round that. SIMON - That's in the show I expect. PAUL - Yeah, it's a sitcom, 'Family', but this counsellor said to me, ""So where was your own mum?"" and then I started talking about what had happened to my mum, and it was then that I realised, that's why I've been trying to write comedy all through my youth growing up, because I was trying to make me laugh in a home which had little laughter.  KATE - And was it around then that you lost your faith? PAUL - It was around there, yes, it was when I was about 16, 17? Yes. I'd been a server in the local church. SIMON - What's a server? PAUL - Well, a server, so I was assisting the vicar. I was in my cassock and surplus and I was assisting and preparing the sacraments. And I remember Christmas midnight mass, midnight service, Christmas, church packed. I hand the vicar the box of wafers, he consecrates them, turns them into the body of Christ, hands back the box to me. I then open the box, I don't know how I did it, but I opened it upside down and the body of Christ fell all over the floor. We had to have two extra hymns while the audience was sort of.. the congregation - audience? - congregation were… I mean, it was just horrendous. So he may have been quite pleased that he lost my faith, I don't know, because he managed to avoid any more terrible sort of… KATE - The Archbishop is there. SIMON - Bishop Justin, you shook your head and then you did a face palm. I'm wondering what was going through your head with Paul's story? JUSTIN - I remember a midnight communion where someone, it was worse, carrying the goblet of wine… PAUL - Oh! JUSTIN - The chalice. PAUL - Yes. JUSTIN - Turned at the beginning of the row where everyone was kneeling down to receive communion, tripped, and pushed the chalice forward as he fell, and it must have got 12 people I should think.  PAUL - All at once. JUSTIN - All at once. PAUL - That is fantastic though. So they all got their wine. ELLIE - Well, they all got their wine didn't they? JUSTIN - It was quite spectacular. So I mean, yes, I know the feeling. But the great thing about these things is the vicar's always done stupider things than anyone else.  PAUL - Anyone else, yes.  KATHARINE - And they make very good stories.  PAUL - They do. But I sort of, I mean, so the cancer we never talked about, and I think there is progress being made now, because I do work for Maggie's, which is a cancer support charity, and they have a sort of… they embrace laughter as a way of getting a conversation going. And in fact I was amazed, Richard Curtis and I opened the Oxford Maggie's Centre and we were asked to write a funny poem about cancer.  So because you were saying about the balance of the comedy, the comedy can lead you into the seriousness, it breaks the ice, because comedy is… When we all laugh together it's a way of belonging. When you're in an audience, if I go to any play I have no idea whether people are enjoying it or not, if it's a serious play because we're all locked in us, but if it's a comedy and we're all laughing we know we're part of a group.  SIMON - Very interesting. It must be one of the hardest questions for you, Justin, you must get asked so many hard questions, but if someone says they've lost their faith how do you respond to that? JUSTIN - Well, I know how I don't respond, which is in any sense to judge or be condemnatory. I think everyone's life's their own. Because I don't think of it as my faith, in my terms, I just… I grew up going to chapel morning and evening at a boarding school for ten years, and the only interesting thing that happened in ten years was the headmaster falling out of the pulpit. And we did our homework behind our hymnbooks, because that was the best way to pass the time. So you had your French irregular verbs hidden by a hymnbook. And that's what you did.  And I didn't find the reality. The clergy at the school were wonderful people, they were really, really kind, but I didn't find the reality of something until after I'd left school and met people in Kenya in East Africa who seemed to have this relationship with God that I didn't have. And it was that example, and then the resurrection. If Jesus rose from the dead then everything else has to follow one way or another. It doesn't mean you don't have problems with God.  And I was reading something this morning from the psalms, psalm 88, which I think was written by someone with very severe depression, because he's, whoever the psalmist is, he or she, says, ""I have no hope. All my friends have left me. Everything…"" And he goes on for quite a long time about this. And clearly the only thing they cling to is they believe that God exists, they rather suspect that God's against them. So when I hear that I think, hmm, God doesn't lose faith in us because we lose faith in him. But I haven't got a good answer.  SIMON - It's a great answer. And you also mention the depression, and I know you've talked about Churchill getting the black dog and moments where it's got sort of close to you but not fully so, yes.  JUSTIN - Yes, and Katharine and I talk about this, and it took us a long time, poor Katharine, to understand what was happening in her life really. And just sort of realise that this was just an illness, like other illnesses, it's a real… And it's not a rational illness, you're not depressed because your life's bad. You can objectively say everything's wonderful. Someone I know very well said to me, ""I have a wonderful family, I have great friends, I'm doing really well in the things I do. I just want to die."" You know, it's not rational, but it's there. And it's no different in that sense from Parkinson's, you can't rationalise away Parkinson's, you've got it. PAUL - It's what Katharine was saying about chemical, Parkinson's is a chemical thing, it's the lack of dopamine, which means that it sort of… The messages, it's like my brain is like a satnav that keeps saying, ""Recalculating route,"" but can't actually find one to… KATE - Do you have ways to kind of replace that dopamine? PAUL - Well, they say, well the drugs do, physical activity can sort of do it. Setting yourself challenges and trying new things is a way of sort of lighting up different bits of the brain.  SIMON - What about the rush of laughter? PAUL - And the adrenalin rush. So I do jokes, I feel better when I think of the jokes. I then go to a Parkinson's group and I tell them the jokes and they feel better for me telling them jokes, and that sort of… So they laugh, and that makes me feel better. And the blacker the better. I was saying that I was talking to a professor and I said what a pity it was that Robin Williams had killed himself, because, you know, I thought he could bring a lot of publicity to Parkinson's.  And this professor said, ""Well, we don't think he had Parkinson's."" I said, ""I thought he did,"" and he said, ""No, no, no, he had Lewy Body Dementia which is related to the Parkinson's, but we don't think he had the Parkinson's."" And I said, ""Why?"" and he said, ""Well, because he killed himself. It's very unusual for people with Parkinson's to do that."" I said, ""I didn't know that,"" and he said, ""Yes. You see, the thing is people with Parkinson's do get extremely depressed, but one of the other symptoms is apathy, so they may feel like killing themselves but they just can't be bothered."" [Laughter] And I tell that to groups of people with Parkinson's and they love it.   SIMON - Yes, always an upside.  PAUL - Always an upside. FRASIER- You're spreading the happiness around. PAUL - Spreading the happiness around.  JUSTIN - Oh, I couldn't, I would use that one, but…  PAUL - But it is, and the things people say to you. There was a neurologist, my wife asked him, he has a wonderful way of delivering news, like a roller-coaster, because he has to tell you the truth, but at the same time he doesn't want it to depress you. But on the other hand he has to tell you the truth. So my wife said, ""Does Parkinson's affect life expectancy?"" and he said, ""Well, very interesting, I'm glad you asked me that because we used to think it did, and then about four years ago we decided that it didn't. But now we think it does."" [Laughter] Long pause before… SIMON - So another potential upside, you have an obsession with chocolate, you celebrated the diagnosis of Parkinson's by going to Chocolate World? PAUL - To Cadbury's World, yes.  SIMON - Cadbury's World, sorry, yes.  PAUL - Yes, we did.  SIMON - This isn't related to Parkinson's is it? You've always had the chocolate thing? PAUL - A lot of people with Parkinson's do love their chocolate, yes, and I was told it does produce dopamine. SIMON - Do you think it's an obsession? PAUL - Well, it is an obsession and it's an increasing obsession, except my wife has now banned chocolate. KATE - Oh! No? PAUL - No, she's a very cruel woman. FRASIER- What a monster. PAUL - Yes, yes. It's unjust isn't it? No, because I was putting on too much weight. I mean, literally, if you gave me a huge kilogram bar of chocolate… You know you can get these kilogram bars of chocolate? In airports particularly. KATE - Yes. SIMON - I didn't. KATE - I do.  KATHARINE - I've had those before. They're good.  PAUL - Well, I could easily polish one of those off in a day.  KATE - That is quite a skill.  SIMON - Bearing in mind, Justin… Easter, maybe that's your favourite festival. Maybe we'll get you two together, the chocolate and… Oh no, that's not the real reason is it? I can't believe I'm even saying that to you, I'm dead embarrassed. [Laughter] PAUL - You've got to be able to party.  SIMON - A chocolate party. KATE - Now Paul, you've got your show on in Edinburgh, where can we see that? PAUL - You can see it if you're in Edinburgh at the Underbelly Friesian, which is in Bristow Square, and it's on at 5:15 every day, except 13th August, for an hour.  KATE - And that's your day off, 13th? PAUL - The 13th is my day off, yes. From 1st August to 26th August I'm doing the show. And I'm looking forward to it enormously. I absolutely love doing stand-up.  KATE - And what's it called?  PAUL - It's called Incurable Optimist.  SIMON - And will you be flyering, giving out your…? PAUL - There'll be lots of flyering and lots of all that. We're just sorting out the best poster at the moment. And I've been doing try outs of the show and people have been very nice so far, so yes.  SIMON - We wish you very well. KATE - We'll try and catch it while we're in Edinburgh.  FRASIER - Yes, good luck. PAUL - Thank you very much indeed. JUSTIN - Absolutely. KATE - Well, that's it for our monthly Ouch talk show for July.

The AU announced two weeks ago that it would send 5,000 troops to protect civilians in the country, even without the government's consent.  ""Everyone has to respect Burundi borders,"" Mr Nkurunziza said in his first public response to the AU plan. At least 400 people have been killed and 220,000 displaced since April. The violence began after Mr Nkurunziza announced he would seek a third term in office. He survived a coup attempt in May, and secured a landslide victory in disputed elections in July. There have been fears that the violence could spiral into civil war and possible ethnic conflict. Letter from Africa: Has the African Union grown some teeth? Is Burundi on the verge of ethnic conflict? Tit-for-tat killings spread fear Under Burundi's constitution, foreign troops can only intervene if the warring parties ask for it, or if there is no legitimate government in place, the president said in comments broadcast on state radio. Any violation of those principles would be considered ""an attack on the country and every Burundian will stand up and fight against them,"" he said.  Other government officials have already criticised the AU proposal saying it would violate the country's sovereignty.  Nearly 3,500 people have been arrested by Burundi's security forces If the deployment goes ahead, it would be the first time the AU uses its power to deploy a force without a country's consent. A clause in the organisation's charter allows it to intervene in a member state because of grave circumstances, which include war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.  Diplomatic moves to prevent a civil war in Burundi have recently accelerated with the UN, the European Union and the East African Community fearful of the impact of worsening violence both on the local population and the region. The government has said there is no threat of genocide. A peace meeting held in neighbouring Uganda on Tuesday to find a solution to the crisis ended without any agreement.

Spread to UST,Pope denounces extremism on historic visit to Iraq,2024-09-25,2021-03-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-56302173,"Pope Francis has condemned extremism in the name of religion on a historic visit to Iraq where he discussed the plight of the Christian minority. Hostility, extremism and violence are ""betrayals of religion"" he told an inter-faith prayer service.  Iraq has been wracked by religious and sectarian violence, both against minorities and between Shia and Sunni Muslims too.  Pope Francis also visited one of Shia Islam's most powerful figures. Receiving the head of the Roman Catholic Church at his home in the holy city of Najaf, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said Christians should be able to live in peace and security like all other Iraqis. The meeting was seen as a highly symbolic moment in the Pope's visit, which is his first international trip since the start of the coronavirus pandemic more than a year ago, and the first ever papal visit to Iraq. Covid-19 and security fears have made this his riskiest trip yet. The 84-year-old leader of the Catholic Church earlier told reporters that he had felt ""duty-bound"" to make the ""emblematic"" journey, which will see him visit several sites over four days in Iraq. He delivered his message at the site of the ancient city of Ur, held to be the birthplace of the Prophet Abraham, who is revered in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. An inter-faith service brought together representatives of Iraq's religions, including Shia, Sunni, Christian and Yazidi clerics.   ""We believers cannot be silent when terrorism abuses religion,"" the Pope said. ""Indeed, we are called unambiguously to dispel all misunderstandings. Let us not allow the light of heaven to be overshadowed by the clouds of hatred."" He singled out the suffering of the Yazidi community which had ""mourned the deaths of many men and witnessed thousands of women, girls and children kidnapped, sold as slaves, subjected to physical violence and forced conversions"". Later on Saturday, Pope Francis celebrated Mass at St Joseph's Cathedral in central Baghdad. Security was tight with special forces deployed in the area and concrete barriers erected outside the church. Grand Ayatollah Sistani is spiritual leader of millions of Shia Muslims, the dominant religious community in Iraq. Audiences with the reclusive 90-year-old are rare but he received the Pope for around 50 minutes, the pair talking without face masks. He ""affirmed his concern that Christian citizens should live like all Iraqis in peace and security, and with their full constitutional rights"", his office said. Pope Francis thanked the ayatollah for speaking up ""in defence of those most vulnerable and persecuted"" amid the violence and hardships of Iraq's recent history, the Holy See press spokesman said. The Shia leader's message of peace, he said, affirmed ""the sacredness of human life and the importance of the unity of the Iraqi people"". This has been a meeting years in the making: an encounter between the leader of the Catholic Church and one of the most powerful figures in Shia Islam: Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.  For a pope passionate about reaching out to other faiths, the meeting is arguably the most symbolic moment of his visit to Iraq.  The dwindling Christian community here has suffered violence at the hands of Sunni extremists but some also fear the presence of Shia armed groups - and the cleric is seen as a voice of moderation.  The Pope visited Ur, the ancient birthplace of the Prophet Abraham, hoping that the biblical figure revered by Christians, Muslims and Jews, can spur reconciliation today. One of the world's oldest Christian communities has seen its numbers plummet over the last two decades from 1.4 million to about 250,000, less than 1% of the country's population. Many have fled abroad to escape the violence that has plagued the country since the US-led invasion in 2003 that ousted Saddam Hussein. Tens of thousands were also displaced when militants from the Sunni Muslim Islamic State (IS) group overran northern Iraq in 2014, destroying their historic churches, seizing their property, and giving them the choice to pay a tax, convert, leave or face death. A US state department report on religious freedom in Iraq in 2019 found that Christians, as well as Sunni Muslims, complained of harassment at checkpoints by Shia security forces and some discrimination in education. On his arrival on Friday, the Pope said Iraq's Christian community should have a more prominent role as citizens with full rights, freedoms and responsibilities. The last Christians in Iraq? Due to security concerns and a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections, the Pope will have limited exposure to the public. He has had two shots of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, and his entourage will have been inoculated, but there are fears the trip could become a super-spreader event given the large crowds expected. When he arrived on Friday, the Pope was seen to have a pronounced limp, suggesting that his sciatica condition continues to bother him. On Sunday, the pontiff will visit Mosul, where he will say prayers in Church Square for the victims of the war with IS, which left tens of thousands of civilians dead. Later, he is scheduled to lead Mass at a football stadium in Irbil in the north, which up to 10,000 people are expected to attend.  The Pope will also visit nearby Qaraqosh, where Christians have returned since the defeat of IS in 2017. About 10,000 Iraqi Security Forces personnel are being deployed to protect the Pope during his visit, while round-the-clock curfews are also being imposed to limit the spread of coronavirus. Some Shia militant groups have reportedly opposed the visit, suggesting the tour amounts to Western interference in the country's affairs.  Correction 29 March 2021: An earlier version of this article stated that Iraq's Christian minority has been ""long terrorised"" by Shia armed groups. This was amended in the hours after publication to instead make clear that the community has suffered violence at the hands of Sunni extremists, while noting that some also fear the presence of Shia armed groups."
Spread to UST,Palace fight back to beat Newcastle,2024-09-25,2021-02-01,Saj Chowdhury,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/55806210,"Newcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow had little chance of saving Jairo Riedewald's strike after it took a deflection Crystal Palace recorded back-to-back wins in the Premier League for the first time since September as they kept an attack-minded Newcastle at bay at St James' Park. The Magpies had a handful of chances to add to the second-minute strike from Jonjo Shelvey, while Roy Hodgson's side made the most of their opportunities, turning the match around in a four-minute spell courtesy of goals from Jairo Riedewald and Gary Cahill. Riedewald's effort trumped Shelvey's half-volley, when his 20-yard rocket took a slight deflection off Ciaran Clark in beating keeper Karl Darlow. And then in the 25th minute 35-year-old Cahill leapt highest to flick Eberechi Eze's corner delivery past the reach of the Magpies keeper. In doing so, the former Chelsea defender became the club's oldest scorer in the competition. Andros Townsend should have made it 3-1 in stoppage time, but almost inexplicably struck his effort high and wide from four yards. The visiting backline was busier of the two defences with Vicente Guaita producing a great instinctive block to deny Ryan Fraser and making another save to deny the Scot. Victory sees Palace move level on 29 points with 12th place Southampton, while Newcastle remain in 16th and eight points above the drop-zone. Whether Hodgson's side can make it a hat-trick of successes at Leeds next Monday might depend on how serious Wilfried Zaha's injury is. The Ivory Coast winger came off in the 58th minute with what appeared to be a hamstring injury. Reaction from Tuesday's Premier League matches Lawro's predictions v Foo Fighters guitarist Chris Shiflett This video can not be played Newcastle 1-2 Crystal Palace: Hodgson pleased with win but concerned about 'wounded' squad This fourth away win of the season in the league was the product of disciplined defending, efficiency in attack and some luck. The Eagles had more than enough time to regroup after the early jolt from Shelvey and were thankful Newcastle's defending was not at the level it was during last weekend's win at Everton. Hodgson's own defence was exceptional on Tuesday. Guaita once again underlined his importance in the backline when he rushed out to get enough of a hand on Fraser's strike to push it wide. Full-back Nathaniel Clyne made a crucial challenge to deny Callum Wilson a shot on goal and Scott Dann produced a brave block to prevent substitute Allan Saint-Maximin from testing Guaita. This video can not be played Newcastle 1-2 Crystal Palace: Bruce 'frustrated' with Palace defeat Despite this eighth defeat in the past 11 league games, this was not a return to the bad old ways for Steve Bruce's side. They set up with a similar attacking formation which reaped rewards at Goodison Park and had Palace on the backfoot for much of the match, enjoying 61% of the possession. The only thing lacking was the same intensity they showed against the Toffees. Riedewald was given too much space to line up his shot for Palace's opener and the defence lost Cahill as he ran clear to nod in the second. Had Fraser stuck away his chance at 2-1 when he was one-on-one with Guaita then the Magpies might have got something out of this game. Bruce has got it tactically right now, he just needs his side to discover a cutting edge. Palace boss Roy Hodgson speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: ""We knew it wouldn't be easy, but it's good to get six points from here [and Wolves].  ""I thought we played well. Having seen the [Shelvey] goal back, it was a much better strike than I first anticipated. It was one heck of a strike really.  ""We played well after that. At half-time I felt good about our play. But then you tend to be more cautious because you know they have to do something special and you perhaps stop asking questions. We really should have scored the third goal to put the game to bed."" On Zaha's injury: ""Suddenly we are looking around wondering where all our players are. It's going to be a problem trying to get these players fit again. These injuries have to be assessed. Zaha doesn't normally get injured so it's concerning he has come off. Hopefully it's nothing serious."" Newcastle boss Steve Bruce speaking to BBC's Match of the Day: ""Frustrated and disappointed as our performance didn't deserve for us to be beat. We had 10 minutes where we went too deep and let in sloppy goals. In this league that punishes you. ""Our performance levels have been better certainly over the last few weeks. We have tried to implement change in the last month or so and what you're looking for is a performance to go with it. As often in the Premier League, it's defining moments. Apart from that 10 to 15-minute spell, we had the better chances and should have taken something from the game."" This was the first time Palace have won an away Premier League game after conceding the first goal since October 2019 against West Ham (2-1), having gone winless in their previous 14 such matches (D2 L12).  Newcastle have lost each of their first three home league games in a calendar year for just the second time, previously doing so in 2014 in the Premier League.  Shelvey's opener for Newcastle (71 seconds) was the fastest goal Crystal Palace have conceded in a Premier League game since Ian Taylor's strike for Aston Villa in March 1998 (1st minute).  Riedewald's equaliser was just his second Premier League goal and first since October 2020 against Fulham, ending a run of 13 games without a goal in the competition. Cahill (35 years, 45 days) became the oldest Englishman to score a Premier League goal at St James' Park since Alan Shearer, for Newcastle against Wigan in April 2006 (35 years, 245 days). The Magpies host Southampton on Saturday (15:00 GMT) and the Eagles are at Leeds next Monday (20:00 GMT).

""What I don't accept is mainstream media immediately slapping that down as not true when they don't know it's not true,"" the ITV This Morning host said. ""It's very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative."" He was criticised on social media and by scientists who have dismissed the theories as ""complete rubbish"". ""The opinions of  the mainstream media or the state hardly come into the debate,"" said Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading. ""Numerous doctors and scientists around the world have said that the disease is caused by a virus, something completely different to a mobile phone signal."" 5G radio signals are electromagnetic waves, he explained. ""Electromagnetic waves are one thing, viruses are another, and you can't get a virus off a phone mast. ""Similarly, sensible studies have failed to corroborate the claim that the signals emitted by 5G masts are able to suppress our immune systems."" Holmes made the remarks on Monday in a segment with the programme's consumer editor Alice Beer, who said the 5G theory, which has led a number of phone masts to be set alight or vandalised, was ""not true and it's incredibly stupid"". He told her: ""I totally agree with everything you are saying but what I don't accept is mainstream media immediately slapping that down as not true when they don't know it's not true. ""No-one should attack or damage or do anything like that, but it's very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative. ""That's all I would say, as someone with an inquiring mind."" On Twitter, scientist and author Dr David Robert Grimes suggested the presenter should ""talk to the scientists & physicians who are experts 1st"". Beer later reiterated her view that ""the 5G conspiracy theory is nonsense and should be quashed"". A government spokesperson said: ""We are aware of a number of attacks on phone masts and abuse of telecoms engineers apparently inspired by crackpot conspiracy theories circulating online. ""Those responsible for these criminal acts will face the full force of the law."" ITV declined to comment. Scientists have called the rumours that there is a link between 5G and coronavirus ""complete rubbish"" and a biological impossibility. However, that has not stopped false claims being shared on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok. Some posts have now been removed, but in recent weeks the conspiracy theory has been shared by verified accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers.  This highlights the difficulty with covering misinformation about coronavirus. A lack of information and complex explanations often fail to satisfy a desire for immediate answers.

The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that UK Essays had failed to make it clear that the papers were not meant to be submitted as students' own work. The online ad also gave a ""misleading impression"" that the firm had received positive press coverage, the ASA said. UK Essays said it would ensure its fair usage policy was more prominent within the website. A website for ukessays.com featured text that stated ""guaranteed grade, every time. We're so confident you'll love the work we produce, we guarantee the final grade of the work.  ""Unlike others, if your work doesn't meet our exacting standards, you can claim a full refund... loved by customers & the global press UK Essays have lots of press coverage from all over the world confirming that a 2:1 piece of work produced by us met this standard... We were the first company in the world to offer you guaranteed 2:1 and 1st class work"". Extra information about the service was included on pages entitled World Class Guarantees and UK Essays in the Press, the ASA ruling explained. A complaint was brought by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA), a universities watchdog, which argued that the ad was misleading because it did not make clear the risks associated with submitting bought essays. It also said that references to the press coverage UK Essays received implied that they had had positive coverage or endorsement from these media outlets. Upholding the complaint, the ASA said: ""We considered the ad gave an overall impression that consumers would be able to submit the purchased essays as their own, particularly because of the anti-plagiarism and grade guarantees. ""We considered that consumers would understand from the website that they could purchase an essay of a particular grade that was plagiarism-free, and that they would be able to make a claim under the refund guarantee if they submitted the essay and did not receive the grade ordered, or if the essay was found to be plagiarised."" It added: ""Because we considered consumers would expect from the ad that they could submit purchased essays as their own that would meet the ordered grade without risks, which was not the case, we concluded that the ad was misleading."" In February last year, the then Universities Minister Jo Johnson urged university and student bodies to do more to deal with the spread of what he called ""essay mills"". A spokesman for UK Essays said: ""While we are disappointed with the ASA ruling, we respect the decision and we look to ensure that our fair usage policy is more prominent within the site.  ""We pride ourselves on the quality of work we produce, but ultimately, we are happy to work within the provided guidelines.  ""We are committed to working closely with any educational institution who are happy to work with us and create open working relations going forward. ""Our desire is to become the word's leading educational support service and we firmly believe that working closely with universities and educational bodies all over the world we can achieve this."" Welcoming the ASA's ruling, QAA's director of academic standards Ian Kimber, said: ""Essay mills mislead students and put their academic and professional careers at risk.  ""This landmark ruling by the ASA is the first successful challenge to their claims of legitimacy, exposing their cynical use of anti-plagiarism disclaimers and exploitative media referencing. ""We will continue to campaign for academic integrity, supporting both students and higher education providers in identifying and tackling cheating and other abuses.

Spread to UST,Bid to safeguard city workers' village,2024-09-25,2017-09-10,By Neil Prior,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-41203669,"About 250 years ago industrialist John Morris set out to create Wales' first purpose-built workers' village. Boasting ""palatial"" accommodation, recreational spaces and a modern grid layout, Morriston, in the east of Swansea, was ahead of its time. It has had conservation status since 1975 but there have been concerns over the changing face of the main Woodfield Street shopping area. Now Swansea council wants to strengthen its preservation powers there. Officials have launched a review which could cover changes to the conservation area's boundaries, as well as exploring opportunities to secure funding for restoration and measures to preserve traditional shop fronts. Speaking ahead of a public consultation process, Councillor Robert Francis-Davies, Swansea council's cabinet member for culture, tourism and major projects, said: ""Morriston was the first planned industrial settlement in Wales, so there are many historic points of interest in the local area. ""An improved conservation area would help identify potential funding opportunities for regenerating historically significant buildings, while also better informing planning decisions in future."" The Morris dynasty began in the 1720s when Shropshire entrepreneur Robert Morris started the first mass smelting at the Llangyfelach Copper Works. However, it was his son, Sir John Morris, 1st Baronet Clasemont, who made the most lasting impact, when he hired architect William Edwards to create Morris Town, now Morriston, in the 1760s. At its heart was Morris Castle, containing 24 workers' apartments which were luxurious by the standards of the day. Sir John became famed for his philanthropy and progressive attitude towards his employees; poet Walter Davies writing of him in 1815 said he seemed ""to have been the most extensive individual builder of comfortable habitations for the labouring class"". Local Historian Gary Gregor added: ""Sir John left an enduring memorial in the form of Morriston, where you can still see the workers' village laid out in a gridiron pattern, with every cottage having sufficient garden to grow vegetables. ""Built on this, we have a substantial architectural legacy, which includes: Philadelphia Chapel, St John's Church, the old police station on Banwell Street, the Morfydd Street canal bridge, Seion Chapel, Libanus Chapel and the old market hall."" But perhaps the jewel in Morriston's crown is Tabernacle Chapel. Designed in the 1870s by architect John Humphrey, and funded by £15,000 of worshipers' subscriptions, it was one of Wales' most expensive buildings at the time. Grade I listed since 1993, it has been described as ""the Non-Conformist cathedral of Wales"", and was recently voted the nation's favourite place of worship by readers of religious website, Sacred Wales. Tabernacle is hosting an open day on Thursday 14 September, as part of the conservation area consultation process. While Morriston was good enough for their workers, it appears it was not entirely to the Morris family's own liking as they moved house, according to Mr Gregor. Built around 1775, Sir John had a Palladian-style mansion called Clasemont at Pengwern, near the present-day DVLA building. He said: ""The spread of fumes from the copper smelting works in the Lower Swansea Valley rendered it unsuitable, so Clasemont was dismantled in 1805, and transported brick-by-brick well away from the pollution west of Swansea, where much of them went into constructing the Morris' new mansion, Sketty Park House."""
Spread to UST,River Wye pollution prompts High Court review,2024-09-25,2023-03-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-64956493,"The Environment Agency (EA) is being taken to the High Court over claims it has failed to protect the River Wye from agricultural pollution. River Action said the EA was allowing destructive levels of nutrients from organic manure to enter the river. It is estimated about 20 million chickens are raised in the River Wye catchment at any one time, about 25% of UK poultry production. The EA said it was ""working hard"" and had taken measures to restore the area. A large amount of organic manure has been spread over the land to facilitate the poultry industry's rapid growth near the river, which has led to a substantial increase in levels of phosphorus in the soil. When washed into the river by rainwater, the phosphorus causes prolonged algal blooms which suffocate plants and wildlife by sucking up all the oxygen and turning the water an opaque green. River Action, which has applied for a judicial review against the EA, said despite the Wye being designated a Special Area of Conservation, algal blooms have destroyed 90% of the river's ranunculus, a family of aquatic plants. In June 2020, an unprecedented algal bloom stretched for more than 140 miles, almost the entire length of the river, it said. A study by Lancaster University published in May 2022 found 60 to 70% of the river's phosphorus now comes from agriculture and 3,000 tonnes of it are entering the river every year, accumulating at a rate of almost 3st (17kg) per hectare when the national average is just over 1st (7kg) per hectare. Charles Watson, chairman and founder of River Action, said: ""The severe ecological collapse of the iconic River Wye is one of the great environmental scandals of our times. ""The sickening tragedy is that this could have been seriously mitigated had the EA enforced existing environmental regulations to prevent the excess application of animal waste on land that was already oversaturated with nutrients. ""The irony is that the same government that introduced these regulations is giving the EA explicit guidance not to enforce them. This unlawful conduct of the EA has to stop now."" Statutory guidance from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), in which the EA operates, states land managers should avoid spreading manure during a crop rotation that raises phosphorus in soil above a certain level unless it is not reasonably practicable to do so or they have taken all appropriate precautions to prevent any diffuse agricultural pollution. River Action said because crop rotations take place over several years, this approach fails to protect the river and it has accused the EA of ""slavishly"" following the guidance at the expense of enforcing rules designed to protect the river. It said the EA was failing to apply the farming rules for water, which prohibit applications of ""organic manure or manufactured fertiliser"" to farmland in a way that would raise nutrient levels above what is ""needed by the crop and the soil"". The charity also said the EA was in breach of the habitat regulations by not applying rules to fulfil its requirements. Ricardo Gama, an environment solicitor who is representing River Action through the firm Leigh Day, said: ""The farming rules for water were introduced in 2018 specifically to deal with the issue of agricultural pollution in rivers like the Wye. ""But from documents we've seen, it's clear that the EA is choosing to apply the rules in a way that is inconsistent with their own interpretation of how the rules are supposed to work. ""This means that manure - essentially an industrial waste product from meat and dairy production - is allowed to flow into our waterways with impunity. ""Our client hopes this claim will force the EA to reassess their approach and start applying the rules properly."" The EA said it was working hard to restore the health and ecological status of the River Wye - including through increased monitoring and increased farm visits focusing on high-risk locations and previously non-compliant businesses. It added: ""Last year we received extra funding to undertake more inspections, and nationwide since 1 April 2021 we have visited nearly 5,000 farms and required over 77,00 actions from farmers to address agricultural pollution. ""The farming rules for water are one of a number of regulations we use as part of our advice led regulatory approach with farmers, to protect water quality and nature. ""If we find pollution or significant risk of pollution occurring we will not hesitate to take further action - evidenced by the enforcement action taken against 140 farms this financial year."" "
Spread to UST,UK hospital trials new coronavirus treatment drug,2024-09-25,2020-05-03,By Justin Rowlatt,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52504409,"A new drug developed by UK scientists to treat Covid-19 patients is being trialled at University Hospital Southampton.  Developed by UK bio-tech company Synairgen, it uses a protein called interferon beta, which our bodies produce when we get a viral infection.  Initial results from the trial are expected by the end of June. There are currently few effective treatments for coronavirus with doctors relying on patients' immune systems. Interferon beta is part of the body's first line of defence against viruses, warning it to expect a viral attack, explains Richard Marsden, chief executive of Southampton-based Synairgen. He says the coronavirus seems to suppress its production as part of its strategy to evade our immune systems. The drug is a special formulation of interferon beta delivered directly to the airways when the virus is there, with the hope that a direct dose of the protein will trigger a stronger anti-viral response even in patients whose immune systems are already weak. Interferon beta is commonly used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Synairgen has already shown its preparation can stimulate the immune response in the lungs of patients with asthma and other chronic lung conditions.  But we can only know whether it works for Covid-19 patients after it has been through a rigorous clinical trial. Kaye Flitney is one of 75 people who have been enrolled in the clinical trial, filmed exclusively by BBC Panorama. It requires Covid-19 patients, like her, to inhale the drug via a nebuliser to bring it deep into the lungs. Kaye, 67, struggles to sit up in her hospital bed and coughs as she puts the dispenser to her lips. She says when she first found out she had coronavirus her first thought was not for her own health. ""I was frightened because my husband has heart failure. It would kill him.""  The 67-year-old, who was taken to hospital due to difficulty with her breathing, said taking the drug hasn't caused her much discomfort.  ""You don't notice you're taking it 'til you're finished. It's not so bad. I could see myself taking it at home."" The 75 volunteers involved so far have been recruited from some 10 hospitals around Britain. Half get the drug, half get what is known as a placebo - an inactive substance.  No-one involved in the trial knows which patients have been given which treatment until the trial is over. ""If you know it's a drug, your mind might have a bias,"" explains Sandy Aitken, the nurse administering the drug. The hope is, it will show the patients getting the drug do much better than those that don't, says Professor Tom Wilkinson, of the University of Southampton.  Synairgen's drug trial is the template for a new fast-track clinical scheme that has just been set up by the government.  The Accord programme, as it is known, is designed to accelerate the development of new drugs for patients with Covid-19.  The first phase of the programme involves six other drugs.  More than 100 treatments are being explored worldwide and a drug called remdesivir, which was developed as an Ebola treatment, has generated particular excitement. US officials have claimed there is ""clear-cut"" evidence it helps people recover from the coronavirus.  Initial results from the interferon beta trial are expected by the end of June. But even if the drug does show promise, it will face further scrutiny before it can be used routinely on patients. That could take months, although the government has said it will work as fast as possible. If deemed effective, the drug and the nebulisers used to deliver it would then need to be manufactured in huge quantities.   Mr Marsden says he is already talking to suppliers around the world about whether it will be possible to start producing the drug as soon as the clinical trial is over.  However, he says it would still not be widely available until the end the year.  You can watch Panorama: When Will We Be Safe? at 19:30 BST on Monday, on BBC One and on the BBC iPlayer. "
Spread to UST,"Leak suspect talked memes, games and violence",2024-09-25,2023-04-13,By Antoinette Radford and Chloe Kim,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65271348,"Prosecutors say an American accused of one of the highest-profile intelligence leaks in years had a history of violent threats and troubling social media posts. Jack Douglas Teixeira, 21, is charged with the unauthorised removal and retention of classified documents and materials. If found guilty, he faces up to 25 years behind bars. In court papers, government prosecutors disclosed that he was once suspended from secondary school and denied a firearms ID over troubling comments he made. Authorities further allege he destroyed his electronic devices and other evidence as they closed in on an arrest. But many questions remain about why Mr Teixeira would share highly sensitive files, including confidential information about the war in Ukraine and other national security issues. Mr Teixeira enlisted in the Massachusetts Air National Guard, a reserve of the US Air Force, in 2019. His job title is cyber transport systems journeyman, and he holds the junior rank of Airman 1st Class.  He has top secret security clearance. In order to be given this clearance, Mr Teixeira signed a ""lifetime binding non-disclosure agreement"" acknowledging that the ""unauthorized disclosure of protected information could result in criminal charges"", according to court documents.  Personnel assigned to his role are responsible for operating the Air Force's global communications network and require a background check that allows access to top secret information. But the government has argued Mr Teixeira has a history of extreme remarks and behaviour, and would pose a serious flight risk and ongoing threat of further damage to national security if he was released from jail pre-trial. Their latest court filings alleged that the airman wrote on social media about how he would kill a ""ton of people"" if he had his way, and had discussed guns and vehicles he could use to conduct mass shootings. While still in high school, he was allegedly overheard by a classmate talking about Molotov cocktails and guns and making racial threats. Those comments earned him a suspension and later led to him being denied a firearms identification card, the filing says. At home, his gun locker sat close to his bed and he owned so many weapons they accounted for about half of his overall net worth, prosecutors said. And with his arrest imminent, he allegedly smashed his tablet, laptop and Xbox console; encouraged members of the chatroom where he leaked files to delete their messages; and then deleted the chat server itself. Mr Teixeira allegedly first leaked the files on the online chatroom platform Discord, a popular hangout among gamers.  Known as ""OG"", he was the administrator of an invitation-only server called Thug Shaker Central, which he created during the height of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.  The group reportedly had about two dozen members and swapped ""memes, offensive jokes and idle chitchat"". They also watched films together, discussed their favourite guns, prayed together and messaged extensively about the war in Ukraine. One member of the chatroom described Mr Teixeira to the Washington Post as a young, charismatic gun enthusiast. Others said he was older than most in the group and appeared keen to impress them. Before he shared images of US intelligence material in January, Mr Teixeira allegedly wrote up versions of the sensitive information and shared it to the chatroom. But he reportedly began sharing photos of the files after becoming frustrated with the lack of response. On several occasions, the Post said, he complained that they were more interested in YouTube videos and he would stop sending documents if the group did not interact with them. The Post was also shown videos from a member of the group of Mr Teixeira shouting racist and anti-semitic slurs before firing a rifle. He told the group he worked in a facility where phones were banned. In early March, members of his chatroom began posting the files on other Discord servers, including ones dedicated to the game Minecraft and a Filipino YouTuber. One member of the group theorised to the New York Times: ""This guy was a Christian, anti-war, just wanted to inform some of his friends about what's going on."" Friends of Mr Teixeira have said he is not a whistle-blower and he has long wanted to join the military, His family has a history of military service. His stepfather retired after 34 years of military service, while his mother previously worked for non-profit organisations focused on veterans, according to LinkedIn and public records cited by US media outlets. The latter posted photos of the family every year for Veterans Day. Both parents attended Mr Teixeira's court appearance earlier this month, but made no comment to the swarm of media that surrounded them as they left court. The only time they spoke was when Mr Teixeira's stepfather shouted ""I love you, Jack"" inside the courtroom. The shackled defendant replied ""I love you too, dad"". The family live in North Dighton, Massachusetts, where Mr Teixeira graduated from high school in 2020. He was arrested outside the family's rural home by heavily armed FBI agents on 13 April.  Neighbours described Mr Teixeira as being ""big into video games"" but a ""good kid, not a troublemaker"". One former classmate told CNN they ""could never have foreseen"" his actions."
Spread to UST,Teen beatings 'should not have happened',2024-09-25,2019-05-21,By Will Leitch,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-48353541,"A Ministry of Defence (MoD) barrister has told an inquest into the deaths of 10 people in west Belfast in 1971 that the beating of two teenage boys ""should never have happened"". The inquest is examining the shootings in Ballymurphy in August that year. Kevin Rooney QC made the comment while questioning witness Bernard Doyle. Mr Doyle and his brother have told the inquest that they found a wounded man in their garden and wanted to help but were arrested and beaten by soldiers. He and his brother were teenagers at the time and were held at Girdwood Barracks for several days. In its latest phase, the inquest is looking at the deaths of John Laverty, 20, and Joseph Corr, 43, on 11 August 1971. The fatal shootings happened on the Upper Whiterock Road as soldiers of the Parachute Regiment moved into the area. The family of Joseph Corr believe it was him the brothers had wanted to help, although the boys had not known him. Answering the barrister's questions, Mr Doyle said: ""I got beat relentlessly for trying to help some fellow who'd been shot."" MoD barrister Mr Rooney said he was not suggesting that the beatings had not taken place and added that they should never have happened. Mr Doyle said he and his brother were initially put in an Army vehicle to be taken to the nearby Henry Taggart base on the Springfield Road. He told the court he thought to himself: ""'I'm dead, I'll never see nobody ever again.' He added: ""See, when you go to Henry Taggart, the things they done in Henry Taggart were unreal and I thought: 'I'm dead, I'm dead.'"" They were instead put into a lorry with other detainees and taken to Girdwood Barracks. He later told the inquest that he went to hospital for treatment for his injuries after his release some days later. He said the doctor looked at him and asked if he had been run over by a bus. The sport-mad teenager had suffered a fracture to his lower back and says he still has back pain. All charges against Mr Doyle were dropped and he was later awarded compensation for the months he was unable to work. Later at the inquest on Tuesday, a man who had watched the beatings also described seeing a wounded man lying face down in the road outside his home. Edward McCourt, who is aged 86, was a joiner and lived in Dermott Hill Park in 1971. He said he woke early on 11 August and looked down to the junction of the Whiterock Road and Springfield Road. Mr McCourt said he saw a group of about 20 men spread-eagled against a wall, being beaten by soldiers with batons. Looking up the road, he told the court, he watched the Doyle brothers being beaten. He said that he then heard shots and went to the front of his home and saw a man lying on the road at the entrance to Dermott Hill Park. He thought he was about 40 to 45 years old and was wearing a white singlet or shirt. He believes the wounded man was Joseph Corr. Mr McCourt saw a bloodstain the size of a dinner plate on the man's back and a smaller one on his front as two paratroopers turned the man over. He told the court that the man was empty-handed and nothing was lying near him. Two soldiers were crouched near him and took the man and moved him out of sight by dragging at his clothes. He explained to the inquiry that the soldiers did not seem to offer the man any kind of medical attention. Mr McCourt told the court he was upset by what he had seen and then noticed two paratroopers with black camouflaged faces in his garden. He said he opened the window and angrily shouted to the soldiers to leave his garden and go back to their own country. He recalled that they both smashed in his front door and ran up the stairs of his home. He said one soldier told him: ""I'll blow your effing head off."" When he confronted them and told them his children were in convulsions, he said, the soldiers turned and left. Shortly afterwards he noticed a convoy of Army vehicles come down from Black Mountain, driving past the end of his street. Later the court heard from Joseph Marley, who also was a teenager at the time. He said he had joined his father and many other men keeping a lookout for the possibility of loyalists attacking the area down the Upper Whiterock Road. He said their family had lived in nearby New Barnsley Grove. He said they heard activity early on the morning of 11 August and, thinking it was ""Orangemen"", they decided to chase them off. There had been shouting and the rattling of bin lids and someone suggested: ""Let's charge them."" As the crowd ran up the pavement shouting, gunfire broke out down the road beside them. It was then, Mr Marley said, that they realised it was, in fact, paratroopers coming down the road. He said none of the crowd had a weapon of any kind, unless they picked up a stone to throw it. He added that he did not see any of the soldiers actually firing at the crowd. He described how one young man was shot in the arm. He believed many more would have been shot if the pavement had not been raised up from the level of the road. As they took cover at a nearby house, he said they used a cigarette lighter to help look at the young man's wound in the dawn light. The young man was taken away by some of them for first aid he said, and the rest crawled back away down the road from the soldiers. He later concluded that the two men who took him away were Joseph Corr and his son, also Joseph. He said the soldiers spread out into neighbouring streets sometimes using back gardens for cover. Later he said he had gone home to New Barnsley Grove, when his mother spoke to a soldier and was struck by him. When he complained, said Mr Marley, the soldier lifted his rifle and fired an un-aimed shot which missed. Mr Marley's evidence will continue on Wednesday. The court also heard from a Ministry of Defence barrister that the headquarters logs of 1st Battalion the Parachute Regiment in cannot be located for the period. A barrister for the Corr family pointed out that the relevant logs had been available to the Bloody Sunday Inquiry."
Spread to UST,Bid to safeguard city workers' village,2024-09-25,2017-09-10,By Neil Prior,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-41203669,"About 250 years ago industrialist John Morris set out to create Wales' first purpose-built workers' village. Boasting ""palatial"" accommodation, recreational spaces and a modern grid layout, Morriston, in the east of Swansea, was ahead of its time. It has had conservation status since 1975 but there have been concerns over the changing face of the main Woodfield Street shopping area. Now Swansea council wants to strengthen its preservation powers there. Officials have launched a review which could cover changes to the conservation area's boundaries, as well as exploring opportunities to secure funding for restoration and measures to preserve traditional shop fronts. Speaking ahead of a public consultation process, Councillor Robert Francis-Davies, Swansea council's cabinet member for culture, tourism and major projects, said: ""Morriston was the first planned industrial settlement in Wales, so there are many historic points of interest in the local area. ""An improved conservation area would help identify potential funding opportunities for regenerating historically significant buildings, while also better informing planning decisions in future."" The Morris dynasty began in the 1720s when Shropshire entrepreneur Robert Morris started the first mass smelting at the Llangyfelach Copper Works. However, it was his son, Sir John Morris, 1st Baronet Clasemont, who made the most lasting impact, when he hired architect William Edwards to create Morris Town, now Morriston, in the 1760s. At its heart was Morris Castle, containing 24 workers' apartments which were luxurious by the standards of the day. Sir John became famed for his philanthropy and progressive attitude towards his employees; poet Walter Davies writing of him in 1815 said he seemed ""to have been the most extensive individual builder of comfortable habitations for the labouring class"". Local Historian Gary Gregor added: ""Sir John left an enduring memorial in the form of Morriston, where you can still see the workers' village laid out in a gridiron pattern, with every cottage having sufficient garden to grow vegetables. ""Built on this, we have a substantial architectural legacy, which includes: Philadelphia Chapel, St John's Church, the old police station on Banwell Street, the Morfydd Street canal bridge, Seion Chapel, Libanus Chapel and the old market hall."" But perhaps the jewel in Morriston's crown is Tabernacle Chapel. Designed in the 1870s by architect John Humphrey, and funded by £15,000 of worshipers' subscriptions, it was one of Wales' most expensive buildings at the time. Grade I listed since 1993, it has been described as ""the Non-Conformist cathedral of Wales"", and was recently voted the nation's favourite place of worship by readers of religious website, Sacred Wales. Tabernacle is hosting an open day on Thursday 14 September, as part of the conservation area consultation process. While Morriston was good enough for their workers, it appears it was not entirely to the Morris family's own liking as they moved house, according to Mr Gregor. Built around 1775, Sir John had a Palladian-style mansion called Clasemont at Pengwern, near the present-day DVLA building. He said: ""The spread of fumes from the copper smelting works in the Lower Swansea Valley rendered it unsuitable, so Clasemont was dismantled in 1805, and transported brick-by-brick well away from the pollution west of Swansea, where much of them went into constructing the Morris' new mansion, Sketty Park House."""
Spread to UST,The DNA viruses left in ancient remains,2024-09-25,2023-10-16,Jasmin Fox-Skelly,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231013-how-unearthing-diseases-ancient-origins-could-help-produce-modern-cures,"The DNA of bacteria and viruses that infected humans thousands of years ago is still trapped in their skeletal remains. Scientists are finding out what we can learn from them. In the 16th Century, in the country now known as Mexico, there was a sudden and dramatic drop in the population. Disease spread after Europeans conquered the territory and millions of indigenous people died as a result. Until recently, it was believed the Europeans had brought the illness with them from Europe - but the exact pathogen responsible was unknown. Now a team of scientists have extracted ancient viral DNA from the teeth of victims of the outbreaks, buried beneath a colonial-era hospital and chapel in New Mexico. The DNA reveals that the victims were infected with hepatitis B virus and human B19 parvovirus. Rather than a European origin as previously thought, the researchers found that the viruses likely originated in Africa. ""The viruses seem to have an African origin, and three of the humans we analysed were genetically African as well,"" says María C Ávila Arcos, assistant professor at the International Laboratory for Human Genome Research at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. At the time, European traders and colonists were forcibly enslaving Africans and transporting them thousands of miles to the Americas. The cruel conditions on ships allowed infections to spread rapidly. ""These humans were kidnapped and then placed in crowded, unsanitary ships in completely subhuman conditions,"" says Ávila Arcos. ""Once the virus arrived in the Americas, the indigenous people had never been exposed to it before, so they were extremely vulnerable. It wiped out a large fraction of the indigenous population."" Rewriting history The discovery is one of the latest in the field of paleomicrobiology, whereby researchers extract fragments of microbial DNA from centuries-old skeletons. The DNA is then reconstructed, allowing scientists to diagnose a disease or condition hundreds or even thousands of years after the person's death. The technique is changing how we view and understand our past. Take smallpox – a devastating illness that killed an estimated 300 million people in the 20th Century alone. The origins of the variola virus that causes smallpox have always been obscure. From anecdotal accounts, historians believed it may have been around since 10,000BC, but until recently there was no scientific proof, and the oldest confirmed case was dated to the 17th Century using DNA extracted from a Lithuanian mummy. However in 2020 that date was pushed back, when Barbara Muhlemann, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, and her colleagues extracted variola virus from the teeth of Viking skeletons dated to AD600. The skeletons were uncovered in 11 burial sites in Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the UK. Smallpox was also found in multiple human remains from Öland, an island off the east coast of Sweden with a long history of trade. The finding predates the earliest confirmed smallpox cases by 1,000 years. The study provides clear evidence that the Vikings, who travelled extensively around Europe and beyond, carried smallpox with them. Meanwhile ancient-DNA analysis has also shone a light on the origins of the plague. A 2015 study analysing microbial DNA from the teeth of 101 skeletons found that the bacteria that causes plague, Y. pestis, had been spreading amongst humans for at least 3,000 years prior to the first documented plague pandemic. The researchers found Y. pestis bacteria in the DNA of seven of the skeletons, the oldest of whom died 5,783 years ago. Although modern plague is usually spread via rats carrying infected fleas, the study showed that the plague bacterium didn't acquire the mutations necessary to infect fleas until the turn of the 1st millennium BC. Before then it likely spread through human-to-human contact, resulting in the less serious pneumonic plague. Once it acquired the ability to infect fleas it spread rapidly, leading to outbreaks of the bubonic plague (Black Death), a pandemic which wiped out half the population of Europe in the 14th Century.   Ancient DNA is changing the way we view another serious disease: syphilis. It was previously believed that the first outbreak of syphilis in Europe occurred in 1495 in Italy, just after Christopher Columbus returned from his first voyage to the Americas. The sexually transmitted disease ran rampant amongst the infantry of King Charles VIII of France, who at the time was planning to conquer the Kingdom of Naples. The debilitating disease then quickly spread around Europe. As the outbreak happened just after the return of Columbus and his crew from their first trans-Atlantic voyage, most historians believed syphilis spread to Europe from what was referred to at the time as the 'New World'. But support is growing for a different theory. In 2020, Verena Schuenemann, a professor of archaeological science affiliated with the University of Basel and University of Zurich, led a team which extracted DNA from nine individuals whose bones bore the characteristic lesions of syphilis. The remains were recovered from cemeteries in Finland, Estonia, and the Netherlands. The researchers detected at least three separate strains of Treponema pallidum, the pathogen that causes syphilis, as well as other diseases such as yaws – now found only in the tropics. Carbon-dating of the skeletons and coffins confirmed that the individuals died between the early-to-late 15th Century, suggesting that syphilis was already circulating in Europe before Columbus returned from his maiden voyage. Calculations based on the mutation rate of the syphilis bacterium also suggest that the origin of the disease predates the time of arrival of Columbus. ""We know that the spread of pathogens is connected to trade routes,"" says Schuenemann.   ""We see that with syphilis, the plague, and leprosy – whenever humans started to exchange travel and trade, they also brought opportunities for pathogens to travel.""   Conversely, that means that microbial DNA can only tell us so much about the history of ancient pandemics. The DNA itself isn't a problem. Although DNA does degrade over time, researchers have sequenced the genome of a woolly mammoth who lived one million years ago. However it's likely that before around 12,000 years ago when humans adopted agriculture and farming, people wouldn't have come into contact often enough to cause a pandemic.   ""You need a certain amount of humans to actually transfer diseases, so we tend to see these diseases appearing alongside the first cities. When people started settling down, that's when the pandemics struck,"" says Schuenemann.   Clues from teeth   A great place to look for ancient microbial DNA is dental plaque. This sticky residue, which builds up on your teeth if you don't brush properly, traps bacteria, eventually causing tooth decay and gum disease. Eventually plaque undergoes a mineralisation process whereupon it hardens, ‘trapping' the DNA of ancient oral bacteria and viruses inside. Decoding this microbial genome is giving scientists access to a treasure trove of information about the health of our ancestors. For example the multinational Medical project is using human dental plaque to piece together the history of how leprosy was treated during the Middle Ages in Europe. Led by Emanuela Cristiani from Sapienza University of Rome, the team have analysed the tartar of teeth excavated from the medieval cemeteries of St Leonard's in Peterborough, England, and Saint-Thomas d'Aizier, in France. You might also like:  The team found traces of ginger in some individuals, suggesting that attempts were made to treat the condition. For instance, Constantine the African, a famous 11th-Century AD physician, wrote about preparing oral treatments containing ginger and other herbs to alleviate stomach pain triggered by leprosy. Mercury was also found in some patients, which could have been used to cover skin imperfections and as a pain-relieving ointment. This suggests that rather than simply stigmatising sufferers, victims were cared for. Diagnosing heart disease and Alzheimer's Sequencing dental DNA can do more than tell us about what infectious diseases a person had when they died. In the future, the technology could also reveal what a person's oral microbiome – the huge and diverse assemblage of bacteria, archaea and fungi that live in and around your mouth – was like too. This information, in turn, could tell us about the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in ancient times. NCDs are chronic conditions that are not the result of a singular infectious agent. They include conditions like heart disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's Disease. ""There's studies going back decades showing how oral health and the oral microbiome are related to these conditions,"" says Abigail Gancz, a biological anthropologist at Pennsylvania State University. In a recent article, Gancz argues that as the links between the oral microbiome and NCDs are so well-established, we may be able to use ancient microbial DNA to infer whether ancient human populations experienced these conditions too. Although they are often thought of as modern diseases caused by unhealthy lifestyles, we actually have no idea to what extent they were prevalent in ancestral human populations, because the vast majority of NCDs leave no distinctive traces on the skeleton. However, there are signs that they were present, although not to the same extent as today. ""In ancient Egyptian literature in some of the earliest written records you have descriptions that look a lot like diabetes, for example accounts of the sweet-smelling nature of urine,"" says Gancz.   ""There is an assumption that people in the past lived short, brutal lives, but a lot of them did make it to older age and would have experienced these non-communicable diseases."" Gancz is leading the Ancient Systemic Disease project, which aims to uncover the link between ancient human microbiomes and the presence of NCDs. So far, she has analysed the skeletons of 192 British individuals dating from the medieval to industrial period. The project involves painstakingly decoding the microbial DNA found in dental plaque to find out what bacteria and viruses the person had when they died. This is then compared to, and correlated with, known markers of disease present in the person's skeleton. ""There are various lesions in skeletons that indicate disease,"" says Gancz. For example, cavities or abscesses in the person's teeth may suggest that the person was suffering from periodontal disease. You can also detect signs of systemic inflammation by looking at a person's bones. For example, arthritis can lead to a visual deformation in bone morphology.   Bones are living thing that change throughout the lifespan, so the bones will have different forms and textures depending on whether someone was actively experiencing stress,"" says Gancz. When complete, the research should allow scientists to look at a skeleton's oral microbiome and use that information to calculate the likelihood that they also suffered from a chronic disease. This will allow researchers to track how conditions like arthritis and obesity have changed over time, including what effect if any the agricultural revolution, industrialisation, and urbanisation had on these conditions. There's good reason to believe that major transitions such as these had a huge impact on human health. For example, a 2013 study by Gancz's supervisor, Laura Weyrich, associate professor of anthropology at Pennsylvania State University, found that the oral microbiome of our ancestors changed – and became more unhealthy – after we switched from hunter-gatherers to farmers. The finding underlines the role that pathogens have had in shaping human history. But research like this isn't just of historical interest. It could be used to improve the health of modern humans too. One of the aims of Weyrich's research is to develop microbiome transplantations – swapping an unhealthy oral microbiome for a healthy one. ""Imagine a day where you don't have to brush your teeth as you have microbes in your mouth that don't cause oral disease – that might be something we can get to by looking at what microbes people had prior to the widespread presence of these modern oral diseases,"" says Weyrich.  ""I always tell people I wish I had teeth like a Neanderthal because the Neanderthals had brilliant oral health for the most part.

Spread to UST,UK hospital trials new coronavirus treatment drug,2024-09-25,2020-05-03,By Justin Rowlatt,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52504409,"A new drug developed by UK scientists to treat Covid-19 patients is being trialled at University Hospital Southampton.  Developed by UK bio-tech company Synairgen, it uses a protein called interferon beta, which our bodies produce when we get a viral infection.  Initial results from the trial are expected by the end of June. There are currently few effective treatments for coronavirus with doctors relying on patients' immune systems. Interferon beta is part of the body's first line of defence against viruses, warning it to expect a viral attack, explains Richard Marsden, chief executive of Southampton-based Synairgen. He says the coronavirus seems to suppress its production as part of its strategy to evade our immune systems. The drug is a special formulation of interferon beta delivered directly to the airways when the virus is there, with the hope that a direct dose of the protein will trigger a stronger anti-viral response even in patients whose immune systems are already weak. Interferon beta is commonly used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Synairgen has already shown its preparation can stimulate the immune response in the lungs of patients with asthma and other chronic lung conditions.  But we can only know whether it works for Covid-19 patients after it has been through a rigorous clinical trial. Kaye Flitney is one of 75 people who have been enrolled in the clinical trial, filmed exclusively by BBC Panorama. It requires Covid-19 patients, like her, to inhale the drug via a nebuliser to bring it deep into the lungs. Kaye, 67, struggles to sit up in her hospital bed and coughs as she puts the dispenser to her lips. She says when she first found out she had coronavirus her first thought was not for her own health. ""I was frightened because my husband has heart failure. It would kill him.""  The 67-year-old, who was taken to hospital due to difficulty with her breathing, said taking the drug hasn't caused her much discomfort.  ""You don't notice you're taking it 'til you're finished. It's not so bad. I could see myself taking it at home."" The 75 volunteers involved so far have been recruited from some 10 hospitals around Britain. Half get the drug, half get what is known as a placebo - an inactive substance.  No-one involved in the trial knows which patients have been given which treatment until the trial is over. ""If you know it's a drug, your mind might have a bias,"" explains Sandy Aitken, the nurse administering the drug. The hope is, it will show the patients getting the drug do much better than those that don't, says Professor Tom Wilkinson, of the University of Southampton.  Synairgen's drug trial is the template for a new fast-track clinical scheme that has just been set up by the government.  The Accord programme, as it is known, is designed to accelerate the development of new drugs for patients with Covid-19.  The first phase of the programme involves six other drugs.  More than 100 treatments are being explored worldwide and a drug called remdesivir, which was developed as an Ebola treatment, has generated particular excitement. US officials have claimed there is ""clear-cut"" evidence it helps people recover from the coronavirus.  Initial results from the interferon beta trial are expected by the end of June. But even if the drug does show promise, it will face further scrutiny before it can be used routinely on patients. That could take months, although the government has said it will work as fast as possible. If deemed effective, the drug and the nebulisers used to deliver it would then need to be manufactured in huge quantities.   Mr Marsden says he is already talking to suppliers around the world about whether it will be possible to start producing the drug as soon as the clinical trial is over.  However, he says it would still not be widely available until the end the year.  You can watch Panorama: When Will We Be Safe? at 19:30 BST on Monday, on BBC One and on the BBC iPlayer. "
Spread to UST,'New-build homes not fire safe',2024-09-25,2019-04-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48113301,"Houses developed by Persimmon Homes and Bellway Homes have potentially dangerous fire safety issues, BBC Watchdog Live has found. New-builds constructed by the firms were sold with missing or incorrectly installed fire barriers, which are designed to inhibit the spread of fire. In some cases, it's thought a lack of fire barriers contributed to the spread of fires that have destroyed homes. Persimmon Homes and Bellway Homes both said they were addressing the issue. Building Regulations require that by law new homes are built with fire protection measures to delay the spread of fire and allow crucial time for escape.  In many new builds, particularly timber-framed buildings, fire barriers are a vital part of this fire protection. The barriers are used to form a complete seal between different areas of a home, and without them, experts say, fire and smoke can spread five to ten times faster.  ""A comparison is if you were to buy a new car and you ultimately found that it didn't have an airbag in it […] It's an integral safety feature within the home,"" said industry expert Andrew Mellor. Responsibility for ensuring that buildings are compliant with Building Regulations ultimately lies with the house builder. In the cases the BBC has uncovered, serious breaches have gone undetected during construction, leaving homes and lives potentially at risk if fire breaks out.  Sarah Dennis is a resident at the Persimmon Homes Greenacres development in Exeter, where, in April 2018, a fire started by a cigarette dropped at ground level spread up to the roof of a house, and then to the adjacent properties. ""Neighbours asked if we could smell smoke. Went inside to check on the kids, there was smoke in the bedroom, Firemen arrived within a couple of minutes. Just a bit of smoke coming from the back and the next minute it was engulfed in flames,"" she said. Subsequent investigations by Persimmon Homes found missing fire barriers at 37% of homes on the Greenacres estate. This triggered a huge inspection programme of thousands of homes across the South West region, where more than 650 homes were found to have missing or incorrectly installed fire barriers. Some of these issues have not yet been rectified - and some homes have still not been inspected. Outside the South West, in Coventry, a Persimmon Homes building containing some 48 apartments was evacuated in 2018, following the discovery of a number of defects including missing fire barriers. Some residents are still living in temporary accommodation while retrofitting and other works are carried out. Persimmon Homes confirmed that, since the issues in the South West came to light in 2018,  it has written to 3200 home owners in the region, and has set up a ""dedicated team"" to carry out inspections.  It said that, in total, 2700 properties have been inspected, and remedial work has been carried out at 679 homes. The company said sample checks were also being conducted nationwide, saying ""if these inspections indicate that we need to inspect every timber frame property then we will do so."" ""This should not have happened and we would like to apologise to all affected homeowners and assure them that we are doing everything we can to rectify the issue swiftly,"" it added. BBC Watchdog Live also uncovered potentially dangerous fire safety issues in developments in Kent and West Lothian built by Bellway Homes. In 2015, a fire took hold in a block of Bellway Homes flats in Canterbury, Kent, and spread through dozens of properties, destroying or damaging 45 of them.  Subsequent inspections highlighted concerns over fire stopping in the wall cavities. Residents at the Old Tannery development have since been moved out while ""improvement works"" to address these fire safety issues are carried out at their homes. In Scotland, BBC Watchdog Live sent its own expert surveyor to a new build Bellway Homes development in West Lothian, to examine the fire protection at four houses, after concerns were raised by one resident whose house had previously been found to have inadequate fire barriers.  Surveyor and expert witness Greig Adams, who carried out the testing, found poorly fitted fire barriers at all four properties, with voids and gaps around them that would prevent them stopping fire from spreading. He said that the homes are not fire safe: ""What we've unfortunately found is that there are fire breach issues in every house we've looked at. It's a legal requirement that the cavity barriers are to be there. It's not optional- and with good reason: it saves lives"" Bellway Homes said it was ""committed to improvement"".  ""Mandatory training on many subjects, including fire stopping, has been introduced for all applicable construction staff and we remain committed to building quality homes in accordance with all relevant regulation,"" it added. Bellway Home also said that until last week, it was only aware of one property on the development in West Lothian where concerns with cavity barriers had been raised.  ""As a responsible builder, Bellway takes our customer's safety extremely seriously and we will investigate and address any raised concerns immediately, where there is perceived to be an imminent danger to persons or property,"" it said. It said that the investigation into the fire at the Old Tannery in Kent was ""inconclusive""- and that, following the fire, ""further remedial works were subsequently identified"" at the development, which it is working closely with the National House-Building Council to complete. The new series of BBC Watchdog Live starts on Wednesday 1st May at 8pm on BBC One and on iPlayer. "
Spread to UST,The monsters of Amen Corner,2024-09-25,2013-04-14,Rob Hodgetts,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/22140660,"Augusta. Sunday afternoon. The back nine. The Masters. It is what golfers dream of, to be in contention as those famous roars reverberate around the pines.  For the lucky few still in with a chance, the pressure mounts. But what looms is one of the hardest and most iconic stretches of holes in golf. Amen Corner. The term, coined by sports writer Herbert Warren Wind in 1958, signifies Augusta's 11th, 12th and the tee shot on 13. It's that amphitheatre of azaleas, whirling winds, Rae's Creek and devilish dramas at the lowest part of the course. Many are inclined to add the 10th to the collective, given its status as statistically the toughest hole. ""Having that opportunity to be in the thick of it and to feel that excitement, to feel that pressure, to grace Amen Corner knowing that you need birdies, and trying to win a Green Jacket, that is the greatest thrill a golfer can possibly experience,"" said Phil Mickelson.  With the Green Jacket up for grabs, let's see what the players face. The 10th takes first-timers at Augusta by surprise. It plunges away, with a huge drop in height between the tee and the green. Players try to hit a severe hook (or fade, for left-handers) around the corner to chop off the distance remaining and try to secure a flattish lie for the second shot. This video can not be played Watson's classy approach seals Masters But beware. Remember what happened to Rory McIlroy in the final round in 2011. He overdid it, caught the overhanging trees and ended among the cabins. Meltdown followed. ""If you don't hit the ball left you're in trouble,"" said Gary Player. ""Bubba Watson went right in the play-off last year, and OK he hit a miracle shot, but Louis Oosthuizen also went right and needed a four iron to the green. If you hook it, you've got an eight iron."" ""The 10th tee shot is something I specifically work on, trying to hit a three wood and moving it more than I would. The reward is getting right down on the flat,"" said Graeme McDowell. Landmark moment: The right-to-left sloping green is deceptive, too. New Zealand amateur Danny Lee six-putted here for a nine in 2009. The start of Amen Corner proper, and a hole that has been changed significantly over the years. The tee was moved back 30 yards in 2002 and another 15 in 2006. Dozens of trees have been added to the right side of the fairway over the last decade, directing drives more to the left.  ""I remember playing with the likes of Seve and Raymond Floyd and they always said to just hit it over where the gallery is, that's the angle you want to come from,"" said Tiger Woods. ""Well, you can't get over there anymore, the hole is playing to the left.  ""It's a much different hole.  A good drive will leave me somewhere between an 8 iron to a 5 iron in there, whereas before it was a driver and a sand wedge, pitching wedge.""  Coming over the hill as you walk down from the tee, you see Amen Corner spread out before you. The vast crowds on the grass, the grandstand, the 11th green and its pond to the left, the 12th tee and the 12th green beyond Rae's to the right.  ""When I first played 11, I couldn't believe how expansive [it was],"" said Woods. ""TV doesn't do it justice how expansive it is from that whole open area on 12 and 13.  And certainly, the commentators try and give it justice, but I don't think they really can, of how much it swirls."" The second to 11 needs to be pin-point. Left is wet, right is tight, leaving a tricky chip onto a fast, sloping green with water lurking beyond.  ""By the time you get to the top of 11 you're looking at the flags on the 11th green and the 12th green, trying to judge the wind,"" said McDowell. Landmark moment: The 11th will long be remembered for Larry Mize's chip-in to win the 1987 play-off. The short 12th,  just a few strides to the right of the 11th, is one of the most revered holes in golf. Backed by rows and rows of patrons in their Augusta green chairs with a grandstand behind, it is the quintessential Masters experience. In the final round, it is packed. The tension is palpable.  The 12th is famous for the fickle winds that dance and dart about above the trees, making club selection tricky. Stories are legion of players choosing wrong, or the wind changing as they hit, and either coming up short and finding Rae's Creek (or the front bunker if you are lucky), or going long into the back bunkers or azalea beds. Guan Tianlang, the 14-year-old Chinese amateur making his Masters debut, crosses Rae's Creek ""You hear guys trying, saying, don't pull a club on 12 until you see both flags on 11 and 12 are moving the same direction.  They are never, ever moving the same direction,"" laughed Woods. ""I've played it so many times where I've played 11, 12 and 13 either all downwind or all into the wind.  How does that work?  You know, you get down there and Bobby Jones has turned this fan on and it swirls."" Ben Crenshaw's veteran caddie Carl Jackson, in his 52nd Masters, says: ""You've got to think about the wind direction, whether it's a sunny day, is it consistent, whether you got to lean on something? It will fool you, because the wind circles in those trees. The caddie's got to have some idea of the type of shot his player is thinking about hitting and make suggestions from that. Sometimes he might just want to hit a little fade or play it down a little bit. ""It can go from a nine iron to a four iron. Some strong guys will even hit a pitching wedge these days.""  Landmark moment: Fred Couples came to the 12th with the lead in 1992 but misjudged his approach to Sunday's traditional right-side pin position and saw his ball trickle agonisingly towards the water. Amazingly, it stayed up and Couples salvaged par before beating Floyd by two.  Still on the far side of Rae's Creek, you walk from the 12th green up to the 13th tee, which is back up in the woods beside the neighbouring Augusta Country Club's ninth hole,, external just over the fence. This is the furthest you've been from the crowd all day. A chance to take a deep breath and hear your heart beating. Technically part of Amen Corner, the 13th offers the chance of an eagle if you get it right, but there are dangers on all sides. Mickelson's miracle shot helped him win his third Masters title in 2010 Most opt for a draw (or fade for a left-hander), but some just nibble at the corner with a straighter one. Left is trees and a creek, too straight and you end up in the pine straw. Not that it bothered Phil Mickelson when he conjured his miracle shot in 2010.  The second shot throws up a dilemma - gamble and try to fly the ball over the tributary of Rae's Creek and onto the green to set up a possible eagle, or lay-up and hope your pitching is good enough to grab a birdie. It could define your tournament. Mickelson says it is his favourite hole. ""It's the risk/reward opportunities,"" he said. ""I've made eagles there to move up.  I've made mistakes there to move back. ""I just think that the shot value that's required there, the lie that is challenging, takes creativity. It's hard to understand, especially on TV, but even in person, how much above your feet that ball is for a right handed player and how much below it is for a left handed player.  Looks simple enough, big greens, just knock it on; it's a tough shot.""  Landmark moment: Plenty of hopes have faded in the creek, or with a tame par on the vast, multi-layered green when others are forging ahead with birdies or eagles. Just ask Japan's Tommy Nakajima. He took a 13 here in 1978.   Whether you are still in contention to win the Masters depends on how you have fared at the start of the back nine.   ""Those holes are monsters,"" said Player.

Spread to UST,What did the ancient Romans eat?,2024-09-25,2021-07-20,Susan Van Allen,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20210719-what-did-the-ancient-romans-eat,"A chef is unearthing recipes from one of the world's oldest cookbooks to reveal the origin of Italian food. It's sunset in Rome, outside the city walls. Golden light filters through umbrella pines and casts its glow on a straight stretch of smooth basalt stones that changed the course of history. This is the Appian Way, the first road built in Rome, where more than 2,000 years ago soldiers set out to conquer distant lands and returned in triumph. The road is the heart of Rome's Appia Antica Archaeological Park, an expansive green wedge that stretches from the edge of the city's historical centre to the hillside villages of the Castelli Romani. This 4,700-hectare oasis is the second largest urban park in Europe – dotted with aqueducts, nature reserves, archaeological sites, vineyards, pastures and villas owned by such luminaries as designer Valentino and actress Gina Lollobrigida. Less than 3km from the Colosseum's crowds, the parco gives travellers a place to slow down and leisurely experience the Roman countryside, complete with birdsong and sightings of shepherds leading their flocks. The scattering of ruins adds a certain memento mori that enchanted painters and poets of the Grand Tour, as you feel the circle of life standing on this old road: soft breeze carrying the scent of fresh grass, crumbling stones carrying stories from the past. As this is Italy, good food must complete the idyllic scene. Enter Paolo Magnanimi, of the Appian Way's Hostaria Antica Roma. The restaurant is located within sight of the park's iconic Mausoleum of Cecilia Metella and fronted by a flower and vegetable garden tended by Magnanimi's father, Massimo. Inside, the menu lists dishes that can't be found at any other restaurant in the city, or perhaps in the world. Behind these creations is Magnanimi, a cook passionate about creating and serving meals that are deeply rooted in this park's history, from the days of ancient Rome. For most, ancient Roman food doesn't sound appealing. What first comes to mind are freakish scenes like Trimalchio's banquet in the 1st-Century AD story Satyricon, where a nouveau riche host throws an ostentatious feast that includes such ""delicacies"" as bull's testicles, sow's udders and a hare decorated with wings to resemble Pegasus. You may also be interested in: • Has Rome declared an artichoke war? • Italy's beloved 3-ingredient pasta dish • The world's oldest known recipes decoded But Magnanimi keeps it real, recreating delicious dishes that regular Romans ate, not the exotic fare that was reserved for the super elite. A chef and historian who has spent more than 25 years studying ancient recipes, Magnanimi says Romans were nature lovers and sensual pleasure seekers who greatly appreciated good food, though over-indulging was very ""un-Roman"". Grains, legumes, vegetables, eggs and cheeses were the base of the diet, with fruit and honey for sweetness. Meat (mostly pork), and fish were used sparingly, and as the empire expanded beginning in the 3rd Century BC, Romans welcomed new flavours – be it pepper from India or lemons from Persia. Garum, similar to an Asian fish sauce, was liberally used to add a rich umami flavour to Roman dishes. All this was enjoyed with honeyed wine at dinners called convivium – gatherings to celebrate life and the seasons. Magnanimi embodies this spirit of celebration, whether telling stories to guests or stirring up something delicious in his kitchen. Now 54, he laughs telling me how as a younger man he had a hard time convincing his father that customers would like his revivals of ancient dishes. ""I started working in the Hostaria when I was 14 and took a break to have my 'Jack Kerouac' years in the USA,"" he said. ""When I came back, I had a new appreciation for the great history of Rome, and I was hungry to learn more about it."" Magnanimi's inspiration grew when a friend gave him Dinner with Lucullo, a book full of stories and recipes from the days of ancient Rome. Its title character was a 1st-Century BC military man who was so famous for his banquets that Romans still praise a good dinner by saying, ""that was a meal worthy of Lucullo."" Magnanimi started testing recipes and had his first success with pullum oxizomum, a chicken entree. It is made with leeks and colatura di alici di Cetara, a condiment from the Amalfi Coast made from fermented anchovies that is the perfect substitute for garum. Some Japanese diners especially enjoyed it, and that led to him being featured on documentaries in Japan. ""My Roman groupies came after that; they were harder to convince to try something new,"" Magnanimi said. ""And then pollo oxizomum was praised in The New York Times, so it is still one of our most popular dishes."" These days, the Hostaria's menu features the Eternal City standards (such as pasta amatriciana and carbonara), along with the ancient Roman dishes that have brought Magnanimi international attention and made his once-sceptical father proud. I first met Magnanimi in 2008 when I landed in the Hostaria and, on the recommendation of a foodie friend, ordered patina cotidiana, a tomato-less predecessor to lasagne. The original recipe used lagana, a flat bread, which was layered with meats, fish and cheeses. Magnanimi's was simpler, filled with ground pork, fennel and pecorino cheese. To recreate this 2,000-year-old dish, Magnanimi started with a recipe from the 1st-Century AD Roman cookbook De Re Coquinaria, the only surviving recipe book from ancient Rome, which is attributed to Apicius, a wealthy gourmand once described by Pliny the Elder as ""the most gluttonous gorger of all spendthrifts"". Since the ancient recipes didn't use quantities or details for preparation, he then consulted noted Italian archaeologist Eugenia Salza Prina Ricotti to recreate the dishes by estimating their measurements with ingredients that were true to the era. ""I couldn't put tomato in it,"" Magnanimi said, ""because tomatoes didn't come to Italy until the 1500s, when Cortes brought them back from the Americas."" The patina cotidiana, which means ""daily dish"" in Latin, is now a restaurant signature. My first taste kept me returning to try more flavours of ancient Rome, including sweets such as tiropatina, a custard that's spiced with pepper, which Romans believed to be an aphrodisiac. Magnanimi told me his most recent creation is la cassata di Oplontis, inspired by a fresco found in a villa near Pompeii. The rich cake made with almond flour, ricotta, candied fruit and honey sells out every night. ""My cheese, I make with the mortar and pestle, exactly like a recipe from Virgil, from the 1st Century AD,"" Magnanimi said. This is moretum, a cheese spread inspired by Virgil's poem about a farmworker preparing his humble lunch, grinding together coriander, celery seed, garlic and pecorino. It can be slathered on libum, a round bread that was sacred to the Romans. I'd seen black carbonised libum in a Pompeii Museum, where a guide told me that its crumbs were placed on altars as an offering to household gods – a precursor to the Christian eucharist. Magnanimi shapes his libum in light, puffy rolls and stuffs them with ricotta sourced from the sheep farm up the road. Magnanimi missed engaging with guests during Italy's Covid-19 lockdown. With all the free time, he took lots of walks through the surrounding Appian Way, where leafy footpaths and bike lanes served as an outdoor refuge for Italians enduring some of Europe's strictest lockdown measures. ""I spent a long morning with a shepherd, some days I'd see so many Romans coming here to jog because they couldn't go to the gym, and on weekends, there were families having picnics near the aqueducts, probably coming here for the first time. I could tell we all were feeling a bigger appreciation for where we live, for Rome."" ""Paolo is an important part of this place. He keeps it lively,"" said Simone Quilici, the director of the Appia Antica Archaeological Park. Quilici is continuing a mission that began in the early 19th Century when the idea of preserving this area began to take hold. That's when archaeologist and architect Luigi Canina decided to plant the now archetypal umbrella pines along the Appian Way. Sadly, the park plans were never fulfilled and by the 20th Century, with uncontrolled traffic and the turbulence of the World War years, there was danger that this precious section of the Appian Way would be destroyed. The area became vandalised and riddled with criminal activity. Finally in 1988, largely thanks to decades of protests, the area was officially designated a park. ""I remember coming here as a little girl,"" Eleonora Fanelli, a Roman archaeologist and tour guide told me. ""I couldn't believe this was in my city, a place out of a fairy tale where I could imagine a prince on horseback galloping on the path."" Now, Fanelli loves to take visitors here. ""Even if it's raining, they want to get out and walk on the road, step on the stones that have chariot wheel marks on them, from 312BC!"" She loves to tell the story of the Roman censor, Appius Claudius Caecus, who nearly bankrupted the Roman treasury to have this road built. The legend goes that though he went blind, he still maintained quality control by walking barefoot on the road to ensure that the stones were smoothly laid. The Appian Way eventually extended 563km south to Brindisi on the Adriatic coast, and was the key to the creation of the Roman Empire.  Magnanimi has lived in the park for two decades and has high praise for Quilici's leadership. ""Since he began in 2017, he's made the park so much better for Romans and for tourists. New things have opened, like the 2nd-Century AD thermal baths of Capo di Bove, where there are beautiful mosaics and a garden."" There is also a new ItinerAppia App, where visitors can scan a QR code and learn about each monument. ""I feel so lucky to live here and to welcome travellers to experience Rome, La Grande Bellezza, for real!,"" Magnanimi said. ""Here they can step back thousands of years on these stones and know how good it tasted."" --- Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

Spread to UST,The new never ending workday,2024-09-25,2014-11-03,Renuka Rayasam,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20140820-secrets-of-time-shifting,"It’s the middle of the night but you’ve got to take this call. It’s not an emergency, it’s just one of your key clients and it’s morning at his office halfway across the globe. Still, you’ve got to pick up.  Sounds extreme, perhaps, but it’s a fact of life for many in today's globalised work force. What do you do when your clients and colleagues are spread across different time zones? For some time-zone-trotting professionals, the answer is something akin to a personal time warp. Fredrich Kahrl faced this dilemma after moving to Berlin from San Francisco. Kahrl's wife had accepted a one-year fellowship and the couple were keen to spend the time in Germany together with their toddler. However, Kahrl — a consultant at Energy + Environmental Economics, an energy consulting firm — wanted to continue working for his US-based employer. Kahrl's boss allowed him to stay on as long as he kept in touch through weekly meetings and didn’t drop the ball with his mostly American and Canadian clients. What this meant, though, was working non-traditional hours. When Berlin was preparing to go to bed, Kahrl was preparing for meetings and taking calls at odd hours, including once in the middle of the night in the bathroom, so as not to disturb the family, all asleep in their small apartment. “Distance is dead, but time zones aren’t,” said Erran Carmel, dean of the Kogod School of Business at American University in Washington DC and co-author of I'm Working While They're Sleeping: Time Zone Separation Challenges and Solutions. And, he said, the time zone dilemma is one that technology can’t solve. People still need to sleep, spend time with their family and “construct a rhythm of their day,” he said. Enter time-shifting. These days, more people are working outside the regular daytime work day, integrating calls and emails from far flung colleagues and clients throughout the evening and early morning hours. The decidedly low-tech strategy is one principal way to manage working across time zones, said Carmel. While the number of workers dependent on time zones is unknown, Microsoft has estimated that there are more than 500 million knowledge workers worldwide. Carmel estimates that more 10 million of them must coordinate with others regularly across time zones. With team members spread across continents, even simple tasks like scheduling a meeting mean at least one person adjusts his or her schedule, waking a few hours earlier or staying up later to coordinate with everyone else, Carmel said. And they do so with little corporate guidance. While there has been plenty of emphasis by companies on tackling culture or language barriers amongst a global workforce and clientele, workers scattered across the globe are typically on their own when it comes to trying to balance their personal and professional lives. Working round-the-clock Manu Gopinath, Global Head of Human Resources at California-based UST Global, starts his work day at 7:00. The global information technology services provider has about 15,000 employees in 20 countries and Gopinath has to coordinate with people in seven different time zones on a daily basis. The company holds most of its global calls from 7:00 to 11:00 Pacific Time, which is eight hours behind Greenwich Mean Time. But it’s a window that works best for most time zones, Gopinath said. It’s the busiest part of Gopinath’s work day; he has to juggle multiple calls, emails and deal with time-critical issues. After that he takes a break before getting back to work. Gopinath is home early in the evening to spend time with his wife and young children and then logs back on for an hour or two at the start of the business day in Europe and Asia before heading to bed. “It’s more about work-life integration than work-life balance,” said Gopinath, who has worked at UST Global since its launch 15 years ago. Given the global nature of his job, Gopinath, 40, said he would rather answer texts and take quick calls while spending time with his kids than make a choice between work and his personal life. “In many cases I get calls or texts or WhatsApp messages during the evening,” he said. “If I am watching TV I can just quickly respond and keep the work moving.” Becoming a night owl Miranda Ash lives in London and works with many American clients and colleagues, so she shifts her day in the other direction. Ash, a self-described night owl, often starts her work day in the afternoon — morning in the US — and works until about 22:00 or 23:00, taking a break to have dinner with husband. “I think it works well for him because he gets to watch football (soccer) at night,” she said. Ash had worked typical daytime hours before becoming global director for membership and awards at WorldBlu, a workplace consulting firm, about five years ago. The company’s eight employees are spread across five times zones with clients all over the globe. The new schedule was an adjustment, she said. “Everyone presumed that I was in the US and I would get calls at one or two in the morning” she said. Ash quickly learned to how to be flexible, while still keeping a manageable schedule. She turns off her phone when she’s done for the night and makes it clear to clients and colleagues that she is based in the UK. She stacks her early morning and late night calls on just one or two days a week, so she can avoid working around the clock every day. Kahrl also eventually settled into a routine in Berlin, using the quiet time in the morning to spend time with his daughter and later focus on tough tasks that required uninterrupted time. The pace of calls and emails pick up in the afternoon and he responded, but Kahrl said he became more disciplined about turning down middle of the night calls by making his availability clear to colleagues and clients. It didn’t always work. “In Germany it always invariably happened that when I was sitting in a beer garden after three beers, I would get a colleague who calls and asks for help,” Kahrl said.

Spread to UST,The earliest examples of printing,2024-09-25,2020-01-15,Cameron Laux,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200115-how-buddhism-spread-written-language-around-the-world,"By ensuring that the Buddha’s teachings were transmitted across millennia, the religion helped develop and spread printing techniques around the world – as a new exhibition reveals. Do you ever feel like you’re trapped in a hamster wheel, while the lord of hell sinks his tusk-sized fangs into you? If so, you might feel a jolt of recognition upon seeing a Buddhist thangka painting by the Nepalese Master Buddha Lama. It’s been created for an exhibition of Buddhist artworks and manuscripts now at the British Library in London, featuring scrolls, artefacts and illuminated books spanning 2,000 years and 20 countries. More like this:  - The most powerful word in English  - The story of handwriting in 12 objects  - The surprising history of the word ‘dude’ Although Buddhist principles like mindfulness have filtered into mainstream Western culture, other key tenets might not be as well-known. According to Buddhist cosmology, life is suffering experienced within the cycle of birth, death and rebirth. In Lama’s painting, we are in the big wheel that Yama, the lord of hell, is holding. (His facial hair is on fire and he wears a crown of skulls.) At the centre of the wheel are three animals symbolising the root causes of suffering, the ‘three poisons’: ignorance (pig), attachment (rooster), and anger (snake). The latter two come out of the mouth of the pig: ignorance is the primary obstacle to achieving anything, take note. The ferris wheel of samsara (rebirth) rotates on this hub. The slice of pie at the top represents the realm of the gods (a gilded cage); the one on the bottom is hell. The others are the realms of demi-gods and humans (top half), and animals and ‘hungry ghosts’ (bottom half). People who are ruled by their cravings are reborn as hungry ghosts. Rebirth in the human realm is fortunate because it offers greater opportunities to escape samsara and achieve nirvana – the extinguishing of desire. One dies and is reborn in the various sectors of the wheel according to one’s conduct. The more materialistic you are, the more ruled by passions, the more unpleasant your realm of existence. Ignorance is absolutely no excuse. The British Library’s exhibition offers insights via objects that are as much artworks as artefacts. At the entrance, a 19th-Century gilded Buddha holds a myrobalan, a fruit that is a metaphorical cure for the three poisons. Among his other poses, the Buddha is often depicted as the great healer of human suffering. A Buddha is present in the upper corners of the thangka painting, to show us the way to the exit. The way off this mirthless amusement park ride is to follow the Buddha’s teachings, and the exhibition presents these in stunning profusion. It also questions common misconceptions. “There is no consensus whether Buddhism is a religion or not,” Jana Igunma, the curator of the exhibition, tells BBC Culture. Buddhism has no “supreme divine being or creator god”; the Buddha is more like a teacher, a guide, and one studies his philosophy and his life by way of texts and illustrations. The media that have carried these over the millennia are fascinating. As many as 500 million people worldwide might identify themselves as Buddhists, but there is no way of knowing for sure, because Buddhism isn’t exclusive: you can practise it, or adopt elements of it, any way you want. Nobody is going to tell you you’re doing it wrong. Also, Buddhism isn’t evangelical: whether or not you choose to listen to the Buddha’s teachings is on you. Perhaps you aren’t ready, and need to spend more time in the realm of the animals or of the hungry ghosts? Buddhism is focussed on preserving and transmitting the teachings of the Buddha, and commentary thereon; and throughout history, it’s been quick to innovate and exploit transcription and printing technologies. It is one of the great drivers of human civilisations. Woodblock printing, for example, was crucial to the spread of Buddhism across East Asia, and in turn, Buddhism helped to spread printing techniques. As Igunma points out, “The Buddhist textual tradition has been an important part of world [civilisation]. The diversity of writing materials and the creativity in the production of manuscripts and books is fascinating… Buddhists were and continue to be keen adopters of new technologies.” The way of the word Depending on the region of the world and the historical period, Buddhist manuscripts and books have been created on a wide range of materials, including stone, palm leaves, precious metals, ivory, cloth, paper and silk. The Buddha’s teachings are written in Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese, Tibetan, Japanese, south-east Asian languages, and subsequently Western languages. As Igunma observes, in the exhibition there are “objects from 20 countries in even more languages and scripts”. All are distinguished by the thoughtfulness, delicacy, and beauty with which they celebrate the life and ideas of the Buddha; as well as by the ingenuity of the media of transmission. An early example of Buddhist text engraved in Pyu script on gold sheets demonstrates how exquisite and solid the Buddhist textual legacy can be. Palm-leaf manuscripts were a prevalent form of textual transmission from the time of the Buddha until the development of the printing press; from 500 BC up to the 19th Century. Palm leaves are readily available throughout India and south-east Asia. When trimmed, treated, and dried they take ink well, and they are durable in the humidity of south and south-east Asia. They result in ‘books’ composed of very large, oblong folios – a good paper equivalent many centuries before paper came into use in Europe. To begin near the beginning, the exhibition includes fragments of Gandharan scrolls from the 1st Century AD, created about 400 years after the historical Buddha is thought to have lived. These are of outstanding importance: as Igunma observes, they are “the oldest extant written scriptures of Buddhism”. The scrolls were made of birch bark in Gandhara, an ancient Buddhist kingdom in the region of present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. They contain Buddhist scriptures in the Gandhari language and Kharosthi script. The fragments seem so ancient and fragile, yet the script on them remains hauntingly clear. We make a jump in refinement of manuscript transmission, to a version of paper as we know it, with the Sutra of the Ten Kings, which was found in a cave near Dunhuang, north-west China, amidst a huge cache of documents. By this time, paper had been in use in central and east Asia, where the dryer climate lent itself to finer material, for centuries. The 2.5m-long painted paper scroll Sutra dates to the 10th Century, and depicts the Ten Kings of the Underworld, sitting behind desks, in judgement on people’s good and evil deeds. A secretary stands beside the king taking notes. The judged souls wear wooden cangues, and are driven by a gaoler. The six possibilities of rebirth are depicted, from hell to Buddhahood. Japan is an important centre for Buddhism, and for refined manuscript creation. Of the exhibits from Japan, two are extraordinary. A copy of the Lotus Sutra was commissioned by Emperor Go-Mizunoo in 1636. The Lotus Sutra is a key text in the Mahayana tradition of East Asia, and is seen by many of its adherents as the summation of the Buddha’s teachings. On display is the scroll of chapter eight of 28 chapters. The lavishly illustrated scroll contains gold and silver ink on indigo-dyed paper. The segment reproduced in the photo here shows the Buddha promising Buddhahood to his 500 disciples. Igunma also draws our attention to the ‘Million Pagoda Charms’, containing incantations to invoke the protective deities, because “they are the earliest examples of printing in Japan, and among the earliest in the world”, dating back to between 764 and 770 AD. Empress Shotoku ordered the charms, including Buddhist texts, to be printed on small strips of paper, and placed in miniature wooden pagodas; the pagodas were then distributed among the 10 leading Buddhist temples in western Japan. There is debate on the subject, but woodblock printing seems to have been used to create the documents. (The ‘Million Pagoda Charms’ were thought to be the world’s oldest printed documents until 1966, when a similar document was discovered that was believed to have been created before 751.) The library – storage of documents – is of course important to Buddhism and its many texts. This too is executed with great flair. Jana Igunma personally regards one of the highlights of the exhibition as “a small arrangement of manuscript chests and a book cabinet which give visitors an impression of what a temple library in mainland south-east Asia looks like”. A photo here depicts a 19th-Century Thai carved and gilded wooden manuscript chest for the storage of Buddhist texts. It is raised on legs, and closes and locks to protect manuscripts from moisture and pest damage. Igunma notes that temple libraries are very sacred places, where “one can find true solitude and tranquillity”. Finally, to end in the present, the British Library commissioned a painted wall hanging – a new Buddhist ‘text’ – of the Vessantara Jātaka by three Singaporean artists, Irving Chan Johnson, Lim Su Qi, and Rungnapa Kitiarsa. It is painted in the style of a 19th-Century Thai banner painting, a visual teaching aid. It is an outstanding work of art, and depicts 13 scenes from the Buddha’s previous life in order to teach about the Buddhist values of generosity and charity. On the way out of the exhibition there is a large standing bell of the sort used in temples for meditation and chanting. Visitors are invited to strike it with a mallet. If Buddhism has a characteristic ‘sound’, this must be it. The tone, so characteristic of Buddhism, is deep, clear, and thrilling. It is the sound of awakening, a call to attention. Another distinctive sound comes through the ancient language Pali, regarded as close to the language the Buddha spoke. The Pali canon of the Buddha’s teachings is an important fount of later translations – and recitations of those texts can be listened to online. Like the bell, it’s an immediate entrypoint into something that has been preserved, via scroll and manuscript, for millennia. The Buddhism exhibition is at the British Library in London until 23 February 2020.

Spread to UST,The soft power roots of K-pop,2024-09-25,2020-03-09,Christine Ro,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200309-the-soft-power-roots-of-k-pop,"The wave of South Korean pop culture around the world hasn’t happened by accident – it was a deliberate government plan, writes Christine Ro. And it has even reached North Korea. GeumHyok Kim loves South Korean dramas, especially historical shows like Dae Jang Geum (Jewel in the Palace). He used to watch them every day, and would also repeatedly watch music videos of South Korean pop groups like Girls’ Generation. What’s unusual about Kim’s love of such culture is that it is illegal. Kim is from Pyongyang, North Korea, where a person caught accessing or smuggling foreign media can be sentenced to a stint in a labour re-education camp or, in the most severe cases, public execution. While extreme, Kim’s experiences show the truly global spread of South Korean culture. More like this:  - Ear assault in Ukraine  - Taiwan’s eerie sonic weapon  - The music played to drown out a war In just a few decades, South Korean culture has taken the world by storm. Since the country’s democratisation in the late 1980s, the relaxation of censorship, the reduction of travel restrictions, and the push to diversify the economy have all contributed to the global spread of its culture. This hasn’t occurred by accident. Hallyu, or the ‘Korean wave’ of culture, has been a deliberate tool of soft power. South Korea isn’t alone in this; many countries invest in cultural councils and exchanges partly to strengthen diplomatic aims. But the South Korean government’s push for cultural power has had remarkably quick success. The roots of Korean participation in modern pop culture can be traced back decades. For instance, in 1959, the Kim Sisters, a singing trio, arrived in Las Vegas for the first of many performances. This group, who appeared 22 times on The Ed Sullivan Show, have been called “cultural ambassadors” and “America’s original K-pop stars”. But hallyu, or the Korean wave, only kicked off following the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. According to a new book, South Korean Popular Culture and North Korea, South Korea’s government “targeted the export of popular media culture as a new economic initiative, one of the major sources of foreign revenue vital for the country’s economic survival and advancement”. In 1998, President Kim Dae-jung, who called himself the “President of Culture”, was inaugurated. His administration started to loosen the ban on cultural products imported from Japan, which had been a reaction to the Japanese colonisation of Korea in the first half of the 20th Century; first manga was allowed back in. The following year, the government introduced the Basic Law for Cultural Industry Promotion and allocated $148.5 million (£113 million) to this. In music, South Korean pop groups had flourished domestically in the early 1990s. Seo Taiji & Boys debuted on a Korean talent show in 1992, marking the start of modern K-pop, with its integration of English lyrics, hip hop elements, and dance. By the mid-90s, the K-pop star system had become entrenched in South Korea. Yet the government wanted to spread their culture around the world – and it started in an unlikely place. South Korea’s first major global successes were soapy TV programmes known as K-dramas, initially intended for domestic audiences, but which found popularity in other parts of Asia and further afield. 2002’s Winter Sonata became a global phenomenon partly through the South Korean government’s deals with broadcasters in strategic locations, like Iraq and Egypt, to increase positive feelings towards Korea. The international success of K-dramas spurred a careful planning of the globalisation of K-pop, beyond the groups that had achieved national fame. As with the electronics and automobile industries, the centralisation of economic power within large conglomerates allowed for slick production under careful discipline. In the K-pop star system, this meant recruiting pop musicians and managing them through years of training and careful presentation – which paid off with dizzyingly successful pop acts like the boy band EXO, who made their television debut in 2011. EXO was conceived of as a South Korean-Chinese group, performing in both Korean and Mandarin and promoting their songs in both countries. One year later, the music video for Psy’s Gangnam Style became the first YouTube video to achieve 1 billion views (and started a global craze for mock-horse-dancing). UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, praising the song, described the arts as a path to cultural understanding. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry’s Global Artist Chart, South Korean boy-band BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide, and the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart. As of 2019, the group accounted for $4.65 billion (£3.5 billion) of South Korea’s GDP – and they became the first Asian band to surpass 5 billion streams on Spotify. The country has seen success in film, too: this year, Bong Joon-ho’s dark comedy Parasite became the first film not in English to win the best picture Oscar, and so far it has grossed more than $50 million (£38 million) at the US box office. The popularity of Korean music, TV and films has spurred growth in other sectors, such as tourism, food and language education. Exports of cosmetics and skincare products, a fixture in beauty-obsessed South Korea, have also skyrocketed. In 2015, South Korea exported cosmetics with a total value of $2.64bn (£1.85bn). And in 2017, South Korean President Moon Jae-In announced the aim of spreading Korean film, music and TV to 100 million people within five years. But how has the international diffusion of South Korean culture played out in its very different neighbour to the north? From South Korean wave to Southern wind Sunny Yoon, a media professor at Seoul’s Hanyang University, emphasises that North Korean audiences aren’t ignorant and passive consumers of foreign cultural products. But as North Koreans who watch South Korean media are, according to Professor Yoon, “in desperate situations (extreme poverty and no freedom)… it is natural for them to desire a new way of life by watching foreign media”. Hallyu has been called a ‘cultural weapon’ in North Korea, where it is referred to as nampung (‘Southern wind’). Given the secrecy in the Hermit Kingdom, what is known about South Korean culture in the North comes mainly from people who have fled North Korea. One is GeumHyok Kim, who as a member of the elite class had certain privileges that allowed him to access foreign culture. At his college, where he was studying for an English degree, his professors would show Hollywood films in their classes: big-budget fare like Top Gun and Armageddon. Kim would give South Korean dramas to his friends, which occasionally landed him in trouble. He was interrogated twice as a 15-year-old about possession of foreign media. He avoided punishment because his father bribed the officials. “Culture makes people brave,” he reflects now. It also makes them curious about differences between their countries and others, as in North Korea. “They started to not believe what the government says.” And, importantly, Kim was allowed to study in Beijing. Being around classmates from different countries, who exposed him to documentaries and books about North Korea, was a shock. “It really made a big bang in my brain,” he says. “I realised that what I knew about North Korea was all a lie.” Eventually he made the difficult decision to defect, although it meant cutting himself off from his family and putting them at risk. Black-market access like Kim’s has been key to the penetration of South Korean and Western media in North Korea. The catastrophic North Korean famine in the mid-1990s, when Kim was a child, reduced citizens’ trust and reliance on the government. Desperate people turned to smuggling for the food they needed, and sophisticated international networks increasingly brought in items that North Koreans could sell to make a living. This includes USB drives containing South Korean films or TV dramas, whose sale can bring in over a month’s worth of food. As North Korea is pursuing a close relationship with China, being caught with Chinese films is less serious than, for instance, being caught with the songs of BTS. Yet watching foreign media is widespread. Some North Korean fans watch programmes with the blinds drawn or one earphone on low volume, keeping an ear out for inspectors. This is aided by the spread of certain technologies. Rich families have solar panels, due to frequent power outages, that allow them to enjoy foreign media uninterrupted. A lucky minority have mobile phones. While the North Korean regime jams foreign broadcasts, some make it through, especially in border areas. And USB drives have become increasingly popular in North Korea, for being easier to smuggle than previous digital media like DVDs. The influence has had some surprising effects, for instance on language. North Koreans exposed to South Korean pop culture have adopted slang and accents from South Korean actors. Some wedding ceremonies have two parts: one with songs approved by the North Korean government, and the second one secretly incorporating rituals borrowed from South Korean media. South Korean makeup and fashion are popular in North Korea, whose regime restricts hairstyles and clothing. This seems to be loosening recently, though, partly due to the influence of fashion-loving Lee Seol-Ju, Kim Jong-Un’s wife. Pop culture opening minds Certain Western pop culture is popular as well. As well as K-pop, defectors claim that films such as Titanic and bands like Westlife made them increasingly aware of what the North Korean regime wasn’t telling them. Access to foreign culture appears to affect loyalty to North Korea. Almost all recent North Korean refugees report being influenced by South Korean TV, films or music. They can be disillusioned on arriving in the South, seeing that not everyone is wealthy and trouble-free. The very different gender norms also take some getting used to. There have been challenges for North Koreans integrating into South Korea: the national suicide rate – already high – is three times higher among defectors. Some choose to return to North Korea. The influence of culture is ultimately limited. North Koreans’ enjoyment of foreign media “demonstrates political dissatisfaction, but this does not turn into an overt political resistance”, says Yoon. Songs, comics, TV programmes and films expand ideas, but on their own won’t bring about regime change. As Kim says, “in dramas, in movies, we can see other societies that are very different. But there is a limit. No one is telling about democracy in dramas. They always tell about love.” Yet they still have an important role. “Culture is soft, culture is light, but culture has power to distribute information to people,” emphasises Kim, who’s now studying politics and international relations in Seoul. “I believe in the power of culture.” If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

Spread to UST,"Walking 2,000 years in 22 days",2024-09-25,2014-06-28,Candace Rardon,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20140605-on-this-turkish-trail-kindness-is-the-compass,"Walking an ancient 330km route alone seems solitary. Except for friendships struck with farmers – and for the ghosts of Ottoman sultans and Roman soldiers who trod the trail before. When I arrived in Hersek, a Turkish village located
160km south of Istanbul across the Sea of Marmara, Refik Ertürk was standing in
the doorway of his kahve (teahouse). Men
sat at card tables outside, filling the dusk air with the clicking of backgammon
tiles and the clinking of spoons against their tulip-shaped tea glasses. Next
door, pomegranate and fig trees grew along the stone walls of a blue-domed
mosque; in the distance, I could just make out the bleating of sheep and the melodic
din of their bells – sounds that would soon become familiar in this bucolic
corner of northwest Anatolia. I was at the starting point of a walking and riding route
known as the Evliya
Çelebi Way, which runs from Hersek south to the city of Simav. The route is
330km (some 22 days) on foot, and extends to 650km (about 25 days) on horseback,
as the riding route includes the Yenişehir Plain, the 130km between Kütahya and
Uşak and the Gediz Plain. Founded
in 2011 by a team of historians and long-distance trekking guides, the history
of the path actually extends back much further.  Evliya Çelebi was a 17th-century Ottoman traveller and
writer who journeyed extensively through the empire for more than 40 years,
documenting his travels in his 10-volume Seyahatname (Book of Travels). As Ertürk’s
teenaged daughter Tuğçe told me after her father invited me to stay in their
home that evening, “he was acting like Christopher Columbus”. In 1671, Çelebi left
Istanbul for the final time to make hajj,
or pilgrimage to Mecca. The route named in his honour follows the first three
weeks of his journey. When Çelebi set out for Mecca, he did so with three companions,
eight servants and 15 purebred Arabian horses. When I set out, I was alone. I
had an 80-litre backpack full of camping gear, a 15-lira compass from a shop in
Istanbul, no knowledge of Turkish except for the glossary in my guidebook and only
my own two feet to convey me – plus a litany of concerns from Ertürk, his wife and
Tuğçe. Where would I sleep? Who would guide me? I tried to downplay my lack of
a map or GPS, but truthfully I shared in their doubts. Setting out the next morning, I surprised myself by
making slow but steady progress toward Simav. The route comprised asphalt road,
old paved roads known as kaldırum, narrow
goat paths and well-worn tractor tracks hewn from the earth over centuries of
use. I often shared the road with flocks of sheep or goats, their whistling,
wizened shepherds never far behind, and with farmers who waved as they ferried neatly-stacked
crates of grapes, tomatoes, green apples and pumpkins. The morning of my fourth day led me through endless groves
of olive trees on the way to the town of İznik, about 35 kilometres into my
walk. It was the end of October; my journey coincided with the harvest. Whole
families were out working, their car doors left open to let pop songs resonate from
the speakers. Women in headscarves and floral şalvar trousers balanced on ladders, stripping each branch of its
olives using short, handheld rakes. Husbands and children busied themselves
below on the patchwork of plastic tarps, filling brightly coloured crates and
buckets. A family beckoned and taught me how to use the rake myself. After,
they sent me on my way with bunches of grapes clipped straight from a nearby
vine.  I finished eating the gift just as I arrived in the
village of Orhaniye a couple of kilometres later. Seated in the shade of a
kahve, I ordered a tost sandwich (Turkish-style
grilled cheese, often prepared with sausage) and ayran (Turkish buttermilk), and began chatting with 22-year-old
Recep Toktaş, who had recently spent six months studying in Valencia, Spain. He
was the first person to ask why I was on the trail. I explained that I felt that
the best way to experience a new culture is to walk through it. Despite the
blisters and the burden of a backpack, it is an extraordinary sensation to feel
a place’s history unfolding beneath your feet – century by century, step by
step.  That afternoon, in the middle of an olive orchard, I
looked up to see an obelisk dating to the 1st Century. The Dikilitaş – also
known as Beştaş, meaning “five stones” in Turkish – stands 1,212m high. The
obelisk marked the spot of a way-station for the Ottoman army; even Suleiman
the Magnificent, the empire’s longest-reigning ruler, camped there in 1534 en
route to Baghdad. After all, it was not only Çelebi’s footsteps I was
following. Two millennia of soldiers and shepherds and sultans had travelled on
this path, and my journey passed by reminders of that history – sacred tombs, mosques,
hammams, bridges, ruins and caravansary, all of whose stones held as many stories as
they did dust. As the days passed, the route grew more mountainous.
So did the likelihood of my losing the trail, since the signposting was scarcer
and the forest paths proved confusing. Hardly a day went by where I didn’t get lost
in the woods at least once. But what kept me walking were the people I met when,
unsure of my way, I had to ask for directions – my burgeoning knowledge of Turkish
assisted by mimed gestures and hand-drawn maps. Their kindness became my
compass.  On the 12th day, I knocked on the door of a
farmhouse near the village of Seydikuzu after several hours of walking, lost, in
a cold rain. A couple pulled me inside, spread my jacket out to dry across a
sack of pinecones by the fire and told me about their children over rounds of
tea and potato burek, a baked, flaky
pastry invented during the Ottoman Empire. When it was time to leave, the
husband donned my 25kg backpack, leaving me – horrified and humbled – to follow
him through a field to the right road. Another evening, a kilometre outside the
village of Bağbaşı, I stumbled across a farmer with a herd of cows. When I
asked where I might pitch my tent, he invited me to stay with him and his
elderly mother. They lived above their stable; the squawking of hens and the
lowing of cattle was the soundtrack as I slept.  By the end of my 22-day journey, I had used my tent only
four times: apart from a few hotels in larger towns such as İznik, İnegöl and
Kütahya, the rest of my nights were spent in spontaneous homestays. The
families never seemed to mind making space for another around their circular
silver dining trays. And they never ceased to shake their heads that I was a
woman walking through their country alone.   I later received an email from the founders of the
Evliya Çelebi Way. They had read about my journey on my blog and told me that I
was the first person they knew to have walked the route from end to end. I felt
thrilled with the accomplishment. But what gave me an even greater thrill was
thinking back to all those I had met on the way – the olive gatherers and
tomato farmers, the shepherds and students, the ghosts of soldiers and sultans
past – and knowing I was only one more traveller who had trodden this ancient way."
Spread to UST,"US court may overturn abortion rights, leak suggests",2024-09-25,2022-05-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61302740,"Millions of women across the US could soon lose their legal right to abortion, according to a leaked Supreme Court document. The document, published by Politico, suggests the country's top court is poised to overturn the 1973 decision that legalised abortion nationwide. If the court strikes down the Roe v Wade ruling, individual states would be allowed to ban abortion if they wish. It is expected abortion could then be banned in almost half of US states. The Supreme Court's justices are expected to issue a ruling in late June or early July. Roe v Wade is in the court's sights because Mississippi is asking for it to be overturned. The justices heard that case in December. Thirteen states have already passed so-called trigger laws that will automatically ban abortion if Roe is overruled this summer. A number of others would be likely to pass laws quickly. Some 36 million women could then lose abortion access, according to research from Planned Parenthood, a healthcare organisation which provides abortions. ""If the court does overturn Roe, it will fall on our nation's elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman's right to choose,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement on Tuesday. ""We will need more pro-choice Senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe, which I will work to pass and sign into law,"" he said. Anti-abortion groups such as the Susan B. Anthony List have welcomed the news. ""If Roe is indeed overturned, our job will be to build consensus for the strongest protections possible for unborn children,"" it said. The leaked document -  labelled ""1st Draft"" - appears to reflect the majority opinion of the court, and Politico reports that it was written by Justice Samuel Alito and circulated within the court on 10 February. But it is unclear if it represents a final opinion, as justices have previously changed their views during the drafting process. The Supreme Court and the White House have not yet commented. Its publication on Monday night sparked an immediate outcry from Democrats, as well as protests by both pro-choice and anti-abortion campaigners outside the court in Washington DC. Leading Democratic politicians Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer said jointly that if the report was accurate, the Supreme Court was ""poised to inflict the greatest restriction of rights in the past 50 years"". Assume for a moment that this draft opinion becomes the law of the land. In an instant - because of statutes already on the books and ""trigger"" laws designed for such an occasion - abortion would be illegal in 22 states.  The legality of the procedure would become a vicious political battleground in the midst of an election year. This is the significance of what may be unfolding in the Supreme Court. Draft opinions, however, are just that - drafts. And there have been accounts of justices shifting their views as the opinion-drafting process unfolds within the cloistered court chambers. This unprecedented leak short-circuits all that. For most of US history, the Supreme Court has operated like Mount Olympus, handing down opinions from on high. That opacity has been shattered perhaps for good, as the leaking spreads. What it will mean for the legitimacy of the judicial process in the US remains to be seen, but within the institution itself it seems safe to assume that all trust between the judges, a collegial group once referred to as ""the brethren"", is gone. In an era when political norms have been broken like pottery in an earthquake, another big piece has fallen. Democratic governors of several states including California, New Mexico and Michigan announced plans to enshrine abortion rights within their constitutions even if the court overturned Roe v Wade. ""I promise you this: I will fight like hell to make sure abortion remains safe, legal and accessible in our state,"" Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer tweeted. News outlet Politico published the leaked document in full, quoting Justice Alito as saying: ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. ""And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, [it has] enflamed debate and deepened division."" Rival groups of protesters continued demonstrations outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday, with anti-abortion activists chanting ""Roe v Wade has got to go"" and abortion rights supporters shouting ""abortion is healthcare"". ""They are not going to get away with this,"" pro-choice campaigner Reverend Wendy Hamilton told Reuters news agency. ""There is more of us than there is of them, and we are going to fight."" ""This is just tearing apart everything that we've worked for,"" another demonstrator said.  One anti-abortion supporter, Emma Heussner, said: ""I'm very passionate about being pro-life. It's a big deal to see Roe v Wade potentially overturned."" The Supreme Court has been reshaped by three appointments under former President Donald Trump, and has been called the most conservative-leaning in modern US history. Six of the nine current justices were appointed by Republican presidents. The other three were picked by Democratic presidents. The court needs a majority to set a ruling. Politico reports that Justice Alito and four other Republican-appointed justices - Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - are in favour of the move against Roe v Wade but it is not clear how Chief Justice John Roberts will vote.  According to the BBC's US partner CBS News, the leak itself will also cause tremendous damage to one of America's most respected institutions and likely see a full-blown investigation, involving the FBI, to unmask the source. Roe v Wade in 1973 gave women in the US an absolute right to an abortion in the first three months of pregnancy, and limited rights in the second trimester. But in the decades since, anti-abortion rulings have gradually pared back access in more than a dozen states. In 2021 alone, nearly 600 abortion restrictions were introduced nationwide, with 90 enacted into law. That is more than in any year since Roe. Limiting abortion access will most intensely affect poor women, researchers say, and they are already more likely to seek an abortion in the first place. Women in their 20s account for the majority of abortions - in 2019 about 57% were in this age group. Black Americans get abortions at the highest rate - 27 per 1,000 women aged 15-44.

Spread to UST,How primates 'rafted' to success,2024-09-25,2021-05-19,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210511-how-rafts-helped-primates-rule-the-world,"Millions of years ago, the oceans presented a formidable barrier to the spread of primates – but were ultimately no match. Did rafts of vegetation help them conquer the globe? Humans evolved in Africa, along with chimpanzees, gorillas and monkeys. But primates themselves appear to have evolved elsewhere – likely in Asia – before colonising Africa. At the time, around 50 million years ago, Africa was an island isolated from the rest of the world by ocean – so how did primates get there? A land bridge is the obvious explanation, but the geological evidence currently argues against it. Instead, we're left with a far more unlikely scenario: early primates may have rafted to Africa, floating hundreds of miles across oceans on vegetation and debris. Such oceanic dispersal was once seen as far-fetched and wildly speculative by many scientists. Some still support the land bridge theory, either disputing the geological evidence, or arguing that primate ancestors crossed into Africa long before the current fossil record suggests, before the continents broke up.   But there's an emerging consensus that oceanic dispersal is far more common than once supposed. Plants, insects, reptiles, rodents and primates have all been found to colonise island continents in this way – including a remarkable Atlantic crossing that took monkeys from Africa to South America 35 million years ago. These events are incredibly rare but, given huge spans of time, such freak events inevitably influence evolution – including our own origins. Primate origins Humans appeared in southern Africa between 200,000-350,000 years ago. We know we come from Africa because our genetic diversity is highest there, and there are lots of fossils of primitive humans there. Our closest relatives, chimps and gorillas, are also native to Africa, alongside baboons and monkeys. But primates' closest living relatives – flying lemurs, tree shrews and rodents – all inhabit Asia or, in the case of rodents, evolved there. Fossils provide somewhat conflicting evidence, but they also suggest primates arose outside of Africa. The oldest primate relative, Purgatorius, lived 65 million years ago, just after the dinosaurs disappeared. It's from Montana. The oldest true primates also occur outside Africa. Teilhardina, related to monkeys and apes, lived 55 million years ago, throughout Asia, North America, and Europe. Primates arrived in Africa later. Lemur-like fossils appear there 50 million years ago, and monkey-like fossils around 40 million years ago. But Africa split from South America and became an island 100 million years ago, and only connected with Asia 20 million years ago. If primates colonised Africa during the 80 million years the continent spent isolated, then they needed to cross water. Ocean crossings The idea of oceanic dispersal is central to the theory of evolution. Studying the Galapagos Islands, Charles Darwin saw only a few tortoises, iguanas, snakes, and one small mammal, the rice rat. Further out to sea, on islands like Tahiti, were only little lizards. Darwin reasoned that these patterns were hard to explain in terms of Creationism – in which case, similar species should exist everywhere – but they made sense if species crossed water to colonise islands, with fewer species surviving to colonise more distant islands.   He was right. Studies have found tortoises can survive weeks afloat without food or water – they probably bobbed along until hitting the Galapagos. And in 1995, iguanas swept offshore by hurricanes washed up 300km (186 miles) away, very much alive, after riding on debris. Galapagos iguanas likely travelled this way. The odds are against such crossings. A lucky combination of conditions – a large raft of vegetation, the right currents and winds, a viable population, a well-timed landfall – is needed for successful colonisation. Many animals swept offshore simply die of thirst or starvation before hitting islands. Most never make landfall – they disappear at sea and become food for sharks. That's why ocean islands, especially distant ones, have few species. Rafting was once treated as an evolutionary novelty: a curious thing happening in obscure places like the Galapagos, but irrelevant to evolution on continents. But it's since emerged that rafts of vegetation or floating islands – stands of trees swept out to sea – may actually explain many animal distributions across the world. Rafting Several primate rafting events are well established. Today, Madagascar has a diverse lemur fauna. Lemurs arrived from Africa around 20 million years ago. Since Madagascar has been an island since the time of the dinosaurs, they apparently rafted the 400km-wide (248-mile) Mozambique Channel. Remarkably, fossils suggest the strange aye-aye crossed to Madagascar separately from the other lemurs. Even more extraordinary is the existence of monkeys in South America: howlers, spider monkeys and marmosets. They arrived 35 million years ago, again from Africa. They had to cross the Atlantic – narrower then, but still 1,500km (931 miles) wide. From South America, monkeys rafted again: to North America, then twice to the Caribbean. But before any of this could happen, rafting events would first need to bring primates to Africa: one brought the ancestor of lemurs, another carried the ancestor of monkeys, apes, and ourselves. It may seem implausible – and it's still not entirely clear where they came from – but no other scenario fits the evidence. You might also like: Rafting explains how rodents colonised Africa, then South America. Rafting likely explains how Afrotheria, the group containing elephants and aardvarks, got to Africa. Marsupials, evolving in North America, probably rafted to South America, then Antarctica, and finally Australia. Other oceanic crossings include mice to Australia, and tenrecs, mongooses and hippos to Madagascar. Oceanic crossings aren't an evolutionary subplot, they're central to the story. They explain the evolution of monkeys, elephants, kangaroos, rodents, lemurs – and us. And they show that evolution isn't always driven by ordinary, everyday processes but also by bizarrely improbable events. Macroevolution One of Darwin's great insights was the idea that everyday events – small mutations, predation, competition – could slowly change species, given time. But over millions or billions of years, rare, low-probability, high-impact events – ""black swan"" events – also happen. Some are immensely destructive, like asteroid impacts, volcanic eruptions, and ice ages – or viruses jumping hosts. But others are creative, like genome duplications, gene transfer between multicellular species – and rafting. The role rafting played in our history shows how much evolution comes down to chance. Had anything gone differently – the weather was bad, the seas rough, the raft washed up on a desert island, hungry predators waited on the beach, no males aboard – colonisation would have failed. No monkeys, no apes – no humans. It seems our ancestors beat odds that make Powerball lotteries seem like a safe bet. Had anything had gone differently, the evolution of life might look rather different than it does. At a minimum, we wouldn't be here to wonder about it. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

Spread to UST,The millions of undiscovered shipwrecks,2024-09-25,2023-06-12,Zaria Gorvett,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230609-how-many-shipwrecks-are-there-in-the-worlds-oceans,"This week UNESCO announced it has found three new shipwrecks, including two that are thousands of years old. But just how many more could be out there? When Elias Stadiatis descended into the indigo-blue water, he had a normal day of searching for sponges ahead of him. Weighed down in a copper diving suit, surrounded by a tangle of breathing tubes, Stadiatis eventually reached the seafloor. As he squinted into the dim, he took in a haunting scene: all around were the fuzzy outlines of human body parts. As he surfaced in a pool of bubbles, he frantically informed the captain he'd found a heap of rotting corpses.   It was the spring of 1900, and Stadiatis had accidentally discovered the Antikythera shipwreck – the remains of a Roman cargo vessel that had sunk more than two millennia earlier. It soon became clear that it was not teeming with cadavers, as it first seemed, but artworks – marble sculptures and bronze statues, seasoned by thousands of years among algae, sponges and fish.   More than 100 years on, the relics at Antikythera, found off the coast of a Greek island on the edge of the Aegean Sea, are still captivating the public. But there are plenty of submerged wonders still waiting to be discovered. Take the recent Unesco expedition to Skerki Bank, a particularly treacherous shallow reef that links the eastern and western Mediterranean. It has been heavily used for thousands of years – and in that time, it has claimed hundreds of ships. Using multibeam sonar and underwater robots, a team of scientists from eight countries mapped the seafloor in the region. This week, they announced the discovery of three new wrecks: the ghostly remains of boats dating to the 1st Century BC, 2nd Century AD, and 19th or 20th Century.  And according to Unesco's estimates there could be many, many more undiscovered wrecks still to be found beneath the waves of the world's oceans. A hidden record   The oldest known boat was found by accident while a motorway was being built in The Netherlands – a wooden canoe crafted over 10,000 years ago. But there's circumstantial evidence it all started far earlier, with humans suddenly appearing on the other side of vast bodies of water. Around 50,000 years ago, it's thought that a group of hunter-gatherers from Southeast Asia must have crossed a band of islands hundreds of miles long, because soon afterwards the first Australian Aboriginals turned up at Lake Mungo in New South Wales.   And where there are sea crossings, there are wrecks. Today the world's oceans are scattered with the debris of millennia of trade, war and exploration – pirate ships loaded with silver, cargo boats along the maritime Silk Road, luxury royal craft that disappeared along with future kings, ancient fishing vessels, modern destroyers and submarines, 19th-Century whalers, and vast passenger liners like the Titanic. Like long-forgotten time capsules, these ships have captivated archaeologists and filled museums around the globe with ancient wonders – including a mysterious astronomical clock from Antikythera, which some experts view as the earliest computer.   So, how many are there in total – and how many still remain hidden in the depths of the ocean? There are several databases of the world's shipwrecks, each of which has a slightly different estimate for the total number that has been found. The online service wreck site has a catalogue of 209,640 boats known to have sunk, 179,110 of which have a known location. The Global Maritime Wrecks Database (GMWD), on the other hand, contains the records of more than 250,000 sunken vessels, though some of these still haven't been found.   According to one estimate, around 15,000 ships sank during World War Two alone – there are forgotten battleships and tankers strewn from the Pacific to the Atlantic, gradually bleeding oil, chemicals and heavy metals into the surrounding water as they decay.       In fact, it's thought the shipwrecks that have been documented only represent a small fraction of the total. According to an analysis by Unesco, there are over three million resting undiscovered in the world's oceans.   These elusive relics are unlikely to be evenly distributed. As you would expect, there are a number of wreck hotspots – maritime graveyards along popular or perilous routes, which have proved to be fertile hunting grounds in the past.   This includes Skerki Bank, as well as the Fourni archipelago, also in the Mediterranean, where 58 ships have been discovered so far – including 23 in just 22 days in 2015. While Fourni archipelago wasn't considered particularly dangerous, it was commonly used as an anchorage point, so it's thought the sheer volume of traffic led to a high concentration of vessels coming to rest there.      A treasure trove   Not only does this hidden cache of as-yet-undiscovered wrecks contain fascinating details of how people once lived – and possible hazards for the future – it can also contain mind-boggling riches. And this can be problematic.   At around 7pm on 8 June 1708, a powerful explosion echoed across the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Colombia. It was the last battle cry of San José, a galleon that had set sail from Spain two years earlier. The boat was part of the Spanish treasure fleet – a convoy of boats, loaded with sugar, spices, precious metals, and other goods, transported between Spain and its territories in the Americas.   As the flagship, San José was carrying a mother-lode – chests of silver, emeralds, and an enormous quantity of gold doubloons. But it came to a violent end during a confrontation with a British ship. After hours of battle, its stores of gunpowder took a hit, and it sank almost immediately – vanishing into the ocean along with nearly 600 crew members.   Over 300 years later, in 2015, the Colombian navy finally identified its broken remains, along with cannons, ceramics, and coins. In all, its cargo is worth an estimated $17bn (£13.5bn). But the find immediately led to a bitter battle over who owns the wreck. Now there are concerns that the archaeological site will be plundered rather than protected. A golden age   These kinds of disputes could soon become a lot more common.   In the past, many shipwrecks were found in relatively shallow waters, sometimes by accident, as fishermen, scientists or treasure-hunters explored the seabed around the world's coastlines. But with access to sophisticated submersibles, modern camera equipment and new sonar technologies, finding deeper shipwrecks has never been so easy.   It's now possible to build up a picture of the ocean floor even in the deepest water – in 2019, researchers discovered the resting place of the destroyer USS Johnston 6km (3.7 miles) deep in the Philippine Trench. (Read more from BBC Future about how the world's deepest shipwreck was found.) Then earlier this year, scientists built a digital twin of the Titanic in three dimensions, based on surveys of the wreck on the Atlantic Ocean floor. As a result, the oceans are giving up their secrets at an unprecedented rate.Just as the use of sonar and GPS tracking has transformed fishing - allowing whole shoals of once-elusive tuna to be identified in the open ocean - anyone can now use these same technologies to find shipwrecks in locations never previously suspected.  But for now, there are still plenty of undiscovered wrecks lurking in the deep – including some of the most famous. Take the Waratah, a gigantic passenger ship often compared to the Titanic. She set sail from Durban to Cape Town on 26 July 1909 with 211 passengers on board, then vanished. To this day, no one knows what happened or where exactly the behemoth sank: despite at least nine expeditions to search for her remains, none have ever been found.   Who knows what will turn up next. Only one thing is certain: it won't be long until we find out. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

Spread to UST,A Roman way to celebrate Hanukkah,2024-09-25,2023-12-07,Joe Baur,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20231206-mele-fritte-a-roman-jewish-fritter,"Cookbook author Leah Koenig's new book, Portico: Cooking and Feasting in Rome's Jewish Kitchen, includes crispy, custardy apple fritters – just in time for Hanukkah. Throughout Hanukkah, Jews around the world will fry everything from shredded potatoes to doughnuts to commemorate the miracle of the oil. That is, when the heroic Maccabees rededicated the temple in Jerusalem, long held by the Greek empire, by lightning the menorah with enough oil to last a day. But, as the story goes, it miraculously lasted for eight nights – forever binding fried foods with the celebration of Hanukkah.  At Hanukkah, one dish stands out for Jewish cookbook author Leah Koenig, who recently published her eighth cookbook, Portico: Cooking and Feasting in Rome's Jewish Kitchen, which is a culinary time machine that spans the millennia of Roman Jewish cooking. That dish is mele fritte: crisp apple fritters served with vanilla sugar. [jump to recipe] Roman Jews are a Jewish diaspora community unto themselves and have a rich history stretching back as far as the fall of the Second Temple, when the Roman Empire reclaimed Jerusalem in 70 CE. That history includes their own culinary traditions merged with flavours from other diasporic Jewish populations that settled in Rome. For example, there are custardy matzo fritters introduced by Sephardic Jews forced out of Spain in 1492, alongside haraimi – a spicy, tomato-poached fish stew served with steamed couscous or bread that was brought to Rome by Libyan Jewish refugees throughout the late 1940s, '50s and during the Six Day War in 1967. Today, a Roman Jewish menu might include a luscious beef stew ladled over rigatoni, tomatoes roasted until they fall apart with a drizzle of oil on top, rosemary-scented lamb and potatoes, and carciofi alla Giudia – Jewish-style artichokes deep fried into crisp, lightly salted blossoms. It might also include fritters. While researching for the book, Koenig found a reference to apple fritters in a handwritten cookbook by Donatella Limentani Pavoncello called Dal 1880 ad oggi: La cucina ebraica della mia famiglia (From 1880 to today: My family's Jewish food). Pavoncello, a teacher by profession, wrote the book in the early 1980s, meant only for her family. But it has since become beloved by Rome's largest Jewish community. ""I think it spread because it is incredibly thorough and useful,"" said Koenig on the cookbook's popularity in the community. ""She groups the recipes by holidays, so anyone cooking for Shabbat or Hanukkah or Passover could turn to that chapter and have an entire menu to work from. It is also a truly beautiful cookbook. Donatella hand wrote the recipes in her gorgeous script, and each chapter opener is illustrated with an intricate paper cutting – that she also made! – depicting the holiday. It's a gem."" Koenig's apple fritters are inspired by Pavoncello, but she had to tinker with the original to develop hers for Portico. ""Like with so many hand-written family cookbooks, a lot of her recipes did not get too specific with quantities and included vague phrasing along the lines of, 'shape until it looks right', or 'cook in the typical fashion',"" Koenig explained. ""I had to do some tweaking, but I made sure to keep the original spirit of the dish."" The apples are sliced into rings, coated in a thick – but not heavy – batter and fried until the outside is crisp and the inside is custardy and sweet.  ""Donatella served the apple fritters as part of her Hanukkah menu,"" said Koenig. ""So now I do, too."" Well before she discovered Pavoncella's book, Koenig had a vision for Portico. ""In a way, I started writing this book in my head back in 2009 when my husband Yoshie and I honeymooned in Rome,"" said Koenig. ""We spent a lot of time during that trip eating our weight in carciofi alla Giudia in the Roman Jewish Ghetto and had the good fortune of being invited to a Shabbat dinner at the home of a kosher caterer.""   Koenig grew up in the Chicago suburbs eating traditional Eastern European Jewish fare for Shabbat, such as brisket, matzo ball soup and kugel. But the Roman Jewish shabbat table, Koenig explained, is a world unto itself.  ""Our host Giovanni served us stracotto di manzo, a slow-simmered beef stew made with wine and tomato passata, a dish of veal and chicken meatballs swimming in a celery and tomato sauce, and several other wildly delicious things,"" she recalled. ""I had never eaten any of those dishes before, in a Shabbat context or otherwise, and yet the context was so familiar that we immediately felt at home."" That dinner crystallised for Koenig just how vast, diverse and connected global Jewish cuisine is, setting her on a professional path to write about Jewish food. ""Researching and developing recipes for Portico feels kind of like a thank you gift to a Jewish community that has given so much to me,"" she said. The book title stems from an ancient structure, the Portico d'Ottavia (Octavia's Porch) built by Emperor Augustus in honour of his sister in the 1st Century BCE. The Portico was repurposed numerous times over the centuries. But in the 12th Century, Portico d'Ottavia became the home of La Pescheria, or the fish market. It stayed in operation for hundreds of years, right up until Italian unification in 1870. In the book, Koenig writes that ""The market was a major source of nutrition for Rome's Jews during the Ghetto period."" She notes that the main street of the Jewish Ghetto today is called Via del Portico d'Ottavia, ""in recognition of the neighbourhood's physical and emotional proximity to the market"".  Armed with this history, Koenig knew from the very beginnings of this project that she wanted this cookbook to be called Portico. ""[Portico d'Ottavia] holds symbolic importance for the community and stands as a reminder of its longevity,"" she writes in the book's introduction. ""I also love how the word portico, which translates as porch or front porch, evokes the idea of coming in – an entrance. The name Portico is my way of saying, 'Welcome. I'm glad you are here.'"" Apple fritters with vanilla sugar recipe By Leah Koenig Makes 6 to 8 Ingredients For the vanilla sugar: 2 vanilla beans 300g (1½ cups) granulated sugar For the fritters: 4 large baking apples, peeled  210g (1½ cups) all-purpose flour  3 tbsp granulated sugar  ½ tsp kosher salt ½ tsp baking soda 355ml (1½ cups) milk or non-dairy milk  vegetable oil (such as sunflower or grapeseed), for frying Method Step 1 To prepare the vanilla sugar, split the vanilla beans lengthwise and scrape out the seeds; set the pods aside. Put the sugar and vanilla seeds in a food processor and pulse until fully combined. Transfer the sugar to a glass jar, add the reserved pods, cover tightly, and set aside. (The sugar can be used right away, but the flavour will develop over time. It can be stored, tightly covered, for up to 1 year.) Step 2 To prepare the fritters, use an apple corer (or a melon baller or sturdy metal teaspoon) to carefully remove the apple cores and discard. Slice the apples into 1¼cm (½in) thick rings and set aside.  Step 3 In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt and baking soda. Add the milk and whisk until smooth.  Step 4 Heat 1¼cm (½in) of oil in a large frying pan over medium heat until shimmering. Line a large plate with kitchen paper and set nearby. When the oil is hot, working in batches of 4 or 5, dip the apple rings into the batter, let the excess drip off, then carefully slip them into the oil. Fry, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Step 5 Transfer to the kitchen paper-lined plate to drain. Sprinkle the fritters generously with vanilla sugar while still hot and serve immediately.   BBC.com's World's Table ""smashes the kitchen ceiling"" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

Spread to UST,The tiny town built from Roman ruins,2024-09-25,2017-12-19,Sunny Fitzgerald,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20171218-jordans-ancient-town-without-a-soul,"When Gadara was declared an archaeological site, residents were asked to relocate. According to former resident Ahmad Alomari, they took the soul of the town with them. “Here is my house,” Ahmad Alomari announced. Preoccupied with navigating the rubble underfoot, I almost missed his declaration entirely. I glanced up at the roofless black basalt and white limestone structure in front of us. “Wait, here?” I asked in disbelief. A golden glow from the early morning sun shone through the door and window frames, illuminating the weed-covered interior. I assumed from Alomari’s jovial nature that he was joking. After all, we were standing inside the ancient ruins of Gadara in the north-western corner of Jordan. And, unless Alomari is a spectre, he certainly wasn’t around in 63BC when the city became an important part of the infamous Greco-Roman Decapolis, a powerful network of 10 cities formed after the Roman conquest of Ancient Palestine. “Yes, here,” he repeated, his smile stretching wide across his face. “This is my home.” You may also be interested in: • A silent city hidden in the desert • The ancient path through the Palestinian territories • The man saved by a tin of fish Lonely columns that once supported three open-air theatres, a basilica and a temple dotted the hilltop. From Alomari’s home, I took in the dramatic view of the Sea of Galilee and Israel. A little further east, Syria’s south-western corner spread out before me. Forty-five years ago, Alomari was born in this very place – a humble house built from ancient stones left behind by Roman-era inhabitants. But the site of Alomari’s childhood home has a history dating back to the 7th Century BC; the Ptolemies and then the Seleucids occupied the city before the Romans arrived in the 1st Century BC. Strategically positioned along trade routes, Gadara enjoyed a golden age of economic and cultural growth, with artists and scholars flocking to the city. But after several centuries, Gadara’s popularity and influence began to decline. Changes in trade routes and a series of earthquakes that destroyed the city’s infrastructure in the 8th Century likely contributed to Gadara’s ultimate abandonment. What was left of the Roman-era structures lay empty for a millennium. In the late 19th Century, new life came to the ancient acropolis. “At that time, the people here were nomadic, pastoral and farmers,” Alomari explained. When one group – including some of Alomari’s ancestors – discovered the skeleton of the former hilltop city, complete with water wells and building materials, and in close proximity to farmable land and the Yarmouk River, they decided to put down roots. Alomari’s great-grandfather was likely one of the first people to take up residence in the ruins and help build a new village on the foundation of the ancient city. “These are 2,000 years old,” Alomari said, running his hand along the rocks that form the walls of his former home. “But my father built this house less than 100 years ago.” In the 1960s, Jordan’s Department of Antiquities declared Gadara an archaeological site; it’s now awaiting consideration for Unesco World Heritage status. Stoves and other elements not considered to be of cultural and historic value were removed, and the homes built by Alomari’s community fell into disrepair. “The Department of Antiquities forbade us from doing maintenance on our homes,” he said. “The first excavation I saw was in the late 1970s,” Alomari recalled. Shortly thereafter, Gadara’s 1,500 residents were told to relocate.  Some families moved out almost immediately, purchasing modern homes in nearby Jordanian cities like Um Qais. “Life wasn’t easy in the village,” Alomari explained. “We had to bring water from the well, wash clothes by hand. It was dusty. There were snakes and scorpions. And we only had electricity for a few hours each evening, provided by a generator.” But even as a child, Alomari recognised that the heart of a place is its people. “Without the families, the village became a body without a soul.” Growing up in the archaeological site, Alomari loved sharing village life with visitors; Gadara has long been a site of Christian pilgrimage, with many believing it to be the place where Jesus Christ cast the demons from two men into a drove of pigs. Alomari’s interactions with foreigners remain some of his first and favourite memories. “When we lived here, travellers visiting Gadara would come to our house,” he said. “They’d sit here on our terrace, drink tea and eat with us.” He stood up from the stone window sill and I followed, stepping down over the derelict rectangular stones piled in front of his former home. “The first time I spoke to a tourist, I was about eight years old,” he recalled. “It was in here,” he said as we approached the entrance to the restored Roman theatre on the western side of the site. “My friends and I also played hide-and-seek here,” he added, his voice bouncing off the curved basalt seats surrounding us. We continued our walk through the ancient city, making our way past the abandoned trader stalls along the paved Roman road, and up the hill towards the cluster of free-standing columns that mark where the basilica once stood. “We used to play football here,” Alomari said. “These were our goal posts.” On this day, there were no children running or playing; in fact, there wasn’t another person in sight. “And that,” he added, glancing at an upper terrace dotted with modern tables and chairs, “is a restaurant now. But it used to be my school.” Alomari’s voice dropped and I detected a distinct sadness. “When my family moved to the new house in Um Qais in 1987, I refused to leave my village,” Alomari said. He was just 14 years old at that time. “I stayed three days by myself. I slept in a tent on our roof in the old village, with just my donkey and bicycle below.” A few years after his family relocated, Alomari heard the archaeologists were seeking English-speaking assistants to help with excavations. Although his language skills were extremely limited, his determination was boundless. “They called me in and asked if I could speak English. I knew if I said no, they wouldn’t give me the job.” So he stretched the truth and they hired him. Although he struggled to communicate, Alomari devoted his time to assisting with the excavations and improving his English over the course of the six-week assignment. His hard work paid off: he was offered a job as a live-in guard in the small antiquities museum located inside the archaeological site. “I didn’t even ask about a contract or payment,” Alomari said. “The only thing I cared about was that I could finally live in my village again.” He made the most of the opportunity – working with archaeologists and interacting with tourists by day, and studying everything from English to archaeology by night. “I was in the museum alone at night, so I read everything I could,” he said. “My first salary was about 100 dinars. And I used a quarter of it to buy my first Arabic-English dictionary.” That dictionary came in handy in his conversations with colleagues, tourists and even a special someone. “I fell in love with a German girl who visited Um Qais,” Alomari confessed. The two spent much of her holiday together, communicating in English as neither could speak the other’s native tongue. “When she returned home, I wrote her a letter in English – only about 10 lines that took me three or four hours to write!” When she replied with her own 14-page letter, he had to pull out his dictionary and his romantic side. “I started to read and write poetry,” Alomari said, smiling. Although the young lovers never met again, Alomari found happiness living and working at Gadara. While he no longer lives within the archaeological site, he continues to assist the Department of Antiquities in its preservation efforts and guide visitors around the ruins. But the absence of life at his old village still haunts him. Alomari’s dream is for the former villagers to once again inhabit their homes inside the site, but he knows this is not possible. So he’s found the next best option: partnering with community-based tourism initiatives like Baraka Destinations and The Jordan Trail to facilitate engaging experiences such as homestays and cooking workshops. Alomari also hopes to one day host his own guests at a countryside homestay he is developing. “I already have the name,” he said, his smile wide once again. “It will be called, ‘Philodemos’.” Philodemus was a 1st Century BC philosopher and poet of Gadara – not entirely unlike Alomari himself. “And do you know what his name means?” Alomari asked. “Philos is ‘friend’ or ‘lover’, and demos is ‘the people’.” “Friend... of the people,” I said aloud. As Alomari described his vision of welcoming visitors into his countryside home to share stories and break bread, I couldn’t help but nod enthusiastically. Without the people and the stories, the archaeological site – stunning as it may be – is simply stones.

Spread to UST,The town that throws wine in the sea,2024-09-25,2018-10-05,Elizabeth Wellington,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20181004-the-french-town-that-throws-wine-in-the-sea,"The sea imbues the town of St-Malo with what locals describe as ‘a salty side’ that’s not only present in its culture and regional dishes, but also its wine. Europe’s highest tides sneak up on tourists in St-Malo, France, lapping against medieval granite ramparts and onto salty pavements. But Malouins, as locals are called, embrace the raging tide with a graceful kinship. The Malouin community has always been tied to the ebb and flow of the sea. Founded on Brittany’s northern coast by Gauls in the 1st Century BC, the port city stands where the mouth of the Rance river meets the English Channel. Because water flows in and out of the bay in both directions, its rising tides are legendary. In summer, sunscreen-doused English tourists wander off ferries from Portsmouth, while the French flock here for summer breezes and Breton savoir-faire. But St-Malo and her tides belong to locals, who welcome the constant salt spray with a chuckle of gratitude. “When I’m in St-Malo, even if I can’t see the sea, I can feel her,” said Yannick Heude, a local sommelier and wine merchant. “I know she’s right here, that she’s always nearby. And if I’m too far away, then she is, too.” You may also be interested in: • The man who makes wine below Paris • The world’s first blue wine • A rare cake that’s cooked on a spit As proprietor of the local wine shop Cave de l’Abbaye St-Jean and a partner at local cooking school L’École du Goût, Heude keeps one foot in local gastronomy and the other in the bay. The sea imbues the local culture with what Heude describes as ‘a salty side’ that’s equally present in local dishes as it is in Malouin identity. “We’ve got la terre et la mer [the land and the sea] that blend to help our chefs create extraordinary cuisine. It’s simple, precise and invigorating,” he said. During a boating trip 15 years ago with friends, Heude found himself pondering a seaborne idea. “There was a fisherman, a sailor, a restaurateur and myself – a sommelier,” he explained. “One of us was expecting a child, and said ‘Listen, I should put some wine underwater to celebrate my son’s birth.’ And I said, ‘Well, I can organise that if you like’.” While setting aside a bottle of wine to age in celebration of a child’s birth is a common practice among oenophiles, Heude explained that this suggestion to age the wine in the sea was unprecedented. But what started as a small feat – bringing 12 bottles of Fiefs Vendéens wine from the Loire Valley to the bottom of St-Malo’s harbour – became l’Immersion, an annual tradition that has evolved into a national phenomenon. There’s an undeniable poetry to the emergence of sea-aged wine in a town that’s so proud of its maritime heritage. St-Malo and its harbour first rose to prominence as one of the primary ports of call for the French spice trade. Malouins voyaged as far as Québec (the voyages of Jacques Cartier – a Malouin – led to France laying claim to Canada) and the Falkland Islands (originally named Îles Malouines in honour of early Malouin settlers). In 1590, St-Malo declared independence from France in an effort to protect its maritime economy from the Wars of Religion, adopting the motto, ‘Not French, not Breton, but Malouin’. Although the autonomous Republic of St-Malo only lasted for three years, the Malouin identity continued in a spirit of unbridled self-determination, inextricably anchored to the sea. Heude continued to place wine on the sea floor every year, gathering his friends to taste the previous year’s bounty. Beyond the initial resonance of the idea of sea-aging wine, there’s also a science to the process that Heude and his friends pegged with sheer intuition. Off the coast of Brittany, the temperature of the ocean floor hovers at 9-10C – the equivalent temperature of a deep wine cellar – while the water shields the wine from damaging UV rays. Plus, the twice-daily ebb and flow of some of the biggest tides in Europe mirror a technique used to age wine, particularly Champagne, known as remuage. The process of slowly tilting wine as it ages keeps the sediment from settling on the sides and bottom of the bottle and maintains the visual clarity of the wine. The wines Heude selects change every year, though he is sure to include bottles of both regular and sparkling, and the differences in flavour of sea-aged wines varies by cuvée (the type, blend and batch of wine), which is the fun of it all. As a rule of thumb, Heude says, wines that have only been lightly filtered are poised for the most remarkable transformations underwater. As the tides move the natural sediment in the bottle, the flavour notes of the wine deepen. The effect is particularly enthralling with sparkling wine, as the changing tides refine the carbon dioxide bubbles to a crisp finish. After discovering the effects of sea-aging, Heude decided to make annual wine deposits to the harbour floor. Every year, on the first weekend of June, 100 gourmands and sommeliers from across France purchase tickets to experience the phenomenon in person. The day-long affair begins with l’Immersion itself. Curious tourists watch as Heude and his team load up a fishing boat with nearly 700 wine bottles in the shadow of Tour Solidor, a 14th-Century tower originally built to control the entrance to the Rance river. Wine bottles are stacked in pallet boxes built for shellfish producers – fitting for a ritual so intimately tied to the local food culture. Extra holes in each box ensure water and seaweed can flow around the bottles during their year-long sojourn at the bottom of the bay. “We saddle them up, and then they’re ready to go,” Heude said. Once they’ve been brought out into the harbour, the boxes are lowered 15m to the sea floor with a trawler. A diver loosely anchors the boxes with enough leeway for each one to move in harmony with the tides. Then they pick up last year’s drop off (this year’s haul) in preparation for a boisterous unveiling. After 12 months of anticipation, Heude and his team push each box to the centre of the crowd. Extra treasures – shellfish, handfuls of seaweed – swirl around the barnacle-laden bottles, giving everyone a glimpse of what the bottles witness during a year on the sea floor. A frenzy ensues as Heude invites onlookers to dive into a free degustation of the region’s gastronomic riches. Sourdough bread from Philippe Renault’s bakery in Dinard, Jean-Yves Bordier’s award-winning butter, oysters from Cancale and tripe from nearby Normandy round out the abundant spread. Amid the joyful flurry, expert sommeliers crack open the bottles to compare sea-aged wines with their cellar-aged counterparts. These tastings unfurl meticulous analyses by expert palates – but this is just the beginning. After the wine tasting, participants who purchased tickets for l’Immersion in advance of the festival accompany the coastguard organisation Société Nationale de Sauvetage en Mer (SNSM) on a short journey to Cézembre, a small, uninhabited blip of sand off the coast of St-Malo that served as a German naval battery in World War Two. Most of its sweeping landscape remains enclosed by barbed wire because the island’s innermost areas haven’t been cleared of land mines, but the shore provides a safe and scenic venue for a riotous Malouin feast. Plates of fried seafood and salt-marsh lamb pile up next to more butter, freshly baked bread and bottles of sea-aged wine, still dripping with salty water. “That’s a little more rock’n’roll. It’s a big party and everyone loves that, too,” Heude said. At its heart, l’Immersion is much more than a wine tasting. It’s a celebration of Malouins’ unceasing connection to the sea. “That’s what has cradled us since our infancy, and at the end of the day, we can’t do without it,” Heude said. “Whether it’s in the arts or in food, it’s in everything: it’s there in wine tastings, in the shrimp, in the scallops, in the fish we catch, in the spring vegetables, in new potatoes. We’ve got it all here. We’ve truly got it all.” Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

Spread to UST,Asbestos: The strange past of the 'magic mineral',2024-09-25,2024-02-07,Zaria Gorvett,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240207-asbestos-the-strange-past-of-the-magic-mineral,"From supernatural capes to sleeping caps, asbestos fibres once had a wide range of bizarre uses. In the minerals gallery at the Natural History Museum in London, amid rows of ornately carved columns and cathedral-like windows, is an oak display cabinet. Within it is a small clear plastic box, labelled with the warning ""DO NOT OPEN"". The case contains what looks like a ball of the grey, fibrous fluff that you might find choking up a clothes dryer – or the kind of thing an owl might regurgitate. It looks like something that has been put on display by accident. But though this artefact is safely sealed within its box, and poses no risk to the public, inside is something deadly. It's an asbestos purse. Oddly, this pale, mangled relic once belonged to none other than American founding father Benjamin Franklin. For millennia, asbestos was not seen as a deadly hazard – a word now uttered in hushed tones, associated with tragedy and scandal. Instead, it was an exciting, even miraculous, material with highly appealing properties. This is asbestos' past as the ""magic mineral"", a strange time when it was woven into textiles fit for kings, and used for party tricks. One 18th-Century philosopher even slept in a night-cap made from it. A valuable acquisition In 1725, Franklin was not yet the polymath and politician that he is remembered as today. At the time, he was a cash-strapped 19-year-old who had recently been left stranded in London by an unscrupulous employer. Luckily, the plucky teenager had managed to secure a new job at a printing shop, but he needed a quick way to raise some extra funds. One day, Franklin had the idea of sending the collector and naturalist Hans Sloane a letter, alerting him to the fact that he had brought several curiosities across the Atlantic that might be of interest. Among them was the famous asbestos purse – an item which was seemingly impervious to fire. When it got dirty, it could be thrust into a flame to ""purify"" it. Sloane duly summoned Franklin to his house, and the lad was paid ""very handsomely"" for this noxious item, which eventually ended up at the Natural History Museum. A material marvel  In fact, the extraordinary fire-resistance of asbestos had been discovered several thousand years before – and has a long history of use in rituals and entertainment. In the 1st Century AD, the Roman author Pliny the Elder introduced his readers to a new kind of linen, known as ""live linen"", which could be used to make a variety of quirky products. He had even witnessed its properties himself – napkins which when added to a blazing fire come out cleaner and fresher than before. This same substance, he explained, was also used to make the funerary shrouds for monarchs; because live linen didn't burn, it helped to keep their ashes separated from the rest of the pyre.  The material was, in fact, asbestos, and by this time, the stories of its properties had already spread across the ancient world. Other sources suggest that it was used for towels, shoes, and nets. One account from Ancient Greece describes a golden lamp made for the goddess Athena, which could reportedly burn for a whole year without going out and had a wick made from ""Carpathian flax"" – thought to be another name for asbestos. Pliny believed that his special ""linen"" was resistant to fire because of its origins in the deserts of India. In this sun-scorched environment, where ""no rain is ever known to fall"", it became hardened against heat. Later theories included that it was made from the skin of salamanders, which were widely believed to be resistant to fire even in medieval times. Both of these ideas were wide of the mark. Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral, and can be found in rock deposits scattered across the globe, from the Italian Alps to the Australian Outback. It can take on many different appearances, depending on its origins and what is being used for, but under a microscope there is one tell-tale sign: stiff, needle-like fibres. Though they may look fragile, these tiny threads are not easily destroyed – they are impervious to heat, chemically inert, and cannot be broken down by biological agents such as bacteria. In addition to its fire-proofing properties, the resilience of asbestos made it a useful addition to household products, even as early as 2500BC. Back in 1930, archaeologists uncovered ancient pottery buried on the shores of Lake Juojärvi, best known as the cleanest lake in Finland. A later analysis revealed that they had been strengthened with asbestos. The popularity of asbestos did not diminish, and by the medieval era there was a flourishing trade in this deadly mineral. Charlemagne, who became the first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in 800AD, was a professional banqueter – feasting his way to diplomatic success. According to legend, he had a snow-white tablecloth spun from asbestos for these occasions, which he routinely thrust into the fire as a party trick. Asbestos even found its way into warfare. The trebuchet was a war machine used during the Christian crusades, and involved a wooden structure that could catapult flaming bags of pitch or tar at enemy targets. By wrapping the bags of pitch in asbestos, knights could stop them from burning up before they reached their destination. Woven asbestos fibres were also added to suits of armour, where their properties as thermal insulators helped to keep inhabitants warm. However, it was around the 12th Century that asbestos acquired a more familiar application. In 2014, scientists revealed that they had discovered asbestos fibres in wall plaster behind Byzantine wall paintings in Cyprus. For most of its history, asbestos was viewed as a highly valuable, even precious material – Pliny attests that, at least in his day, it was more expensive than pearls. But towards the end of the 19th Century, large deposits were discovered in Canada and the United States, and its use exploded. At first, it was used at power plants and on steam engines, but soon the mineral began to creep into people's homes. The very same properties that had attracted people to asbestos for millennia now encouraged its liberal application wherever fire-proofing, strengthening or thermal insulation was required. By the late 20th Century, the mineral was so widespread that many water pipes were made of it. (Read more about the asbestos found in some drinking water.) Even in ancient times, there were hints that asbestos was toxic, and with each passing century the risk became clearer. In 1899, an English doctor recorded the first confirmed case of a death linked directly to the material – a 33-year-old textile worker who had developed fibrosis of the lungs. In the UK, all asbestos was banned in 1999, but much of the asbestos added before this date remains in place – as buildings degrade, it is posing a significant health risk. And it is still in use across much of the rest of the world. The US continues to import asbestos from abroad, though the country's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is looking into measures to curb its use.  Franklin's asbestos purse reminds us that there is still deadly asbestos lurking in even the most unexpected places. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

Spread to UST,How primates 'rafted' to success,2024-09-25,2021-05-19,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210511-how-rafts-helped-primates-rule-the-world,"Millions of years ago, the oceans presented a formidable barrier to the spread of primates – but were ultimately no match. Did rafts of vegetation help them conquer the globe? Humans evolved in Africa, along with chimpanzees, gorillas and monkeys. But primates themselves appear to have evolved elsewhere – likely in Asia – before colonising Africa. At the time, around 50 million years ago, Africa was an island isolated from the rest of the world by ocean – so how did primates get there? A land bridge is the obvious explanation, but the geological evidence currently argues against it. Instead, we're left with a far more unlikely scenario: early primates may have rafted to Africa, floating hundreds of miles across oceans on vegetation and debris. Such oceanic dispersal was once seen as far-fetched and wildly speculative by many scientists. Some still support the land bridge theory, either disputing the geological evidence, or arguing that primate ancestors crossed into Africa long before the current fossil record suggests, before the continents broke up.   But there's an emerging consensus that oceanic dispersal is far more common than once supposed. Plants, insects, reptiles, rodents and primates have all been found to colonise island continents in this way – including a remarkable Atlantic crossing that took monkeys from Africa to South America 35 million years ago. These events are incredibly rare but, given huge spans of time, such freak events inevitably influence evolution – including our own origins. Primate origins Humans appeared in southern Africa between 200,000-350,000 years ago. We know we come from Africa because our genetic diversity is highest there, and there are lots of fossils of primitive humans there. Our closest relatives, chimps and gorillas, are also native to Africa, alongside baboons and monkeys. But primates' closest living relatives – flying lemurs, tree shrews and rodents – all inhabit Asia or, in the case of rodents, evolved there. Fossils provide somewhat conflicting evidence, but they also suggest primates arose outside of Africa. The oldest primate relative, Purgatorius, lived 65 million years ago, just after the dinosaurs disappeared. It's from Montana. The oldest true primates also occur outside Africa. Teilhardina, related to monkeys and apes, lived 55 million years ago, throughout Asia, North America, and Europe. Primates arrived in Africa later. Lemur-like fossils appear there 50 million years ago, and monkey-like fossils around 40 million years ago. But Africa split from South America and became an island 100 million years ago, and only connected with Asia 20 million years ago. If primates colonised Africa during the 80 million years the continent spent isolated, then they needed to cross water. Ocean crossings The idea of oceanic dispersal is central to the theory of evolution. Studying the Galapagos Islands, Charles Darwin saw only a few tortoises, iguanas, snakes, and one small mammal, the rice rat. Further out to sea, on islands like Tahiti, were only little lizards. Darwin reasoned that these patterns were hard to explain in terms of Creationism – in which case, similar species should exist everywhere – but they made sense if species crossed water to colonise islands, with fewer species surviving to colonise more distant islands.   He was right. Studies have found tortoises can survive weeks afloat without food or water – they probably bobbed along until hitting the Galapagos. And in 1995, iguanas swept offshore by hurricanes washed up 300km (186 miles) away, very much alive, after riding on debris. Galapagos iguanas likely travelled this way. The odds are against such crossings. A lucky combination of conditions – a large raft of vegetation, the right currents and winds, a viable population, a well-timed landfall – is needed for successful colonisation. Many animals swept offshore simply die of thirst or starvation before hitting islands. Most never make landfall – they disappear at sea and become food for sharks. That's why ocean islands, especially distant ones, have few species. Rafting was once treated as an evolutionary novelty: a curious thing happening in obscure places like the Galapagos, but irrelevant to evolution on continents. But it's since emerged that rafts of vegetation or floating islands – stands of trees swept out to sea – may actually explain many animal distributions across the world. Rafting Several primate rafting events are well established. Today, Madagascar has a diverse lemur fauna. Lemurs arrived from Africa around 20 million years ago. Since Madagascar has been an island since the time of the dinosaurs, they apparently rafted the 400km-wide (248-mile) Mozambique Channel. Remarkably, fossils suggest the strange aye-aye crossed to Madagascar separately from the other lemurs. Even more extraordinary is the existence of monkeys in South America: howlers, spider monkeys and marmosets. They arrived 35 million years ago, again from Africa. They had to cross the Atlantic – narrower then, but still 1,500km (931 miles) wide. From South America, monkeys rafted again: to North America, then twice to the Caribbean. But before any of this could happen, rafting events would first need to bring primates to Africa: one brought the ancestor of lemurs, another carried the ancestor of monkeys, apes, and ourselves. It may seem implausible – and it's still not entirely clear where they came from – but no other scenario fits the evidence. You might also like: Rafting explains how rodents colonised Africa, then South America. Rafting likely explains how Afrotheria, the group containing elephants and aardvarks, got to Africa. Marsupials, evolving in North America, probably rafted to South America, then Antarctica, and finally Australia. Other oceanic crossings include mice to Australia, and tenrecs, mongooses and hippos to Madagascar. Oceanic crossings aren't an evolutionary subplot, they're central to the story. They explain the evolution of monkeys, elephants, kangaroos, rodents, lemurs – and us. And they show that evolution isn't always driven by ordinary, everyday processes but also by bizarrely improbable events. Macroevolution One of Darwin's great insights was the idea that everyday events – small mutations, predation, competition – could slowly change species, given time. But over millions or billions of years, rare, low-probability, high-impact events – ""black swan"" events – also happen. Some are immensely destructive, like asteroid impacts, volcanic eruptions, and ice ages – or viruses jumping hosts. But others are creative, like genome duplications, gene transfer between multicellular species – and rafting. The role rafting played in our history shows how much evolution comes down to chance. Had anything gone differently – the weather was bad, the seas rough, the raft washed up on a desert island, hungry predators waited on the beach, no males aboard – colonisation would have failed. No monkeys, no apes – no humans. It seems our ancestors beat odds that make Powerball lotteries seem like a safe bet. Had anything had gone differently, the evolution of life might look rather different than it does. At a minimum, we wouldn't be here to wonder about it. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

Spread to UST,Project aims to count Arctic walruses from space,2024-09-25,2021-10-13,By Jonathan Amos,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58901410,"A new project aims to get a better idea of the number of walruses on Earth by counting them from space. Volunteers are being sought to search through thousands of satellite images to see how many of the tusked animals they can spot. Scientists need improved population data as they try to asses how this polar keystone species will be affected by climate change.  Walruses are heavily dependent on sea-ice, which has been in sharp retreat. The marine mammals will haul out on to the floes, to use them as a platform on which to rest and raise their young, and as a base from which to launch foraging trips. A walrus will drop to the seabed to hunt in the muds for clams and other invertebrates, such as snails, soft shell crabs and shrimp. All this is being made more difficult as the extent of the seasonal sea-ice declines. ""We're seeing about a 13% loss in summer sea-ice per decade,"" said Rod Downie, chief polar adviser at environmental campaign group WWF.  ""One of the implications of not having the sea-ice to haul out on is that we're increasingly seeing walruses spend longer on land. And that comes with a number of impacts, which include overcrowding with the potential for calves to be crushed in stampedes. This happens. But also for local food sources to be depleted,"" he told BBC News. WWF is running the ""Walrus From Space"" project jointly with the British Antarctic Survey, which has expertise in satellite surveys of polar wildlife. BAS has long counted penguins from orbit, and is also now tracking seals, albatross, and even whales under the water.  ""It's only recently that satellites have had high enough resolution to allow us to count walruses accurately,"" said BAS remote-sensing specialist Peter Fretwell. ""We'll be using Maxar's WorldView satellite which has a resolution where each pixel is only about 30cm on the ground. That's about the size of an A4 sheet of paper and we can easily count individual animals at that resolution."" Volunteers are being directed to an online portal where they'll be shown images and asked, in the first instance, merely to state whether or not the view contains one or more of the tusked pinnipeds. A second phase, once all ""empty"" pictures have been excluded, will then ask the volunteers to put a dot on every walrus they see. The survey, which will run for at least five years, is concentrating on the Atlantic sub-species, and a somewhat isolated group of animals in the Laptev Sea area.  Today's estimate is that these mammals in total probably number around 30,000. The project hopefully will narrow the uncertainties. Surveys of this kind naturally come with some caveats. For example, the type of satellite being used can't see the Earth's surface when it's cloudy; and walruses aren't static, they move around. But such confounding factors are all taken into account by the methodologies and models used to build population data-sets. And, of course, they're underpinned by the knowledge of indigenous communities who live side-by-side with the walruses. The Walrus From Space project is receiving funding support from the People's Postcode Lottery, the Royal Bank of Canada and directly from WWF supporters. The goal is to recruit more than 500,000 citizen scientists over the next five years. Early volunteers have included cub scouts, who've been testing the counting portal ahead of its live launch. Phoebe Overton, from the 1st Molesey scout group in Surrey, acknowledged it was tricky to identify the walruses even with the super-sharp pictures.   ""It's quite hard because there are rusty barrels and rocks that look really similar,"" she said. But Charlotte Guise, from the nearby 9th Walton-on-Thames group, added, ""it's fun to see the way they live and how many there are, and they are kind of really cool creatures"". There is no plan at the moment for the project to try to count the Pacific sub-species of walrus, which may number some 200,000 individuals. Again, this estimate is uncertain.  ""Whilst the Pacific walruses are a lot more numerous, Atlantic walruses are probably spread out over a larger area,"" Dr Downie said.  ""And if you include both Atlantic and Laptev, then you're talking about a vast area with many more haul-out sites. So, we're focussing on them, but there'll be other research groups in the Arctic working on the Pacific sub-species."""
Spread to UST,Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?,2024-09-25,2020-04-23,Steve Duffy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-52380643,"What can statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales? Here we assess some of the figures showing the pandemic over its peak years and also give some of the remaining indicators as they stood in May 2024. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared in May 2023 that Covid-19 was no longer a global health emergency, but said it did not mean the danger was over. In Wales, while some hospital and mortality data was still being published in autumn 2024, other surveillance measures had been scaled back or discontinued. There was a peak in people testing positive for Covid in hospitals in late January 2024 and numbers then settled into a pattern of rising and falling. Other indicators around waste water monitoring and people contacting their GPs last winter showed lower levels than the same period the year before. Mortality figures involving Covid in the eight months to the end of August 2024 were about 60% of the total we saw in the same period of 2023 - about 13 deaths a week compared with 22 deaths a week.  Digital Health and Care Wales stopped its weekly Covid snapshot figures in the summer of 2023, although Public Health Wales (PHW) was still publishing some hospital and testing data in autumn 2024. Positive tests for Covid appear to follow a more cyclical pattern than flu or other winter viruses, which show a seasonal peak. Numbers of inpatients with Covid started to drop again by early February 2024 but followed a rising and falling pattern in the next few months. There were 192 in-patients testing positive for Covid, including 15 patients in critical care in the week ending 8 September. We might expect to see more elderly people in hospital and around half of those testing positive for Covid were over 80 and 89% were over 60. We no longer know how many of these patients are being treated primarily for Covid or happen to be incidentally testing positive while in hospital for other things. PHW was still publishing weekly data on patients who test positive for Covid in hospitals - and where they were likely to have acquired it. There were 91 positive tests for Covid in hospitals in the week ending 8 September. Figures showed ""probably"" or ""definitely"" hospital-acquired infections in patients made up 59% of those with Covid in beds, compared with those patients who came with Covid or the origin cannot be determined.  Hospital-acquired infections stood at 54. There have been nearly 25,000 hospital-acquired infections recorded since the start of the pandemic.  The issue of patients catching Covid while in hospital was a particularly acute feature during the early days of the pandemic, when there was no vaccine. The pattern of acute respiratory infections over the past two winters suggest seasonal peaks for flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). But Covid infections among those in hospital show more of an undulating pattern over the course of the year. The peaks were not as high in the winter of 2023-24 as they were in the previous winter. RSV had started to rise amongst mostly young children to very high intensity levels but dropped back.  Flu cases in the community rose in early February but only to low intensity before falling back. Patients testing positive for flu in hospital fell from mid-February. Health officials kept a close eye on Covid over the winter period in 2023-24, in case it added to pressures on the NHS with more seasonal viruses. This winter, there was a realistic worst scenario of just under 1,200 Covid patients in late December and a ""most likely"" of 620 patients in the early modelling from Welsh government scientists. The actual figures in late December were close to the optimistic scenario - 380 patients - but moved closer to the worst-case scenario at the end of the first week of 2024. For about half the winter period, the actual number of patients testing positive for Covid was greater than the most likely scenario. By the end of March, it was below the most likely and optimistic scenarios. In winter 2022-23, the peak when it came in late December reached about 650 patients, three weeks after the modelled peak for a reasonable worst scenario of 1,800 patients. The actual curve for patients with Covid positive tests by the end of the modelling period in March 2023 was tracking with the ""most likely"" scenario after following a more undulating pattern, which had taken it closer to the ""optimistic"" scenario at one point. Another snapshot of how Covid and other viruses are present is sample tests from up to 1,500 patients attending hospital each week. These tests are for a range of respiratory viruses and showed around 13% testing positive for Covid at the winter peak in mid-January and 16% for flu when it peaked in early February. By the end of June, fewer than 2% were testing for flu but 18% were for Covid on these random tests - the highest proportion since the previous October. This is separate from testing for Covid or flu only or those showing symptoms. The rate at which GPs are consulted about Covid-19 is also another indicator, which peaked in the first week of January 2022 at 98 consultations per 100,000 and had fallen back to extremely low levels, around one or two per 100,000 in the first quarter of 2024.  Another measure had been analysing samples of waste water, which was re-started for the winter of 2023/24. Early results showed samples indicating presence of Covid were not close to to the levels seen in the autumn and winter of 2022-23, reflecting indicators elsewhere. Surveillance involving testing for infection of blood donors was also stopped at the same time. Wales did not join a scaled-down relaunch of the long-running ONS swab survey, which had been discontinued in early 2023. The number of people who have died with Covid as a contributory factor had reached 12,902 in Wales by the end of August 2024. Deaths in 2023 ran at around half the number we saw in 2022. In the most recent week, up 30 August, 10 people in Wales had a death registered which involved Covid-19 and saw it mentioned on their death certificate, according to the ONS. Six of these deaths had Covid as the underlying cause of death.   Up to 30 August 2024, there had been around 10,476 deaths due to Covid, with the virus the underlying cause of death. ONS also now records so-called ""expected deaths"". This is a change from a previous ""excess deaths "" approach, which looked at an average for deaths from all causes across five non-pandemic years. This now adjusts for population changes and age trends and so it has revised down estimates we saw under the previous method. So between January 2020 and August 2024, there had been around 7,000 more deaths than we might have expected to see. During 2020, there were around 3,216 more deaths than expected - compared to around 3,500 when measured as ""excess deaths"". Over the eight months to late August 2024, deaths have been running below expected levels in all but 12 weeks. There were 508 deaths from all causes - 108 fewer than we might expect to see in week ending 30 August2024. Covid accounted for 1.3% of all deaths in Wales in the first eight months of 2024. Nearly a fifth (17%) of all Covid deaths registered have occurred in care homes. The first occurred in Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly in the last week of March 2020 and eventually totalled around 1,650 Covid deaths in the first two waves of the pandemic. There were 16 deaths involving Covid among care home residents registered between January and late August 2024.  Care Inspectorate Wales reported that deaths peaked in May 2020 and before it stopped publishing data it was notified of 2,339 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid up to the end of June 2023. There were 726 deaths above the five-year average in care homes in Wales in April 2020, at the height of the first wave of the pandemic. There were also high numbers of excess deaths in the winter of 2020-21, when the vaccination programme was only just starting. Altogether, in the three-year period from January 2020 there were nearly 1,500 excess deaths in care homes in Wales. ONS analysis of deaths in care homes in 2021 found mortality rates lower in Wales in male residents than in England or any English region. The same occurred in 2022. The two peaks for Covid deaths in care homes came in weeks in April 2020 (125 deaths) and January 2021 (129 deaths). Covid was the second leading cause of death in care home residents after dementia in 2021, accounting for 12.9% of male resident deaths and 11.1% of female resident deaths. In 2022, Covid dropped to being the fifth leading cause of death in care home residents in 2022, accounting for 4.5% of deaths. Meanwhile, up to the end of February 2022, 120 people working in health and social care in Wales had died, with Covid a factor. Of these, 62 were care workers and 58 worked for the health service. There were nearly twice as many deaths due to flu and pneumonia in Wales than due to Covid in 2023. There have been more Covid than flu deaths in only three weeks over the last year and four times as many flu deaths than Covid deaths in 2024 up to the start of May. Covid-19 was the 32nd leading cause of death in Wales in July 2023, after being the 19th leading cause in June. This was the lowest ranking as cause of death for two years and the third lowest since the pandemic began. It was behind accidental poisoning and appendicitis. Monthly mortality analysis - which was also discontinued at the end of July - showed there were 21 deaths due to Covid in July 2023 - 0.8% of all registered deaths.  Looking at when Covid was a contributory factor, there were 29 deaths involving Covid in Wales - or 1.1% of all deaths registered in July. Heart disease was again the leading cause of death in July 2023 in Wales.  Flu and pneumonia again ranked sixth but below normal levels.  Covid was the leading cause of death at the height of the pandemic in 2020 and then the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease in 2021. It was the seventh leading cause of death in 2022, with a mortality rate of 38.5 deaths per 100,000. It was the sixth leading cause of death in men in 2022 (4%) and fifth leading cause in men over 80 (5.1%) but did not feature as a leading cause of death in women. Up to the end of July 2023, heart disease was the leading cause of death - although still below average - and Covid was the ninth leading cause.  Across England and Wales in the whole of 2023, deaths due to Covid were 2% of all cause deaths. This compared to 4.2% from flu and pneumonia Heart disease ranked as the leading cause of death for 2022 and in England and Wales it was dementia and Alzheimer's disease in 2023, closely followed by heart disease.  Analysis of mortality from the start of the pandemic until the end of July 2023 shows the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is slightly higher in Wales (102.2 deaths per 100,000), than England on 101.5 deaths per 100,000. Scotland (9.56) and Northern Ireland (93.2) are both lower in the 41 months to the end of July. The age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England than in Wales. It is also higher in all English regions apart from south west, south east and east England. When a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales. Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 70% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales in 2023.  It has been as high as 94% and on average since the outbreak of the pandemic until the end of August 2024, 82% of deaths with Covid on death certificates could be said to be due to Covid. So, there had been around 10,429 deaths due to Covid by 30 August 2024 in Wales. Covid has been ""suspected"" by doctors in around 4% of cases.  A doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution.  Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) and Merthyr Tydfil had the highest crude mortality rates over the course of the pandemic in Wales. By 29 December 2023, RCT had reached a total of 1,235 deaths, with the highest crude mortality rate - 516.7 deaths per 100,000. This was the seventh highest crude mortality rate of all local authorities across England and Wales. Deaths involving Covid can also be shown to be hitting people living in deprived areas, usually associated with poorer health, harder than in the least deprived areas of Wales. When deaths from Covid as the underlying cause and adjusted for age are looked at, then Rhondda Cynon Taf, Blaenau Gwent and Merthyr had the highest mortality rates in 2020. Bridgend had the highest Covid mortality rate in 2021, including the peak of the pandemic's second wave. Conwy had a relatively higher mortality rate in the third year of the pandemic.  Six of RCT's communities were in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates can be broken down further. At a health board level, the age-standardised mortality rate for Cwm Taf Morgannwg, which covers RCT, Merthyr and Bridgend, was 127 deaths per 100,000 due to Covid in the three years of the pandemic up to the end of July 2023.  This is the highest in Wales, the lowest being 55.5 deaths per 100,000 due to Covid in the Powys health board area, set against a Welsh average of 84.3. For 2023, Conwy, Bridgend and Powys had the highest Covid mortality rates in Wales, based on the sizes of their populations. The community with the highest number of Covid deaths across 2020 and 2021, including in the first two waves of the pandemic, was Tonyrefail West (RCT) with a total of 63 deaths due to Covid. This was followed by Sandfields in Neath Port Talbot and Porth East and Ynyshir in RCT (55 deaths each), by the end of 2021. When translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Gwersyllt West and Summerhill in Wrexham was the highest at 742.6 deaths per 100,000 - or 44 deaths over the two years. This was followed by Tonyrefail West, Port Talbot East and Llanelli Bigyn in Carmarthenshire. All communities of Wales have now had at least two deaths during the pandemic. The lowest number of deaths at a community level were in Aberystwyth North and Aberystwyth South, Bangor City and Llandudno Junction South and Llansanffraid Glan Conwy. At a local authority level, in the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales. In 2021, Bridgend had the highest Covid mortality rate - 271 deaths or 183.2 deaths per 100,000; this was the 24th highest area across England and Wales. The first wave of the pandemic brought early clusters of deaths in the old Gwent valleys, around Pontnewydd and Upper Cwmbran, Cross Keys and Ebbw Vale, followed by Tonyrefail East in Rhondda Cynon Taf. Blaenau Ffestiniog and Llanberis in Gwynedd also had early clusters in north Wales, according to data analysis. These were adjusted for age or deprivation and so other factors such as travel patterns or occupations may have come into play to explain the spread of infection. The highest rate by the end of March - a few days after lockdown - was around Caerphilly and the valleys to the north and was more than 11 times what would be expected compared with the whole of Wales. By mid-April, higher mortality rates had spread to Welsh border counties and expanded into Cardiff and Swansea and other valleys areas. By the end of the first wave, the only clusters of higher mortality were showing in parts of north Wales.  ONS said there was higher mortality in more deprived areas of south east Wales, but consistently high mortality was also seen in some rural areas after accounting for known risk factors. There are figures to compare relative excess deaths in different European countries. Bulgaria has the highest relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rate - 18.2% higher than normal - and Norway the lowest, 4.1% below average. Wales was 3.7% above average in June 2021 and then 2.1% above average in July 2022 - ranked 21st out of 33 nations. For those aged under 65, Wales was 4.8% above average (ranked 12th) and 1.5% above average (joint 24th) in the over-65s. Wales also saw excess mortality in more than half of weeks over the period. Covid vaccinations passed the 10m mark as the spring 2024 booster programme progressed in April 2024. The autumn-winter booster programme reached more than 742,500 people in 2023-24. That included nearly three quarters of over 65s and 85% of care home residents. Numbers of NHS staff who took up offers of a vaccine booster was down on earlier stages of the programme. Just over half of all those eligible across different groups had taken up the offer, perhaps reflecting numbers who felt they had immunity from having had the virus more than once. The 2024 spring programme - targeting mainly the over 75s - reached 147,481 doses by early May. Analysis of vaccine uptake has consistently found gaps between people living in deprived areas and also people from black, Asian and mixed groups.  The offers of the primary course of vaccine to anyone over five, available since December 2020, ended in June 2023.  The dominant variant in Wales has been Omicron for more than two years and 357 positive test results had been sequenced in the month ending 21 May 2024. Because of the ending of mass testing in April 2022, we should not expect to see the same numbers of results going off for sequencing any more. Nearly all of those analysed in the last month have been the JN.1 sub-variant. From summer 2020, the ONS organised a weekly nose and throat swab survey involving thousands of households across Wales, which latterly saw people being sent test kits by post. It became the most important tool to measure the level of infections, with the end of mass testing in March 2022. By this measure, infections were estimated to have peaked in Wales in April 2022 with 232,000 (around 8%) estimated to be affected. However, the survey was ""paused"" at the end of March 2023, as the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) worked to confirm a surveillance approach which was ""proportionate and cost effective"" to living with Covid. The health minister expressed her ""deep disappointment and concern"" about the ""loss of this important source of surveillance"". and the break in data gathering at a time infections were still being recorded in Wales. But the Welsh government decided not to re-join a scaled-down version of the survey, which was relaunched in winter 2023, testing around 29,000 people. This suggested 2.7% of people in England and Scotland had Covid in the week ending 3 January 2024. Data from the infection survey, before it was wound up, also suggested 94.6% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection. The estimate was 91% of 16 to 24-year-olds in Wales would have tested positive for antibodies in February 2023. At the higher threshold, 79.5% of adults in Wales are at or above 800 nanograms per millilitre and nearly three quarters in those aged 16 to 24 and 92.3% of the 75-79 age group. A test of blood donors in Wales found more than 80% prevalence of the N antibody, indicating a natural infection from having Covid, and a 99.9% prevalence of the S antibody from either infection or having had the Covid vaccine.  The number of people who were reporting they had long Covid symptoms in Wales a year after being infected in early March 2023 was estimated to be around 57,000. This was just under 2% of the population who are estimated to still be suffering symptoms 12 months or more since having Covid. A total of 94,000 people were estimated to have long Covid at any duration. Of these, 24% said it had ""a lot"" of impact on their daily lives and 52% said it had little impact. An estimated 3.14% of people in Wales reported having long Covid - this was slightly less than in Scotland and the West Midlands and north west and north east of England. Just under 2% reported long Covid after a year - fewer than England and most of its regions and Scotland. Two thirds in Wales reporting long Covid said they had symptoms of weakness and tiredness and more than half a shortness of breath. Nearly half had muscle ache. This data set has now been curtailed, with the end of the ONS infection survey. A separate survey of more than 1,600 people with long Covid in Wales referred to the Adferiad recovery programme found around 70% were female and half were aged over 50. Of those needing follow-up, around a quarter had hospital treatment. Average stays were around two weeks. Fatigue, ""brain fog"" and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms. Scientific advisers for the Welsh government estimate that potentially up to a quarter of people who have Covid may develop long Covid. In January 2022, this would have included far higher proportions of Covid cases involving people aged between 50 and 70 - an estimated 43% of those with Covid. But even if 6% of young people under 25 with Covid developed long-term symptoms, this could still mean more than 2,200 young people with long Covid in Wales. This analysis was used to develop a ""social cost"" estimate for Covid, which looked at the cost to the NHS of treating Covid at different stages of the pandemic. With the effects of the vaccine, and less patient time in hospital and intensive care, it meant this estimated cost had fallen from £21,000 per case in the second wave of the pandemic to £5,769 per case by January 2022. Of this, more than £4,800 per case would be the cost of long Covid. The first Welsh patient to be admitted to a hospital with Covid was on 2 March 2020. Waves of the pandemic saw dozens of patients in critical care with Covid.  This reached 164 patients at the first wave peak in April 2020, while the second wave peak in January peaked at 150 patients. As the vaccination programme kicked in, there were only 40 patients at the winter peak of 2021-22 and then 24 patients with Covid in critical care at the peak of winter 2022-23. For the final Digital Health and Care Wales figures, there were five patients in critical care with Covid on 12 July 2023, with one of those recovering from Covid. A long-running study of more than 500 Welsh critical care patients with Covid gave insights into the virus. The mortality rate was about 34%, including those who died later on a general ward. About 63% had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived were spending less time in critical care - an average of seven days - than early in the pandemic.  Around 60% of patients had been admitted to critical care with Covid the primary reason for treatment. The average age of those admitted in 2022-23 was 58, and just over half were men. Half were from more deprived parts of Wales. About 26% were under 50. At its peaks, there were between 120 and 140 admissions a day on average to hospitals for patients with Covid. By the time Digital Health and Care Wales halted their data gathering, there were five admissions of people testing positive for Covid on 12 July 2023, with numbers in single figures for the previous three months. Figures had been low and, for the first time since the pandemic began, no Covid admissions were recorded on 24 January 2023. The previous low had been just one admission on two days in May and June 2022. Over 18 months from the start of 2022, hospitals in Wales were asked to track how many of their patients testing positively for Covid were actually being primarily treated for it. Over this period, 13% of patients on average with Covid were being actively or primarily treated for it.   There were some differences between health boards over definitions so care needs to be taken in how we interpret this. But since the autumn of 2022, the proportion of ""active"" Covid cases was usually in single figures. The Icnarc intensive care study has found a far smaller proportion of critical care patients with Covid were being primarily treated for the virus during 2022 (41%), compared with the period before (nearly 86%). The mortality rate was 31% for those with ""primary"" Covid, compared with 25% for those with incidental Covid. In the autumn of 2020, a series of local lockdowns - which began in Caerphilly in early September 2020 - were introduced to try to stop a rise in cases. These eventually covered most local authority areas in Wales but only had a short term impact. This measure was followed by a Wales-wide ""firebreak"" lockdown on 23 October 2020.  The case rate then rose to a second wave peak in winter 2020. When we look at infections at a community level, there has generally a split between rural and more urban areas. This is noticeable when we look at a map of community case rates for the whole pandemic, taking into account population sizes. At the peak of the Omicron wave at the end of 2021, the positivity rate - the number of positive results from all PCR tests taken - reached 51.6%. Locally, Neath Port Talbot over the course of the whole pandemic had the highest positivity rate (18.8%) and Ceredigion the lowest. Earlier in the pandemic, a 5% positivity threshold was suggested by the World Health Organisation as an indicator that infections were too high. There was a much younger profile to cases in the third wave in the latter half of 2021. Between January and March 2022 there was a rise in proportions of those aged 20 to 40 testing positive.  In terms of PCR tests, the 20 to 40 age group made up more than 41% of positive results in winter 2021-22. Nearly 8.9 million Covid-19 tests have been carried out since the start of the pandemic, with the first positive result recorded in Swansea on 27 February 2020. For most of the first wave, testing was confined to hospitals and some care homes but mass testing became available in the spring of 2020.  This ended at the start of April 2022, although it is still taking place in hospitals and also for some vulnerable people and those with symptoms in care homes. There are around 2,500 PCR tests currently taking place each week, about half in the over 60s. This compares to around 200,000 a week at the pandemic's peak. Up to the end of routine testing in April 2022, about 17,000 PCR tests routinely took place in hospitals each week and up to 30,000 weekly in care homes.  Testing that was processed privately - at so-called Lighthouse labs - is no longer taking place. There have also now been changes to guidance for Covid testing in hospitals, although patients will still be tested before admission or ahead of surgery or chemotherapy. Altogether, around 32,500 positive results were recorded in care homes over the course of the routine testing programme from autumn 2020. Care home staff no longer need to take a weekly PCR test, while free lateral flow tests will only be provided in limited circumstances. School absences for Covid-related reasons are no longer being recorded.  We saw over the 2021-22 academic year, 69.1% of pupils missed at least half a day's schooling because of Covid. Absenteeism for any reason continued to rise, including those persistently absent. The percentage of secondary school pupils who were persistently absent had tripled to 16.3% from 2018-19 - the last full academic year before Covid - and 2022-23. This was more than twice the absence rate in pre-pandemic years. Analysis of these figures showed 10% were persistently absent - and this rose to 21% of those from poorer backgrounds. The so-called R-number - the reproduction number - had been a tool to express the infection rate of Covid. However, it is has now been phased out as a measure. Expressed within a range, if it was above 1, this indicated that infections were growing.  The range for the last estimate in December 2022 was between 0.9 and 1.2, suggesting infections were rising. So, for every 10 people with Covid in Wales, between another nine and 12 people would be infected. In the financial year ending in March 2021, the first year of the pandemic, spending on infectious diseases in the NHS in Wales jumped by £373 million. That worked out at £156 per person in Wales, or just under 6% of all NHS Wales spending. The costing of treating patients with Covid and managing the virus was put at £628m. Spending also included field hospitals and operating the track and trace system."
Spread to UST,Three things to do as energy bills go up,2024-09-25,2022-09-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63074521,"Most households will see their energy bills rise on Saturday, as the new energy price guarantee comes into effect. The rise is less than had previously been expected, after the government announced it would cap domestic bills to prevent widespread hardship.    But it is still significant. A typical household's energy bill will rise from £1,971 to £2,500 - that's double what it was last winter. So what can you do to try to prepare for higher bills? Though most energy-cutting tips won't make enough of a saving to offset the total impact of soaring bills, there are some ways to make sure you are paying the right bills and to help ease the mounting costs. Suppliers need regular readings from your gas or electricity meter to calculate your bills.  Without your readings, suppliers estimate usage which means your bills could be too high, so households are being urged to contact their suppliers to give them the readings via a phone call, their website or an app. Industry body Energy UK said there is no need to submit a meter reading on 1 October itself, as most suppliers will accept readings for a few days on either side of that date. But it advised customers to check with their supplier for advice on giving readings when the new prices kick in, as high call volumes and website traffic are expected. For those who have not read a meter before, Citizen's Advice has information on how to recognise different meters. You do not need to do a meter reading if you have a working smart meter (credit or pre-payment) or a fixed deal.  There are also longer term cost-cutting tips such as insulating your home well, checking appliances are turned off rather than left on standby and turning your thermostat down by one degree.  Make sure you are claiming all the support you are entitled to.     All households will get a one-off £400 cut to their fuel bills from October.  You do not have to contact your supplier about this. The discount will be made automatically by energy suppliers in England, Scotland and Wales.  It will be spread over six months, with a reduction of £66 in October and November, and £67 every month between December and March 2023.  Separate arrangements are being made for households in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. You can use the Citizens Advice benefits calculator to work out if there are any other funds you should be claiming. In Scotland, you can use Advice Direct Scotland's calculator. Households that receive the Winter Fuel Payment - which is worth £200-£300 and is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - will receive an extra £300 in November or December. That should cover nearly all pensioners across the UK.  In England, Scotland and Wales, all homes in council tax bands A to D, or up to E if a householder has a disability, are also eligible for a £150 energy rebate, often through their council tax bill. The payment should have been made by the end of September, so check that you have received this.  How it should have been paid depends whether you pay your council tax by direct debit and where you live in the UK. The Northern Ireland Assembly has received an equivalent sum of money to administer locally. If you are claiming support such as income-based jobseeker's allowance, income support, pension credit or universal credit, certain schemes can help you pay your energy charges and energy debt directly from your benefits.  Jobcentre Plus or the Pension Service can arrange for some of the benefits to be paid directly each month to the energy company owed.  If you can't afford your ongoing energy bills, contact your supplier. If you are in debt to your energy company, you might be able to get a grant to help pay it off. British Gas, Octopus and Scottish Power are among the firms which offer grants to their customers and charity Citizens Advice offers more guidance.  Organisations such as National Debtline also offer advice, and can help you check that your bills are correct and complain about your supplier if they are not.  If you do get into debt, Citizens Advice warns that suppliers have the right to force you onto a prepayment meter, which is the more expensive way of paying. The charity predicts almost half a million people could be in this position over the winter.  Although the government says a typical household can expect to pay £2,500 a year, this is not a limit on how much you will actually pay.  It has worked out that figure for a ""typical"" household using a new limit on unit prices of 34p per kWh of electricity and 10.3p per kWh of gas for dual-fuel customers on a standard variable tariff.   However, most households aren't typical, and your bill depends on how much energy you actually use."
