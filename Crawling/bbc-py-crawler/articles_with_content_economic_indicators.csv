economic indicators,Is US economy better or worse now than under Trump?,2024-09-15,2024-09-02,Jake Horton,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xl5vnlzpwo,"It has been a recurrent theme of this US presidential campaign - has the US economy performed better under Joe Biden or Donald Trump? “By many indicators our economy is the strongest in the world,” Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris has claimed. Trump, the Republican nominee and former president, says he created the ""greatest economy in the history of our country"", and the Biden-Harris administration has ruined it. We have looked at some key indicators to compare economic performance under the two presidencies. Although the impact of Covid has made comparison difficult, both presidents can count some notable economic successes despite wages struggling to keep up with price increases in recent years. First, let's look at economic growth using Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - the value of all goods and services in the US economy.  There was a dramatic collapse in this figure during Covid as many businesses shut. Following the pandemic, the economy bounced back strongly under Trump and recovered better than many other western countries. This has continued under Mr Biden, with the US producing the strongest pandemic recovery within the G7 as measured by GDP. But over Trump's four years in office, it was not the greatest economy in US history, as he likes to claim. Between January 2017 and January 2021, average annual growth rate was 2.3%.  This period includes the slowdown and recovery of the economy as a result of the Covid pandemic. Under the Biden administration so far, this figure is 2.2% - so almost the same. There have been periods in the past when GDP growth was significantly higher than the average under both Trump and Biden, such as in the 1970s. The rate at which prices are rising has been a big issue in the campaign. Prices rose significantly during the first two years under Mr Biden - hitting a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Trump has said the US has experienced “the worst inflation we've ever had”.  But that's not true - inflation was last above 9% in 1981, and it has been much higher than that at several other points in US history. Inflation has now fallen to around 3% - but it remains higher than when Trump left office. Grocery prices, for example, increased by 13.5% over the year ending in August 2022.  This was the peak under the Biden administration, and prices have stabilised somewhat since, with the cost of groceries rising by 1.1% from July 2023 to July this year. The recent trend is comparable with many other Western countries which experienced high inflation rates in 2021 and 2022, as global supply chain issues driven by Covid and the war in Ukraine contributed to rising prices. But some economists say Mr Biden’s $1.9tn (£1.5tn) American Rescue Plan, which passed in 2021, was also a factor - as the injection of cash into the economy led to prices rising further. The Biden administration has repeatedly pointed to strong job growth as a major achievement. Before big job losses in 2020 due to Covid, in the first three years of Trump's presidency almost 6.7 million jobs were added, according to data for non-farm jobs (which covers about 80% of workers in the labour force). There's been an increase of almost 16 million jobs since the Biden administration took over in January 2021. Mr Biden claims this is the “fastest job growth at any point of any president in all of American history”. That’s correct - if you look at the available data since records began in 1939. But his administration has benefited from a sharp rebound in economic activity as the country emerged from pandemic lockdowns. “Many of the jobs would have come back if Trump had won in 2020 - but the American Rescue Plan played a major role in the speed and aggressiveness of the labour market recovery,” says Professor Mark Strain, an economist at Georgetown University. This spending plan passed under the Biden administration in 2021 was designed to help stimulate the economy following the pandemic. Weaker than expected job growth in July led to fears of a sudden downturn in the US economy and stock markets were hit as a result, but they've since stabilised. Both administrations have pointed to low unemployment levels under their leadership.  Prior to the pandemic, Mr Trump delivered an unemployment rate of 3.5%. As in many parts of the world, Covid lockdown measures led to soaring levels of unemployment in the US - but the unemployment levels had dropped back down to around 7% when Trump left office. Under the Biden administration unemployment continued to fall to a low of 3.4% in January 2023 - the lowest rate in more than 50 years - but it it has since ticked up to 4.3%. In terms of wages, these did rise under Trump but at a similar rate to his predecessor Barack Obama, up until the pandemic hit. Workers’ wages increased rapidly at the start of 2020 during the Covid pandemic - but the sudden uptick in wages was linked to lower paid workers being more likely to be laid off, which raised the average wage of people who were still employed. Under Mr Biden, average weekly earnings have grown, but they have struggled to keep up with the increase in prices caused by high levels of inflation. When adjusted for inflation, average weekly wages are less than when Mr Biden came into office.  The US stock market isn't necessarily a reflection of the broader economy, but many Americans have investments, so its performance holds some importance. The Dow Jones Index is a measure of the performance of 30 large companies listed on US stock exchanges. It reached record highs during Trump’s presidency, but crashed as markets reacted to the pandemic, wiping out all the gains made under Trump.  However, the financial markets recovered to above pre-pandemic levels by the time Trump left office in January 2021. They have continued to grow under Mr Biden, and although there have been recent wobbles, they have reached record levels under his administration as well. Graphics by Tommy Lumby.

economic indicators,Fears over energy tax rises as business confidence falls,2024-09-15,2024-09-01,Michael Race & Karen Hoggan,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx287xq91e5o,"Raising the windfall tax on the UK's oil and gas companies will hit the government's main goal of growing the economy, the industry has said. Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) said the planned hike would cause investment in the sector to plunge and result in a loss of £13bn to the UK economy from 2025 to 2029, putting 35,000 jobs at risk. The warning came as a leading business group warned that talk of tax rises and employment rights has ""dented confidence in the environment for business in the UK"". A Treasury spokesperson said the government was committed to a ""constructive dialogue"" with the oil and gas industry over changes to the windfall tax. Under government plans, the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) - which is the official name of the windfall tax - is due to rise from 35% to 38% on 1 November on the profits oil and gas firms make in the UK.  Companies operating in the North Sea are already taxed differently to others. They pay 30% corporation tax on profits as well as a supplementary 10% rate.  It means from November, the total tax rate on profits made by energy firms in the UK is expected to rise to 78%. The government has also announced it wants to extend the length of the levy until 2030, and that it will ""tighten"" investment allowances, which have allowed firms to reduce the amount of tax paid if they invest in projects, such as green energy, in the North Sea. OEUK said the policy changes would ""undermine"" the industry's ability to ""support the government’s overarching goal of driving economic growth"". Its analysis follows previous concerns from firms over the Labour government's plan to increase the windfall tax on profits made by energy companies. The industry body's analysis claimed: ""This is a government that has made economic growth its main priority and yet our analysis shows that its policy will ultimately reduce this sector’s contribution to the UK economy,"" said David Whitehouse, OEUK chief executive. The EPL was first introduced in May 2022 by the previous government in response to surging oil and gas prices.  With household energy bills soaring, the windfall tax was designed to help fund a scheme to restrict gas and electricity bills, which has now ended.    OEUK argued the original EPL was intended to be a ""temporary tax in response to the economic environment at the time"".  The ""windfall conditions"" that the EPL was designed to address had since passed, it added.  A spokesperson for the Treasury said: ""We are committed to maintaining a constructive dialogue with the oil and gas sector to finalise changes to strengthen the windfall tax, ensuring a phased and responsible transition for the North Sea. ""Our plans for a new National Wealth Fund and Great British Energy will create thousands of new jobs in the industries of the future."" In the run-up to the general election, Labour positioned itself as the party of ""wealth creation"", with the aim of improving living standards for working people.  Central to that was its claim that it would encourage businesses to invest more,  something that has been languishing since 2016. The party hoped this would lead to more funding for training, skills, technology and buildings which, economists say, would make the UK more productive.  However, last week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer warned the autumn Budget in October, where the government will outline its taxation and spending plans, would be ""painful"". Talk of tax rises and increased employment rights has ""dented confidence in the environment for business in the UK"", said Anna Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors (IoD) business group. The IoD's Directors' Economic Confidence Index, which measures business leader optimism, hit a three-year high in July, but fell back sharply in August, according to the latest survey.    ""It’s disappointing to see [July's] welcome uptick in business leader confidence snuffed out over the summer,"" said Ms Leach.  The group said investment intentions for the year ahead saw the sharpest decline since the beginning of the Covid pandemic lockdowns.  Revenue and headcount expectations for business bosses also fell last month. ""We are calling on the government to take time to get policy design right for the long-term, and deliver the stable tax and policy framework needed to drive business confidence and investment,"" Ms Leach added. Also on Monday, the CBI Growth Indicator survey said private sector firms expected activity to rise ""modestly"" in the three months to November. CBI interim deputy chief economist, Alpesh Paleja, said this was ""encouraging"", but added that its survey painted a ""very mixed picture"".  He said consumer-racing businesses were still ""struggling"" and momentum in manufacturing remained ""tepid at best"". Ahead of the Budget on 30 October, he said firms would want to see policies which can help turn this mixed outlook into a ""far more positive outcome for all sectors for the rest of the year"".  He added: ""Whether that’s reducing costs - for instance through long overdue business rates reform - or setting out a business tax roadmap to attract investment. ""All this can help to deliver the return to long-term sustainable growth that new government has promised, and firms across all sectors want to see."" "
economic indicators,"The town that should have burned, but didn't",2024-09-15,2024-09-10,Ally Hirschlag,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240909-how-montecito-california-fire-proofed-and-defended-itself-against-a-mega-wildfire,"In 2017, one of California's largest ever wildfires was steadily approaching Montecito. But it had long been preparing for just such an event, and survived almost intact. A few days into December 2017, Maeve Juarez, a wildland fire specialist for the Montecito Fire Department, learned an enormous wildfire was creeping toward the Southern California town. She was about to be on the frontlines of a community of less than 10,000 people facing off against the Thomas Fire, California's largest ever wildfire at that time. The community, however, had several advantages over the approaching fire, the most significant being that it had been preparing for this moment for 30 years. A decades-long programme had ensured people in the town took regular measures – from clearing up dried leaves around town to fire-proofing their own houses – and installed a level of community trust and cohesion that made fast action possible in the face of a quickly encroaching fire. Wildfires: A growing threat In 2017, the Thomas Fire was the largest in recorded Californian history, but it has since been surpassed in size by eight others, including the July 2024 Park Fire. On 8 September 2024, more than 10,000 people were put under mandatory evacuation orders due to a new fast-spreading, uncontrolled wildfire in southern California. As climate change brings the wildfire threat closer to many communities, they are likewise considering what measures they can take to protect themselves. They may not have 30 years to develop these strategies, but looking at Montecito's long-running experiment can help other communities come up with plans of their own. ""You don't start preventing dementia once the signs are there; similarly, we don't want to start preparing for wildfire once it's coming into our neighbourhoods,"" says Juarez. On 16 December 2017, the Thomas Fire's flames emerged above Montecito, almost a full week after residents had evacuated. By then, the Sundowner winds – strong down-sloping winds that typically hit the area in the early evening – reached 65mph (105km/h) and the fire team braced for the worst. But Montecito's long history of preparation, along with the support of over 8,000 firefighters, turned the town into a wildfire success story. As the fire peaked around 6am, firefighter reservers came to help the crews positioned to keep the fire at bay. Over the next 12 hours, they worked together fighting spot fires that cropped up from falling embers. By nightfall, the Sundowner winds had died down, and the fire had moved away from the coastline and Montecito. Despite the ominous setup, the town's extensive preparations had paid off. The Thomas Fire burnt through some 282,000 acres (114,000 hectares) of Californian land, including parts of nearby Ventura and Santa Paula. But once the flames and embers abated, only seven homes in Montecito had burned down. ""Hundreds of structures benefited from the vigilant fire suppression resources that had been deployed in advance,"" says Juarez. ""The level of damage was considerably lower than projected in the 2016 Montecito community wildfire protection plan or what we experienced during previous fires."" Montecito's long journey to that moment started in 1994 when, prompted by worsening wildfire seasons, the Montecito Fire Department launched a programme led by wildland fire specialists to develop ways to mitigate wildfire threats. Since then, they have consistently helped the community come together to maintain these strategies as a united front. With the guidance of wildland fire specialists like Juarez, community members have long been asked to take critical steps to reduce fire fuel (such as dried leaves and dead plants) around the town. The fire department organises regular neighbourhood cleanups, offers free wood-chipping services, and clears overgrowth and brush in remote areas that might help spread wildfire. They also have a comprehensive evacuation plan in place to protect residents and clear the way for first responders to do their job. Community members are kept up to date on the best fire mitigation practices, such as how to incorporate new fire-resistant materials into home hardening projects.   ""Our strength lies in ensuring that our entire community is prepared for wildfires,"" says Juarez. ""While following all the recommended checklists is essential, the community's collective efforts are what truly make the difference."" The other major advantage Montecito had during the Thomas Fire was time. Due to how the fire was moving, they were able to deploy firefighting resources (130 engines and 30 crews) four days before the fire encroached on the town. They even had the bandwidth to use bulldozers to clear vegetation along a perimeter above and around Montecito, which is known to burn quickly, while water tankers spread retardant across around 16 miles (26km) of upper roadways. Time also helped them to implement a calm, measured evacuation, although this also owed something to the town's long-standing preparations for wildfire, Juarez says. The established trust between the fire department's wildland fire specialists and the community led to high compliance with evacuation orders, meaning firefighters had the chance to clear brush. Willingness to follow requests to leave private driveway gates open, meanwhile, meant firefighters could strategically set up fire trucks and hose lays around individual properties. Wildfires in the Western US are growing bigger and more intense as climate change triggers longer, dryer summers. But that just sets the stage; urban sprawl and accidental ignition by humans also increase the risk of megafires by creating more fuel and then lighting the match, so to speak. Erica Fischer, assistant professor of structural engineering at Oregon State University in the US, studies how community infrastructure is impacted by natural disasters, with a particular focus on wildfires and earthquakes. She says the science behind how communities can be retrofitted to withstand wildfires is some 100 years behind that of withstanding earthquakes. If a community doesn't have a unified, collaborative mitigation strategy, she says, the burden often falls entirely on individual homeowners. So, where can communities without a wildfire mitigation strategy begin? Fischer says the first step is to identify their most vital infrastructure and develop a plan to protect it from burning – a strategy known as asset mapping. ""What would burn in this community that would destroy it economically [and] prevent it from coming back?"" says Fischer. ""Previous research shows that [it's] often schools and hospitals, particularly if they only have one of them in a town, which means that they're usually the largest employers."" Every community is different and will have a unique set of priorities. In Ashland, Oregon, for example, which is currently developing its wildfire mitigation strategy, the town prioritised protecting its theatre, Fischer says. Identifying areas where fire is likely to spread is also a high priority. For example, if there's an older wooden church in the centre of town that could quickly catch fire if embers fell on it, that should be hardened against fire first. Meanwhile, protecting water infrastructure should not be overlooked, stresses Fischer. ""There's been a lot of water infrastructure damage throughout the West due to wildfires, and that includes contamination within the water distribution system."" One helpful approach is to create defensible spaces around water supplies, such as natural watersheds and reservoirs. All parts of a community need to understand their own level of risk, adds Abby Silver, outreach programme coordinator for Wildfire Partners, a non-profit in Boulder County, Colorado. ""Before the Marshall Fire [in Boulder, Colorado in 2020], those who lived in the more urban parts of the east county thought of wildfire as something that happens 'up there in the hills',"" says Silver. Now they're beginning to realise that wildland fire can turn into urban conflagration under the right conditions."" Extra effort may be needed to include and support parts of the community likely to have a harder time recovering if they lost structures in a wildfire. Financially and/or socially vulnerable areas might not have as direct access to firefighting resources as more affluent parts of a community, says Fischer, nor as much representation in a town hall setting. Experts agree that every wildfire-at-risk community needs a concise evacuation plan that is broadcast widely and accessible to all community members. If a community can be efficiently evacuated ahead of a wildfire, it clears the way for firefighters and emergency crew to do their job. ""During a wildfire, emergency responders' first priority is life safety, then structure defense,"" says Silver. ""The less energy they have to devote to helping residents evacuate, the more they can devote to response. Educating the public to evacuate early, without necessarily waiting for an evacuation order, facilitates the work of first responders."" Connecting people, stories and ideas to spread fire adaptation practices to different communities and help with peer support play an important role, too, says Emily Troisi, director of the Fire Adapted Communities Network (FacNet), a non-profit that helps provide fire-at-risk communities with the education and tools they need to better mitigate the impacts of fires. ""This work is very hard, [and] complex, and many communities have experienced trauma from the severe negative impacts of extreme wildfire."" Doing retrospectives of towns that were destroyed or partially destroyed by wildfires, unlike Montecito, can also help communities see where the gaps in protection were, says Fischer. This, in turn, can help them prioritise what they need to shore up. ""These towns where portions of the towns were down, those are the real success stories that we should be engaging with and talking about a little bit more."" However, Fischer cautions that Montecito's mitigation strategies aren't a panacea that will work for every fire-at-risk community. ""When [you've been] doing this staged approach [for 30 years], not only is it not so much of a financial burden to the community itself, but you're doing a little bit over a long period of time, and that changes the culture and the perception of risk and hazard within the town."" Most communities in the US are also not as homogenous as the small, affluent town of Montecito. It's challenging to get everyone in a community on board with a complex wildfire mitigation plan, even with incremental change, when there's economic and social disparity. ""To tell a community that you need to do all of this wildland mitigation in addition to all of this mitigation within your community, and you need to do it immediately, or else your town is going to burn down? It's overwhelming, financially,"" says Fischer. More like this:  • Why Canada is riddled with wildfires that burn year-round • The long distance harm to health caused by wildfires • The goats fighting fires in Los Angeles Troisi also advises against putting too narrow a focus on only preventing fires or stopping structures from burning. FacNet focuses on tools that aid overall community evaluation and relationship-building to help people think through who and what needs to be included in resilience efforts, she says. Understandably, not every community has the budget to develop an expensive wildfire mitigation programme. However, Juarez says, there are several grants available that include salaries for wildland specialists like her. Numerous non-profits around the US are also helping at-risk communities become more fire aware. Fires can be incredibly destructive, but they can also be beneficial if handled respectfully. Prescribed burns are often instrumental in reducing the risk of megafires, according to a 2023 report from the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission, which gave recommendations to Congress on how to improve federal policies related to wildland fires. (Read more about the benefits of prescribed burns for nature). While experts advise communities to harden their homes against wildfires collectively, there are also several steps individual homeowners can take to make their property less likely to catch fire. According to Juarez, quick and impactful measures include retrofitting vents with galvanised steel screening; filling and covering exposed wood on siding, doorways and windows with caulk and fresh paint; and sealing garages and doors with weather stripping. She also recommends installing gutter screens since gutters can collect dry leaves and debris that ignite easily. In all cases, it's important to use ignition-resistant construction materials whenever possible. CARBON COUNT The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. Perhaps the most impactful step homeowners can take is to create a buffer zone around their property (the recommended buffer area can vary depending on a state's wildfire risk; in California, the zone is 100ft (30m). ""Use non-combustible materials like pebbles or river rock within the first 5ft (1.5m) of your home,"" says Juarez. ""This area should have little to no vegetation to minimise anything that could catch fire from embers."" Clearing flammable materials, such as brush and weeds, beyond this zone is also a good idea. But as Montecito shows, wildfire protection goes far beyond these individual measures. As climate change fans the flames of wildfire destruction further, mitigation experts say it takes connections and continued, active participation between everyone to develop defensive strategies that will work. ""It has to be a collaboration between land management agencies, governments, and homeowners,"" says Fischer. ""All three have to buy in, and all three need to be at the table ready to do something."" -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

economic indicators,Trump and Harris battle over election’s biggest issue,2024-09-15,2024-08-16,Sarah Smith,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl2xjxlz3xo,"After almost a year off the platform, Donald Trump returned to X this week and asked his 89 million followers: “Are you better off now than you were when I was president?” It was a clear echo of the famous quote from Ronald Reagan during his victorious 1980 presidential campaign, when he asked: “Are you better off today than you were four years ago?” This messaging isn’t surprising. It seems like an obvious strategy for Trump to focus on the economy. That’s because polls consistently suggest it’s the issue American voters care about the most. One such poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov in recent days listed “inflation/prices” and “jobs and the economy” among voters’ top concerns.  Perhaps more importantly, polls also indicate voters are deeply unhappy with the current state of affairs. That seems like a perfect situation for any presidential challenger. But in an election that’s been transformed by Kamala Harris taking over from Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate, Trump seems to be struggling to land his simple message on the economy. It is less than a month since he was on stage at the Republican National Convention looking unbeatable, having survived an assassination attempt and riding high in the opinion polls. Now, he has lost that lead and seems to have lost his way. Meanwhile, in the opposition corner, Ms Harris is riding a wave of excitement and enthusiasm that he is finding difficult to counter. The easiest way to burst her bubble would be to remind voters how unhappy they are about high prices and blame her for the inflation that has pushed up the cost of living during the time she has been beside President Biden in the White House. One of the reasons Trump is failing to land that message is the Harris campaign’s strategy of putting proposals to try to lower the cost of living at the heart of her pitch. In a speech in North Carolina on Friday, Ms Harris promised to expand child tax credits, help people to purchase their first homes, and to encourage the building of more affordable housing. She also said she hoped to tackle the persistently high price of food and groceries by banning “price gouging” or excessive corporate profiteering.  ""By any measure, our economy is the strongest in the world,” she said. “Many Americans don't yet feel that progress in their daily lives."" Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ought to be able to boast about some very good economic indicators. There is strong growth, record levels of job creation, and this week the inflation rate fell below 3% for the first time during Mr Biden’s presidency. But because prices are still high, voters don’t feel any better off. Voters don’t care about the rate of inflation – they care about the level of prices. “A central banker wants inflation to get back to target. A shopper wants his or her old price back,"" Jared Bernstein, the chair of President Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, said in a July speech. When it comes to the economy, “the vibes are off”. “Vibes matter,” Mr Bernstein said. So will the bad economic vibes hurt the Harris campaign? That is what I asked voters over lunch at a crab shack on the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. Jeff Tester, who works in a nearby marina, said high prices are really hurting him.  “I get paid by the hour. I get up to go to work every day. I think you have to do that to get the American dream,” he said. “But I just know it's getting harder.” And he is very clear about who he sees as responsible. “I blame the Democrats. I believe their policies are hurting the working man,” he said. Every diner I met complained about inflation, but not everyone held Mr Biden or Ms Harris responsible. Dan Nardo, a retired boat broker, said he believed the pandemic, oil prices, foreign wars and supply chain issues have more to do with price rises than the US president. His friend Randy Turk, a retired lawyer, told me that he felt a new administration is likely to follow a similar path to try to reduce inflation, regardless of who wins.  “It's not like a different president can really make that much of a difference,” he said. Ms Harris struggled for prominence and media coverage during most of her time as vice-president. Previously that was seen as a weakness. But if it means she can emerge untainted by “Bidenomics”, it could be one of her greatest strengths. Ruth Igielnik, polling editor at the New York Times, says the latest data she has collected suggests “voters very much tied their negative feelings about the economy to Joe Biden”. Talking to me on the BBC’s Americast podcast,  she explained that in her polling Trump is still favoured on the economy, but where he once had an 18-point lead over Mr Biden he now leads Ms Harris by only about 8 points. “That makes me think voters aren’t necessarily attaching their feelings about the economy to her,” she said. A separate poll this week conducted for the Financial Times and the University of Michigan Ross School of Business indicated Ms Harris holds a narrow lead over Trump on who Americans trust to handle the economy. No wonder Republicans are publicly begging Trump to focus on the issues, the economy in particular, and stop launching personal attacks against Ms Harris. In a speech this week, Trump told supporters he was going to talk about the economy but struggled to stay on topic. “They say it’s the most important subject,” he said, ""they"" referring to his advisers and strategists who believe this is his strongest line of attack. “I’m not sure it is. But they say it’s the most important,” he added, before going on to list immigration, crime and the way Ms Harris laughs as top issues. You could practically hear his campaign managers pulling their hair out. “Voters don’t care about personalities or who is drawing larger crowd sizes,” said Matt Terrill, former chief of staff for Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign. “Independent, undecided, swing voters in key states care about the economy and inflation so just focus on those core issues,” he said.  “Stay focused on talking about how you are going to make the lives of Americans better over the next four years.” It was back in 1992 that the Democrat Jim Carville coined the slogan “It’s the economy, stupid” while he was working on Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign. It’s advice that every campaign since has clung to. But Trump, this time around, seems to be finding it uncommonly difficult to stick with. It ought to be a winner for him. After all, according to the Financial Times poll, in answer to his question “Are you better off now than you were when I was president?” only 19% of voters say they are."
economic indicators,Slowest US inflation since 2021 raises rate cut hope,2024-09-15,2024-08-14,Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy3wy522dyo,"Consumer prices in the US rose at the slowest pace in more than three years last month, bolstering the case for the central bank to start cutting interest rates. Overall, prices rose 2.9% over the 12 months to July, the smallest annual increase since March 2021 and down from 3% in June, the Labor Department said.  The monthly inflation report was being closely watched after signs of weaker-than-expected jobs growth in July sparked stock market turmoil and recession fears earlier this month.  Analysts said the figures should help convince the Federal Reserve that high borrowing costs are working to return inflation back to normal, despite upticks in housing and food costs. The Federal Reserve has held its key lending rate at 5.3% - a roughly two-decade high - since July 2023, a move that has hit the public in the form of higher rates for mortgages, credit cards and other loans.  By keeping rates high, the bank is hoping to discourage borrowing and cool the demand pressures that were helping drive up prices of homes, cars and other items. But the central bank is under pressure to cut rates as inflation, which tracks the pace of price increases, has started to move closer to its 2% target rate, helped by lower oil prices and resolution of Covid-era supply chain crunches.  The three major stock indexes in the US were little changed after the report, which came in roughly as expected. Julian Howard, chief multi-asset investment strategist at GAM Investments, said a rate cut in September now looked ""all but certain"". But he said he thought the Fed would remain cautious about signalling the path ahead, pointing to last month's uptick in inflation in the UK, where the Bank of England recently cut rates. ""While the UK's higher-than-2% figure, was to an extent expected, it is still slightly jarring when inflation comes in higher than the target after a recent rate cut,"" he said.  ""Whatever the Fed does in September, it will be very keen to convey ongoing data dependency from one meeting to the next, rather than setting out a trajectory that might fail to materialise."" Inflation in the US has already receded significantly since June 2022, when it hit 9.1%. Over the past year, prices for appliances and cars have fallen, along with prices for other items such as airline tickets and furniture.  Petrol prices - a key determinant of economic sentiment in the US - have dropped 2.2%. But rising prices for household staples such as groceries have kept political pressure on the White House during a presidential election year, weighing on Democrats. Housing has accounted for more than 70% of inflation over the past year, as rents jumped more than 5%. Grocery prices also rose 1.1%, while car insurance has soared more than 18%. In a statement, President Joe Biden said the report showed ""progress fighting inflation and lowering costs for American households"", while the Trump campaign focused on the 20% rise in prices since 2021, calling the phenomenon ""Kamalanonics"", after election rival vice-president Kamala Harris. On Wall Street, the figures left investors divided about how much the Fed should cut rates in September - whether by 0.25 percentage points or more. Wells Fargo analysts said they were betting on the Fed moving more aggressively to cut rates, despite the acceleration in rents in July. ""Through the see-saw ride of recent monthly prints, the moderation in core inflation has broadened beyond goods, with services inflation—most notably housing—also cooling over the past year,"" economists led by Sarah House wrote.  ""The continued steady slowdown in inflation, when paired with the rise in the unemployment rate and deterioration in other labor market indicators, leads us to believe the [Fed] will want to move quickly."""
economic indicators,Was Ukraine’s role in big Wagner defeat an own goal in Africa?,2024-09-15,2024-08-11,Paul Melly,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78ld18lgr9o,"As Ukraine’s foreign minister completes his latest tour of Africa, his country risks paying a serious diplomatic price for helping separatist rebels in northern Mali inflict a severe defeat on the Russian military operator Wagner at the end of last month. The ambush at Tinzaouten on 27 July reportedly killed 84 Wagner fighters and 47 Malian soldiers. It was a painful military blow for the mercenary outfit once headed by the late Yevgeny Prigozhin, but now controlled by Russia’s official defence command structure. Just two days later Andriy Yusov, spokesman for Kyiv’s military intelligence service (GUR), said that ethnic Tuareg rebels in Mali had “received necessary information, and not just information, which enabled a successful military operation against Russian war criminals”. Subsequent reports suggested that Ukrainian special forces had trained the separatists in the use of attack drones. Yet for many Africans, this was yet another case of outside powers exploiting the continent as a bloody playing field for their own rivalries. Predictably, Mali’s ruling military junta, and the allied regime in neighbouring Niger, protested by breaking off diplomatic relations with Kyiv. But much more significant was a statement from the regional bloc, the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas). Despite its own diplomatic issues with the military regimes in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, it was clear in its rebuke. It declared its “firm disapproval and firm condemnation of any outside interference in the region which could constitute a threat to peace and security in West Africa and any attempt aiming to draw the region into current geopolitical confrontations”. The anger will have been strengthened by suggestions that some jihadist militants joined the Tuareg separatists in mounting the Tinzaouaten attack. The Senegalese foreign ministry summoned the Ukrainian ambassador in Dakar to protest after he posted a Facebook video about Mr Yusov’s gloating comments. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba was touring Malawi, Zambia and Mauritius last week. But after the harsh words from Ecowas and Senegal he may now have to engage in some serious fence-mending in West Africa. What many sub-Saharan African governments - even those that privately mistrust Moscow - will probably view as Kyiv’s unhelpful outside military adventurism could dispel the goodwill so painstakingly cultivated over the past two years through peaceful Ukrainian diplomacy. Of course in narrow military terms, helping to inflict the heaviest-ever African defeat on Wagner was a success for the Ukrainians. The mercenary contractor - now officially renamed Corps Africa after being brought under Russian state control - had doubled its manpower to an estimated 2,000 in Mali over the past two years. So news of the heavy losses in Tinzaouaten came as a shock, particularly given that the Malian army and Wagner forces had seized Kidal, the Tuareg rebel “capital”,  last November. The Tinzaouaten incident has signalled the separatists’ return to the offensive –with, it soon became clear, the support of a new partner. Kyiv’s hints of direct involvement confirm how far it is prepared to reach in taking its fightback against Russia’s President Vladimir Putin well beyond the home battlefield. In fact this is not the first such direct intervention against Wagner military operations in Africa. There were strong indications that last August and September Ukrainian special forces carried out drone raids in Sudan in support of the military regime led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. For more than a year, it has been engaged in a brutal power struggle with its former allies the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as ""Hemedti"", who has been assisted by Wagner. Some Ukrainian military commentators, such as Evgeniy Dikiy, former commander of Ukraine’s Aidar battalion, depict their country’s reported African military interventions very much in terms of a battle for survival after Russian forces invaded in February 2022. Mr Dikiy has argued that Kyiv has no Africa policy but does have scores to settle with Russia and Wagner in particular. But the administration of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky may not see things in quite such simplistic terms. For it knows that the fightback against Moscow is not only conducted on the battlefield. Diplomacy and trade matter too. And in the immediate aftermath of the 2022 invasion, Kyiv was painfully reminded of this truth, particularly in regards to Africa. In the UN General Assembly on 2 March that year, only 28 of the 54 African member states voted to condemn the invasion. While only a few close allies of Moscow actually voted in support of Russia’s action, many other African governments, including some generally perceived as firmly pro-Western, actively abstained or absented themselves from the vote. And later, when President Putin pulled out of the deal allowing both Ukrainian and Russian grain exports - many destined for Africa - to safely transit through the Black Sea, many sub-Saharan governments chose to view this setback in neutral terms rather than blaming Moscow. While that particular issue has faded in significance, because Ukraine has largely recovered its freedom to ship grain after striking the Russian Black Sea fleet, the foreign ministry team in Kyiv has remained convinced of the need to rebuild their political and economic networks across Africa. Mr Kuleba has now made four African tours. And while his campaign to earn goodwill and build partnerships south of the Sahara has not always advanced without a hitch - hopes of being received by President Cyril Ramaphosa during a visit to South Africa late last year were disappointed - there have also been important successes. Zambia, for example, attended the Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland in June and, unlike some other participants, did sign the final communiqué (whose terms satisfied Kyiv). And last week Mr Kuleba visited the Zambian capital, Lusaka, where he was received by President Hakainde Hichilema. In reaching out to African countries now, Ukraine is seeking to make up for the diplomatic ground lost during the first three decades after its independence when it was largely preoccupied with its internal affairs. While Russia inherited the worldwide diplomatic presence of the old Soviet Union, newly independent nations such as Ukraine had to build up their networks from scratch. With limited resources, over 30 years Kyiv managed to open only eight embassies across the entire African continent - in Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa. But after being so uncomfortably reminded in 2022 of the need to win friends and influence people, Kyiv is pushing rapidly to expand its coverage, aiming to build a 20-embassy African network, with the first 10 extra missions already announced. April saw Kyiv’s special envoy for the Middle East and Africa, Maksym Soubkh, in Abidjan to open the embassy in Ivory Coast. And Kyiv is proposing more than diplomatic co-operation. Eight sub-Saharan countries have already benefitted from its “Grain from Ukraine” food aid initiative. It also plans to build up its development assistance, strengthen two-way trade and provide more university places for African students. Contentious military adventures targeting Russian mercenaries look an ill-judged risk that could jeopardise all the diplomatic goodwill and economic returns that Ukraine hopes to gain from its broad-based positive sub-Saharan strategy.

economic indicators,East v West - Germany's drug-fuelled Cold War for medals,2024-09-15,2024-08-19,Olivier Guiberteau,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/crlrn9re3z5o,"East v West - Germany's drug-fuelled Cold War for medals ""These are all harmless drugs. All athletes take them. It's really nothing special."" That was what German heptathlete Birgit Dressel, who finished ninth in the 1984 Olympic Games, once told her mother. Sadly, those words couldn't have been further from the truth. On 8 April 1987, after taking medication to help with a bad back, Dressel's body went into allergic-toxic shock, leading to rapid organ failure.  After two days of agony in Mainz hospital, she died at the age of 26. Her autopsy revealed traces of more than 100 drugs in her system, including anabolic steroids that she had been taking for years, while her medical history showed she had been injected with at least 40 different substances throughout her career, with one practitioner alone administering 400 injections. During her final years, she became heavily reliant on prescription drugs to compete and live pain-free. Her tortuous training regime had pushed her body to the brink, and by the time of her death, she was experiencing hip pain, lateral bending of the spinal column, damage to the discs and fusion of the spinal vertebrae, displacement of the pelvis, degeneration of both kneecaps and sunken arches in her feet.  To combat the pain, she was reportedly taking nine pills a day, as well as additional drugs administered by three separate doctors. Dressel's demise was a harrowing example of how far humans will go to keep up, but her story had much broader implications. After the reunification of Germany in 1990, a treasure trove of documents held by the then-defunct East German secret police, the Stasi, revealed what many had suspected for decades: East Germany had conducted a state-sponsored, systematic doping operation that led to spectacular sporting success. As the sordid details were gradually revealed, Western European nations appeared vindicated.  Allegations of East Germany doping, along with other Soviet satellite states, had increased dramatically throughout the 1980s. Here was confirmation the other side had been cheating all along. However, the narrative was not quite so simple. The division between 'clean' and 'dirty' athletes was not as well-defined as the line that had cut Germany in half for nearly 50 years. Dressel, born in Bremen and living in Mainz, was not from East Germany but from the West. While they would take decades to emerge, West German sport had its own secrets. Ines Geipel (far left, bib number 166) competing in 1985. On the far right, in bib number seven, is Marita Koch, another East German athlete whose 39-year-old 400m record still stands today ""From the 1970s onwards, East Germany began winning a lot of medals. West German politicians started worrying about it and spreading the message that West German athletes needed to win medals too,"" says Letizia Paoli, who chaired the 2009 committee investigating West German doping activity at the University of Freiburg. ""They couldn't afford to look worse than the East. Medals were seen as an indicator of political and economic success."" The East German doping system was comprehensive, systematic and all-encompassing. Stasi files revealed that an initially amateurish doping programme was transformed in 1974 by an innocuous-sounding piece of policy called State Research Plan 14.25. It mandated doping across all sports with the potential to deliver Olympic glory. Thousands of athletes, some as young as 12, were shovelled through a programme where cheating was a prerequisite. ""The training regime was really tough. We trained three times a day, and when we weren't training we did physiotherapy, sauna and yoga to recover. We were like well-bred horses waiting to race,"" says Ines Geipel, a former East German athlete and author of a book, Behind The Wall, which details her experience in Cold War East Germany. ""As young people, sport was the only way for us to see the world - to get out. ""We were given various tablets in silver foil, but there was no information about them, just that they were good to take because we sweated so much while competing."" Thanks to recovered documents, Geipel now knows she was primarily being given an anabolic steroid called oral turinabol. Refusals or questioning led to the withdrawal of athletic sponsorship and a black mark against your name in Stasi files. That, in turn, could affect your chances of gaining employment, housing or benefits. Geipel felt the full weight of the Stasi when officials uncovered her plans to defect and remain in Los Angeles after the 1984 Olympics to be with a Mexican athlete she had fallen in love with. After returning to East Germany, the Stasi turned the screw, she was expelled from sport and, for many of her compatriots, became a social pariah. ""If you escaped, you were seen as a traitor,"" said Geipel. ""Firstly, they wanted to find a man in the GDR [East Germany] who looked like the Mexican I'd fallen in love with. ""They thought if I met a man who looked like the Mexican, then everything would be good again. There wasn't such a man. ""Then they tried to force me to commit to the Stasi. But I didn't do it. ""The last stage, when they didn't see any other option, was to operate on me and cut through my stomach. ""It's all in the files... they cut the stomach in such a way, through all the muscles and everything so that I couldn't run any more and didn't have a way of getting to the rest of the world any more."" In August 1989, she fled to the West via Hungary after crawling across the heavily-defended border. Geipel, pictured in 2014, asked for her name to be removed from the German record books after she was part of a quartet who set a national 4x100m record. An asterisk now appears in its place It is possible to pick up the threads of Germany's recent doping past and follow them back decades. Plenty lead to the Western side of the Cold War. The day before the 2006 Tour de France,  a doping scandal exploded. German rider Jan Ullrich, the 1997 Tour winner and one of that year's favourites, was sitting on a bus on the way to a press conference when he received the news that his world was about to come down around him. Operation Puerto, an investigation by Spanish police into doping in sport, had connected him to illegal blood transfusion.  The investigation's details were scandalous: Manolo Saiz, the directeur sportif of the Liberty Seguros–Wurth team, was arrested with a briefcase of cash in Madrid. The Spaniard was never charged, but neither did he ever return to the top level of professional cycling.  Elsewhere a fridge filled with 186 blood bags, labelled with codenames belonging to athletes, was discovered at doctor Eufemiano Fuentes' clinic, along with complex machines to manipulate and transfuse blood. Investigations into his German-based T Mobile team later uncovered more than a decade's worth of doping starting in the early 1990s, when it was known as Telekom. Ullrich, seen here in the wake of his 2006 suspension from the Tour de France, has said that not blood doping during his era would have been ""like going to a gunfight armed only with a knife"" Two team doctors, Andreas Schmid and Lothar Heinrich, admitted their involvement in long-term doping. ""I made available to cyclists, upon request, drug substances, especially EPO [erythropoietin, a hormone that causes the body to make more red blood cells],"" said Schmid, claiming in his defence that he had never doped an unwitting athlete. Both men came from one university department: the University Medical Center Freiburg, in south-west Germany, just 20 miles from the French border. The University of Freiburg responded by forming an independent committee to look into historic doping allegations. The first commission was quickly dissolved due to health reasons, while Paoli, an Italian criminologist, was asked to chair the second and head a six-strong team of investigators. She accepted, but her and her team's relationship with the university soon deteriorated. All six of the investigators resigned in protest at the lack of cooperation from the university and its departments, but ultimately did publish an independent report. It painted a damning picture of decades of doping by medics based at Freiburg. Two men were cited as key players: professors Joseph Keul and Armin Klumper. From the 1960s onwards, Keul, who died in 2000, was the superstar physician in Germany, working with scores of top-level athletes and acting for more than 20 years as head physician of the German Olympic team. Keul started providing medical care for West German Olympic teams in 1960 Klumper joined Freiburg in the mid-1960s, initially as a medical assistant, before becoming head of sports traumatology. ""Unlike in East Germany, where it was a top-down doping system, in the West, much of it was outsourced to Freiburg,"" says Paoli. According to sources seen by the commission, as many as 90% of West German track and field athletes during the 1970s and 1980s passed through Freiburg - though how many doped may never be known.  What is clear is that Keul and Klumper played vital roles in West Germany's and then Germany's sporting successes. ""The athletes loved Klumper. He was excellent with his diagnostics and would go to the track and field to spend a lot of time with them, while Keul was more hands-off,"" says Paoli. Evidence of Klumper's involvement in doping is staggering. His infamous 'Klumper cocktails' were referenced multiple times during interviews with ex-athletes. ""These were mixtures of off-label medicines, prescription medicines, doping products and natural remedies that were supposedly tailored to individual athletes' needs,"" says Paoli. One such athlete was Dressel, who visited Klumper regularly for treatment. Her last visit to Freiburg came on 24 February 1987 - less than three months before her death - where he reportedly gave her a cocktail containing 15 substances. By the late 1980s, numerous West German sporting figures, including discus thrower Alwin Wagner, external and sprinter Manfred Ommer,, external were openly linking Klumper, who died in 2019, with historic doping. Yet he also had his supporters. Even as his name began to sink under further allegations in 1997, a passionate defence was published in a national newspaper, signed by some major names in German sport at the time, including gymnast Eberhard Gienger, decathlete Jurgen Hingsen and footballer Wolfgang Overath. Gienger subsequently admitted in 2006 that he had taken anabolic steroids, external during his career, saying he doped to aid his recovery after an operation and that Klumper ""prescribed very generously"".  Hingsen insisted in 2016 that Klumper and Keul had never offered him anything illicit, external. Overath has since described any suggestion of doping during his time in elite sport as 'absurd'., external Hingsen in discussion with Klumper (right) in the summer of 1988. Hingsen committed three false starts in the 100m - the opening event of the competition - in the Olympic decathlon in Seoul later that year, ending his hopes of a medal Olympic medal-winning hammer thrower Uwe Beyer presented a prescription for steroids bearing Keul's name, but, overall, direct evidence linking Klumper's colleague with doping was less widespread. Keul instead worked to undermine the growing evidence of the health risks of drug misuse and the anti-doping system designed to catch cheats. In 1976, he gave an interview explaining how he justified his stance to himself and others. ""Where is it written that we should prevent harm?"" Keul said to German broadcaster ZDF. ""That is a general medical task, but it has nothing to do with sports medicine."" For him, healthy sportspeople gambling on performance enhancement was a separate branch of medicine, one where the usual considerations did not apply. In 1992, with public funds drying up after the end of the Cold War, Keul began taking large amounts from external sources, including Deutsche Telekom's cycling team, which later became T-Mobile. The narrative of a virtuous West Germany emerging victorious from sport's Cold War was dented when T-Mobile and Keul's Freiburg colleagues were caught up in the Tour de France doping scandal in 2006. In August 2013, it was fatally shattered. Alwin Wagner finished sixth at the Los Angeles 1984 Olympics, but said Armin Klumper stopped doping him after those Games as he continued to criticise and question the drugs regimes that West Germany's elite athletes undertook A report commissioned by the German Ministry of Sport and carried out by researchers at Humboldt University in Berlin and the University of Munster - Leaks from Doping in Germany from 1950 to Today - appeared in various German newspapers. The report was heavily redacted because of legal and privacy concerns, but was clear enough in its claim that doping was widespread on both sides of the Cold War divide and had continued after reunification. The revelations on West German doping landed like a bombshell, with the reverberations travelling around the world. The report alleged that West Germany's shock comeback win over Hungary in the 1954 World Cup final - a game often called 'The Miracle of Bern' - had been powered by pervitin, an energy-boosting methamphetamine. The drug had been studied in depth for its doping qualities at Freiburg during the 1950s. Questions were also raised over West Germany's 1966 World Cup, in which they reached the final but lost to England 4-2. The report revealed that a letter from Fifa official Mihailo Andrejevic informed the president of the German Athletics Association, Max Danz, that ""fine traces"" of ephedrine - a central nervous system stimulant - were found in three players of the German national team.  No action was taken and some have speculated that the players may have consumed the ephedrine in a cold medicine. By the time of the 1972 and 1976 Olympics, in Munich and Montreal respectively, organised doping was common among West Germany's elite athletes, the report added. While most of Germany's sports federations agreed to take part and share documentation, according to the report, it was notable that the country's athletic association refused to hand over the minutes of its presidential meetings, while ""a former president of the federation was unwilling to allow access to doping-related documents in his possession"". The report also states that the German Football Association only offered the researchers access under ultimately unacceptable conditions, while the security services refused access to potential doping-related documents from both West and East Germany. Over a decade later, the initial report, even with redactions, is only available as a physical copy by request to the German government.  The Federal Institute for Sports Science (BISp) said the 804-page initial report did not ""meet the requirements of good scientific work in form and content"" and requested that it was revised. A later, 43-page version has been made available more publicly., external The University of Freiburg told BBC Sport it was ""committed to the consistent, unreserved and transparent clarification of the past surrounding Freiburg sports medicine"" and described the resignation of Paoli and her team of investigators and their failure to deliver a final report in conjunction with it as ""very regrettable"". The university has made some parts of the team's provisional work available online., external Germany announced in July, external that it intends to bid to host the 2040 Olympic and Paralympic Games. If successful, the event would mark 50 years since reunification. But, like the future, the country's past is contested. The Cold War had its victor, and victors often have the freedom to mould history and storylines as they see fit. Yet West Germany's secrets have, at least partially, emerged to change the script. East Germany doped its athletes on a chillingly industrial level that saw thousands drugged without clear consent to gain a sporting upper hand - but the situation in the West was far less opaque. Those in West Germany were afforded freedom beyond the wildest dreams of East Germans, but it is becoming increasingly clear that many chose exactly the same methods as the enemy.  For some, in the battle for Cold War medals, anything to gain an advantage was fair game.

economic indicators,Women's World Cup can make Essex major hub - Feist,2024-09-15,2024-07-11,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/crgrqjq9n51o,"Chelmsford has been Essex's official home ground since 1967, having first staged a County Championship match in 1926 The new general manager of Essex, Dan Feist, believes if they are chosen to host Women's World Cup games in 2026, it will be key to further establishing the county as a major cricket hub. England and Wales were chosen to host the expanded 12-team tournament two years ago, but the grounds which will stage matches have yet to be confirmed. Feist stepped up into the general manager role as part of a restructure that will see chief executive John Stephenson leave Chelmsford at the end of the season. ""Our purpose is that we want to be the number one cricket region and there's plenty of potential measurements you can take at the moment that show that we're in a good position for that,"" Feist told BBC Essex Sport.  Dan Feist: We need to ensure we're in a position to adapt to the future demands of sport and entertainment Essex CEO Stephenson to leave at end of season ""Obviously the number one thing we're in conversation with the city and county councils for is making sure this is a hub for the future and how do we make sure that Chelmsford has another hundred years of playing cricket on it?  ""A big part will be, in the next few months, our application to try to host Women's World Cup games here in 2026.  ""Like any major event that comes over to this country now, it's not just about the venue, it's about the engagement, the opportunity, the aspiration and the economic viability and everything around that in terms of the region and the reach."" Essex have been one of the most successful clubs in the 21st century. They became county champions in 2017 and 2019 - also completing a double five years ago by also winning the T20 Blast - and have won four other trophies. The county have been chosen as one of eight to host a fully professional women's team as part of a major restructure of the domestic game next year - another indicator of the health of the club. ""With the growth in terms of population, the diversity of the region in a number of different areas, it is a vital hub for the country in terms of the ECB's [England and Wales Cricket Board] ambition to be the most inclusive sport and we've got plenty of examples of how we can impact that,"" he said. ""As the game grows and the aspirations around that, we need to be making sure we're making the most of those unique selling points to us - which is a large part of the UK population is living in this area and there's a huge passion for the game."""
economic indicators,Ireland to increase public spending by almost 7%,2024-09-15,2024-07-09,John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yql430l5o,"The Irish government says it will increase spending on public services by almost 7% in its pre-election budget. In 2021 the government set a rule which said that public spending should grow by no more than 5% a year. It says it will break that rule partially because the population of the Irish Republic has grown faster than anticipated. Finance Minister Jack Chambers said: ""There remains the continuing need to improve public services and infrastructure, particularly in the context of a growing population and economy. ""The government has adapted its fiscal strategy to take account of this, to support the continued delivery of better healthcare services as well as accommodate higher capital spending."" The details are contained in the Summer Economic Statement which sets out the parameters for October’s budget. It will be the last budget before the election, which must be held before the end of March. The overall budget package will be worth €8.3bn (£7bn), consisting of €6.9bn (£5.82bn) of spending and €1.4bn (£1.18bn) of taxation measures. Day-to-day spending will increase by 6.4%, while infrastructure and investment spending will rise by 10.6%. There will also be an additional €1.5bn (£1.27bn) for the health service this year. Last week it emerged that the Irish Department of Health was already anticipating a €1.1bn (£845m) overspend this year. The public expenditure minister, Paschal Donohoe, said more than €5bn (£4.22m) of the additional spending is to cover ‘existing level of service’ requirements and includes the cost of pay deals and decisions already taken on infrastructure projects. About €1.8bn (£1.52) will be for new measures to be announced in the budget."
economic indicators,"Marked rise in NI business activity, says survey",2024-09-15,2024-07-09,Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5x413z2w0o,"Northern Ireland's private sector saw its order books grow at the fastest level in more than two years in June, according to a survey by Ulster Bank. Every month, the bank asks firms from across the private sector about staffing levels, order books and exports in what is considered a reliable indicator of economic performance. It suggests new orders increased at the fastest pace since February 2022, feeding through to what it described as a ""marked rise"" in business activity. However, the rate of job creation was modest, amid some reports of difficulties sourcing new staff. Ulster Bank chief economist in Northern Ireland Richard Ramsey said it showed Northern Ireland's private sector was in a much better condition than it had been in January. ""New order growth in Northern Ireland was the strongest of the 12 UK regions in June,"" he said. The survey considers four sectors of the economy - services, retail, construction and manufacturing. The bright spot in June was manufacturing, with output and orders growing at their fastest rate in more than two years. But despite this demand, Mr Ramsey said staffing levels fell for the third month in a row, with manufacturers citing recruitment difficulties and challenges replacing those leaving the industry, which was constraining capacity to meet growing demand. “The latest figures have been compiled in the mouth of a general election. But the private sector, like households, eagerly awaits announcements from the next government,"" he said. ""An emergency budget is expected, the only questions are when, and what will be in it?”"
economic indicators,Finding the 'missing middle' of small businesses,2024-09-15,2024-07-10,Kieron Johnson,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240710-shamina-singh-mastercard-small-business-bbc-executive-interview,"Today in the Executive Lounge, one global firm's innovative solutions to the universal problem of small businesses struggling to survive. The small business sector has a big problem. It's called the ""missing middle"", which refers to the gap in provision of financial services and support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These businesses are seemingly caught between a rock and a hard place – they're too big to qualify for microfinance and too small to be eligible for regular bank loans. Consequently, 67% of SMEs worldwide are fighting for survival, according to the World Economic Forum. A number of international finance institutions, most notably the World Bank, have attempted to close the funding gap, so far with mixed results. This is despite adopting a dual-pronged approach, which includes helping to make SMEs more attractive for investment and liaising with financial institutions in an effort to boost lending. But the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development says the success of any international organisation aiming to bridge the financial services gap in a particular region hinges on having a strong local presence there, which can understand and meet the needs of SMEs effectively. Perhaps surprisingly, Mastercard has stepped up to meet this hyperlocal need. Contrary to popular opinion, Mastercard isn't a credit card company. It doesn't extend credit to consumers or issue them with credit cards. In fact, the company's main function is to process payments. Mastercard has always put financial inclusion at the top of its agenda, Shamina Singh, the company's executive vice president of sustainability says. Singh is responsible for, among other things, developing and implementing environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy across the company. ""As the global economy becomes increasingly digitised, one challenge we face is to ensure that new, technology-driven ways of storing, lending, saving, sending and investing money are designed for inclusion, especially for small businesses,"" says Singh. Singh highlights Mastercard's Inclusive Growth Score, a tool that provides local financial institutions with a clear view of a particular community's social and economic indicators so they can reliably predict if a small business will thrive there. ""We work closely with our colleagues on the ground in a particular region, so we can better understand if there are viable market opportunities there, and the regulatory environment is supportive of building up small businesses.” Mastercard's Strive small business programme is one solution that's emerged from this research. Executive Lounge The BBC's series features interviews with executive leaders making innovative, data-driven decisions helping shape the future of business – and paving the path for other leaders to thrive. Read more conversations here. Designed to address the transition to the digital economy necessitated by Covid-19, which disproportionately affected businesses led by women and ethnic minorities, Strive helps small businesses access the tools and resources they need to digitise. Strive is intended to be a hand-in-glove fit for businesses of all kinds and all around the world – some 'graduates' include Sparkle Lighting, a lighting design company in the heart of the UK, and Kelsie Kay's Coffee Depot situated on a Native American reservation in South Dakota. ""When we launched our first Strive programme, the financing gap for small businesses was $930bn (£743bn) in low and lower-middle-income countries,"" Singh explains.""Globally, this figure was $5.2tn (£4.15tn) annually."" Singh talks to the BBC about the progress made to shrink that disparity – and the work still to be done – to ensure small businesses worldwide have what they need, and a vibrant 'middle' can once again be found. What inspired the launch of this small business initiative in 2021? When seeking credit, some of the small business community falls between the cracks. We call them the ""missing middle"" [and] they often lack funds to grow.  In addition, digitalisation emerged as a survival tool during the pandemic, enabling small businesses to remain in operation during lockdowns. But not all businesses benefitted equally from the shift to digital. Covid-19 quickly exposed deep inequalities and tested the resilience of small businesses – especially those operating in the cash economy.   The shift to digital has been uneven, and too many small businesses are still unable to benefit from, or fully participate in, the growing digital economy. Even before the pandemic, small businesses were falling behind their larger competitors in terms of integrating digital technologies into their operations. We developed Strive to help build the resilience of small businesses by helping them go digital, get capital and access networks and know-how.  What role does data play in steering the programme? Before launching each Strive programme, we conduct thorough market analysis to understand the unique issues and [the] needs micro and small businesses face in that particular market. For example, before launching Strive UK, we conducted quantitative research with over 1,000 small businesses in the UK in addition to a listening tour across the UK with in-depth qualitative interviews with expert organisations supporting SMEs across the public and private sectors.   Our data-driven approach enables us to monitor our programmes' efficiency and iterate as needed. What criteria does the programme use to determine which countries, territories and regions to prioritise? We have Strive programmes in multiple markets, from Czechia to the UK. Before we launch a programme in a particular region, we assess what that market and its small business owners need, which may be unique to that area. After all, different markets have different needs. One example is Strive Women, which covers countries such as Pakistan, Vietnam and Peru. Our research shows that, in these regions, men have greater access to productive assets and influence over familial decision-making. For instance, in Pakistan, only 33% of male entrepreneurs have had to seek their family's permission before starting their business while nearly 60% of female entrepreneurs felt the need to obtain their family's approval, mainly from their father or husband. Contrast this with Strive USA. Small businesses - which are defined as those with 500 employees or fewer - comprise 99% of all businesses in the US and employ more than 60 million people. Yet, despite their importance, half of these new businesses will fail within five years – often because they can't access the capital, tools and networks they need to stay afloat. These challenges disproportionally affect underserved businesses and help explain the huge racial wealth gap that exists between white and minority-owned small business owners. Mastercard by the numbers $74 million: Mastercard Impact Fund grants supported work in 54 countries across financial security, small business growth, impact data science and community support. 37 million: Women entrepreneurs provided with solutions that can help them grow their businesses. $511 million: Invested in Black communities across the US since 2020, to help close the racial wealth and opportunity gap. $2 million: Mastercard Strive Innovation Fund 2.0 grants were awarded to 11 organisations. 13 million: Small businesses brought into the digital economy in 2023 through card acceptance technology. *Source: Mastercard ESG report (2023). Is there one small business success story that stands out? In Vietnam, we worked with Luu Thi Hoa, the founder of an agricultural cooperative [in the city of Ha Giang]. Hoa started her business in 2017, mainly offline, selling Ha Giang specialties such as honey, herbs and vegetables to tourists. She joined our Ignite program in 2021 with training in financial management, digital marketing, art therapy (to manage stress) and business planning. Hoa was selected to receive seed funding which she used to fine-tune her packaging and join another online marketing course with a focus on e-commerce platforms sales techniques. During our latest conversation with Hoa, she shared that her business grew by 10 to 15% over the last two years.  More like this: • Cisco: Bridging the digital divide • UPS: The road to carbon neutrality • Intuit: Astrophysics to the office What opportunities do you see on the horizon for small businesses, and how will Mastercard capitalise on them? Digital is a big opportunity. We created a social enterprise called Farm Pass, which provides a digital marketplace for farmers to access larger markets and negotiate a fair price for their produce. We worked with farmers [for example tomato farmers in India] to create a new type of network that allows them to engage with each other, and the benefits to farmers are clear.

economic indicators,The superbugs lurking in seas and rivers,2024-09-15,2024-07-13,Anna Turns,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240709-why-cleaning-sewage-out-of-uk-waterways-could-stop-amr-superbugs,"Drug-resistant superbugs are on the rise, prompting researchers and campaigners in the UK to call for a water system clean-up. I'm a goggles-on, face-underwater kind of swimmer, yet these days I hesitate before I dip my head beneath the surface of the sea. In recent years, increasingly frequent spills have released millions of hours-worth of untreated sewage into UK rivers and coastal water. The immediate health risks are numerous: exposure can lead to acute sickness, ear infections or a tummy upset. But that's not all – there's another potential health hazard lurking in those polluted waters. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) develops when the genetic codes of pathogens, including bacteria present in sewage, mutate to resist medicines designed to control infections. Infections caused by the resulting drug-resistant pathogens, sometimes referred to as ""superbugs"", are estimated to be directly linked to 1.27 million deaths each year and the UK's special envoy on antimicrobial resistance, Dame Sally Davies, has called this threat ""a global antibiotic emergency"". By 2050, AMR could cause 10 million deaths annually, according to the UN Environment Programme. The World Health Organization (WHO) labels AMR a ""silent pandemic"" because it's a serious threat to public health globally – yet it's not often talked about by the media or policymakers. Untreated sewage is one possible avenue for AMR's spread. And once untreated sewage pollution containing AMR reaches the environment, people – including swimmers like me – can be exposed. But while sewage spills regularly make headlines, AMR often gets overlooked. So behind the scenes, scientists are working hard to quantify which sources of AMR are the most dangerous and which solutions could be the most effective to reduce the spread of AMR. Not only in the UK, but globally too.     Curious about whether I have ingested any AMR, I'm getting tested to check whether my guts have been colonised by a particular type of antibiotic resistant E. coli. A quick, simple and not-so-glamorous screening test involves sending a faeces sample off in the post to Elitsa Penkova, an evolutionary microbiologist at the University of Exeter in the UK. As part of her PhD, she's coordinating the Poo-Sticks project to assess the link between sewage pollution in UK rivers and antimicrobial resistance in swimmers and non-swimmers – by analysing poo samples from 300 people. While I wait for my results, Penkova explains that humans don't metabolise antibiotic medicines well: ""Up to 70% of these antibiotics can be excreted via urine and faeces"", so some get unknowingly flushed away down the toilet. Sewage pollution includes effluent from waste water treatment plants, combined sewer overflows that discharge raw sewage into waterways when the system becomes overloaded, such as during heavy rainfall, and septic tanks. Hospital wastewater is another source of antibiotics. And around half of all the world's antibiotics are used on farms, so agricultural run-off is a major concern. Antimicrobial residues end up in soil, river sediment, waterways and oceans. A new water quality report from environmental charity Earthwatch Europe concludes that 75% of the UK's rivers are in poor ecological health.

""Polluted rivers offer favourable conditions for the emergence, spread and maintenance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria,"" says Penkova, whose research follows the University of Exeter's 2018 Beach Bums study, conducted in collaboration with Surfers Against Sewage, an environmental non-profit campaigning for cleaner, safer waters. During this research, comparisons of faecal samples from UK surfers with people who don't go in the sea showed a strong association between water users and AMR. Guts of surfers were about three times more likely to harbour antibiotic-resistant E. coli – a bacteria listed as a priority pathogen by WHO that grows in the presence of cefotaxime, a common antibiotic – than non-surfers' guts. Researchers also found that surfers swallow up to 10 times more water than sea swimmers so could potentially be more vulnerable to ingesting antibiotic resistant bacteria. However, a 2023 Irish study found that coastal swimmers were less likely than non-swimmers to carry antibiotic resistant bacteria in their guts. Those results contradicted the Beach Bums results, possibly because swimmers swallow smaller volumes of water than surfers, suggests Penkova. Polluted rivers aren't a threat solely to swimmers and surfers. ""There are many ways you might ingest AMR,"" says Giles Bristow, chief executive of environmental non-profit Surfers Against Sewage (SAS). ""Some people might paddle or walk into the water after their dog – if they have a cut on their foot, for example, AMR might get into the bloodstream. Polluted water can also get into your ears, eyes or mouth."" While carrying AMR doesn't necessarily make someone poorly, and that bacteria can be excreted without causing problems for healthy people, continuous exposure does increase the risk that AMR gets passed on to someone more vulnerable to infection. ""It's a nasty bug,"" says Penkova. ""It's hard to prevent [serious illness] because these superbugs are easily transmissible and there are limited treatment options for AMR infections – antibiotics simply won't work. That's the biggest concern."" Currently, when rivers and coasts are monitored by government authorities (the Environment Agency in England, Natural Resources in Wales, and Scotland's Environment Protection Agency) for sewage, levels of just two prevalent bacteria – E. coli and intestinal enterococci – are measured because they are well-studied and predictable. Yet these indicators only give a snapshot view of river health status and subsequent risk of AMR spread, as Bristow explains: ""There are thousands of different species of increasingly antimicrobial resistant bacteria that are pathogenic. Our sewage system is a breeding ground for AMR,"" he says.   Wastewater is a major contributor to AMR. Treatment plants act as both a sink and a hotspot because it's where bacteria from faecal material are removed, whether they carry resistance genes or not. It's also where those bacteria mix with other bacteria naturally present in the activated sludge flocs (a gel-like material covered with masses of microbes that biodegrade organic material and filter out most pathogens). The high nutrient concentrations  on these flocs mean that bacteria reproduce quickly and genes, including those for antibiotic resistance, can transfer faster. Jan-Ulrich Kreft, associate professor in computational biology at the University of Birmingham in the UK, studies the complexities of wastewater treatment plants and aims to quantify the pathways of transmission of AMR through the environment. ""We don't yet know whether the run-off from cows or manure spread on fields is as significant as the human sewage pathway. Once we know that, we can prioritise interventions and gauge progress from that baseline."" ""Wastewater treatment plants remove all bacteria – and their resistance genes – by about 100-fold as a rough rule of thumb,"" says Kreft who explains that untreated sewage is always significantly worse that treated sewage. In the UK, all human sewage gets treated except effluent released via combined sewer overflows (often but not always during rainy weather), or sewage that leaks out of holes or cracks in the old, often Victorian, pipes. Nobody knows exactly how much untreated sewage gets spilled but one study calculated that 11 billion litres (2.4 billion gallons) of untreated sewage was discharged from just 30 UK wastewater treatment plants in 2020 – equivalent to the volume of 4,352 Olympic-sized swimming pools. For that reason, Kreft argues that the installation of volume metres at storm overflows should be a legal requirement: something recommended by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee, but left out of the 2021 Environment Act. A little AMR can also remain in treated effluent and E. coli is one of the bacteria that doesn't bind to the sludge flocs – instead it flows through the system and out into the waterways. In developing countries the situation can be much worse, Kreft says. In India's Musi River, where only about 20% of sewage gets treated because the population is growing faster than treatment plants can be built, urban rivers are full of raw sewage.  ""Treatment plant effluent is actually cleaner than the polluted river water,"" says Kreft.   AMR is a mobile entity, moving around the globe via shipping and tourism – so improving wastewater treatment in developing countries would help tackle the AMR issue in the UK, says Kreft. In fact, the UK government recently pledged £85m ($108m) to support international efforts to improve access to antimicrobial drugs in Africa and monitoring of AMR globally. ""It's a global problem – people travelling from countries in Southeast Asia are likely to return with resistant bacteria in their gut,"" says Kreft. ""Airplane toilets are full of AMR and these resistant bacteria can stay in the gut for a few months. It might not be a problem, but if you get ill and take a course of antibiotics, then you're selecting for resistant bacteria. If resistant genes transfer to the pathogen causing your infection, the medicine won't work."" In 2022, scientists at the University of York in the UK led a global project monitoring pharmaceuticals that carried out the first worldwide investigation of medicinal contamination in the environment. Of 258 rivers across the globe tested for 61 pharmaceuticals, a quarter tested positive for some, including commonly used antibiotics, at high enough concentrations to drive the evolution of AMR. The AMR problem is also forecast to worsen as the growing world population puts greater demand on existing sewerage infrastructure and increases the need for more wastewater treatment plants. Climate change-induced extreme weather is a threat multiplier too. During droughts, sewage in waterways becomes more concentrated, while floods increase the run-off from agricultural land and overwhelm sewers, causing raw effluent to divert into rivers. Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. ""When rivers flow fast, some bacteria in the river sediment become resuspended and released back into the water column, so it's a good idea not to swim in rivers after heavy rainfall,"" warns Kleft. Rising temperatures have an effect too. Bacteria grow more quickly in warmer sediment or water and a 2018 US study found that an increase of 10C (18F) is consistently associated with increased levels of AMR in common pathogenic bacteria.  In the UK, however, there are growing calls for a sewage-system clean up. In 2023, 1,924 people reported getting ill after entering UK waters, as outlined in SAS' latest water quality report.  According to Bristow, ""about 60% of those cases were in bathing waters classified as 'excellent'; the places that we encourage people to go in and swim"". Bristow says his non-profit is pushing for an independent inquiry into the issue of sewage pollution and widespread lack of water quality monitoring. ""[AMR] is not a future threat – it's a now threat and our waste treatment systems are absolutely central to building resilience,” he says. According to a spokesperson for Water UK, the trade association for water and wastewater companies, research shows that wastewater treatment works ""are effective"" at removing AMR genes and organisms from effluent. Water companies have also proposed prices hikes to fund further investment in infrastructure, including treatment works, some of which the industry's economic regulator Ofwat has approved. Countries with advanced AMR monitoring strategies, such as Iceland, Finland and Slovenia, also have some of the cleanest waterways in Europe. So one solution, Bristow suggests is to better resource the UK Environment Agency – the government department monitoring water quality. ""There's a huge lack of monitoring so we don't really understand what's in our rivers and coastal waters,"" he warns. According to the UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), both its department and the Environment Agency are also part of a £24m ($31m) Treasury-funded pathogen surveillance in agriculture, food and environment (Path-Safe) programme. This aims to detect and track pathogens and associated AMR through the food and water system, and has been trialling new approaches for environmental surveillance. More like this: • The unnatural impacts of natural gas • How unhealthy air changes body and mind • Parisians save 'le pipi' to help the Seine ""I don't think people realise how urgent this is….it's not something we often talk about because it's unpleasant and scary,"" says Penkova, who wants policymakers to urgently prioritise this issue and tackle systemic antibiotic overuse in both the medical sector and industrial agriculture.   But there are also steps individuals can take too, she adds: ""The first step is to avoid overusing antibiotics, always finish a course of medicine and stop wasting antibiotics"". Furthermore, the development of new, targeted antibiotics is another frontier in AMR prevention, with some signs of promise. Microbiologists at Queen's University Belfast recently identified how a bacteria protects itself from the effects of antibiotics and this could lead to novel drug development in the future. Meanwhile, chemists at King's College London have discovered a way to speed up the production of new antibiotics. Researchers at the University of Stirling in Scotland are also developing a new, low-cost system for monitoring freshwater quality that uses innovative sensor technology and artificial intelligence to flag polluted waters. After a few days, Penkova gets in touch with the results of my E. coli test. My sample doesn't show any evidence of AMR which is good news…for now. A person's gut microbiome is dynamic – it fluctuates depending on the food and drink they consume, the people they interact with and the places they visit. But Penkova doesn't want to put people off swimming: ""I want to empower people to become more informed and call for change to clean up our waterways,"" she says.  While confirmed presence of E. coli cannot be definitively linked to the waters someone swims in, scientists like Penkova are working hard to quantify those links and encourage greater antimicrobial stewardship within healthcare and farming – that begins with doctors and vets only prescribing antibiotics when essential and appropriate, so not as a preventative measure or to treat viral infections that won't respond to antibacterial drugs. On a personal level, I'll definitely be avoiding any default use of antibiotics unless absolutely necessary and I'm going to do my best to avoid exposure to AMR in the environment too. I will be checking for pollution forecasts more carefully via the SAS safer seas and rivers service app, I definitely won't be swimming in rivers or coastal waters after heavy rainfall, and I'm taking the unused antibiotics in my bathroom cabinet back to my local pharmacy to be disposed of safely. -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

economic indicators,What happens when hurricanes rapidly intensify,2024-09-15,2024-07-02,Lucy Sherriff,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230911-what-a-record-breaking-hurricane-looks-like,"Hurricane Beryl, the first category five storm of 2024, marks an intense start to the Atlantic hurricane season. And it could be a sign of what is to come. Hurricane Beryl, a category five storm, is the first hurricane of 2024 and the earliest category five storm in the Atlantic ever recorded by the US's National Hurricane Center. The storm is unusual in more ways than one. Beryl strengthened from a tropical depression into a major hurricane – category three or above – in only 42 hours. It was classified as a category four storm within 48 hours, before swelling into a categery five storm as it headed towards Jamaica. ""It's rare to see a storm rapidly intensify this fast, this early in the season, in this part of the Atlantic,"" AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Forecaster Alex DaSilva told BBC News. And some experts fear it could be an ""alarming"" indication of what may be to come as the season progresses. The arrival of such a powerful hurricane in June has been attributed to the unusually high ocean temperatures, with the heat content of the seas around the Caribbean being more like the levels seen in mid-September rather than early summer, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). It follows more than a year of record-breaking ocean temperatures.  The ""unprecedented"" growth in the strength of Beryl so early in the hurricane season ""is in line with the recent trend towards very rapid intensification"", says the WMO. And this increase in hurricane intensity is a harbinger of the future, according to Jeff Masters, a meteorologist at Yale Climate Connections (a Yale University-funded climate media forum) and former NOAA scientist. ""We should expect more cases of rapid intensification as the climate continues to warm."" Other recent hurricanes have intensified even more rapidly, all of which makes them hard to predict and prepare for. In 2023, Hurricane Lee brought large swells and ferocious winds to batter the Caribbean islands. Experts saw the storm undergo a rapid change – quickly and unexpectedly intensifying into the highest category five strength. This dangerous pattern of hurricane behaviour is thought to be a sign of what's to come as the world's oceans warm up. The hurricane, which reached 160mph (258km/h) winds on 8 September 2023, was a category one storm on Thursday but intensified to a category five, increasing by 85mph (137km/h) in just 24 hours. The increase made the hurricane, which meteorologists dubbed ""rare"", the third-fastest rapid intensification in the Atlantic. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the definition of rapid intensification is a 35mph (56km/h) over a one-day period – which Lee greatly exceeded. Only two other Atlantic hurricanes in history have intensified more rapidly – Felix in 2007, and Wilma in 2005 – and only 4.5% of named storms in the Atlantic have grown to a category five in the past decade. Some climate scientists were stunned in 2023 over not just Lee's sudden intensification – and then rapid weakening – but also the timing of Hurricane Jova, which rapidly ballooned into a category five storm as it made its way over the Pacific Ocean at the same time Lee was forming. These two huge storms formed as the US Atlantic hurricane season peaked on 10 September. Hugh Willoughby, research professor at Florida International University's National Hurricane Research Center says a major hurricane intensifying rapidly isn't out of the ordinary, as that's just how they form ­– but it was especially surprising that these two did so during an El Niño. There's ""pretty convincing evidence"" that major hurricanes are becoming more common, says Willoughby, speaking to BBC Future Planet at the peak of the 2023 hurricane season. Research has shown the proportion of tropical cyclones that reach category four and five is projected to increase due to global warming. Cyclones – or hurricanes, the term depends on their geographical location – form over warm sea surfaces; as water evaporates off the ocean's surface, it rises as humid air, creating an area of lower air pressure below, causing more air to rush in, which in turn warms and rises. The air that rises eventually cools, forming clouds and thunderstorms, and a system that spins and grows, fed by the ocean's heat and water evaporating from the surface. When wind speeds reach 74mph (119km/h), they're classed as a hurricane or cyclone. Since industrialisation, humans have been fuelling the rapid rise of greenhouse gases, which have increased the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. And the costs, both on human life and the economy of extreme weather events, are rising. You might also like: ""What we need to worry about are storms that become major hurricanes becoming more frequent and doing more damage,"" adds Willoughby. ""We have every reason to expect them to become more common, and it's going to get worse."" When hurricanes make landfall they begin to decrease in strength because they no longer gain energy from the ocean. However, they can still wreak devastation. When Hurricane Maria, a category five storm, hit the northeastern Caribbean in 2017, it killed as many as 4,600 people in Puerto Rico alone, causing power cuts, broken roads, and knocking out water services. It was the strongest hurricane to hit the island in a century. In the Northwest Pacific, Hurricane Patricia, which hit in 2015, was the strongest landfalling Pacific hurricane on record. It was also the strongest storm in terms of wind speed, with winds of 214mph (345km/h). The death toll, almost unbelievably, was zero. The strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed was Hurricane Allen in 1980, which caused nearly 300 deaths in Haiti and whose winds reached 190mph (306km/h). Economic harms – and billion dollar disasters – caused by extreme weather events are becoming more commonplace. Hurricane Katrina remains the costliest hurricane on record. The 2005 event, which destroyed more than 800,000 homes and brought catastrophic flooding to Louisiana, is estimated to have cost the US $193.8bn (£155bn). Although the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific have their fair share of hurricanes, one of the most active tropical cyclone basins is in the Western Pacific, where there are warmer sea surface temperatures, which cyclones need to thrive. The strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide – measured by the storm's central pressure – was Typhoon Tip in 1979, which reached wind speeds of 190mph (306km/h) and killed 99 people, mostly in Japan. The deadliest cyclone, however,  happened in 1970, caused between 300,000 to 500,000 fatalities in what is now Bangladesh. The deaths were mostly caused by a large storm surge which overwhelmed the low-lying islands and led to the United Nations calling for ways to mitigate the harmful effects of tropical cyclones. Although some scientists say it is too early to correlate rising ocean temperatures with an increase in hurricanes and cyclones, warmer waters do intensify wind speeds – making these storms more dangerous if they make landfall. ""It's unclear at the present whether the recent years of increased storms constitutes a trend,"" says Jordan Gerth, research meteorologist at the Space Science and Engineering Center in Wisconsin. He notes there have been a greater number of named storms than the historical average, but that this may be due to improvements in the quality of meteorological observations, including NOAA upgrading its satellite system and forecasting models. ""However,"" he continues, ""due to increases in water temperature, a primary source of fuel that can increase the intensity of hurricanes, we expect, and are witnessing, an increase in the number of major hurricanes. In other words, a hurricane is more likely to intensify in today's climate than in years past."" Despite slowing down over the weekend to a category four, Lee is expected to cause ""hazardous beach conditions"" around the US East Coast, Bermuda, and the Bahamas throughout the coming week. Experts at the National Hurricane Center also predicted the hurricane would grow in size again over the coming days, but that it was still too soon to know the level of impact, if any. ""What we can learn from these storms,"" Gerth warns, ""is more socioeconomic than meteorological. US infrastructure and communities are vulnerable."" * This article was originally published on 12 October 2023.

economic indicators,Cameras will help to monitor footfall - minister,2024-09-15,2024-06-25,Alex Green,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11jgrv7pno,"Two additional cameras installed in St Helier will help to monitor footfall in the capital, Jersey's minister for Sustainable Economic Development has said. In a written question, deputy Kirsten Morel was asked about increasing footfall in St Helier by deputy Max Andrews. Mr Morel said footfall was one of the ""key indicators of the health of a High Street"" but he said it only painted ""half the picture"". He said the cameras, installed on Queen Street and King Street in December, would give the States more data around footfall. The minister said work was under way with retailers to shape the retail strategy for Jersey’s high street. He said work continued on a ""series of quick wins"" to improve both the retail and cultural experience of shoppers and drive increased footfall. ""Events programmes are also important to encourage footfall, particularly in the off-season and events such as Public Voice Common Ground, the Lunar New Year festival and La Saison Française have been employed to drive increased footfall to St Helier,"" Mr Morel said. He added that Jersey Business was in ""constant contact"" with businesses in the area to help them develop ""compelling business plans"" to entice more footfall.

economic indicators,'Why should I bother going to my local school to vote?',2024-09-15,2024-06-27,Claire Hamilton,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cprrq09l597o,"Regarded as one of Merseyside's most affluent areas, the Wirral West constituency is home to some of north-west England's most expensive properties. It’s a place favoured by famous ex-footballers, some of whom are occasionally spotted on the fairway at the Royal Liverpool golf course in Hoylake. Boundary changes have altered Wirral West’s social mix for this general election - the constituency now takes in swathes of rural areas, as well as the upmarket town of Heswall, and the Woodchurch estate. Matt Martin has run the Green Onions café in the coastal town of West Kirby for 10 years.  He said the pandemic had hit businesses like his very hard. Mr Martin said he really craved economic stability from whomever ends up in power after next week's general election. ""I am thinking about who might come in and give us a boost,"" he said, adding that, despite the apparent affluence of the area, ""people here are still struggling"". About five miles across the peninsula in Woodchurch, Matt Gibbs runs the Carrbridge Community Centre. He thinks the area sometimes struggles to establish its own identity - ""the underlying feeling is we are neither here nor there, caught between West Wirral and Birkenhead. ""On some days it might be ‘Oooh, we live in leafy, posh West Wirral’, and on other days it might be ‘Oh, we’re in Birkenhead and there are problems here’ - so how do you marry that together?"" He is worried that disaffection with local politics might put people off voting on 4 July. ""We’ve got the Euros, which is a massive distraction. People might feel, 'why should I bother going to my local school to vote for someone when they are all going to be the same?'"" For many years, Wirral West was a ""bellwether"" seat – an indicator for which way the political wind was blowing across the country. Margaret Greenwood, who bucked the national trend to win the seat for Labour from Conservative Esther McVey in 2015, is not standing this time around, so whichever party wins, the constituency will have a new MP. Paul and Steve Smith run a yoga business in West Kirby. Paul said he felt the NHS should be a priority for the next government. ""I recently ended up in A&E and waited over seven hours,"" he said. ""People sat there, hungry and thirsty – it was awful."" Meanwhile, Steve said: “Waiting lists are too long for SEN diagnoses, which means children aren’t able to access the right support and education."" He also said he wanted water companies and other utilities to be brought under public ownership.  Also from West Kirby, Rachel Lightburn said social care was her biggest priority during this election campaign, since both her grandmothers had lived in care homes.  She said the whole issue ""had been featured so little during this campaign"".  ""It’s too difficult for political parties to try and address, so they avoid it."" Ms Lightburn thinks too many care home operators focus on making a profit rather than on delivering high-quality care. “Covid showed us the crisis going on in our care homes, and they still haven’t addressed it."" Finally, Lewis Quail from Heswall added crime to the list of voters' concerns.  ""As summer progresses you notice low-level crime,"" he said. ""There have been quite a few dispersal zones introduced – I don’t know if they’ve worked – but you notice it when you take the dog for a walk."""

The verdicts of pundits from around the globe to Thursday night’s televised clash in Atlanta, Georgia, between the two White House rivals was damning. From Beijing to New Delhi and beyond, the reviews were most scathing of President Biden’s performance at the CNN forum, but his Republican challenger did not escape criticism. By BBC Monitoring Russia team Even before last night's debate, the main evening news shows on Russian TV on Thursday were speculating that Mr Biden would not be able to survive it.  ""An hour and a half live on air is a test of mental and physical fitness,"" Channel One said, asserting that Mr Biden would ""find it difficult to withstand this"". Both state-owned Channel One and Rossiya 1 reported opinion polling showing that some 60% expected Mr Biden to be given a stimulant to get through the debate. Afterwards, pro-Kremlin commentators portrayed Mr Biden's performance in the debate as lacklustre.  Military blog Rybar branded his performance a ""total failure""; while the Telegram channel of the Russia in Global Affairs magazine said that Mr Biden had failed to prove that he was in ""proper physical shape"" to lead the country and that his performance ""appears to have frightened his supporters"". Rossiya 1 TV said on Friday morning that voters were concerned about Mr Biden's ""mental health"".  It also highlighted Trump's attacks on Mr Biden's handling of the Ukraine war. By Kerry Allen, China media analyst, BBC Monitoring Chinese media were enthused by the theatrics of last night’s debate, and many outlets highlighted that Mr Biden and Trump didn’t shake hands at the beginning of the debate and went on to launch “fierce personal attacks against each other”.  The state-owned Global Times describes the debate as “like a reality show”. Chinese satirical cartoons often depict a fierce, quite literal, battle between the two candidates, but Chinese audiences enjoyed the more quirky aspects of the debate, such as the pair going “off topic to discuss their golf skills”. Generally, Chinese media want to paint a picture for audiences of general apathy and frustration among US voters at both candidates.  Global Times says they were both scrutinised over their “age and stamina”; noting that on the campaign trail, Trump was “frequently mangling his sentences” and that Mr Biden “often makes verbal slip-ups”.  Some outlets take aim at Trump over “lying” and Mr Biden “mumbling”. China frequently highlights growing divisions in US society and often suggests the US may descend into civil war.  The overall message is that both Trump and Mr Biden are “currently facing difficulties”.  After last night’s debate, many took to social media to express “concerns about America’s future”, Xinhua news agency says. By Upasana Bhat, BBC Monitoring Prominent Indian media outlets highlighted a ""shaky"" performance by Mr Biden and ""aggression"" by Trump in their coverage of the debate. Analysing the ""key takeaways"", a report on Hindustan Times newspaper's website described the debate as a ""high stake face-off that will turn the tide for rest of the campaign"".  It said that Mr Biden appeared to be ""struggling and even froze several times"".  Trump showed ""more aggression"" and ""capitalised on Biden’s missteps"" such as during a discussion on immigration, it added. Some media outlets picked up on Trump's claim Mr Biden was getting ""paid by China"".  ""'Manchurian Candidate, Paid By China': Trump's Big Charge Against Biden,"" read a headline on the NDTV channel's website. A report on Firstpost website noted that climate change was a topic where India and China figured in the debate. The US election result is not expected to change India-US ties much as Prime Minister Narendra Modi - who's just started a third term in power - shares a good rapport with both Mr Biden and Trump. By Shaina Oppenheimer, BBC Monitoring In Israel, media agreed that Mr Biden looked “weak”, and theorised how a Trump presidential win would affect the ongoing Gaza war.  During the debate, Trump said if he was president, the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel would not have happened.  Media highlighted Trump’s pro-Israel credentials as he accused Mr Biden of weakness: “He’s become like a Palestinian. But they don’t like him. Because he’s a very bad Palestinian. He’s a very weak one,” Trump said. Barak Ravid, the diplomatic correspondent for the Walla news site, said that Mr Biden was ""unfocused” on the conflict.  ""He failed to explain the extent of his support for Israel and it was possible for Trump to attack him, and present him as someone who is trying to prevent Israel from eliminating Hamas,"" Ravid said. Ynet’s veteran defence analyst, Ron Ben-Yishai, said: ""Trump is now seen as a candidate whose victory in the presidential elections is almost certain, and all the actors and elements, from Russia and Ukraine to Israel and Saudi Arabia, and also Iran, will conduct themselves from now on according to this assumption.""  Ben-Yishai said certain elements in Israel ”are already rubbing their hands with joy” at the prospect of a second Trump presidency. By Pascal Fletcher, BBC Monitoring, Miami Latin America's media were riveted by what they called the ""tense"" presidential debate, highlighting their rancorous exchanges over immigration, the economy, abortion and global politics. Many media pundits in the region saw Trump succeeding in stoking doubts about Mr Biden's age by pummelling him energetically on issues sensitive to US voters, such as inflation and immigration. ""Trump corners Biden in tense debate,"" was how leading Brazilian daily Folha de Sao Paulo headlined its initial report. Mr Biden’s “hesitant and confused performance… could radically change the scenario of the elections"", Folha added. Posting on X, prominent Mexican journalist Leon Krauze drew a similar conclusion, saying Mr Biden ""stumbled, lost his thread and was incapable of showing up the lies of his rival"". Meanwhile, Argentina’s La Nacion said that ""the Democrat president was not able to dispel the doubts about his age and his health, and he set off alarms in his party"". Colombian daily El Tiempo saw the exchanges between Trump and Mr Biden characterised by ""insults, jibes and few proposals"" in which ""neither of the two appeared to overcome the concerns over their advanced age"". “The debate shows Trump strong and Biden weak,"" was how Brazilian daily O Estado de S. Paulo summed up one analysis. ""Biden self-destructed in front of the American public and the world... Biden debated desperately badly,"" Brazilian analyst Demetrio Magnoli said on the popular G1 news website. By Pascal Fletcher, BBC Monitoring, Miami In Mexico, media tend to be wary of calls from US politicians for drastic measures to stem the flow of migrants and illicit drugs, so reporting on the debate homed in on the repeated clashes over immigration, mostly consisting of Trump slamming what he called Mr Biden's failure to secure the border. Left-wing Mexican daily La Jornada highlighted the debate ""clash over migration and the economy"". ""During the first presidential debate, ex-President Donald Trump criticised the immigration policy of the Joe Biden Government and said that migrants would have to be removed from the country for alleged crimes committed against Americans,"" Mexican daily Reforma told its readers. In its coverage, Mexican news magazine Proceso focused on Trump asserting that the US had become a ""nest of rats"" because he said Mr Biden's immigration policies had ""opened the door to criminals, murderers and rapists"". By William Armstrong, BBC Monitoring Turkey specialist, Istanbul Turkish media outlets and social media users criticised Mr Biden’s “poor” debate performance, which many said led to “panic” among the Democrats. ""Biden had difficulty understanding the questions and hesitated when answering,"" Hurriyet newspaper said, describing the debate as a ""disaster"" for Biden. Academic Hilmi Bolatoglu said in a post on X that Mr Biden’s performance strengthened indications that a “new Trump era is approaching”. Coverage also raised eyebrows about the general quality of the debate.  ""There were many gaffes in the 90-minute debate. Insults and mockery flew in the air, Biden had several hiccups and Trump gave a lot of misinformation,"" Milliyet newspaper said in a report. “Looking at… the list of lies and distortions that both leaders told, one wonders which of them American voters will elect to wreak havoc on the world,” veteran journalist Murat Yetkin said on his YouTube channel. Many pundits in Turkey have long been cool on Mr Biden’s presidency, accusing him of “hypocrisy” on the Israel-Gaza war and voicing doubt about his emphasis on defending the “liberal international order”.

economic indicators,Scottish Labour manifesto: Key policies analysed,2024-09-15,2024-06-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c722g1d025jo,"The Scottish Labour party have launched their 2024 election manifesto, in which leader Anas Sarwar has pledged that if his party won the general election it would bring change “for this generation, and the next”. The document sets out the party's plans if it was to form a government. Here are some of their key policies, analysed by BBC Scotland correspondents. Health is a devolved issue so even if Keir Stammer wins next month, Labour won’t be making decisions about the NHS in Scotland. For that reason, many of the plans in this manifesto - to reduce the number of health boards, to have a mental health practitioner in every GP surgery, or to make more use of technology - can be seen as aspirations and the sort of topics Anas Sarwar will continue to challenge John Swinney on in Holyrood. Even the headline promise to create 160,000 appointments every year to cut waiting times is not guaranteed to happen if Labour win in Westminster. Firstly, the money raised would be transferred to Scotland through ‘Barnett consequentials’ (you can read more about those here), then the SNP government would have to choose to spend it on creating additional appointments, and highly trained staff would then have to be recruited to ensure those patients could be seen. Growth is the answer to most questions facing Labour. With criticism that its plans imply a big cut to public spending, at least to those services that are not given protection, it is also promising not to raise tax ""on working people"". Labour has opted to constrain itself on borrowing, showing it is serious about economic stability by adopting the Conservatives' fiscal rules on debt. The only way out of that tax-spend-borrowing corner is with economic growth - generating more tax for public services, as well as more jobs and higher pay. As UK and Scottish growth has been slow for 16 years, since the bank crash, Labour's means of boosting it are not that radical a change of direction from the Conservatives', with the same limit to the amount government can spend to stimulate growth. So Labour's plan depends on government competence, working better to stimulate business investment, backing the right technologies with an industrial strategy to back the most promising growth sectors, and using government funds to invest in them. In Scotland, a lot of that is about renewable energy, though a hard line against further oil and gas drilling does not look helpful to investment or jobs. Labour also says it will be be pro-worker. The tension between these two begins with the promise of a rise in the minimum wage. Some 200,000 Scots will be better off, we're told, but employers will pay for that. The tensions continue with more workplace rights; on fire and re-hire, banning zero hours contracts but only if they are '""exploitative"", broader parental leave rights. Employment rights cross the Border, but much of Scottish Labour's manifesto is about devolved powers, and an indicator of what to expect at the 2026 Holyrood election campaign. Anas Sarwar answered a journalist's challenge to rule out a rise in Scotland's income tax rates, with a simple 'yes'. That leaves the next Holyrood manifesto also dependent on growth, putting emphasis on backing for renewable energy, a faster planning system, business rates reform to help the high street, and workplace skills. Much of Scottish Labour's manifesto raises criminal justice issues - which Scottish Labour MPs won't be able to do anything about, because they're devolved to Holyrood. The party talks of Police Scotland being ""gutted"" (policing is devolved) and court backlogs delaying justice (courts are devolved). The manifesto says Scotland's ""sense of security has been slowly eroded over the past 17 years"" - taking us back to 2007 when the SNP gained power at Holyrood, not 2010 when the Conservatives gained power at Westminster. Holyrood issues are being used to fight for Westminster seats, but that's nothing new and Scottish Labour are not the only ones doing it. Policies which a UK Labour government would be able to implement in Scotland include greater collaboration between UK police forces on cybercrime, fraud, trafficking and terrorism. The manifesto says ninja swords, zombie-style blades and machetes will be banned and rules strengthened to prevent their sale online. Labour says it will add new provisions to the Online Safety Act and explore further measures to keep people safe, especially when they're using social media. The commitment to end new oil and gas licences is a much less palatable pill to swallow in Scotland, where 60,000 jobs rely directly or indirectly on the sector. But there's no sugar coating it in the Scottish manifesto, although it emphasises that existing licences won't be revoked. Perhaps the biggest sweetener is the decision to base its publicly-owned Great British Energy north of the border, delivering clean power and investing in green energies. GB Energy will be given £8.3bn over the course of the next parliament to co-invest with the private sector in new technologies. The renewables industry has some concern about GB Energy being a generator of electricity because it fears that might skew the market. But the party says it will invest in Scotland's energy potential and create new high-quality jobs. It’s fourteen years since Labour last won a national election in Scotland. When Gordon Brown was prime minister, they held Scotland in the 2010 UK election while losing power across the UK. The SNP has dominated ever since. But Labour senses that this is a change election, that frustration with a Conservative government at Westminster and an SNP government at Holyrood leaves them well placed to regain lost ground in Scotland. One Labour veteran told me that campaigning in Scotland at this election was like taking a warm bath with bubbles. That is by comparison with years of rejection and some hostility on the doorsteps. Another long standing Labour campaigner admitted that there was not yet enthusiasm for Sir Keir Starmer’s party. It was just that people were so fed up with the alternatives, Labour is now seen to offer the best route to change. That’s why that word is plastered over the manifesto and threaded through the party’s campaign. Yet the promises Labour are making are far from radical. They are modest and limited because as the party’s Scottish leader, Anas Sarwar, puts it, in tough times they would rather under promise and over deliver than break trust by doing the opposite. A prominent part of Labour's economic, energy and net zero plan is called GB Energy.  So what is it? ""A publicly-owned clean power company, to create good jobs and cut bills for good,"" says Anas Sarwar.  ""And [it] will be headquartered here in Scotland."" Where in Scotland? He's not saying before the election. This is not an energy supplier, but an investment fund, laden with big expectations. It is intended to co-invest with private firms in green energy generation, support new technologies, and back community-based wind, solar and hydropower projects. All this with capital of £8.3bn spread over five years, when the current Whitehall expectation is of total green energy investment by the end of this decade of £400bn. How it cuts your bill is not so clear, except that renewable energy is seen as cheaper than fossil fuels. Maybe so, but gas prices can go down as well as up. Nor is it clear that this is a priority for private sector co-investors. They can get funds, if the investment conditions are right. What they want from government is more electricity grid capacity, consents for grid connections, a guaranteed floor price to reduce risk and consistent policy. Scottish Labour’s manifesto acknowledges the damage done to the cultural sector by the pandemic, which continues today. They propose a long term recovery plan to support the sector, which was one of the first industries to close, and the last to reopen. Campaigners who have long called for an increase in public funding for arts and culture will be heartened by the comment that for the 0.2% of the Scottish budget currently spent on culture “we get so much back for so little investment.” They will also welcome the commitment to a baseline for cultural spending which reflects its value and delivers a greater share of the Scottish government budget. They also support the introduction of an Arts Bill which would place a statutory responsibility on local authorities to deliver arts and culture. Cash-strapped authorities like Glasgow - which has a huge number of museums, galleries and cultural organisations on its patch - may note any plan would be supported by fair funding. They suggest a Cultural Rucksack scheme - based on a successful Norwegian programme which allows every school pupil the chance to experience professional arts and culture. And they also want to see more support for the grass roots music industry and for the film and television sector, as well as increased opportunities to learn production skills. They promise a push to address the decline in Gaelic language and to support a museum and archive devoted to telling the stories of underrepresented groups in Scotland’s history and culture. That also ties in with a commitment to recognising Scotland’s historical role in empire, colonialism and transatlantic slavery, which they want to see included in the national curriculum."
economic indicators,Sharp rise in new orders boosts NI private sector,2024-09-15,2024-06-10,John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd114v5rp7po,"Northern Ireland’s private sector economy continued to grow in May with new orders showing their sharpest rise in more than two years, an Ulster Bank survey suggests. The monthly survey covers a representative sample of around 200 firms in the four main parts of the private sector. It indicates that the job market remains strong, although there are indications that some manufacturers are cutting staff. The strong job market also appears to be boosting wages which is feeding through to some prices. ""Retailers are recording the highest rates of cost inflation, in part linked to the rise in the National Living Wage, which is feeding into the prices that consumers pay,"" Ulster Bank’s chief economist Richard Ramsey said. He added that on the other hand, construction costs are rising at their weakest pace in 45 months which is ""perhaps an indication that material cost inflation is continuing to come back from record highs"". Mr Ramsey said that despite the continued challenge from inflation the NI economy appeared to be picking up some momentum. ""The four months since the return of the Northern Ireland Executive have witnessed a strong private sector performance, and this shows no signs of slowing, indeed quite the opposite, with the pace of output, new orders and employment all accelerating in May. ""Northern Ireland’s performance compared favourably with other UK regions, with NI topping the league table for output and employment."" Later this week official jobs market data will be published along with figures showing the performance of the NI services and manufacturing sectors in the first quarter of this year. They are likely to show a pick up in performance after economic output fell at the end of 2023. Private sector output was flat in the final quarter of 2023, while public sector output declined, which may have reflected the impact of public sector strikes.  Most of these industrial disputes have since been resolved after the UK government provided money for pay deals."
economic indicators,Are animals conscious? How new research is changing minds,2024-09-15,2024-06-15,Pallab Ghosh,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv223z15mpmo,"Charles Darwin enjoys a near god-like status among scientists for his theory of evolution. But his ideas that animals are conscious in the same way humans are have long been shunned. Until now. ""There is no fundamental difference between man and animals in their ability to feel pleasure and pain, happiness, and misery,"" Darwin wrote. But his suggestion that animals think and feel was seen as scientific heresy among many, if not most animal behaviour experts. Attributing consciousness to animals based on their responses was seen as a cardinal sin. The argument went that projecting human traits, feelings, and behaviours onto animals had no scientific basis and there was no way of testing what goes on in animals’ minds. But if new evidence emerges of animals’ abilities to feel and process what is going on around them, could that mean they are, in fact, conscious? We now know that bees can count, recognise human faces and learn how to use tools. Prof Lars Chittka of Queen Mary University of London has worked on many of the major studies of bee intelligence. ""If bees are that intelligent, maybe they can think and feel something, which are the building blocks of consciousness,"" he says. Prof Chittka’s experiments showed that bees would modify their behaviour following a traumatic incident and seemed to be able to play, rolling small wooden balls, which he says they appeared to enjoy as an activity. These results have persuaded one of the most influential and respected scientists in animal research to make this strong, stark and contentious statement: ""Given all the evidence that is on the table, it is quite likely that bees are conscious,"" he said. It isn't just bees. Many say that it is now time to think again, with the emergence of new evidence they say marks a ""sea change"" in thinking on the science of animal consciousness. They include Prof Jonathan Birch of the London School of Economics. ""We have researchers from different fields starting to dare to ask questions about animal consciousness and explicitly think about how their research might be relevant to those questions,"" says Prof Birch. Anyone looking for a eureka moment will be disappointed. Instead, a steady growth of evidence for a rethink has led to murmurings among the researchers involved. Now, many want a change in scientific thinking in the field. What has been discovered may not amount to conclusive proof of animal consciousness, but taken together, it is enough to suggest that there is ""a realistic possibility"" that animals are capable of consciousness, according to Prof Birch. This applies not only to what are known as higher animals such as apes and dolphins who have reached a more advanced stage of development than other animals. It also applies to simpler creatures, such as snakes, octopuses, crabs, bees and possibly even fruit flies, according to the group, who want funding for more research to determine whether animals are conscious, and if so, to what extent. But if you're wondering what we even mean by consciousness, you're not alone. It’s something scientists can’t even agree on. An early effort came in the 17th century, by the French philosopher René Descartes who said: ""I think therefore I am.""  He added that ""language is the only certain sign of thought hidden in a body"". But those statements have muddied the waters for far too long, according to Prof Anil Seth of Sussex University, who has been wrestling with the definition of consciousness for much of his professional career. ""This unholy trinity, of language, intelligence and consciousness goes back all the way to Descartes,"" he told BBC News, with a degree of annoyance at the lack of questioning of this approach until recently. The ""unholy trinity"" is at the core of a movement called behaviourism, which emerged in the early 20th Century. It says that thoughts and feelings cannot be measured by scientific methods and so should be ignored when analysing behaviour. Many animal behaviour experts were schooled in this view, but it is beginning to make way for a less human-centred approach, according to Prof Seth. ""Because we see things through a human lens, we tend to associate consciousness with language and intelligence. Just because they go together in us, it doesn’t mean they go together in general."" Some are very critical of some uses of the word consciousness. ""The field is replete with weasel words and unfortunately one of those is consciousness,"" says Prof Stevan Harnad of Quebec University. ""It is a word that is confidently used by a lot of people, but they all mean something different, and so it is not clear at all what it means."" He says that a better, less weasley, word is ""sentience"", which is more tightly defined as the capacity to feel. ""To feel everything, a pinch, to see the colour red, to feel tired and hungry, those are all things you feel,"" says Prof Harnad. Others who have been instinctively sceptical of the idea of animals being conscious say that the new broader interpretation of what it means to be conscious makes a difference. Dr Monique Udell, from Oregon State University, says she comes from a behaviourist background. ""If we look at distinct behaviours, for example what species can recognise themselves in a mirror, how many can plan ahead or are able to remember things that happened in the past, we are able to test these questions with experimentation and observation and draw more accurate conclusions based on data,"" she says. ""And if we are going to define consciousness as a sum of measurable behaviours, then animals that have succeeded in these particular tasks can be said to have something that we choose to call consciousness."" This is a much narrower definition of consciousness than the new group is promoting, but a respectful clash of ideas is what science is all about, according to Dr Udell. ""Having people who take ideas with a grain of salt and cast a critical eye is important because if we don’t come at these questions in different ways, then it is going to be harder to progress."" But what next? Some say far more animals need to be studied for the possibility of consciousness than is currently the case. ""Right now, most of the science is done on humans and monkeys and we are making the job much harder than it needs to be because we are not learning about consciousness in its most basic form,"" says Kristin Andrews, a professor of philosophy specialising in animal minds at York university in Toronto. Prof Andrews and many others believe that research on humans and monkeys is the study of higher level consciousness – exhibited in the ability to communicate and feel complex emotions – whereas an octopus or snake may also have a more basic level of consciousness that we are ignoring by not investigating it. Prof Andrews was among the prime movers of the New York Declaration on Animal Consciousness signed earlier this year, which has so far been signed by 286 researchers. The short four paragraph declaration states that it is “irresponsible” to ignore the possibility of animal consciousness. ""We should consider welfare risks and use the evidence to inform our responses to these risks,"" it says. Chris Magee is from Understanding Animal Research, a UK body backed by research organisations and companies that undertake animal experiments. He says animals already are assumed to be conscious when it comes to whether to conduct experiments on them and says UK regulations require that experiments should be conducted only if the benefits to medical research outweigh the suffering caused. ""There is enough evidence for us to have a precautionary approach,"" he says. But there is also a lot we don’t know, including about decapod crustaceans such as crabs, lobsters, crayfish, and shrimp. ""We don’t know very much about their lived experience, or even basic things like the point at which they die. ""And this is important because we need to set rules to protect them either in the lab or in the wild."" A government review led by Prof Birch in 2021 assessed 300 scientific studies on the sentience of decapods and Cephalopods, which include octopus, squid, and cuttlefish. Prof Birch’s team found that there was strong evidence that these creatures were sentient in that they could experience feelings of pain, pleasure, thirst, hunger, warmth, joy, comfort and excitement. The conclusions led to the government including these creatures into its Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act in 2022. ""Issues related to octopus and crab welfare have been neglected,"" says Prof Birch. ""The emerging science should encourage society to take these issues a bit more seriously."" There are millions of different types of animals and precious little research has been carried out on how they experience the world. We know a bit about bees and other researchers have shown indications of conscious behaviour in cockroaches and even fruit flies but there are so many other experiments to be done involving so many other animals. It is a field of study that the modern-day heretics who have signed the New York Declaration claim has been neglected, even ridiculed. Their approach, to say the unsayable and risk sanction is nothing new. Around the same time that Rene Descartes was saying ""I think therefore I am"", the Catholic church found the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei ""vehemently suspect of heresy"" for suggesting that the Earth was not the centre of the Universe. It was a shift in thinking that opened our eyes to a truer, richer picture of the Universe and our place in it. Shifting ourselves from the centre of the Universe a second time may well do the same for our understanding of ourselves as well as the other living things with whom we share the planet.

economic indicators,US Fed pencils in one interest rate cut this year,2024-09-15,2024-06-12,Charlotte Edwards,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1ddj7v9y97o,"The US Federal Reserve has signalled that it will cut its key interest rate just once this year despite inflation easing.   Back in March, the central bank had been expected to reduce borrowing costs three times by the end of 2024. However, on Wednesday, new forecasts from Fed officials who make decisions on rates pencilled in a single reduction.   The new outlook emerged after the Fed voted to hold interest rates at their current 23-year high even as inflation ticked lower. Inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, slowed to 3.3% in the year to May. That compares with 3.4% in the 12 months to April. However, between April and May inflation was unchanged and it remains above the Fed's 2% target. Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, said that only ""modest"" progress had been made on hitting the target and the central bank would need to see ""good inflation readings"" before interest rates can be cut. US interest rates were held at 5.25%-5.5%. Anastassia Fedyk, assistant professor of finance at Haas Business School at the University of California Berkeley, told the BBC's Today programme: ""We did get some good news in terms of better inflation numbers. ""But the Fed is still being pretty cautious so they are signalling that in the future they are going to be doing one, most likely, rate drop and not a very large one at that."" Some analysts suggested that the central bank would backtrack on the number of interest rate cuts this year.  Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that reducing forecasts of interest rate cuts from three to one this year was ""unnecessarily aggressive"". While economists at Wells Fargo said it would be a ""close call"" between making one or two reductions in 2024. Officials at the US Fed were split over how many interest rate cuts they expected this year. Of the 19 policymakers who gave their outlook, four expected no cut, seven forecasted one reduction while eight thought there would be two. Forecasts from the US Fed signalled one modest cut to 5%-5.25%.  Mr Powell acknowledged that a reduction of this size would not have a major impact on the US economy. But he said when a cut finally does come it would be “a consequential decision for the economy” which “you want to get right"". While inflation eased a little, the US employment market remains robust. Recent data showed that US employers added 272,000 jobs in May - far above the 185,000 expected. Ms Fedyk said: ""The Fed is trying to react to the data but not overreact to the data."" Some other major economies have cut interest rates, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada. But the US - and the UK - are yet to make a similar move. The Bank of England will meet next week and is widely expected to hold interest rates at 5.25%, their highest level for 16 years. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation has slowed significantly in the UK from a high of 11.1% in October 2022 to 2.3% currently. However, some elements of inflation remain stubbornly high. At the same time, average wage growth in the UK remains strong compared to inflation. Earlier this week, Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics said: ""Overall, the stickiness of wage growth may not stop the Bank from cutting interest rates for the first time in August, as we are forecasting, as long as other indicators such as pay settlements data and next week’s CPI inflation release show decent progress."""
economic indicators,"Focus on GDP not way to fairer society, say Greens",2024-09-15,2024-06-02,Paul Seddon,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511lz64rrpo,"The co-leader of the Green Party has told the BBC that finding different ways to measure economic success would help build a fairer society. The party has long argued that economic growth drives over-exploitation of resources and should not be the default aim for governments. Adrian Ramsay said relying on gross domestic product (GDP) to judge the state of the economy was a ""blunt instrument"". He added that a ""wider range of economic measures"" should be reflected when deciding what policies to pursue.  It marks a contrast with other political parties, which usually put their plans to boost economic growth front and centre in election campaigns. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Ramsay defended his party's approach, adding they had a ""strong message about the sort of economy we want to see"". ""The principle for Greens is that just using GDP as a measure of economic success is a blunt instrument,"" he added. He added that the statistic ""doesn’t tell us about how unequal our society is,"" or whether public services are working, or measure impacts on the environment. ""We need to have a wider range of economic measures which are about health and happiness, prosperity, jobs, public services,"" he added. He added that policies such as its proposed tax on the wealthiest 1% would help fund improvements to the NHS. The UK's main GDP measure is produced by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and tries to measure the overall size of the economy. It plays an important role in deciding tax and spending decisions, because the government relies on official forecasts for GDP to work out which policies are affordable. It is also expected to play a major role in the UK's general election campaign.  Rishi Sunak cited economic growth figures in his speech announcing the poll, whilst Labour has made achieving the ""highest sustained growth"" in the G7 club of wealthy nations one of its five missions for power.  In recent years, a number of alternative measures have been developed that try to capture other aspects of the economy. Since 2010, the ONS has also measured well-being, external alongside economic growth. This assesses health, relationships, education and skills, as well as people's personal finances and the environment. However, critics say GDP still occupies too important a role in debates about the economy.  In documents setting out their philosophy, the Greens say it promotes a focus on ""consumerism"" and other indicators would better capture the extent to which economic policies protect nature and improve well-being.  The Green Party of England and Wales is separate to the Scottish Greens, which stands candidates in Scotland. It is aiming to run in every English and Welsh seat for the first time, requiring it to pick 103 more candidates than at the last election in 2019. However, it is expected to focus on a small number of target seats, including the new seat of Waveney Valley, where Mr Ramsay is the party's candidate. Other targets include the new seat of Bristol Central, North Herefordshire, and Brighton Pavilion, where the Greens only current MP, Caroline Lucas, is standing down. A full list of candidates will be available on the BBC website after nominations close on Friday 7 June. "
economic indicators,China's grand ambition for space,2024-09-15,2024-06-04,Andrew Jones,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240510-change-6-is-just-the-tip-of-chinas-space-ambitions,"China's Chang'e-6 mission is intended to bring back lunar samples but is also a stepping stone to much more ambitious space exploration. China's Chang'e-6 spacecraft has landed on the unexplored far-side of the Moon and then re-launched from the lunar surface carrying precious soil samples. The probe touched down nearly one month after launching from Earth in one of China's most ambitious lunar missions to date, which sent a stack of four spacecraft towards the Moon.  While the mission marks China's growing capability in space exploration, it also offers some indications of just how far the country's ambitions within the Solar System stretch. The main aim of Chang'e-6 is to collect the first samples from the lunar far side and deliver them safely to Earth, potentially bringing back new insights into our nearest neighbour, our own planet, and the early history of the Solar System. To do this, China's quartet of spacecraft must perform an intricate cosmic dance. Chang'e-6 spent roughly 4.5-days on its voyage to the Moon, after launching from the Wenchang Space Launch Centre on 3 May. Once in orbit around the Moon, a lander separated from the orbiter and targeted a landing area. As the far side of the Moon never faces Earth, operations and communications with Earth were facilitated by Queqiao-2, a communications relay satellite launched by China in March. The lander touched down in the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin – a huge impact crater on the far side of the Moon – in the early hours of the morning of 2 June in Beijing (22.23 1 June GMT). Safely on the lunar surface, the lander used a scoop and a drill to collect around 2kg (4.4lbs) of surface and subsurface materials. These were then sealed into a container and blasted into lunar orbit by an ascender, which will then be tasked with catching up with the orbiter and handing over its precious cargo. The precise rendezvous and docking between orbiter and ascender will take place while travelling at just over a mile per second (1.68km per second). This will need to be automated, due to the light-time delay due to their distance from ground stations on Earth.  After this celestial game of cat and mouse, the samples will be transferred to a reentry capsule. That spacecraft – resembling a mini version of the return module of China's Shenzhou crew spacecraft – will be released just before the orbiter reaches Earth. It will first bounce itself off Earth's atmosphere to help shed some of the energy from its high-speed return from the Moon, then plummet through the atmosphere to deliver the samples to a landing area in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. Getting these samples from the SPA basin to laboratories could bring a diversity of invaluable science payoffs. ""The SPA basin is one of the best places to go on the Moon to get rocks which can be investigated to answer questions we have about the Moon's origins and geological evolution,"" says Katherine Joy, professor of lunar and planetary science at the University of Manchester in the UK. The rocks collected by Chang'e-6 will notably be the first from the lunar farside, while the Apollo missions conducted by Nasa all visited the nearside. ""Hopefully these will help us unlock why the near and far side of the Moon are so geologically different from each other.""  ""The samples collected will also help us date the huge impact basin itself, shedding light on when huge planetary embryos were striking the Moon in its early history,"" Joy says. Aside from the scientific intrigue however, the Chang'e-6 mission also belies some of China's even grander ambitions.  These manoeuvres will be useful practice for another possible mission: grabbing samples from Mars. While lunar samples promise big science returns in terms of Solar System secrets, Red Planet material could, potentially, provide new insights into the greatest mystery: the origins of life and whether or not Mars is habitable.  Nasa and the European Space Agency (Esa) are also working on a Mars sample return. However, that complex project has recently run into delays, budgeting issues and congressional hurdles. This means China could have a clear shot at a staggering space ""first"". Another notable fact is that the complex lunar orbit rendezvous element of Chang'e-6 is not necessary for a lunar sample return. It is, however, required if you want to get astronauts to the lunar surface and safely back to Earth, and the added complexity of the Chang'e-6 mission appears to be a stepping stone to crewed lunar missions. China announced last year that it planned to launch its first crewed lunar mission before 2030, putting a pair of astronauts on the surface for a few hours before rejoining a colleague waiting in orbit, much like the Chang'e-6 orbiter and ascender, and, most notably, similar to Nasa's Apollo missions. China is not planning a mere short-term, flags-and-footprints presence on the Moon. Their ambition is more like Nasa's Artemis than it is Apollo. China plans to launch two separate missions to the south pole of the Moon around 2026 and 2028 – including testing using lunar soil to 3D print bricks – as precursors to a lunar base. ""The lunar south pole is the destination to be heading to to prepare for when we send humans back to the Moon,"" says Joy.  ""Along with the Chang'e-7 and 8, several missions planned by Nasa's commercial lander programme will also be landing to test where and how much volatiles, including water and water ice, are sited in the polar soil.  ""Such material could be of use by future human explorers so it will be very interesting to see what diversity will be encountered by all the planned robotic landers in the next few years."" These efforts are part of a Moon base initiative. China, together with Russia, is attempting to attract countries for a joint International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) and is developing cornerstone technology such as nuclear reactors that would provide power during the lunar nights, which last the equivalent of two weeks on Earth. This project is a parallel yet separate initiative to Nasa's Artemis programme. It illustrates that the growing geopolitical split on Earth isn't just confined to the planet. Space exploration, sometimes seen as a purely scientific pursuit, is also a demonstration of geopolitical prowess and hints at capabilities for other goals.  China's ambitions for space are, naturally, complex. ""All states pursue space projects for a variety of reasons, mostly falling within the categories of war, development, and prestige,"" says Bleddyn Bowen, who researches space policy and international relations in outer space at the University of Leicester.  ""Some are scientific and exploratory, such as the Chang'e missions, others are for the economy and infrastructure and others are for military capabilities or force enhancement,"" says Bowen. China now has its own space station, named Tiangong or ""Heavenly Palace"", which hosts three astronauts for periods of six months at a time. Its Beidou constellation is its answer to the United States' GPS system. Providing timing and positioning services has triggered economic growth in China and allowed the growth of location-based app services and assisted sectors such as finance, agriculture, shipping, aviation and more. It also grants China's military with precision missile and munitions guidance capabilities and the ability to greater coordinate and project its forces across the globe. None of this is exceptional, however. ""The fact China has a military space programme and anti-satellite weapons is not out of step with what other major space powers have done in the past, and are doing today,"" says Bowen. ""Chinese leaders have a mix of interests in terms of war, development and prestige. They want to be secure from external and internal threats, project their own military power, secure commanding economic positions in the world economy, and reap political/prestige benefits from successes and high-profile programmes.""  While major missions like Chang'e-6 grab occasional headlines, China's space programme is both comprehensive in scope and has repercussions for itself and other countries on Earth. More like this: • How China is creating new food in space • Why European astronauts are learning Chinese • The other nations aiming for the Moon Back to science, China is also making strides in astronomy, astrophysics and exoplanet detection. This month, the country's key space science official revealed a series of missions that will aim to make breakthroughs. These include a constellation of satellites in formation, using the far side of the Moon as a shield against earthly interference and attempting to pick up the faint signals from the early universe. Another mission will aim to detect Earth-like exoplanets and so-called rogue planets adrift in the Milky Way without stars to orbit, while a solar probe will attempt to get the first views of the Sun's poles. The country's Tianwen planetary programme intends to sample a near-Earth asteroid and visit a comet, collect samples from Mars, and send a probe to Jupiter. A later mission to one of the Solar System's ice giants – either Uranus or Neptune – is being considered for the future. Its space officials have also talked of creating an Earth-Moon economic zone, illustrating that, like other space powers such as the US, China is looking at commercialising space and its resources. For now though, China's focus is on attempting to bring home the goods with Chang'e-6 before the end of June. Beyond this, its next sample mission, late this decade, may be carried out by its own astronauts. * This article was originally published on 12 May 2024.

economic indicators,How does the UK compare with other economies?,2024-09-15,2024-05-22,Ben Chu,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedd1nd5d9go,"On the day that Rishi Sunak called a July election and the latest figures showed inflation falling, the government has been talking about its record on the economy.  Chancellor Jeremy Hunt made a number of claims on BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday, including comparisons between the UK economy and other countries.  We have looked at some of them. Mr Hunt said: “Inflation [in the UK] is now lower than in the eurozone or in the United States of America, but prices are still a lot higher than they were a year ago.” He's right. Inflation measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) was 2.3% in the UK in the year to April 2024. The main measure of consumer inflation in the US in April 2024 was 3.4%. And in the eurozone, inflation in April was 2.4%. But the UK’s inflation rate peaked higher than in the US and the eurozone, at 11.1% in October 2022. Mr Hunt said that “the UK economy will grow faster over the next six years than in France, Germany, Italy or Japan"", according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It should be said that forecasting what the economy will be like six years in the future is highly uncertain. The IMF did indeed predict that the UK economy, as measured through its gross domestic product (GDP), would be 8.8% bigger by the end of 2029 than at the start of this year. That would be more growth than it forecasts for France (8.3%), Germany (5.7%), Italy (3.5%) or Japan (4.4%). But it would be smaller than the other two members of the G7 major advanced economies: US (13.7%) and Canada (10.8%). It should also be mentioned that other forecasters are less optimistic about the UK, at least in the short term. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), for example, predicts that the UK will have the worst growth in the G7 next year. The OECD is a group of countries which aims to assist economic development, raise living standards and promote growth in world trade. Talking about what has happened to living standards in the UK, Mr Hunt said: “Living standards have fallen by more in Germany,  Austria or Sweden.” The chancellor did not specify which measure of living standards he was talking about, or over what period. BBC Verify could not find the figures to support his claim, so we asked the Treasury. It told us Mr Hunt was talking about the OECD’s measure of “gross disposable household income” over a specific period - comparing July to September 2022 with October to December 2023. This is borne out by the OECD data, although the choice of time period seems arbitrary, as does the selection of comparator countries.  If you look at UK living standards between the last three months of 2019 - before the pandemic started - and the end of last year, they have performed worse than those countries and also worse than the G7 average. The G7 (Group of Seven) is a group of seven big industrialised economies. “We’ve attracted more than that [foreign direct investment] then anywhere in the world except the United States and China since 2010,” Mr Hunt said. The Department for Business and Trade produces an overview of “greenfield foreign direct investment data”. “Greenfield” refers to the entire new investment in a country. This data shows that foreign investment in the UK grew by £498bn between 2010 and 2022. That’s lower than the US (£848bn) and China (£708bn), but higher than Germany (£222bn) and France (£133bn) Another indicator of relative attractiveness of European countries to foreign investors by the accountancy firm EY suggests the UK has fallen behind France. World Bank data on foreign direct investment as a share of the economy suggests that the difference between France, Germany and the UK is less pronounced than the greenfield data.

economic indicators,Change allows tariff-free meat from down under,2024-09-15,2024-05-16,John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80z00ew15eo,"The UK and EU have ratified a change to the Windsor Framework which allows NI businesses to make greater use of UK trade deals. The change allows tariff-free imports of certain meat products from Australia and New Zealand. The government says the deal addresses a post-Brexit problem where NI businesses importing higher-tariff meat products could not use the arrangements covering the rest of the UK. It means more than 13,000 tons of lamb, beef, and poultry imports will now be covered by UK tariff rate quotas. Tariffs are effectively trade taxes which are applied to imports of some goods. A tariff rate quota means a certain amount of product can be imported tariff free every year while imports above that limit have tariffs applied. Minister of State for Northern Ireland Steve Baker said it was a unique arrangement which would allow NI importers to benefit from UK free trade agreements. He said this would ""further cement Northern Ireland’s place in the UK"". The deal could mean greater choice for consumers and greater flexibility for meat processors, but would also mean increased competition for local producers. Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme on Thursday, Mr Baker said local farmers would face competition, but believed it was only right that “people should have choice”. “I can think of at least one producer in Northern Ireland who would like to import Wagyu beef from New Zealand – that is not beef that is produced on the island of Ireland - it’s an important element for consumers to have that extra choice,"" he said. “The arguments for free trade will always run, I‘m firmly on the free trade side of the argument but what I would say is that all these trade deals do include provisions which make sure that we don’t end up swamped with cheap produce."" The agreement was reached at a meeting of the Joint Committee, which oversee the implementation of the Windsor Framework. The delegations were led by Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron and European Commission Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič. It’s understood the meeting also discussed a recent vote at the Stormont Assembly where a proposal to add a new EU law to the Windsor Framework failed to get cross community support.  The introduction of new EU laws under the Windsor Framework is ultimately a matter for the UK government. However, if the assembly has not expressed cross-party support for the law, the government will normally veto it. If the government vetoes the law the EU could ultimately take ""appropriate remedial measures"". The veto will not be applied if the government assesses that the new law would not create a new regulatory border between GB and NI, or if exceptional circumstances apply. It’s understood the two sides will do more work on this issue, which concerns a new EU law on the protection of geographical indications (GI) for craft and industrial products. The UK is hoping to persuade the EU that existing measures will meet the intention of the new law."
economic indicators,New orders boost growth in private sector,2024-09-15,2024-05-13,Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce7rlzj8pe3o,"A sharp rise in new orders boosted growth in Northern Ireland’s private sector last month, according to a survey by Ulster Bank. Every month the bank asks firms about things like staffing levels, order books and exports in what is considered a reliable indicator of economic performance. It suggests business confidence levels remained high in April and firms in Northern Ireland were taking on staff at a faster rate than anywhere else in the UK. Three of the four sectors - retail, construction and manufacturing - reported a pick up in new orders. Only services, which is the largest part of the economy and includes IT and hospitality, reported a slowdown last month. However, cost pressures remain a significant challenge. The survey suggests firms costs in April rose at the fastest rate in 12 months, as a result of the uplift in the National Living Wage coming into effect, as well as increased shipping costs caused by Red Sea disruption. The bank’s chief economist Richard Ramsey said that despite these challenges firms remained optimistic about the year ahead. “Overall, the latest survey offers encouraging signs about the state of the local private sector,"" he said. “However, the challenges facing the public sector remain and these will impact on parts of the private sector in due course."""
economic indicators,Argentina's Milei defends radical austerity plan,2024-09-15,2024-05-06,By Ione Wells,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-68935255,"Argentina's President Javier Milei has denied that it is ordinary Argentines who are paying for his radical austerity measures. In a BBC interview, Mr Milei, who campaigned with a chainsaw to symbolise his desire to slash public spending, insisted that the political class were paying for his huge cuts, not the people.   The right-wing economist was voted in after years of high government spending and high debt. Inflation is now starting to fall after it initially soared when he took office in December, but it remains the highest in the world annually. The president's critics argue millions of Argentines are paying the price for his austerity programme.  In the five months since he was sworn in, he has slashed public sector jobs, energy and transport subsidies, and the value of the currency so people's money is worth less than it was. Meeting him for the interview in his presidential office, there were clues to his unconventional political background as a celebrity TV economics pundit: a photo of the Rolling Stones (he was in a tribute band), a bust of himself on the desk, a toy model with a chainsaw, and a water bottle with a photo of himself on it.   Gifts from his fans, his team said.  His face lit up with glee when he told me his favourite Rolling Stones song is Rip This Joint, which he said was off an album with ""libertarian components"".  Since he became president, he has maintained his radical rhetoric about the economy, but has toned it down on other issues.  He refused to repeat his past criticism of China, one of Argentina's biggest trading partners, a nation which he labelled an ""assassin"" during his presidential campaign. As far as economics is concerned, he has made cutting inflation, which stands at 287% annually, his clear priority, arguing that ""the most regressive tax that most afflicts people is inflation"". But many of his policies have caused prices to rise in the short term, at a time when salaries and pensions are not keeping up with inflation.  Julia is one of those who can no longer make ends meet on her monthly pension of about US$190 (£150).   The 72-year-old retired chef travels two hours every day to supplement her meagre pension by singing in Buenos Aires.  It is the common people who are suffering, she told me, in tears.  Confronted with her statement, President Milei said this was ""false"".  He insisted that the brunt of the burden was being borne by what he called the political corporation, claiming that 90% of the cuts were falling on the political class and only 10% were achieved through cutting government spending on pensions. Independent analysts say spending on pensions has been cut by 30-40% in real terms - with some saying this makes it one of the biggest government spending cuts. In his interview with the BBC, President Milei celebrated the fact that his administration had managed to lower spending to a level below tax income for the first time since 2008. When repeatedly asked what he would say to pensioners like Julia who are struggling, he said: ""You can't make a macroeconomic evaluation based on the situation of an individual.""  He argued people were being influenced by information spread by the ""rotten"" mass media and journalists, whom he described as ""serial liars"".  When it was put to him that the information that people had access to were prices on shelves, such as the price of milk, which has doubled since he took office, he said: ""You don't do economics based on the price of an individual asset.""  He defended his policies to the BBC, saying that ""there is no magic, real life needs time"".  ""What would have been the alternative? To continue to print money like the previous administration that generates inflation and ends up affecting the most vulnerable?""  Mr Milei insisted his economic programme was helping the most vulnerable - for example, by increasing some welfare benefits such as support for unemployed people with children to buy food.   He said economic indicators were ""improving"" and that ""in the last month, salaries beat inflation"". But many Argentines say they are not convinced by his argument.  Vanessa López, who works at a soup kitchen in a poor neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, said demand for their service had increased. ""It's not only people who are homeless, there are entire families that come looking for a plate of food."" Some of the president's fans are willing to give him time. Nicolás Vargas said he and his partner Ornella struggled to make enough to cover the basics. But he said Argentina's economic crisis was something that ""has been going on for a long time, even decades, and it cannot be fixed in two, three, four months, even a year"". ""I have that faith. I estimate it will take two years. In other words, this year is the year of recovery."" This sentiment is shared by President Milei, who insisted in the interview that he did not care how many people criticised him, because of his ""conviction"" that ""a better future is getting closer"".  The full interview is available on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds or you can listen to Ione Wells discuss her interview with President Milei on The Global Story podcast. "
economic indicators,US inflation jumps as fuel and housing costs rise,2024-09-15,2024-04-10,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68781482,"Consumer prices in the US rose faster than expected last month, in a sign that the fight to slow inflation has stalled. Prices rose 3.5% over the 12 months to March, up from 3.2% in February, the US Labor Department said.  Higher costs for fuel, housing, dining out and clothing drove the increase. Analysts warned that the lack of progress in curbing price rises will force the US central bank to keep interest rates higher for longer. Higher rates help stabilise prices by making it more expensive to borrow for business expansions and other spending. In theory, that in turn slows the economy, and eases the pressures pushing up prices.  The Federal Reserve's key interest rate is now at the highest level in more than two decades, in the range of 5.25%-5.5%. Forecasters had expected the bank to start lowering borrowing costs this year, reflecting the fact that the inflation rate, which tracks the pace of price rises, has fallen significantly since hitting 9.1% in 2022. But recent economic data, including strong jobs creation figures last week, has raised doubts about how soon those cuts might come. Shares on Wall Street closed lower on Wednesday as investors had been betting that rates could soon be cut. Analysts, who once expected rate cuts as soon as March, have been rapidly revising bets, with many now not expecting any until later this summer and some predicting the bank could wait until next year. What the Fed decides to do is likely to shape decisions by central banks around the world, said Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Diversified Funds. ""The Fed has got some head scratching to do and if other central banks were waiting for the Fed to move, they have got a conundrum on their hands now,"" he said.  Inflation cooled rapidly over 2023 as pandemic-era supply issues healed and the spike in food and energy prices sparked by the war in Ukraine faded, but it still remains higher than the bank's 2% target. An uptick in oil prices in recent months has also pushed energy costs higher, while prices for services show little sign of stabilising.  The Labor Department said prices had jumped 0.4% from March to February, the same as in February. Higher petrol and housing costs accounted for more than half the increase.  Car insurance, medical care and costs for internet also contributed. So-called core inflation, which is seen by economists as a better indicator of future trends because it does not include more volatile food and energy prices, stood at 3.8%, the same as in February.  ""We shouldn't overreact to the jump in headline inflation - which was all about energy,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. But he added: ""The details are not at all reassuring for the Fed."""
economic indicators,Business activity drops for tenth month running,2024-09-15,2020-01-13,By Richard Morgan,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-51088867,"Business activity in Northern Ireland has declined for the tenth month running, according to a survey by Ulster Bank.  Last year was the weakest year for private sector output, orders and employment growth in seven years.  Output and new orders declined, but companies increased staffing levels, the survey said. Reluctance among customers to spend and uncertainty around Brexit continued to impact negatively on business activity. However Ulster Bank's chief economist Richard Ramsey said there are signs of Northern Ireland's downturn easing.  ""Brexit uncertainty dogged private sector performance throughout 2019 but there has been a notable pick-up in sentiment,"" Mr Ramsey said.  ""Greater clarity around Brexit and political direction following the general election is a factor. ""All sectors have become more optimistic about the year ahead with retailers the only sector not anticipating growth over the next twelve months."" Construction firms are said to expect activity to increase over the next year for the first time in 18 months."
economic indicators,Engineers report another strong quarter,2024-09-15,2017-06-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-40125081,"Scotland's engineering and manufacturing sector has recorded a third strong quarter in a row, an industry survey has found. Scottish Engineering's latest quarterly review suggested an improvement in orders and output on the previous two three-month periods. It also found ""particularly strong"" growth in staffing levels. The industry body said it showed engineering firms were ""gritting their teeth"" in tough economic conditions. According to the survey of 320 companies, positive output figures were reported by electronics firms, fabricators, machine shops and mechanical equipment businesses. UK orders in general were similar to the first quarter of this year, while export orders also remained positive. Employee numbers generally showed a ""marked improvement "" across small, medium and large companies over the previous quarter.  In general terms, levels of optimism among small and medium sized firms remained positive, but there was a more negative outlook from large companies. Scottish Engineering said some sections of the engineering industry were looking to improve on the last quarter's predictions.  Fabricators indicated high hopes for UK orders in the next quarter, although some saw exports declining compared with the last quarter. Scottish Economy Secretary Keith Brown welcomed the figures and said: ""The latest Scottish Engineering Quarterly Review figures show some positive signs for the engineering and manufacturing sector in Scotland with the report signalling expansions in output, orders and staffing levels in the second quarter of 2017. ""Furthermore, the survey's output volume indicator was at its highest in almost 7 years, suggesting that our engineering and manufacturing sector has picked up in the first half of the year.  ""The figures come after the 2017 EY Scotland Attractiveness Survey confirmed 2016 was a record breaking year for foreign direct investment into Scotland. For the second year in a row we have attracted more projects than ever before and Scotland has been the top UK region outside London in every one of the past five years."" He added:""As these figures together show, our economy remains resilient and the Scottish government will continue to do all we can to support growth."""
economic indicators,Economy continues to show signs of improvement,2024-09-15,2023-04-17,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65275557,"Positive signs of improvements in the Northern Ireland economy continued last month, according to an Ulster Bank survey. Every month the bank surveys firms in the private sector. They are asked about things like their staffing levels, order books and exports, in what is considered to be a reliable indicator of economic performance. Private sector growth in March rose at its fastest rate in a year. This was boosted by improved consumer confidence, with only London recording a sharper rate of growth among the UK regions. Inflationary pressures continued to ease in terms of both input costs and output prices but are still above the pre-pandemic long-term average. Growth was reported across all sectors in the survey, except construction. Ulster Bank chief economist Richard Ramsey said: ""Lack of a Stormont executive and a paralysis in decision-making is being felt and will continue to be felt in this sector.  ""This is reflected in the new-orders indicator, which has indicated declines for 21 months running. ""Whilst we are seeing notable short-term improvements and firms are relatively optimistic for the year ahead, there are lots of challenges that will impact on future growth."" Mr Ramsey added: ""The slowdown in the global economy is one factor but the outlook for the public finances is also bleak and this is compounded by the ongoing lack of a functioning Stormont executive.  ""Meanwhile, households will continue to battle with a cost-of-living crisis."" It comes as Danske bank has upgraded its forecast for the Northern Ireland economy this year, although a contraction is still expected. A report from the bank says the fall in annual economic output is expected to be about 0.3% in 2023 due to high inflation and changes to the economic policy environment. Previously the bank forecast a 1% fall in activity this year. However, it says the outlook is ""highly uncertain"".  Things are expected to pick up next year, with the bank forecasting that the Northern Ireland economy will grow by about 0.9% in 2024.  Danske Bank's chief economist Conor Lambe said: ""The economy has proved more resilient than previously expected and the labour market remains in a relatively robust position.  ""We still expect annual economic output to fall this year in Northern Ireland and the wider UK but we have revised our forecasts upwards relative to our previous report. Mr Lambe added: ""Persistent inflation is still a risk to the economic outlook, with inflation in the UK remaining near its multi-decade high. ""Although we think it has likely peaked, the rate of price rises is still expected to remain above its 2% target throughout this year.  ""If inflation remains higher than forecast and declines more slowly than anticipated, it has the potential to constrain economic activity even further."" Danske says it expects the rate of jobs growth to slow sharply this year.  The bank is forecasting the unemployment rate in Northern Ireland will average about 3.2% in 2023 before increasing to an annual average of about 3.5% in 2024.  However, the professional, scientific and technical services and information and communication sectors are expected to see high rates of jobs growth of 8.3% and 2.2% respectively. "
economic indicators,NI economic output falls slightly in second quarter,2024-09-15,2022-09-29,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-63076590,"Northern Ireland's economy began to lose momentum in the second quarter of this year, the latest official data suggests. Economic output was 2.4% higher than the same period last year but fell by 0.1% compared to the first quarter. That weaker short-term performance was mainly related to the service sector, which is the largest part of the economy. Retail sales figures were particularly weak, falling 2.4% over the quarter. The figures come the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) and are broadly in line with the wider UK performance. Nisra said that while Northern Ireland output had fallen back marginally, it broadly remained at a 15-year high point. However Northern Ireland's economy still remains 0.2% smaller than the peak of the 2007 housing bubble. Latest official figures for the construction sector also point to weakness in that sector: output was down by almost 4% on an annual basis and by 0.6% on the quarter. Construction has faced acute pressures from rising material costs and supply chain delays. The Nisra figures cover a time period before the ""mayhem which followed Friday's mini-budget"" but a ""nevertheless very interesting,"" according to the Ulster University Business School's senior economist Esmond Birnie. He suggested it was ""very likely"" that Northern Ireland along with the rest of the UK has ""already entered into recession"". ""Latest indicators at the UK-wide level suggest that UK output will decline in the third quarter,"" he said.  ""It is overwhelmingly likely that Northern Ireland will do likewise."" Mr Birnie added: ""Commentators such as the Bank of the England or the international body OECD were already predicting that next year would be characterised by close-to-zero growth or even negative growth even before the mayhem which followed Friday's mini-budget."" Prime Minister Liz Truss told BBC Radio Kent that the action taken in the past week had opened up new road projects and new infrastructure projects. But one industry body says that's not enough to help businesses in Northern Ireland. Mark Spence, from the Construction Employers Federation said: ""That will benefit some of the companies based in Northern Ireland who work in GB. Unfortunately in terms of infrastructure in Northern Ireland, that all comes out of the block grant we get from Westminster. ""What's clear is that block grant isn't increasing, we're living within a finite budget, and the problem is that the raging inflationary costs within construction means you get much less for the same budget."" Many construction deals are done based on a fixed price contract - a sum that is agreed before the work is started, and doesn't depend on the length of time the work will take.  Mr Spence said: ""The amount of construction available to be done within the public-sector budget is decreasing day on day. ""There are companies out there today that had started contracts before these costs really kicked in who undoubtedly are incurring a loss just to complete those contracts, but they're completing them. They're taking the hit. ""But they'll be very careful before they sign the next contract."""
economic indicators,House price growth at six-year low,2024-09-15,2019-04-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47960657,"House prices rose in February at the slowest rate since September 2012 while in London house prices fell, the Office for National Statistics said. Average house prices increased by 0.6% in the year to February 2019 but fell by 3.8% in London. The ONS said inflation was stable at 1.9% in March as a rise in fuel prices from February was offset by falls in food prices. The figures ease pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. The Bank of England targets inflation - the rate of price increases  - at 2% and last month kept rates unchanged at  0.75%, where they have been since August last year. The ONS said there had been a slowdown in house price growth over the past two years. The average UK house price was £226,000 in February, £1,000 higher than a year ago. The fall in London house prices was the largest fall since mid-2009, but the city remains the most expensive place to buy property with an average price of £460,000. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the fall in London house prices was the largest since the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis. ""This follows efforts by policymakers to cut down on riskier mortgage lending, though clearly uncertainty over Brexit will have played a large part in the capital's faltering housing market,"" he said. Other indicators have pointed to a subdued housing market. Halifax, the UK's biggest lender, said earlier this month that property prices had fallen by 1.6% in March compared with February. At 1.9%, the latest inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Prices Index, was a little lower than the 2% that had been forecast by economists. Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: ""Inflation is stable, with motor fuel prices rising between February and March this year, offset by falls in food prices as well as the cost of computer games growing more slowly than it did at this time last year."" Inflation in the games, toys and hobby sector fell to 1.1% in March from 3.1% in February helping to keep a lid on the overall basket of prices. Average petrol prices were 1.2p per litre higher at 120.3p. Mr Brettell said the inflation number made the Bank of England's job easier ""as there's no pressure to raise rates as it grapples with continued uncertainty over Brexit"". Howard Archer, economic adviser to the EY Item Club of forecasts said it was ""decent news for both consumers and the Bank of England"". It comes after data on Tuesday had shown that average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, rose 3.4% in the three months to February and the unemployment rate lower than at any time since the end of 1975. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will meet next month to discuss rates. Mr Archer said: ""Despite a tight labour market, it is difficult to see the Bank of England raising interest rates at their May meeting or any time soon, amid likely MPC concern that prolonged Brexit uncertainties will likely to weigh down on the economy"". However,  Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the inflation data would not give the MPC ""breathing space"" to keep rates on hold because ""the labour market is still tightening and the economy is coping with Brexit uncertainty"". The Bank of England has said that economic outlook would continue to depend ""significantly on the nature and timing of EU withdrawal"". In the short-term economists say pressure on inflation could come from household energy prices  in April when energy regulator Ofgem increases its price cap by 10%. Mr Archer said it was ""questionable""  whether earnings growth can continue as the growth in wages dipped to a five-month low of 3.2% in the month of February."
economic indicators,US business levels fall sharply amid coronavirus,2024-09-15,2020-02-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51591070,"Business activity in the US service sector fell last month for the first time since 2013, hurt by the coronavirus, according to a survey. The drop came amid a ""notable worsening"" in the services sector, which includes finance and retail, the IHS Markit research firm reported. New orders received by private sector firms also declined for the first time since 2009, it said. US financial markets fell sharply following the report. The latest IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index data found that services business activity fell to 49.4, from 53.4 in January, while manufacturing output slowed to 50.8, compared to 51.9 in January, a six-month low.  The combined score was 49.6, down from 53.3 in the opening month of 2020. Anything below 50 indicates contraction. The report added to fears spurred by recent trends in the bond markets, which suggest investors see the risks of holding short and long-term government debt as increasingly similar. That comparison is often tracked as an indicator of possible recession. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.7%, while the S&P 500 dropped about 0.9% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was more than 1% lower. Investors also turned to US government debt, considered a less risky investment, driving the prices up and yields on bonds down.  The IHS survey found that manufacturing output was hurt by delivery delays from China, while services industries such as travel also took a hit. Executives also reported spending more cautiously, amid questions about the upcoming presidential election and worries about the possibility of a wider economic slowdown.   The survey found a modest rise in business confidence, suggesting that executives are hopeful the slowdown will prove short-lived. But the rate of contraction last month was still severe, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS. ""With the exception of the government shutdown of 2013, US business activity contracted for the first time since the global financial crisis in February,"" he said.  In recent weeks, companies around the world, including Apple, sportswear firms, airlines and carmakers, have reported slowdowns.  But analysts have said that the US - where consumer spending drives much of the economy - should be relatively insulated from the effects, assuming the coronavirus outbreak wanes relatively soon. US jobs growth beat expectations last month, while the overall economy is growing at about 2.1%, according to the most recent government figures. However, traders are also now anticipating the Federal Reserve will move to cut interest rates further this year, although the head of the central bank said at its most recent meeting that it did not think the economy needed additional help.  The IHS Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) report will raise fears about the country's underlying economic health, said Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics, adding that the contraction in the service sector - which includes industries like healthcare - was especially alarming.  However, he added: ""We have a hard time believing the apparent message...that the economy is on the brink of a recession. ""Unless job creation and consumer confidence suddenly craters, it's difficult to see how the new downside risks that have emerged in recent months would be enough to sink the entire economy."""
economic indicators,House prices in 'largest monthly fall for 11 years',2024-09-15,2020-06-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52888991,"House prices fell 1.7% in May from the previous month, the largest monthly fall for 11 years, according to the Nationwide. Annual house price growth halved from 3.7% to 1.8%, as the coronavirus crisis hit market activity. The latest HMRC data showed that residential property transactions fell 53% in April compared with 2019. ""The medium-term outlook for the housing market remains highly uncertain,"" the Nationwide warned. ""We have already seen a sharp economic contraction as a result of the necessary measures adopted to suppress the spread of the virus,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. But he pointed out that the raft of policies adopted to support the economy should ""set the stage for a rebound once the shock passes"" and help limit long-term damage. ""These same measures should also help ensure the impact on the housing market will ultimately be less than would normally be associated with an economic shock of this magnitude,"" he predicted. The figures are based on Nationwide's lending data, do not include cash purchases, and may have a greater volatility owing to the very low levels of activity. Yet, the big month-to-month drop in Nationwide's house price index in May - the largest since February 2009 - ""is just the start of a protracted decline over the remainder of this year,"" warned Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Before the pandemic struck the UK, the housing market had been steadily gathering momentum, the Nationwide said.  Activity levels and price growth were edging up thanks to continued robust labour market conditions, low borrowing costs and a more stable political backdrop following the general election. ""Behavioural changes and social distancing are likely to impact the flow of housing transactions for some time,"" Mr Gardner said.  Recent Nationwide research suggested that one in eight people had put off moving because of the lockdown.   But the majority saw the current situation as a temporary pause in the market, with would-be buyers planning to wait six months on average before looking to enter the market. Early indicators of housing demand have picked up since in-person property viewings were permitted again on 13 May, said Pantheon Macroeconomics.  It said the daily volume of Google searches for the three main property portals had increased to be just 13% below its pre-lockdown level, having been down 50% in April. ""Relatively few people likely will be forced to sell their homes, given that mortgage payment holidays are easily available and home ownership has declined,"" said Mr Tombs.  ""Nonetheless, the huge size of the blow from Covid-19 to households' incomes and the deterioration in consumers' confidence suggests that house prices must drop."" He predicted a 5% fall in prices by the end of the third quarter of the year. Separate figures from the Bank of England show how the mortgage market decelerated sharply alongside the house sales shutdown. Some 15,848 mortgage approvals for house purchases were recorded in April - about 80% below February levels before the coronavirus crisis took hold, the Bank said. This was around half the number of approvals taking place in the trough during the financial crisis, and the lowest since the figures started in 1993. Approvals for re-mortgaging fell by a lesser extent during the month, to 34,400, some 34% lower than in February. The UK's financial watchdog has confirmed the support firms should give to mortgage customers who are either coming to the end of a payment holiday or who are yet to request one. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said last month that homeowners struggling financially due to coronavirus would be able to extend their mortgage payment holiday for a further three months, or cut payments. On Tuesday, it confirmed customers yet to apply for a payment holiday have until 31 October 2020 to do so. Meanwhile the current ban on lender repossessions of homes will be continued to 31 October. ""The measures we have confirmed today will mean anyone who needs to can get help from their lender, if they are still struggling to pay their mortgage due to coronavirus,"" said Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive at the FCA. ""It is important that if a consumer can afford to re-start mortgage payments, it is in their best interests to do so. Customers should talk to their firm about the best option available for them."" On Friday, the Nationwide's chief executive, Joe Garner, argued that it would be prudent for extensions to mortgage holidays to be marked temporarily on a borrower's credit file.  However, the FCA said the current guidance - that taking a deferral should not have a negative impact on a borrower's credit file - should continue. The regulator pointed out that lenders could still use details obtained from other sources, such as bank account information, when making their decisions on whether to grant other loans."
economic indicators,Analysis: Unrest in Abkhazia,2024-09-15,2014-05-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27607559,"Opposition leader Raul Khadzhimba addressing protesters in front of the presidential office in Sukhumi Unrest has erupted in one of the least understood conflict zones of the former USSR: the tiny, impoverished Black Sea territory of Abkhazia. It broke away from Georgia after a ferocious war two decades ago and has since been supported mainly by Russia.   Here Michael Cecire, external, an expert on the region at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia, answers questions for BBC News.      The frustration is likely to be real. Russia, and the de facto Abkhazian government, promised that the 2014 Sochi Olympics would be a boon to the Abkhazian economy, but it was anything but. The Olympics were billed as a way of boosting the economy by bringing tourism to Abkhazia or sourcing materials for construction, but the most noticeable effect was actually a source of frustration: the expanded security cordon that penetrated beyond the Russia-Abkhazia border. Some of Abkhazia's economic problems can certainly be attributed to the de facto government, but it is Russia that has the real power to improve conditions. For example, the Moscow-financed building boom in Chechnya has improved material conditions (even if human rights remain a deep problem), but nothing comparable has happened in Abkhazia. However, even this is only a part of the story. The opposition has certainly cited economic conditions as a major grievance, but the chief point of contention is President Alexander Ankvab's more liberal (relatively speaking) policy towards ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia, primarily concentrated in the Gali region. Mr Ankvab has advocated more fully integrating them into Abkhazian society, which includes giving them passports and Abkhazian ""citizenship"". The opposition, led by Raul Khadzhimba, has painted this as a purely political ploy by Mr Ankvab to expand his electoral base (they accused the late former President, Sergei Bagapsh, of the same) and say these policies could endanger Abkhazia's ethnic Abkhazian identity.  Mr Khadzhimba has also accused the Ankvab government of kowtowing to Moscow. Though there is a political consensus in favour of a security alliance with Russia, Mr Khadzhimba's opposition does not wish to allow Russians to buy Abkhazian property or to see Sukhumi integrate too closely within Russia. It is unclear just how much of a believer Mr Khadzhimba is - he is a former KGB officer and was once seen as Moscow's favoured politician. His political transformation suggests that his ideals are rather pliable, but he also may feel spurned by his former patrons. All we really know is that Mr Khadzhimba truly believes he should be in power. As for Mr Ankvab, his political longevity depends largely on Russia. If they see abandoning him as politically expedient, he will face a much more difficult time regaining power. He is an ethno-nationalist. He is not anti-Russia, as there is little room in the political landscape for anti-Moscow sentiments, but he has campaigned strongly against further integration with Russia at the expense of Abkhazian independence. His platform is to preserve the ethnic Abkhazian character of the state versus Mr Ankvab's broader view of citizenship. By all indications, he was actively backed by the Russians in his electoral contest against Bagapsh in 2004. Russian President Vladimir Putin even reportedly campaigned for him and, after he lost, there was a chilly period between Moscow and Abkhazia until a compromise was found. It was not a surprise. The opposition actually submitted a 5 May ultimatum to Mr Ankvab in late April for him to dismiss his government and make radical reforms. His response was essentially a shrug, so it was really only a matter of time until the opposition launched protests. The opposition's ability to quickly rally and force Mr Ankvab and his government to vacate is a more surprising development, but it was never unimaginable. I do not see the Kremlin or the Georgians involved in this. However, Russia may go with the more politically expedient choice if it becomes clear that Mr Ankvab cannot maintain stability. If Mr Khadzhimba gains power, the likelihood that Gali Georgians will see large-scale re-enfranchisement will strongly diminish, but the relationship with Russia is not likely to change appreciably. There may be a slowdown, or even some reversal, in Abkhazia's integration with Russia, but Mr Khadzhimba has not given any indication that he is willing to turn to Georgia or the West as an alternative. That means Sukhumi will continue to be reliant on Moscow for its budget and economy.    Not especially, other than popular anger against an incumbent who is accused of presiding over a diminishing, corrupt economy.   Abkhazia leader 'flees protests' Five years on, Georgia makes up with Russia Georgia in Sochi warning to Russia Abkhazia profile"
economic indicators,Starting pay 'rises sharply' as staff supply falls,2024-09-15,2021-07-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-57729288,"Starting salaries continued to rise sharply at Scottish firms last month as the supply of job candidates in some sectors fell away, a survey has found.  The latest RBS Report on Jobs said recruiters noted candidate shortages for both permanent and temporary posts. The lack of supply was attributed by some respondents to ""a reluctance among candidates to switch roles due to Covid-19 related uncertainty"". Brexit and off-payroll working tax rules were also cited for the shortage. For permanent positions, the rate of decline in supply was the fastest since March 2019, while firms signalled the steepest downturn in temp staff supply in the survey's history. The shortage came as hiring activity at Scottish businesses surged again last month, in line with easing Covid-19 restrictions and rising economic activity.  An upturn in permanent placements was slower than in May but was still rapid overall, while temp billings growth also remained historically elevated.  Panellists in the survey suggested the shortage of candidates for permanent roles had ""placed upwards pressure"" on pay, with the rate of increase among the steepest on record. Recruiters across Scotland also recorded a further increase in average hourly wages for short-term staff during June.  Temp wages have now risen in all but one of the past nine months. Demand for permanent staff across Scotland rose sharply again during June, with the fastest rise since data collection began in January 2003.  Across the monitored sectors, IT and computing registered the quickest increase in vacancies, followed by engineering and construction. Recruiters across Scotland also registered a further rise in the number of temporary vacancies during June. Blue collar posts saw the strongest rise in the number of temp vacancies, followed by IT and computing. RBS chief economist Sebastian Burnside said the June data pointed to a ""sustained rebound"" of the Scottish jobs market. Earlier this week, a Scottish Chambers of Commerce survey suggested Scottish businesses were seeing ""shoots of recovery"" for the first time in over a year as Covid-19 restrictions began to lift. Its latest quarterly economic indicator indicated more positive growth across all sectors, with firms reporting substantial rises in confidence and domestic sales. However, while companies were optimistic about sales revenue in the third quarter of this year, they are more cautious around investment and staff levels. They also expressed greater concern over inflation, as more consumers spend savings accumulated over the last 16 months. SCC president Tim Allan said: ""The success of the vaccine rollout has enabled the easing of restrictions and the gradual reopening of the economy, unleashing pent-up demand in the economy.  ""This has allowed some sectors to rebound more quickly than others. ""However, the route to economic recovery will be a marathon, not a sprint."" "
economic indicators,Trump knows economic meltdown brings political pain,2024-09-15,2020-03-26,By Anthony Zurcher,https://www.bbc.com/news/52053676,"The latest US unemployment numbers were predicted to be catastrophic. The actual total, 3.3 million, turned out to be even worse than expected.  The record-breaking amount reflects a US economy put into deep-freeze almost overnight. The government-ordered shutdown hasn't just shuttered businesses temporarily, it has vaporised the jobs of millions of Americans - many of whom are the particularly vulnerable hourly service workers who live paycheque to paycheque. The stock market free-fall and early reports of layoffs foreshadowed Thursday's grim news, prompting Congress to craft its largest-ever aid package, which passed the US Senate Wednesday night. The test now will be whether the multi-trillion-dollar relief will do enough, quickly enough, to staunch the bleeding. What's clear at this point, however, is the physical disease that is afflicting tens of thousands of Americans and growing will be accompanied by an economic ailment that adversely affects the lives of millions.  Like Congress, the White House has also seen the coming economic tsunami - and what it could portend. Earlier this week, Donald Trump said he was anxious to reopen businesses and get Americans back to work, representing a shift of focus from earlier statements about doing everything possible to stop the spread of the virus.  The political reality for Trump is there will be very real consequences for his presidency not only if the US death toll from the coronavirus pandemic continues to mount, but also if the US spirals into a deep recession. While this is uncharted territory, a nation in economic turmoil early in an election year is a serious threat to a president's political hopes. There are few more reliable indicators of ballot-box success or failure than the state of the economy.  When times are bad, financial hardship becomes a roar that drowns out all other concerns. For the moment, the president has seen a modest rise in his public approval ratings, suggesting the possibility of a rally-around-the-leader effect, as Americans accept hardship in order to overcome an external threat. While there's been nothing quite like this in modern US history, past crises - such as the 1990 Gulf War and the 9/11 attacks - produced ever more marked surges in presidential support. In both cases, however, those numbers eventually dropped, whether due to the long grind of suffering or an economic downturn.  George W Bush's numbers after the attack on the World Trade Center and subsequent Iraq War held up long enough for him to win re-election. His father, George HW Bush, whose post-Gulf War glory quickly faded with the onset of a recession, was not so fortunate. Trump's call for the nation to get back to work has been echoed by other conservatives who are more bluntly suggesting that aggressive measures to save American lives may not be worth the extended economic distress they require.  The president's rhetoric sets up a potential conflict in the coming days with many governors, Republican and Democrat, who have the ultimate authority in their states and will be reluctant to ease the restrictions on their populations. The move might allow Trump to deflect some of the blame for the ongoing economic pain, however.  ""You should have done it my way"" is a more politically defensible position than ""my way has caused you this pain, but it's worth it"". There's also the possibility that some Trump-friendly governors might be inclined to side with the president, setting up sharp divides within the nation between some states that opt for an extended lockdown and others that ease their restrictions. For instance, the governor of Mississippi recently issued an order essentially limiting the ability of the state's local officials to impose their own business-closure orders. Trump has also lashed out at a familiar foe, the US press. In a Wednesday night tweet, he accused the ""lamestream media"" of pushing for businesses to remain closed as a way of undermining his re-election hopes. ""The real people want to get back to work ASAP,"" Trump wrote. It's an indication that the coming general election campaign is very much on the president's mind. Already the president's political opponents are sharpening their attacks, sensing a long-term vulnerability on his handling of the viral outbreak. Priorities USA Actions, a liberal group, has begun airing an advert using audio clips of Trump's early dismissiveness of the threat of the virus superimposed over a chart of the growing number of cases in the US. The president's campaign has filed a cease-and-desist letter to remove the spot from the air, noting that one of the quotes suggests Trump called the virus a hoax, when in fact he was referring to media coverage of it.  There is ample evidence of the president downplaying the threat the virus posed in the early days of the outbreak, however. Whether or not the president's lawsuit is successful, if the medical and economic pain continues to grow, there will be similar adverts coming in the days ahead. Three million Americans without jobs - 3m Americans facing desperate times and open to desperate measures - has the potential to be a powerfully destabilising political force.   Congress's aid package, with its one-time payments to individuals and expanded unemployment benefits, is aimed at ameliorating some of the economic pain and avoiding massive unrest. If Thursday's job numbers is just the first wave of an economic onslaught, however, it may not nearly be enough. And the president seems to sense this.  Follow Anthony on Twitter"
economic indicators,Turbulence and trade-offs: Why economics matters,2024-09-15,2019-07-07,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48903058,"Readers - a quick hello from me, the BBC's new economics editor. I'm going to be writing about almost everything from a economic perspective, and breaking some interesting stories on this blog. Here is my first high altitude take: The economy is at a crossroads in the UK. The indications right now are consistent with a stalling economy, perhaps a contracting one, meaning there is even a small possibility we are in recession. Those signals are coming from economic data, from soft corporate results and they are raising expectations that an unwanted item could be awaiting the new Prime Minister and Chancellor - the first negative quarter for the economy for 7 years. The wider European economy is not in the rudest of health either, with Germany's manufacturing juggernaut slowing down sharply and Italy's chronic fiscal problems exacerbated by its unstable government. An unprecedented double-edged challenge to seamless trade comes from the erratic and unpredictable Brexit negotiations, affecting everything from the price of cheese to the flow of manufacturing parts, and the post-Brexit novelty - for some the very essence of EU withdrawal - of the UK fighting its own corner in choppy global trade seas. Over the next 12 months, it won't be about projections, forecasts and crystal balls - the impact of increasingly likely fundamental changes to trading arrangements with the UK's biggest single trade partner will become tangible, observable and impossible to ignore. The seeds of this economic uncertainty were sown long ago. What we are seeing right now in global politics is, at least partly, the culmination of a decade-long Roadrunner moment after the trauma of the financial crisis. That moment could and perhaps should have given rise to an immediate global round of trade protectionism, economic nationalism and turbulent diplomacy.  It did not then. But it was merely postponed rather than entirely prevented. The consequences appear to be with us now in the form of a slow motion global trade war, with tariffs, tensions and declining co-operation. It was the action of central bankers, above all, in printing money, pumping trillions of pounds, dollars, euros and yen, that stalled an immediate political reaction to the 2008 financial collapse. But the quantitative easing anaesthetic has now worn off and its unwanted side effects are also still being felt in inflated house and other asset prices, and cuts to living standards that are now starting to reverse, but workers, especially the under 50s' have barely recovered from a living standards lost decade. So, no surprise at the fertile conditions created by economics for a global political backlash against, well, almost everything really.  But that volatile political brew is now making economics even more difficult to predict. Central bankers, such as Mario Draghi and Mark Carney, commanded volatile markets in uncertain times with force of will, rhetoric, and their institutions' ballooning balance sheets. It seemed like a free lunch. The bill always arrives eventually and seems likely to be the dilemma of their successors. The real question is how far does this now go? China and the US continue to spar over everything from soya to steel. The fundamental axis of the entire world economy, since the 2001 accession of China to the World Trade Organisation, seems to be breaking before our eyes. The workshops of the world are under strain. The unofficial Sino-US compact that saw manufacturing and jobs outsourced East, and in return, dirt cheap prices, cheap dollar lending and raised living standards exported back West, unravels with unknowable consequences. Before the crisis, the presumption in the US and Europe was that the East would become more like the West. Open economies would bring more prosperity and more open democracy, and a smaller size of the state. Perhaps we are, in fact, becoming more like them. The financial crisis has had an enduring political legacy. Where the state stepped in most spectacularly to bail out the banks, in the US and here in the UK, public opinion seems now more comfortable with governments at least claiming to be stepping in, not stepping back. President Trump promises Rust Belt workers that he will back them by starting trade wars that are ""easy to win"". But it was his predecessor who won an election partly after a boast that he had kept ""General Motors alive"", and whose chief trade negotiator warned that Americans were not buying into the idea that cheap T-shirts were a price worth paying for lost jobs. Here, a Conservative leadership campaign competes over endless public spending promises, with MPs lobbied with a message of ""spend spend spend"". The successful Brexit referendum message was fundamentally about a stronger British state, with more money promised to be spent on public services. So there will be a tidal wave of economic news in the coming months from a new fiscal approach, a possible return to the polls, the race for a new Bank of England Governor, Brexit, third party trade negotiations and the China-US tensions. But beyond the financial big picture, other currents are altering the way economics function. Data and unequal access to information, even your own information about yourself which is now in the hands of Big Tech companies is one of the big issues of our time. But this new form of inequality also raises fundamental issues about the economy and also the laws of economics itself, which mostly presume that information is shared perfectly. There are fundamental economic questions which arise from attempts to deal with environmental problems. The biggest one is simply this - are people really willing to adapt their lifestyles or even livelihoods to make the changes deemed necessary for the environment? And in the UK particularly, ageing should totally transform the nature of state spending. Difficult problems, even when they can be seen beyond the clouds of the Brexit process, are being parked, ignored and wished away. Economics is not just about interest rates and sterling values and stock market crises, it is a lens on almost everything around us, from the technology you are using to read this, to the forces shifting the levers of global politics. While the record of economic forecasting is rightly questioned, economics offers an invaluable and revealing way to look at the world's complicated problems. Yes, trade will loom large, but fundamentally, economics is about trade-offs. Trade-offs that many political leaders ignore or actively attempt to deny exist. I am thrilled to return to report this world as BBC economics editor after five years dabbling in covering the mainly dark corners of political dysfunction.   It was in a prominent live interview I did that the contention that this country had ""had enough of experts"" became notorious. I'm not sure that is the case now.

economic indicators,Supermarket mega-merger faces crunch decision,2024-09-15,2019-02-08,By Tom Espiner,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47146133,"A key decision that could reshape the UK's supermarket sector is due at the end of April, with Sainsbury's and Asda waiting to hear if their proposed merger can go ahead. But initial indications do not look good. The UK's competition watchdog has said the proposed tie-up could push up prices and cut choice for customers. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it was ""likely to be difficult"" for the chains to ""address the concerns"". The CMA also said the merger could lead to a ""poorer shopping experience"".   Should the deal go through in spite of those concerns, the combined group would knock Tesco off its perch as the UK's biggest supermarket chain. Sainsbury's and Asda - which is owned by US retail giant Walmart - are the second and third largest supermarket chains in the UK. The UK's grocery market is fiercely competitive. Sainsbury's and Asda are looking to respond to pressure from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, to be more competitive against Tesco, and to be able to counter online threats such as the rise of food delivery apps and Amazon. Richard Lim, chief executive of research consultancy Retail Economics, says the ""biggest driver here is about scale"". For example, by combining their businesses, the firms can push for the lowest prices from suppliers. The idea is that if one supermarket is paying 10p for a tin of beans, while the other is paying 11p, both supermarkets would now be able to pay the lower price. Sainsbury's expects to make cost savings of £350m just from this kind of ""price harmonisation"", Mr Lim says. However, MPs have warned it would not be easy to get the big suppliers to agree to this, meaning thousands of small suppliers could get squeezed. Chief executive Mike Coupe has said Sainsbury's would seek to make the savings from large suppliers, which provide the majority of its goods, rather than squeezing small suppliers. The supermarkets have pledged that as a result of the merger, prices would drop ""by around 10% on many of the products customers buy regularly"". Mr Lim says that, assuming Brexit goes smoothly, Sainsbury's and Asda would be able to pass cost savings on to consumers. However, critics have pointed out that Sainsbury's has not laid out which products would see falls in price, over what time scale, and exactly where the savings are going to come from. The most detail Sainsbury's has given was when Mr Coupe told the Environment Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee: ""We will lower the prices of everyday items. It's 18 months in the future, it's a very competitive market. It is impossible to speculate exactly about what those items will be, but they will be the kinds of things that people buy week in, week out: tinned tomatoes, pasta."" Gary Carter of the GMB union says members are ""worried and stressed"" due to uncertainty about their positions. ""People don't know what the merger will bring,"" he says. ""We've had a lot of comments from people: 'Will I have a job?', 'Will I be made redundant?', 'If I have a new job, who will my new employer be?'"" Asda employees are also wondering whether they would get pay parity with Sainsbury's colleagues, who get higher wages, he says. Mr Lim thinks it's inevitable that there will be job losses as the two firms combine operations. ""In the end it's inevitable to have fewer people working in the combined unit,"" he says. ""The motivation [for the merger] is driving down costs."" A merger between Sainsbury's and Asda, who plan to keep their brands separate, could potentially create a retail giant with more than 2,800 shops in the UK. The CMA launched its investigation into the proposed deal in August 2018. If it decides the merger can go ahead, it is likely to say that the two retailers must sell a certain number of stores to competitors. But the number of stores they have to get rid of, and how profitable those stores are, will determine whether the deal will turn out to be viable. Estimates range from between 70 to 300 stores that would have to be offered for sale. As part of its investigation, the CMA is looking at how closely Sainsbury's and Asda would compete with each other in stores and online, and whether competition from other retailers would be stifled. The scope of the investigation includes groceries, fuel, toys, electrical goods and children's clothing, and it is also looking at the impact on supermarkets' power over suppliers. Now that the CMA has published its provisional findings, supermarkets and other interested parties will be able to comment before the final decision. Chief executive Mike Coupe has described the CMA's analysis as ""fundamentally flawed"" and said the firm will be making ""very strong representations"" to it about its ""inaccuracy and lack of objectivity"". The supermarkets could decide to appeal against the final decision, should it go against them."
economic indicators,Has 'womenomics' worked in Japan?,2024-09-15,2018-02-17,By Reality Check team,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42993519,"Japan's prime minister Shinzo Abe has positioned himself as an enthusiastic advocate of promoting equality in Japanese society.  In a recent session of the Japanese Diet's Budget Committee, Noriko Horiuchi, a member of Mr Abe's Liberal Democratic Party, credited the prime minister's championing of women's advancement as a factor in ""the beginning of a new era in female success"". Does that claim stand up to scrutiny?  A key part of his policy of economic reforms, dubbed 'Abenomics', involves getting more women into the workforce; and the term ""womenomics"" has been used to describe this aspect of his politics.  But despite this rhetoric, Japan has actually slipped in the World Economic Forum's (WEF) global ranking of the gender gap - dropping from 111th in 2016 to 114th in 2017. Ten years ago, it ranked 80th.  The WEF index is derived by looking at several different areas where a gender gap might occur; one of the key ones being economic participation and opportunity.  In the Budget Committee meeting, Mr Abe claimed that over the last five years, the female employment rate had risen, and that it was now higher than that of the United States for women over 25 years of age.  The number of female employees in the workforce has increased since 2012 - and according to 2016 OECD figures, Mr Abe is also correct in saying that the employment rate of women is higher than that of the United States for those who are over 25.  In 2016, Japan's overall female employment rate of 66.1% was well over the OECD average of 59.4%.  However, Atsuko Muraki, visiting professor at Tsuda University and a former vice-minister for Health, Labour and Welfare, says female employment in Japan has increased in quantity but not in quality.  This is borne out by a closer look at the type of work women are doing - only 12.4% of legislators, senior officials and managers are female, according to the WEF figures.  Mr Abe's government enacted a law aimed at achieving gender equality in the workplace in 2015. It made companies with more than 301 employees set targets for increasing women in management and publish their results.  However, there are no penalties for failing to comply.  In 2016 the government revised an ambitious national target of filling 30% of senior positions in both the public and private sectors with women by 2020. The new targets were 7% for senior government jobs and 15% at companies.   The main reason for Japan falling down the rankings in the WEF's index was ""reversals of progress"" in political empowerment.  Mr Abe's 2014 cabinet was noted for equalling the highest number of female Cabinet ministers ever in Japanese history (seven out of 18). However, his current 20-member Cabinet has only two women in it - justice minister Yoko Kamikawa and Seiko Noda, whose brief covers internal affairs, women's empowerment, and social security.  Only 47 out of 465 lawmakers in the House of Representatives are women. Percentage-wise, this is the lowest level in the G8, and also lags behind other countries in the region like South Korea, Indonesia and China.  Mariko Bando, president and chancellor of Showa Women's University in Tokyo, says the political system is partly to blame, but says it is also the responsibility of the country's political parties.  Japan elects its members of parliament in two ways; 289 members are chosen in single-seat constituencies by plurality, and the remaining ones are elected in block districts by proportional representation.  ""The political parties don't put female candidates at the top of the list in the proportional representation system,"" she says. ""First of all political parties themselves have to do more to make efforts to encourage women's participation."" What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

economic indicators,People buy less food at supermarkets as prices rise,2024-09-15,2022-06-24,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61920559,"Households are cutting back on food shopping as the rising cost of living bites into budgets. Nearly half of adults surveyed by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they had bought less food in the past fortnight due to higher prices. The price of food was also the most common reason for why those asked were seeing their monthly outgoings rising overall, the ONS said. Supermarkets Asda and Tesco have said customers are cutting back on shopping. Asda told the BBC that some shoppers are asking cashiers to stop scanning items when the till total hits £30 as they try to cut costs and also switching to budget ranges. Meanwhile, Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket, has said it is seeing early signs that shoppers are changing their habits due to high inflation - the rate at which prices rise - such as buying less food and visiting more frequently. The ONS said its feedback from supermarkets also suggested customers were spending less on their food shop because of the rising cost of living. It found that sales in supermarkets dropped 1.5% in May, with a 2.2% fall in specialist shops such as butchers and bakers. ""Many customers are buying down, particularly with food, choosing value-range items where they might previously have bought premium goods,"" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium. Retail sales overall fell by 0.5% in May, the ONS said, and it also revised down its sales growth figure for April to 0.4% from its previous estimate of 1.4%. Prices overall are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for 40 years, with UK inflation at 9.1%, the highest level since March 1982. The RAC motoring group revealed that the average price of a litre of petrol hit £1.90 for the first time on Thursday, while diesel was edging towards £2 a litre.  Fuel and energy prices are the biggest drivers of inflation, but food costs drove the most recent rise in May, with prices for bread, cereal and meat climbing. Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the ""horror"" of April's unprecedented rise in energy bills ""swallowed a much bigger slice"" of households' income and ""kept their appetite for spending under control"". ""It's not just the rising bills of today that are worrying us, it's the prospect of even higher bills tomorrow, and fears of a looming recession, which might cause our finances to unravel entirely,"" she added. Cutting back on food has emerged as the most tangible evidence of the effect of the soaring cost of living on our household finances. This ONS report chimes with a survey commissioned by the BBC which found 56% of people asked had bought fewer groceries, and the same proportion had skipped meals. The fact that it is food - a necessity for everyone, of course - shows how everyday life is affected, rather than just having fewer holidays or socialising less. By the autumn and winter, the focus may well shift to people heating their homes less. But whether it is heating, eating, or both, people are going to be looking at where they can reduce their spending for some time yet. In a BBC-commissioned survey of more than 4,000 people, 82% said they thought their wages should increase to match the rising price of goods and services. Workers and unions have been pushing for pay rises, with strikes on the railways this week and BA workers at Heathrow voting to strike over the summer. But the government has warned against employers handing out big increases in salaries over fears of a 1970s style ""inflationary spiral"" where firms hike wages and then pass the cost on to customers through even higher prices. The drop in food sales comes as a long-running measure of consumer confidence recorded its lowest score since records began in 1974. Market research firm GfK said its consumer morale index fell to -41 in June from -40 in May, below levels that have previously preceded recessions. The ONS said that while food sales fell, fuel sales volumes rose by 1.1% in May - despite record high petrol prices. Heather Bovill, deputy director for surveys and economic indicators at the ONS, said more workers returning to the office might be the reason in the uptick in fuel sales. But she said the rise, along with boost in clothing sales, were ""offset by falls for household goods and department stores, with retailers in these areas reporting consumer reluctance to spend due to affordability worries and higher prices."" The proportion of online sales slipped back in May but remains substantially higher than before the pandemic, the ONS said. How are you cutting down on your food shopping?

economic indicators,Firms' increased costs 'linked to Brexit red tape',2024-09-15,2021-02-08,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-55952462,"Northern Ireland firms increased their prices last month at the highest rate since 2018, according to an Ulster Bank survey. It says firms saw their costs rise at the highest rate in the UK, largely as a result of higher shipping costs. Every month the bank asks firms across the private sector about things to determine their economic performance. Staffing levels, new orders and exports are considered to be reliable indicators. Ulster Bank's Chief Economist in Northern Ireland Richard Ramsey said: ""Northern Ireland's firms signalled the highest rate of input cost inflation across the UK with input prices rising at the fastest rate since June 2018."" ""Higher shipping costs were widely cited alongside higher raw material costs and increased transport costs linked to the new Brexit arrangements."" ""As a result of these cost pressures, local firms, most notably retailers, hiked the price of their goods and services at the fastest pace since October 2018."" The survey also said output in the private sector fell at the sharpest rate in January since last May because of lockdown restrictions. Mr Ramsey said: ""Profit margins are being squeezed across all sectors but particularly construction."" ""2021 has been the year of the rollout on two fronts. The rollout of the vaccine will be the single biggest factor driving economic performance later in the year.  ""Meanwhile, the rollout of red tape linked to the new Brexit arrangements will hinder Northern Ireland's economic recovery by adding costs to business and restricting trade. ""While Northern Ireland has the advantage of remaining within the EU's single market for goods, it finds itself on the wrong side of a regulatory sea-border which has effectively redrawn the map of the UK's single market and customs union"" he added."
economic indicators,Extreme weather events are 'the new norm',2024-09-15,2021-10-31,By Matt McGrath,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59105963,"Extreme weather events - including powerful heat waves and devastating floods - are now the new normal, says the World Meteorological Organisation. The State of the Climate report for 2021 highlights a world that is ""changing before our eyes."" The 20-year temperature average from 2002 is on course to exceed 1C above pre-industrial levels for the first time. And global sea levels rose to a new high in 2021, according to the study. These latest figures for 2021 are being released early by the WMO to coincide with the start of the UN climate conference in Glasgow known as COP26. The State of the Climate report provides a snapshot of climate indicators including temperatures, extreme weather events, sea level rises and ocean conditions. The study finds that the past seven years including this one are likely to be the warmest on record as greenhouse gases reached record concentrations in the atmosphere. The accompanying rise in temperatures is propelling the planet into ""uncharted territory"" says the report, with increasing impacts across the planet.  ""Extreme events are the new norm,"" said WMO's Prof Petteri Taalas. ""There is mounting scientific evidence that some of these bear the footprint of human-induced climate change."" Prof Taalas detailed some of the extreme events that have been experienced around the world this year.  Another worrying development, according to the WMO study, has been the rise in global sea levels. Since they were first measured by precise satellite-based systems in the early 1990s, sea levels went up by 2.1mm per year between 1993 and 2002. But from 2013 to 2021 the rise has more than doubled to 4.4mm, mostly as a result of accelerated ice loss from glaciers and ice sheets.  ""Sea levels are rising faster now than at any other time in the last two millennia,"" said Prof Jonathan Bomber, Director of the Bristol Glaciology Centre. ""If we continue on our current trajectory, that rise could exceed 2m by 2100 displacing some 630 million people worldwide. The consequences of that are unimaginable."" In temperature terms, 2021 will likely be the sixth or seventh warmest on record.  That's because the early months of this year were impacted by a La Niña event, a naturally occurring weather phenomenon that tends to cool global temperatures.  But the report also shows that the global temperature record is on course to breach 1C for the first time over a 20 year period. ""The fact that the 20-year average has reached more than 1.0C above pre-industrial levels will focus the minds of delegates at COP26 aspiring to keep global temperature rise to within the limits agreed in Paris six years ago,"" said Prof Stephen Belcher, chief scientist at the UK Met Office, which contributed to the report. Commenting on the analysis, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres, said the planet was changing before our eyes.  ""From the ocean depths to mountain tops, from melting glaciers to relentless extreme weather events, ecosystems and communities around the globe are being devastated,"" he said.  ""COP26 must be a turning point for people and planet,"" said Mr Guterres. Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
economic indicators,Pandemic leaves businesses 'close to exhaustion',2024-09-15,2021-04-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-56744859,"Scottish businesses are ""close to exhaustion"" after 12 months of the ""some of the most challenging trading conditions in modern history"".  Scottish Chambers of Commerce said Covid restrictions and new rules for trading with the European Union had taken their toll.  Its quarterly survey of 370 firms confirmed that retail had been worst affected.  Tourism businesses are more positive as lockdown controls begin to be lifted.  Non-essential shops are likely to be allowed to reopen on 26 April following a four month closure, while pubs, restaurants and cafes will also be able to reopen on a limited basis.  The Scottish government has linked the emergence from lockdown to the rollout of the vaccine. On Tuesday Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that Scotland had ""effectively met"" its initial vaccination target.  Scottish Chambers of Commerce said there was optimism about the vaccine in the business community.  However its quarterly economic indicator for January to March 2021 also found that:  Tim Allan, the group's president, said: ""Businesses in Scotland are close to exhaustion as they continue the slog through some of the most challenging trading conditions in modern history.  ""As the easing of restrictions come, albeit slowly, serious questions over how long trading will continue to be limited remain while businesses trading with the EU have faced fresh difficulties at the border. Rising costs is also a significant issue."" He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland that Nicola Sturgeon's decision to ease travel and socialising limits from Friday was ""a little bit underwhelming"".  ""Allowing people greater movement in the country is welcome from a morale point of view, people want to go and visit family and friends in other parts of the country, but from a business perspective it did very little,"" he said.  He called for a ""reset"" of relations with the Scottish government and a Business Growth Act within the first 100 days of the new parliament.  ""Every single sector with the exception of manufacturing in the last quarter reported falls in confidence, cash flow, employment,"" he said.  ""There are major headwinds for Scottish business so we've called for a fundamental reset in the relationship with politics, politicians, policy makers.  ""We need to have a business action bill - we want an act passed in the first 100 days of the new parliament which addresses the issues of skills, business support, international trade, reducing business costs and the interference of government in private enterprise.""  Meanwhile, the Scottish Beer and Pub Association has called for a dedicated recovery plan and fund for pubs, and a Scottish pubs minister to lead the recovery.  The group's president, Edith Monfries, said: ""There are over ,4000 pubs in Scotland and 130 breweries contributing £1.66bn to the economy and paying £785m in wages. Fast tracking the recovery of our sector will be critical to Scotland's economic and social recovery.  ""We need a long-term plan that makes Scottish pubs and breweries sustainable for the future so that Scotland's vibrant hospitality and tourism sector can thrive once again."""
economic indicators,Christmas cutbacks cause shock drop in shop sales,2024-09-15,2023-01-20,By Dearbail Jordan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64334048,"Shop sales fell by record numbers both in December and across the whole of last year as consumers cut spending.    Retail sales had been expected to rise last month in what is a key season for shops because of Christmas. However, the volume of goods people bought in December fell by 1% from November, and by a record 5.8% compared with December 2021. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also confirmed retail sales for last year recorded the worst-ever fall.  They fell by 3% between 2021 and 2022, which is the biggest decline since ONS records began in 1997. Prices have been rising sharply since last year, mainly due to soaring energy costs, which has put pressure on millions of households. While the rate of inflation is starting to ease, at 10.5% it remains close to a 40-year high. The ONS said retailers had indicated that ""consumers are cutting back on spending because of increased prices and affordability concerns"". While the amount of goods and food bought fell in December, rising prices mean a large number of retailers have reported strong sales figures based on value over the Christmas period. ""It's worth noting that sales growth has been driven by customers spending more due to inflation rather than buying more,"" said Silvia Rindone, UK and Ireland retail strategy leader at accountancy firm EY. John Adams, managing director at Jarrold, a department store in Norwich, said that Christmas sales had risen by 13%. However, it appeared people were spending more on fewer items. ""I think from our perspective they were probably being more considered about what they were buying so we saw the average unit transaction actually increase,"" he said. ""People tended to be buying quality and investing in things rather than buying perhaps frivolous things."" There was a sharp drop in volume at non-food stores, but food stores also reported a fall in sales in December, according to the ONS. It said the drop in food sales during December reinforced the view that people stocked up for Christmas earlier. In November, the volume of retail sales at food stores rose by 1%. ""After last month's boost as shoppers stocked up early, food sales fell back again in December with supermarkets reporting this was due to increased food prices and the rising cost of living,"" said Heather Bovill, deputy director for surveys and economic indicators at the ONS. Bill Grimsey, the former boss of Iceland and Wickes, told the BBC's Today programme: ""Christmas is the key trading time for retailers to often make a difference between profit and loss, particularly in the food sector where volumes are so very important."" Online sales also fell between November and December. The proportion of online sales dipped to 25.4% from 25.9% in the previous month. Ms Bovill said feedback from retailers indicated ""postal strikes were leading people towards purchasing more goods instore"".  Mr Adams said: ""Our footfall was ahead of 2019, so ahead of pandemic levels. I think particularly in the run-up to Christmas people were worried about delivery disruption with the strikes that were happening so there was definitely a swing back to in-store experience.""  Looking ahead, John Allan, chairman of the UK's biggest supermarket chain Tesco, said that while there is a hope inflation will drop sharply in the middle of the year, ""that doesn't mean prices are going to fall"". He said: ""I think it means the increase in prices, we hope, will be much less sharp in the second half of this year and it is probably going to be into 2024 and beyond before we see the normal level of inflation we've enjoyed in previous years."" Mr Allan called on the government to provide a detailed plan to help boost economic growth. ""What we'd love to see from government is a really serious, thought-through, long-term growth plan,"" he said. ""Long-term growth is the only way in which we're actually going to be able to raise standards of living for our fellow citizens."" We've had a host of big retailers reporting better-than-expected Christmas trading but these ONS figures are a bit of a reality check on what's really going on. We've been spending more but getting less for our money. And that's the overall story of retail in 2022 as inflation has taken a huge bite out of our spending power.  This year's festive figures are also flattered by easier comparatives from the previous year which was disrupted by the Omicron variant of Covid and supply chain problems leading to less available stock.  There had been fears that retail would be a wipe-out this Christmas. Consumers did still spend but this all-important season didn't deliver much festive cheer.  And it seems inevitable spending will be reined back in the first half of this year with higher bills coming down the tracks including all those purchases put on credit cards.  The ONS also revised down figures for November. It said that sales volumes fell by 0.5% instead of the original estimate of a 0.4% drop. Capital Economics said the figures for December showed a ""disappointing end to a difficult year"". ""Today's retail sales release suggests that some of the resilience in the economy towards the end of last year appeared to peter out in December,"" said Olivia Cross, an economist at Capital Economics."
economic indicators,What next in Scotland's housing market?,2024-09-15,2022-10-19,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-63320045,"As soaring price inflation, the prospect of recession and of a prolonged European war have closed in on the economy, the housing market appears to have bounced along merrily, as if oblivious. It's not as if they're linked to the price of oil, gas or food, which have driven inflation to 10.1% in the year to August.  The latest house price index, published on Wednesday, shows the average price paid for a Scottish home in August was 9.7% up on the same month last year.  That's down from the 11% rise in the year to July, and down from the 15.1% published a year ago. The English market has seen more volatility in price inflation, partly through the distorting effect of transaction tax holidays - used by the Treasury to stimulate the market as the country came out of recession. Prices in the year to August in England were up 14.3% - down from July's inflation rate of 16.8% - with the average price reaching £315,000. That figure is pulled up by London and the south-east, which have seen more subdued increases in recent years. Price inflation across the UK, with Wales also seeing some lively numbers, means that the average home has gained £36,000 in value over the past year - ahead of average pre-tax full-time earnings. Much of this has to do with the pandemic. The enforced shutdown of the market for parts of 2020 was followed by a burst of pent-up demand, driven by people who had realised during lockdown that they could do with more space. Many saved quite a lot during the pandemic, which they could put into a house purchase. Many also found they could live and work further from the office. So the price of a des res detached home with a bit of space in the country, especially near the coast, has risen fastest of all. The latest figures from Registers of Scotland show the price of a detached home is up by 13% to £349,000 on average, while flats were up 6.7% to £134,000. Aberdeen registered barely any increase, while other bigger cities were close to the national average. The council areas with the biggest increases were Argyll, Highland and the islands. East Lothian and the Borders have been hot spots for rising prices recently, but both saw more modest price increases in these latest figures.  There's a health warning with these figures, though, as they can be skewed by small numbers of transactions, and August can be a quiet month. The big driver of home price inflation in recent years has been the mismatch of supply and demand. Estate agents and surveyors note that there aren't enough homes coming on to the market while demand has remained higher.  When they are put up for sale, the blind bidding system usually used in Scotland is competitive.  To illustrate the point, I'll declare a personal interest: I recently sold my terraced house in Glasgow. There were 13 bidders, and it went for more than 30% above the home report valuation. That, incidentally, puzzles me as to the point or the meaning of a home report valuation. Last year saw the highest number of transactions since 2007, partly to catch up on the lower number in the first year of the pandemic. Registers of Scotland tells us that transaction numbers were down by more than a fifth in the year to June. And according to a specialist in the economics of the housing market, John Boyle at Rettie estate agents, that is at least as important a number to watch if we are to understand the market.  His preferred indicator of market health is the number of sales multiplied by the average price, and since the financial crash of 2008, that has been much lower than it was. Looking ahead, Mr Boyle is one of the market watchers who expects to see the broader economy closing in on house price inflation and dampening it, though not necessarily by driving prices down. That only happens where people are forced to sell - for instance due to divorce or a need to move home for work. What we've seen in recent years is that those who have to move, but cannot sell at the price they want, will often rent out and become tenants elsewhere.   And there's repossession due to mortgage default, which was a feature of past recessions. That is less likely now because affordability checks ahead of agreeing to lend have been much more stringent since 2008. Banks, or at least their regulator, are wary of the destabilising effect it can have on the economy. If homes don't have to be sold, that squeezes supply even further, and holds up prices. Mr Boyle says the mid-to-upper level market has continued to fare quite well, depending on cash buyers and those on secure, higher salaries.  Cash buyers have grown as a share of the market, to around a third. They have an advantage in bidding contests over those who have yet to secure a mortgage or have other houses to sell first. The lower-to-middle market is more exposed and dependent on mortgages. With monthly payments at exceptionally low levels since 2009, home prices adjusted upwards to affordability based on those low mortgage costs.  But as they rise - which they were bound to do eventually, but with the recent budget bùrach in Downing Street turbocharging them - they are making it more difficult to make that second or third step up.  The Registers of Scotland figures are accurate about transactions that have to be registered with that office, but they are backward looking. Deals closed in August were typically struck in spring, before it became clear that the economy was heading downhill. More up-to-date assessments of the market come from Halifax, part of the same group as Bank of Scotland. It says UK prices in the year to August were up 9.9% with inflation on a falling trend. Scotland's prices rose, but by 8.5%, falling from 9.3% inflation over the year. Rightmove, which has a strong grip on the property advertising market, reported that Scotland has seen 6.6% growth in prices in the past year, and it is taking an average 24 days to secure a sale. The UK increase for Rightmove is 7.8% and falling. It notes the recent political and interest rate turmoil has hit the first-time buyer market. Its report this week showed a drop in the number of such people engaged with buying, while those who have a mortgage offer are rushing to complete the purchase before interest rates rise further. The monthly market review by RICS, the surveyors organisation, is the best measure of what lies ahead. It reported buyer enquiries in Scotland have recently fallen for third consecutive month. While limited supply is still supporting a modest price rise, this looks set to end as the pace of house price inflation slows. Looking to the remaining weeks of this year, price and sales expectations are now slightly negative. That does not tell you how much prices or sales might fall - only that the number of upbeat surveyors is smaller than the downbeat ones. If this is a turning point in the market, what is a potential buyer to do? Wait to see if prices fall, or jump into the market in case mortgage costs rise further?  There's no simple answer. It depends on circumstances, of where you are, how long you can stay there, where you want to be, and how you intend to finance it."
economic indicators,Amazon's Bezos on economy: 'Batten down hatches',2024-09-15,2022-10-19,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63319010,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has added his voice to the chorus of voices warning of hardship ahead for the US economy. On social media, the billionaire wrote that the economy was sending a signal to ""batten down the hatches"". Growth in the US has already contracted for two quarters in a row, a milestone that in many countries - though not the US - is considered a recession. As the US central bank raises interest rates to fight rising prices, many economists expect further slowdown. The drumbeat of concern recently forced US President Joe Biden to address the issue. In an interview last week, he said ""I don't think there will be a recession. If it is, it'll be a very slight recession"". In the US, a panel of economists is charged with declaring the formal start and end of recessions. They use a number of indicators, in addition to gross domestic product in making the determination. With midterm elections looming in November, Mr Biden has tried to make the case that the slowdown in economic activity is a healthy shift from the growth surge that followed the pandemic lockdowns. Job creation remains robust, unemployment rates low, and households finances relatively healthy. But as inflation has remained much higher than the 2% goal - hitting 8.2% last month - hopes that authorities will be able to get the issue under control without triggering a potentially severe slowdown have waned. ""We have got to get inflation behind us. I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn't,"" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last month. The US housing sector - which accounts for about 15% of the economy by some estimates - has already slowed sharply, as borrowing costs approach 7% - the highest rate since 2002, prompting job cuts at banks and other property firms. In updates to investors in recent days, bosses at the biggest US banks warned of darker days ahead. ""In my conversations with CEOs, they tell me they are rethinking business opportunities and would like to see more certainty before committing to longer term plans,"" Goldman Sachs boss David Solomon said.  ""We're tightening economic conditions very, very quickly. And when you tighten economic conditions it has an impact on these things"" Jamie Dimon at JP Morgan, who has previously warned of a ""hurricane"" ahead, said consumers would likely run through the cushion in their bank accounts by the middle of next year. Amazon, which will update investors later this month, has also been grappling with a slowdown in its e-commerce business. It has slowed hiring and said it is working to cut expenses.  Mr Bezos stepped down as Amazon chief executive last year but remains chairman of its board. He has been critical of the president's economic policies in the past, faulting Mr Biden for being disingenuous about the forces driving prices higher. He shared a video of Mr Solomon discussing the need to be cautious, given the economic uncertainties. ""Yep the probabilities in this economy tell you to batten down the hatches,"" Mr Bezos wrote."
economic indicators,What jobs are available post-lockdown?,2024-09-15,2020-07-21,By Bill Wilson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53414413,"Covid-19 has had an impact on nearly all aspects of life, including people's work. The world of work is changing - and some sectors appear to be in a much stronger position than others. According to the latest jobs market report from employment website CV-Library, the number of job vacancies in the UK fell by 62.7% in the second quarter of 2020.  And for those jobs that are being advertised, competition is stiff, with the average application-to-job ratio rising by 84%. The report is the latest in a series of snapshots trying to predict - by looking at online job vacancies - where workplace opportunities might be increasing or shrinking. So, with more people battling it out for jobs, which industries are actually hiring staff? And which face a more uncertain future? From software engineers to web developers, to online security specialists, this sector is expanding. Digital skills are required in all industries, from e-commerce to automating processes in factories. ""It is encouraging that we are seeing indications of growth for roles like IT professionals and designers, which will be critical for many firms as they adapt to meet the challenges of a changed market,"" says Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), which monitors the number of active job postings in the UK. But a word of caution, there is also lots of competition in the sector as Alison's story here demonstrates. Since the start of lockdown in March, we have all been shopping a lot more online, and that has seen an increase in people being hired in the sector. Online giant Amazon has created 15,000 new full and part-time warehouse and delivery driver jobs across the UK in goods fulfilment centres, where orders are processed, and in its logistics network.  Verity Stephens is a member of the Team GB judo squad and an instructor in the sport but saw her job evaporate in  lockdown. ""I run extra-curricular judo programmes in schools across Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire - teaching about 250 children a week,"" she says. ""I literally went from having a full schedule to nothing in 24 hours."" She now helps process goods entering Amazon's warehouse and order centre at Coalville, Leicestershire. Meanwhile, delivery company Hermes is creating 10,500 jobs, as it looks to hire 1,500 full-time staff across its delivery network and head office, and 9,000 freelance couriers. With pubs and restaurants having been closed during lockdown we have all been eating at home an awful lot more. And increased demand for groceries has seen ""a knock-on in jobs demand"", says Richard Lim, chief executive of analysts Retail Economics.    Between them, supermarkets have taken on more than 50,000 workers during the coronavirus outbreak, and while many have been temporary posts, full-time jobs have been created too. ""The increase in food retail jobs has been in three different areas: in-store - doing things like replenishing shelves, in online order processing in the huge new warehouses that have sprung up, and in logistics taking food deliveries to customers' doors,"" says Mr Lim. Large goods vehicle (LGV) drivers are in demand, according to the latest REC survey, and this work sector dovetails with many of those mentioned above. (Under UK and European law, the LGV driving licence and HGV licence are the same licence.) Whether it is taking stock to an Amazon warehouse to be shelved and then put into customer orders, or taking extra deliveries to individual supermarkets, goods are being moved by road. According to the REC, those who can build vehicles and repair them are also being sought by employers. The demand comes against a backdrop of warnings in the industry during the past few years that there is an acute shortage of drivers. Last winter, trade body the FTA warned there was a shortage of 59,000 drivers in the country. Domestic cleaners were hit hard with the imposition of lockdown in March, being prevented from visiting clients' homes. That caused problems for small firms such as this one run by Louise and Liam Parkinson. But with restrictions easing, the last month has been ""a bit of a whirlwind"", says Liam. ""The phone's not stopped ringing. The one thing we've seen is people ringing up wanting to book us because we're a small family-run business and they want to support local businesses. We've had quite a few new customers and have had to employ someone."" As well as a rise in demand for domestic cleaners, businesses are also hiring again, with recruitment website Indeed now showing more than 10,000 cleaning roles. Recent vacancies listed have included jobs for supermarkets Aldi, Lidl and Iceland, businesses such as Wetherspoons and Ladbrokes, and for places such as holiday cottages and schools. According to trade body the British Cleaning Council there has been an increase in demand for cleaners in all sectors of the economy, but particularly in the healthcare and hospital sector as the public wants to see visible signs of cleaning. Anyone paying attention to the news in recent months could not have failed to notice the deluge of High Street retailers announcing job cuts since March.   Boots, Burberry, Cath Kidston, Clark's, Dixons Carphone, Harrods, John Lewis Partnership, Monsoon, Oasis, Quiz, River Island, TM Lewin, Topshop, Very, Wickes and Zara have all said jobs were to be lost or at risk. This week Ted Baker and Marks & Spencer joined that list with hundreds more jobs at risk. ""The general picture around retail jobs is the difference between food and non-food jobs,"" says Richard Lim of Retail Economics. ""While food retailing has flourished, the non-food sector is in crisis mode as sales and jobs have been obliterated."" According to the REC, one of the sectors that saw job advertisements contract in mid-July was that of ""publicans and managers of licensed premises"". One London publican who spoke to the BBC, but asked not to be named, said: ""Coronavirus is a big issue. A lot of pubs are still shut and a lot of publicans are in limbo because of the furlough scheme, so there is no need to advertise for vacancies as there actually won't be many."" He added: ""Even in normal times it is very hard to make money in this job, and the hours are very long too, so it might not appear very enticing to those looking for a less-demanding type of work."" Meanwhile, independent eating and drinking outlets, such as this one in the north west of England, say they have been forced to scale back their businesses due to the coronavirus outbreak. One sector hit hard by coronavirus has been the UK events sector, that is those firms who put on trade shows, exhibitions and conferences. Such gatherings are still not allowed. Companies such as this one have seen their existence, and staff jobs, threatened by the coronavirus shutdown. Some 70% of 1,100 trade shows and exhibitions due to run this year have been cancelled, says trade body the Events Industry Alliance. And it warns that could put at risk a quarter of jobs in the sector, some 30,000 posts. Large gatherings such as the Southampton International Boat Show, originally scheduled for September, have been cancelled, as the organisers still don't know whether the event would even be allowed by then. Beauty salons are to fully reopen on 1 August, but the British Beauty Council has warned lockdown has been a struggle for the sector, which employs about 200,000 people. Council boss Millie Kendall told the BBC: ""Starting with the beginning of lockdown, and the applications for grants and loans, and furlough, it has been very challenging for the industry. ""We are probably looking at 11% redundancies across the board in our industry. This is going to affect microbusinesses more than some of the bigger corporations."" The travel industry has been brought to its knees during the pandemic, with much international travel banned. Even with flying restrictions easing, some countries including the UK have introduced quarantine measures for people returning from certain destinations. Back in April, British Airways announced 12,000 possible job cuts from its 42,000-strong workforce, with both cabin crew and pilots affected. Easyjet is also cutting 1,300 cabin crew and 727 pilots, while Virgin Atlantic is cutting 3,500 staff. Meanwhile, Ryanair staff have agreed to take temporary pay cuts in order to keep their jobs. The future for the industry remains unclear, with IAG, the parent company of British Airways, warning it could take ""several years"" for air travel to return to 2019 levels."
economic indicators,Inequality driving 'deaths of despair',2024-09-15,2019-05-14,By Sean Coughlan and David Brown,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-48229037,"Widening inequalities in pay, health and opportunities in the UK are undermining trust in democracy, says an Institute for Fiscal Studies report. The think tank warns of runaway incomes for high earners but rises in ""deaths of despair"", such as from addiction and suicide, among the poorest. It warns of risks to ""centre-ground"" politics from stagnating pay and divides in health and education. The report says such widening gaps are ""making a mockery of democracy"". The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), one of the country's leading research institutes, is launching what it says is the UK's biggest analysis of inequality. That will be chaired by Nobel Prize-winning economist Prof Sir Angus Deaton. He said ""people were troubled by inequality"" more than at any time since the 1940s - and the impact was so serious that it suggested ""democratic capitalism is broken"". He warned of the dangers of disillusionment if people did not feel fairly rewarded for their work - and that extreme wealth seemed to be gained by ""taking rather than making"". Sir Angus said ""people getting rich is a good thing"" but not if it meant ""enriching the few at the expense of the many"". At the outset of this review, the IFS has published indicators of inequality - such as the average chief executive of a FTSE 100 company now earning 145 times the average salary, up from 47 times in 1998. It suggests pay inequality in the UK is high by international standards - with the share of household income going to the richest 1% having tripled in the past three decades. The middle classes are also under pressure, particularly younger generations, with stagnant pay and unaffordable house prices. The long-term decline in trade union membership is identified as another factor in wages not increasing. As well as inequality in income, the think tank highlights divergence in health. It says there is almost a 10-year gap in male life expectancy between the richest and poorest areas - and the IFS warns of ""deaths of despair"", with a rise in early deaths from drug and alcohol abuse and suicide being linked to factors such as poverty, social isolation and mental health problems. Patterns of relationship are also affected by inequality, the study suggests. Over recent decades, wealthier people have become more likely to be living in a couple, either married or co-habiting, the IFS says. But among the poor, declining numbers are living with a partner, a pattern attributed to increasing job insecurity, a lack of financial independence and more ""chaotic lives"". The big picture, says the IFS, is the UK is becoming more like the US, with a concentration of wealth at the top and pressure on working families lower down the pay scale. It says that in the US, increases in life expectancy have stalled and that for non-graduate male workers, pay has not risen in real terms for five decades. ""The risk is that the UK may follow a similar path,"" says the IFS study. The IFS warns of the social tensions that will come with an economic landscape built on widening inequality. As economic think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported recently, this is likely to put pressure on the middle classes as well as those on low incomes. University science researcher James Hutchinson, in his 30s, feels he has kept his side of the bargain - gaining a degree from Cambridge - and now working as an academic as well as raising a family with his partner. But he feels a sense of ""powerlessness"" about the cost of housing and that his work has no job security, with a series of short-term contracts. ""It's not a sob story,"" says Dr Hutchinson, ""But if people feel they can't improve their lot, then they feel disconnected."" ""We were sold the idea that academic success is the way to be better off,"" he says. His partner Bethany has decided not to work because she can't afford childcare. She says ""for me as a parent, I didn't feel comfortable with us being separated... and then working all hours."" They live in Bristol and struggled to get somewhere they could afford to live - currently the family all sleep in one room while they patch up their home. Dr Hutchinson recognises that he's ""more privileged than many"" - earning the average for UK graduates of £35,000 per year - but he voices a frustration at a lack of progress and fears that things could get even worse for his children. The ""disconnect"" comes, he says, from his generation becoming ""increasingly aware of your own expendability"" and a work culture haunted by a ""constant lack of security"". Dr Hutchinson is sceptical that any of the political rhetoric will translate into real improvements.   ""How do we build a functional society out of dysfunctional lives?"" he asks. The consumer society is afraid of becoming the consumed."
economic indicators,Can pregnancy rates predict a recession?,2024-09-15,2018-02-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43195765,"The rate of women becoming pregnant begins to fall several months before the start of a recession, research from US academics suggests. Its authors said fertility rates might help predict economic downturns. They were more accurate than some traditional indicators, they said. The research shows the rate of conceptions stopped increasing and began to fall several quarters before the start of the last three recessions in the United States. Economists are frequently criticised for failing to accurately predict the direction of economic growth. Increasingly they are looking beyond traditional measures such as manufacturing output, retail spending and house prices to help build a more complex and accurate picture. ""We think that the factors behind the last three recessions also had a profound and rapid effect on fertility decisions,"" the report's authors said, summarising their findings. ""In fact, these factors seem to have impacted fertility decisions before large parts of the economy.""  The authors of Is Fertility a Leading Economic Indicator? tracked more than 100 million births in the United States between 1989 and 2016. They incorporated data on miscarriages and abortions. It was already accepted that birth rates fall in a downturn, but Daniel Hungerman, Kasey Buckles and Steven Lugauer found that conception rates drop several months before other signs of a recession become visible. ""We were surprised when we saw [the correlation] and then we were surprised no one had noticed it before,"" said Mr Hungerman. The paper found rates of conceptions grew more slowly, followed by rapid falls in the rate of conception starting several quarters before recessions begin. ""The nature of each recession has differed and so what conversation goes on at the kitchen table might be different, but I do think that people talk about the future when they try to have a baby and in aggregate they seem to do a good job thinking about it,"" says Mr Hungerman. The paper says for example that in December 2007 a poll of business leaders found they were optimistic about the future, although it later transpired that by then the recession had begun.  At that point the growth in conception rates had already been falling for several months, with the decline starting several quarters before the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.  There is also a correlation with the scale of the downturn.  Fertility sank more rapidly (by four percentage points) before the deeper 2007 recession than in the run up to the two previous dips in the early 90s and the early 2000s. Increasingly the collection of vast amounts of detailed data on everything from online searches to shopping and eating patterns is allowing economists to explore new sources of information on the economy. ""The huge amount of data is important,"" said Mr Hungerman. ""Even more important is the frequency. Most studies use annual level data but with ours we look within the year. ""For a lot of the anticipatory patterns we see they're measured in quarters or months. If you use annual level data you might miss that."" While it may not be simple to track conceptions in real time, the report's authors suggested proxy data such as the sale of fertility and pregnancy-related goods could be monitored. In a much discussed case several years ago, US retailer Target reportedly issued money-off coupons on baby items to a teenager after mining its sales data and identifying she was pregnant.  The academics also looked at what happened to conceptions at the end of the last three recessions. But they found the data was less clear cut.  The end of the 2007-08 recession was dubbed a ""jobless recovery"". Hungerman, Buckley and Lugauer found it was also a ""baby-less recovery."""
economic indicators,China's annual growth slowest in decades,2024-09-15,2019-01-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46941932,"China's economy grew at its slowest rate since 1990, stoking fears about the impact on the global economy. China expanded at 6.6% in 2018, official figures out Monday showed.  In the three months to December, the economy grew 6.4% from a year earlier, down from 6.5% in the previous quarter.  The data was in line with forecasts but underlines recent concern about weakening growth in the world's second-biggest economy.  China's rate of expansion has raised worries about the potential knock-on effect on the global economy. The trade war with the US has added to the gloomy outlook.  The official figures out Monday showed the weakest quarterly growth rate since the global financial crisis.  While China watchers advise caution with Beijing's official GDP numbers, the data is seen as a useful indicator of the country's growth trajectory. By Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia business correspondent China's economic slowdown is not news in itself. Beijing has broadcast this for several years, that it's going to focus on the quality not quantity of growth.  But still, we should be worried.  Slower growth in China means slower growth for the rest of the world.  It accounts for one-third of global growth. Jobs, exports, commodity producing nations - we all depend on China to buy stuff from us. Slower growth in China also means it is harder for China to address its mountain of debt, even with the Communist Party's undoubted ability to be able to support the economy.  Growth has been easing for years, but concern over the pace of the slowdown in China has risen in recent months as companies sound the alarm over the crucial market.  Earlier this month Apple warned weakness in China would hit its sales.  Carmakers and other firms have spoken out on the impact of the trade war with the US. China's government has been pushing to shift away from export-led growth to depend more on domestic consumption.  Policymakers in China have stepped up efforts in recent months to support the economy.  Those measures to boost demand include speeding-up construction projects, cutting some taxes, and reducing the level of reserves banks need to hold.  Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said the Chinese economy remained weak at the end of 2018 ""but held up better than many feared"".  ""Still, with the headwinds from cooling global growth and the lagged impact of slower credit growth set to intensify... China's economy is likely to weaken further before growth stabilises in the second half of the year."""
economic indicators,Half of Scots graduates 'underemployed',2024-09-15,2017-08-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-41075040,"Half of Scots who graduated from university and some college courses in the past five years are working in ""non-graduate"" jobs, according to the Office for National Statistics. A survey by the ONS suggested 52% are in jobs which do not require further or higher education qualifications. These include those with qualifications like HNDs and HNCs and higher levels of SVQs through to degree-level and up. But university leaders say the ONS definition of graduate is too broad. They cite different studies showing that up to 72% of full-time first degree leavers were in posts classified as professional employment six months after graduating from university. BBC Scotland is examining the lives of Generation Y, the ""millennials"" born between 1980 and 2000. There has been a steady increase in the number of people in this age bracket going into further education, with the number of students in Scotland on the rise. However, it has been suggested that many might not ultimately go into careers related to their studies - or even those considered graduate professions. The Office for National Statistics gathered information on graduate destinations as part of its annual population survey. It found that 51.8% of recent graduates - defined as those leaving full-time education within five years of the survey date with a level of higher education above A-level equivalent standard - were in a job which did not require this level of training.  The figure for the UK was a whole was 46.4%.  The data also suggest that many of this group may not go on to graduate-level jobs in future, with only about 40% of non-recent graduates - those who graduated more than five years ago - being in graduate jobs in 2016. The ONS defines non-graduate jobs as those which do not normally require the knowledge and skills devolved through higher education, listing examples including receptionists, sales assistants, many types of factory workers, care workers and home carers. They cite a report from the University of Warwick which notes concerns about the ""growing mismatch between skills and the knowledge developed on degree programmes and the requirements of employers"". However their definitions were challenged by Universities Scotland, who said the ONS figures ""define a graduate far more broadly than usual"", due to the inclusion of various HND and HNC level courses. Oliver Newton, policy and research director at the Edge Foundation, said there was ""a challenge on both sides of the equation"". He said: ""On the one hand we're bringing out more graduates than we need in some areas, and on the other some of those graduates don't necessarily have the skills and work experience that employers are looking for. ""The UK has one of the highest rates of graduate underemployment, people who have got a degree but aren't necessarily using it for a job that requires one."" Cat Taylor studied history at undergraduate level, and then did a postgraduate degree in 18th century cultures. She said she didn't think of having any other options when leaving school but said she realised she was ""not very employable"" at the end of the academic process. The 29-year-old now works front-of-house in a museum, something she ""never"" thought she would be doing while she was studying. She said: ""I'm glad I did my degree, because I loved it. But if I could look back in time I don't think I would make the same choices again. ""The whole thing makes me feel kind of like I wasted a lot of time. I don't really think I did, because I do love what I did, I love learning - but I didn't need to do any of it to be where I am now.  ""I never thought that this would be what I'm doing, but admittedly I'm not entirely certain what I thought I was going to; I thought I would do my degree and then that would open up opportunities to me. I don't think that happened. ""I would tell 16-year-old me that 'you're going to have to go to university because you don't have any clue about what else you could do. But study IT, study something which is useful, study nursing'."" Others who didn't go to university have highlighted how other paths can work out. One 27-year-old woman became an overhead lines apprentice for Scottish and Southern Energy after applying for the role after seeing it advertised online. She said: ""I was speaking to a lot of friends and family, a lot of whom had their own trades - very few of my family had went to university. ""I saw them with good career prospects and good money coming in, so I thought, why not? Why go to university when I could be earning money doing this? ""I chose an apprenticeship because I love being outside and I love hands-on learning. The idea of getting a good qualification as well as earning a wage really appealed to me. You're guaranteed a job at the end of this. ""I think the best idea would be to really think it through, speak to as many people as possible, your family and friends. Do your research about where you could go, what sort of jobs you might like, and above all pick something you're passionate about and that excites you."" On the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Robert Wright, a professor of economics at Strathclyde University, said many graduates enjoy much better prospects than those who do not go in to further education - but added that some do find themselves ""underemployed"". He said: ""If we look at the data, even through the recession graduates of higher education institutions do much better on average than non-graduates in terms of employment and earnings. We can say with some confidence that they still have much better prospects than those without that education. ""But that's a general statement, on average. There are certainly graduates who do not do so well, find themselves underemployed in jobs which do not require their skills, and they remain in these jobs for long periods of time. ""To me it's clearly the case that underemployment is an indicator that what's being supplied by the higher education sector is not clearly a match for what's being demanded. ""There is this mismatch. But then again we have to think about what the role of further and higher education is; is it only to get people into the job market for work? Some people say that should be the main priority and I don't disagree with that. ""But the other issue that is important here is whether or not the taxpayers should be paying for underemployment, Should there be free tuition fees for people who end up with a university degree, working in non-graduate jobs?"" Luke Humberstone, president of the National Union of Students, said students can pick up skills at university which can transfer into other areas, without necessarily staying in the professions they studied for. He said: ""We've got to consider what's best for the individual. Yes, some students may want to use their skills that they gained at university, but some others might simply be able to get a job that suits them. ""It's not just about getting graduate employment, it might be that they start their own businesses and contribute to society that way. Education in our society is a public good, and I think that increasingly society believes that."" Universities Scotland said the ONS had taken an unusual approach to how graduates are defined, pointing instead to figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency which show a ""very different"" picture. Director Alastair Sim said the figures ""define a graduate far more broadly than usual as they include anyone holding a qualification above A-level. The picture is very different for university graduates. ""72% of graduates with first degrees, who go into the labour market, are working in professional occupations within just six months. By then, the average university graduate is earning £22,500. The percentage of graduates working in graduate-level careers continues to grow in the years that follow and three and a half years after university almost 9 of every 10 are happy with their careers to date. ""Universities work really hard to support graduate employability. This is reflected in very positive employability figures and high employer satisfaction. We also value the minority of graduates who choose to continue their studies or combine more study with part-time employment."" Scottish government education minister Jamie Hepburn pointed to statistics which showed very low unemployment among young people, and also highlighted the HESA figures. He said: ""I do recognise there is an issue with underemployment, but I'd urge people to look at the evidence before us.  ""What [HESA] found here in Scotland was some three and a half years after graduation, graduates from Scottish universities will earn on average £500 more a year than their English graduate counterparts and £2,500 more a year than those who've gone to Welsh and Northern Irish universities. That seems to me to be a positive outcome. ""I do recognise that underemployment is a genuine issue. I'm not suggesting that everything is absolutely correct here in Scotland, and that's why for example we're taking forward the developing young workforce agenda, which is now in place across the entirety of Scotland, bringing employers and the educational environment closer together to make sure people coming out of their school experience are better equipped for the world of work."" Colleges Scotland said students graduated with ""work-ready skills"", and said they worked closely with schools, universities and employers to ""support the economic and social needs of their regions"". Chief Executive Shona Struthers said: ""Colleges are increasingly becoming the route of choice for young people progressing on to university, with the Scottish government's agenda on widening access to higher education increasingly being delivered by colleges supporting over 90% of the growth in entry to university by disadvantaged students since 2006. ""Scotland's colleges remain committed to further development of relationships with employers, to ensure closer alignment to make the best use of talented graduates who are keen to gain meaningful employment and contribute to society, and meet the needs of the labour market.""

economic indicators,Theresa May: Syria statement in full,2024-09-15,2018-04-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43766966,"Last night British, French and American armed forces conducted co-ordinated and targeted strikes to degrade the Syrian regime's chemical weapons capability and deter their use.  For the UK's part, four RAF Tornado GR4s launched Storm Shadow missiles at a military facility some 15 miles west of Homs, where the regime is assessed to keep chemical weapons in breach of Syria's obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention. While the full assessment of the strike is ongoing, we are confident of its success. Let me set out why we have taken this action. Last Saturday, up to 75 people, including young children, were killed in a despicable and barbaric attack in Douma, with as many as 500 further casualties.  We have worked with our allies to establish what happened. And all the indications are that this was a chemical weapons attack.      We have seen the harrowing images of men, women and children lying dead with foam in their mouths. These were innocent families who, at the time this chemical weapon was unleashed, were seeking shelter underground in basements. First-hand accounts from NGOs and aid workers have detailed the most horrific suffering, including burns to the eyes, suffocation and skin discolouration, with a chlorine-like odour surrounding the victims. And the World Health Organisation has received reports that hundreds of patients arrived at Syrian heath facilities on Saturday night with ""signs and symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic chemicals"". We are also clear about who was responsible for this atrocity.  A significant body of information, including intelligence, indicates the Syrian regime is responsible for this latest attack. I cannot tell you everything. But let me give an example of some of the evidence that leads us to this conclusion.  Open source accounts allege that a barrel bomb was used to deliver the chemicals.  Multiple open source reports claim that a regime helicopter was observed above the city of Douma on the evening of 7th April.  The opposition does not operate helicopters or use barrel bombs. And reliable intelligence indicates that Syrian military officials co-ordinated what appears to be the use of chlorine in Douma on 7th April. No other group could have carried out this attack. Indeed, Daesh for example does not even have a presence in Douma.  And the fact of this attack should surprise no-one. We know that the Syrian regime has an utterly abhorrent record of using chemical weapons against its own people.  On 21st August 2013, over 800 people were killed and thousands more injured in a chemical attack also in Ghouta. There were 14 further smaller scale chemical attacks prior to that summer.  At Khan Shaykhun on 4th April last year, the Syrian regime used Sarin against its people, killing around 100 with a further 500 casualties. And based on the regime's persistent pattern of behaviour and the cumulative analysis of specific incidents, we judge it highly likely both that the Syrian regime has continued to use chemical weapons since then, and will continue to do so. This must be stopped.  We have sought to do so using every possible diplomatic channel.  But our efforts have been repeatedly thwarted both on the ground and in the United Nations. Following the Sarin attack in eastern Damascus back in August 2013, the Syrian regime committed to dismantle its chemical weapon programme - and Russia promised to ensure that Syria did this, overseen by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.  But these commitments have not been met.  A recent report from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has said that Syria's declaration of its former chemical weapons programme is incomplete.  This indicates that it continues to retain undeclared stocks of nerve agent or precursor chemicals - and is likely to be continuing with some chemical weapons production.  The OPCW inspectors have investigated previous attacks and on four occasions decided that the regime was indeed responsible. And on each occasion when we have seen every sign of chemical weapons being used, any attempt to hold the perpetrators to account has been blocked by Russia at the UN Security Council, with six such vetoes since the start of 2017. Just this week, the Russians vetoed a draft resolution that would have established an independent investigation into this latest attack - even making the grotesque and absurd claim that it was ""staged"" by Britain. So we have no choice but to conclude that diplomatic action on its own will not be any more effective in the future than it has been in the past.  Over the last week, the UK government has been working intensively with our international partners to build the evidence picture, and to consider what action we need to take to prevent and deter future humanitarian catastrophes caused by chemical weapons attacks.  When the cabinet met on Thursday we considered the advice of the attorney general, the national security adviser and the chief of the defence staff - and we were updated on the latest assessment and intelligence picture.  And based on this advice we agreed that it was both right and legal to take military action, together with our closest allies, to alleviate further humanitarian suffering by degrading the Syrian regime's chemical weapons capability and deterring their use. This was not about interfering in a civil war.  And it was not about regime change.  As I discussed with (US) President Trump and (French) President Macron, it was a limited, targeted and effective strike with clear boundaries that expressly sought to avoid escalation and did everything possible to prevent civilian casualties. Together we have hit a specific and limited set of targets. They were a chemical weapons storage and production facility, a key chemical weapons research centre and a military bunker involved in chemical weapons attacks.  Hitting these targets with the force that we have deployed will significantly degrade the Syrian regime's ability to research, develop and deploy chemical weapons. A year ago, after the atrocity at Khan Shaykhun, the US conducted a strike on the airfield from which the attack took place. But Assad and his regime haven't stopped their use of chemical weapons.  So last night's strikes by the US, UK and France were significantly larger than the US action a year ago, and specifically designed to have a greater impact on the regime's capability and willingness to use chemical weapons.   And this collective action sends a clear message that the international community will not stand by and tolerate the use of chemical weapons.  I also want to be clear that this military action to deter the use of chemical weapons does not stand alone.  We must remain committed to resolving the conflict at large.  The best hope for the Syrian people remains a political solution.  We need all partners - especially the regime and its backers - to enable humanitarian access to those in desperate need.  And the UK will continue to strive for both. But these strikes are about deterring the barbaric use of chemical weapons in Syria and beyond.  And so to achieve this there must also be a wider diplomatic effort - including the full range of political and economic levers - to strengthen the global norms prohibiting the use of chemical weapons which have stood for nearly a century.  Although of a much lower order of magnitude, the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the UK in recent weeks is part of a pattern of disregard for these norms.  So while this action is specifically about deterring the Syrian regime, it will also send a clear signal to anyone else who believes they can use chemical weapons with impunity. There is no graver decision for a Prime Minister than to commit our forces to combat - and this is the first time that I have had to do so.  As always, they have served our country with the greatest professionalism and bravery - and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude.  We would have preferred an alternative path.  But on this occasion there is none. We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised - either within Syria, on the streets of the UK or elsewhere. We must reinstate the global consensus that chemical weapons cannot be used.  This action is absolutely in Britain's national interest.  The lesson of history is that when the global rules and standards that keep us safe come under threat, we must take a stand and defend them. That is what our country has always done.  And that is what we will continue to do. "
economic indicators,"Business, bedfellows, Brexit and Boris",2024-09-15,2019-08-30,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-49517248,"Boris Johnson is reported (credibly, and with no denial) to have shared a short and pithy piece of advice to anyone in business who didn't share his approach to Brexit.  It's not the conventional Conservative approach to the enterprising types who have long formed the backbone of the party, and provided much of its funding. But these are not conventional times. And if you thought he was going to build bridges, now that he has taken office, well... think again. The strategy seems to be a profoundly un-Conservative and Trumpian - creating divisions, and then doubling on them. So where does that leave relations with business? And how is business responding?  We get some glimpses of the answer today, and may get more of them next week, when CBI Scotland gathers for dinner, during which we usually expect to hear from a senior figure in Whitehall. Businesses in Scotland are voicing growing impatience with the uncertainty hanging over the economy as a result of Brexit. Several sector organisations have voiced concern this week that their warnings are being ignored. Survey evidence from Scottish private sector firms, published today, shows declining confidence. The Bank of Scotland business barometer for August registered a nine-point drop in confidence levels about the economy. Business leaders were also seeing declining confidence in their own firms' prospects, which fell six points to zero. That is a measure of the number of firms surveyed who were positive about their prospects, set against those that were negative. There was a notable rise in the numbers expecting to cut staffing levels during next year. Meanwhile, the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) reported half-year exports rising sharply, much of that due to stocking up ahead of possible tariffs being imposed post-Brexit.   Markets showing that kind of surge included South Korea and Morocco. HMRC figures showed exports up nearly 11% to £2.2bn in the first six months of 2019. Export volumes were up 7%. Single malts were up 19% to £652m, now representing 30% of the value of all Scotch shipped overseas. That represents a trend far removed from the politics of trade, with distillers successfully pushing to ""premiumise"". Karen Betts, the SWA chief executive, urged the UK and European Union to agree terms for Brexit.  She said: ""Prolonged uncertainty is costing the industry money in no-deal planning and in exporting, as companies have, where they can, brought exports forward, incurring additional capital on additional warehouses and associated costs."" She added the industry's customary appeal to the chancellor: ""The UK government must take these pressures into account when deciding on duty rates in the autumn budget"". Ms Betts' predecessor at the Scotch Whisky Association, David Frost, was recently made the lead negotiator for Boris Johnson, in his government's discussions with European institutions and member states. At least he ought to understand the importance of geographical indicators in future trade talks. In further evidence of economic difficulties stemming from Brexit and political uncertainty, the Scottish Engineering trade body reported that most indicators were down in its quarterly survey, with output volume negative for the first time in three years.  Export levels were negative, for the first time this year. There has only been one other negative quarter since the end of 2016. That is despite the weakened pound, which ought to make exporting easier. Engineering firms had more positive trends for recruitment, which rose slightly in the most recent quarter - possibly due to vacancies which were going unfilled. The sector was more positive about the coming months. While larger companies were downbeat about orders and employment, others were expecting to see a pick-up in UK orders, export orders and output volume. Paul Sheerin, chief executive of Scottish Engineering, noted that the new UK Cabinet had excluded anyone who was not a firm believer in the values and impact of Brexit. He commented: ""Businesses of all sizes up and down the country recognise the danger in forming a management team that lacks diversity of thought or the conviction to challenge internally, and yet this is what have have leading UK plc at a time of unprecedented difficulty, representing an electorate that is deeply divided"". The engineering boss said a no-deal Brexit would mean ""added costs for zero value"" and uncertainty about business sustainability. Among the organisation's members, three in 10 said they depended on non-UK nationals and six in 10 rejected the proposed salary threshold of £30,000 for migrant work permits. Mr Sheerin said: ""We are deeply disappointed that the feedback given prior to the (immigration) white paper seems to have been ignored, and this is underlined in 70% of our respondents voicing the need for flexibility in immigration policy which addresses Scotland's unique needs"". Earlier this week, responding to the controversy around the tactics being used by the UK government to ensure its Brexit policy is implemented at the end of October, a response came from Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce. She said: ""Businesses in Scotland feel as if their pleas for a return to political sanity are falling on deaf ears as this dangerous game of Westminster brinkmanship escalates. ""Continuing political turbulence is taking a measurable toll on contracts, on investment decisions and on business confidence.  Dr Cameron added: ""Government support is essential to creating the right environment for businesses to thrive and this effort is currently, at best, increasingly haphazard."" And then there's Ruth Davidson. Business organisations reckoned they had a listening ear in her office. So from the Federation of Small Businesses, there's dismay at the Scottish Tory's leader's departure. Andrew McRae, the Federation's policy chair in Scotland, responded: ""It is more than disheartening that Scottish frontline politics is losing a straightforward, pro-business voice like Ruth Davidson's, especially during this period of turmoil. ""She has been a staunch friend of the FSB during, and before, her tenure as leader. We fully understand and respect her reasons for stepping back from the forefront of politics, but many will miss her contribution to Scottish public life."" And that is a reminder of how things used to be between Tories and business. It's not clear how, how soon, or if, that oft-defining relationship in British politics and its economy will return to business as normal."
economic indicators,Tough times 'may be ending' in Aberdeen,2024-09-15,2018-11-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-46319025,"The tough economic conditions Aberdeen has seen in recent years may be coming to an end, a property law firm has said.  Aberdein Considine indicated a recovery in the property market could be attributed to an improving economy. Property sales in Aberdeen have increased for the first time in nearly two years, with a rise of 7.9%. Prices in Aberdeen also appear to have stabilised, with the average home costing £199,834.  Jacqueline Law, managing partner at Aberdein Considine, welcomed the findings.  She said: ""The upturn in Aberdeen is great news after a prolonged difficult period, and is hopefully an indicator that we are beginning to see the north east emerge from one of its most testing downturns."" The stabilisation of property prices in Aberdeen suggests demand has also steadied.  Ms Law acknowledged that uncertainty around Brexit could have adverse effects on the property market, but she also recognised the potential for Aberdeen's local economy to mitigate some of the impact. She added: ""We can't ignore the ongoing turbulence in relation to Brexit, as well as the corresponding uncertainty this is causing to both businesses and homeowners.  ""That said, the return of a stable and prosperous oil and gas industry should hopefully provide some insulation against the challenges the country might face over the next few months and years."" In October it was predicted that the Aberdeen property market was set for an ""oil industry jobs boom"". Bob Fraser, a senior property partner at Aberdein Considine, has also attributed the current improvements seen in the property market to the oil and gas industry.  Speaking to BBC Scotland, he said: ""I think that there's stabilisation in the oil and gas industry to an extent, and we're beginning to see that feed into increased confidence in property consumers. ""I think it is primarily driven by that because it is such a major factor in the local economy."" Mr Fraser believes that there will not be a dramatic change in the property market, but instead a gradual increase carrying on into next year. However, he too recognises the uncertainty around the market as Brexit approaches.  He said: ""I would say that if it were not for the uncertainty over Brexit we would probably be seeing a much clearer picture in the local economy, so to a certain extent, the improvement in the Aberdeen area is being veiled by a slight uncertainty over Brexit."" But for Aberdeen, Mr Fraser predicted that growth in the local economy would have a far greater influence on the health of the housing market than the state of the national economy.  He added: ""We have seen many instances in Aberdeen where the local economy has be diametrically opposite to the UK economy."" "
economic indicators,"Stormont needs to find £800m, civil servants say",2024-09-15,2023-05-02,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65454672,"Stormont officials believe they will need to find £800m in cuts and revenue raising measures in the wake of last week's budget. The figure is included in an assessment of the budget by the independent Northern Ireland Fiscal Council (NIFC). It said Stormont's overall budget for day-to-day spending would fall by 3.3% in real terms in this financial year. That is a tougher settlement than central government departments, which are facing a 0.7% real terms cut. This is particularly stark for Northern Ireland education, which is facing a 2.7% cut while the schools budget for England is due to rise by 6.5%. The NIFC said the relatively large cut for education may reflect that it was the largest overspender last year. The council said Stormont's real overall budget cut would have been 5.5% if last year's overspend had to be paid back immediately. The Treasury has agreed the £300m overspend can be repaid over two years rather than one. The NIFC said that while this ""avoids a very sharp real terms cut in departmental spending this year"" it still means ""tough decisions on spending and revenue raising"". It adds: ""The NI Civil Service believes it they may need to find £800m this year given the pressures on its budgets.  ""Revenue raising would likely be focused on fees and charges as the secretary of state has already set the regional rate for 2023- 24."" The government has said the overspend can be cleared by using any additional in-year funding from the Treasury. Should this not cover the full amount, the outstanding balance would be paid in 2024-25 by reallocating money from previously announced Northern Ireland funding packages. The NIFC suggested that the money is most likely to be found in two pots - the 2020 'New Deal' funding to help businesses following Brexit and the 2014 Stormont House Agreement funding for institutions to address the legacy of the Troubles.  The former totalled £400m, although it is not clear how much has already been spent. The latter totalled up to £150m over five years. Separately, an independent review by the NIFC has concluded that public spending per head in Northern Ireland needs to be 24% higher than in England to deliver comparable public services. The work uses population indicators such as age and long term illness to assess relative need. It calculates that spending her head in Northern Ireland is currently 23% higher than England. But it warns that under the current public spending model that premium will fall to 20% by the end of this decade. As recently as 2018-19, the Northern Ireland premium was as high as 40% due to pots of one-off funding related to various political deals. The NIFC says that the reduction in that premium has contributed to the current budget pressure on Northern Ireland departments. Sir Robert Chote, chair of the NIFC, said ""For many years NI departments benefited from funding-per-head that was not only well above spending in England but also above estimates of relative need."" He added that the funding premium has ""fallen sharply to broadly in line with relative need - which has already proved very challenging - and it is set to drop even further"". He said this would increase the pressure on a restored Stormont Executive to deliver reform and improve efficiency, as well as confronting it with difficult choices over cutting services or raising more revenue.  Sir Robert added that another option would be to put a ""funding floor"" under the block grant in line with relative need, as happens in Wales.  That sort of arrangement would need to be negotiated and agreed with the UK government. The Democratic Unionist Party has been tentatively floating the idea of an arrangement similar to the one that applies in Wales."
economic indicators,Has the home ownership dream soured?,2024-09-15,2017-10-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-41581824,"""Trapped"" and ""frustrated"" - This is how people describe being unable to sell homes whose values have yet to recover from the financial crisis that started more than a decade ago. House prices are lower in real terms than they were in 2007 in more than half of England and Wales, according to analysis for BBC News. Those who wish to sell can find themselves with a home worth less than they paid for it, particularly in northern England. In the areas where values have continued to rise buyers are finding it impossible to find an affordable home, particularly in London and the South. But what is it really like for those of us trying to get a step on the property ladder or move? The large number of for sale signs and boarded up homes tell the story of a depressed sales market in Horden, County Durham The former mining community is not attracting buyers or investors and house values, when adjusted for inflation, have fallen by about 57%. Lee Percival paid £112,995 for his home on a newly built estate in 2007. The estate has never been finished due to the financial crash and his home has dropped in value by about £30,000. ""I regret buying it at the time we did, my wife loves it here, but I just feel - well we have made a loss haven't we? ""Yes, I feel trapped."" Mr Percival admits if he had to move it would be hard to sell. ""We could lose more than that, we might have to take less than that for it. ""I know I could never sell it at the moment."" In parts of Bradford values have crashed by up to 50% in real terms and one of those who have found themselves with a house worth less than it cost is Isaac Stott. The charity worker bought his home in 2007 and paid £86,500 for it. ""Everything was going really well it looked like a good investment but within nine months the property value dropped to around £35 to 40,000."" He said the market has improved but his three-bedroom home is on the market for £76,500 - £10,000 less than he paid. ""It is frustrating to see how much it has dropped and how much it is worth. ""My sister in Kent lived in a very small house and she just sold that for just over £250,000 and it is like - great."" Isaac and his wife admit trying to sell and the potential financial loss is worrying. ""It has taken up space in our life. I can find myself coming home and thinking 'Oh I wish we had sold this'. ""It weighs on my mind."" Lucian Cook, residential property research director at Savills, said one of the principal reasons for the stark regional differences is economic. ""What you have is a two speed-economy much more weighted to London and the south leaving a lot of the north behind. ""What that tends to mean is there is much greater population pressure in the south and as a result you have much greater shortages of house building which has pushed prices up in a way that hasn't happened in the north."" He said the disparity means homeowners in northern England, who have bought since 2007, have not seen significant growth in prices. ""That makes it very difficult for you to accumulate equity in the house that you own and in turn that makes it difficult to trade up the housing ladder unless you have managed to pay off a very significant amount of your mortgage."" Bank Hall, Burnley, has seen prices drop by about 53% in real terms in 10 years but investor Indinar Madhar is not concerned. ""I think there was a bubble that burst around 2007/08. ""I've bought and kept them, I do it purely for rental income and I don't see myself selling. ""People are happy to pay about £40,000 in this area. I have another house I bought in this area for £42,000 and I'd be lucky to get £40,000 so it's not worth my interest to sell."" She said she bought because the 15 houses were cheap and has no regrets. ""It made sense for me to buy cheap houses and charge rent and get a good return on my investment for my rent so that's why I did it."" She also says businesses in the area are encouraging more people to live in Burnley, in particular major employers. ""That's one thing about Bank Hall, it's so close to the facilities of the town. You should expect for it to have a price tag on it. Maybe in time it will turn that corner."" For Neil Potter it is a different problem. He rents a three-bedroom house in Halberton in Devon because he says it is still far too expensive for him to buy. ""We rent our house - we can't get on the market because we've got three kids and to buy a four-bed, you're looking at £330,000... house prices in Devon and this area are quite expensive."" Values have fallen in Halberton, by more than 40% in a decade, the largest drop in the South West; but that brings little comfort for Mr Potter. ""We've been here 12 months - we rented in Tiverton before. ""That was a four-bed and to buy that, it was about £260,000. The three-bed we're renting in Halberton is worth around £330,000 - silly money."" Long-term residents in the area were surprised to learn values had dropped in real terms. Heather Adwick has lived in the village for 39 years and said she did not think the village was a cheap place to buy. ""I didn't think the prices had gone down because we're amazed by one house - a cottage - on the main road which is up for £410,000. ""I can't believe it - we're always amazed by how much people are putting them up for."""
economic indicators,Cold War 2: The Atlantic flank,2024-09-15,2022-03-12,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-60720696,"Ahoy there. We have a new national shipbuilding strategy. It's not much further down the slipway than the last one. Shipyard skills now get their own taskforce, and there is £206m to find ways of reducing shipping's poor record on emissions. Included in the new strategy is the promise of 150 ships and smaller boats over three decades, and more than £4bn already committed. These are Royal Navy orders, plus boats for the Border Force, lighthouse supply ships, and 38 ferries for Transport Scotland, plus the post-Brexit, export-promoting national flagship. It confirms what we knew about complex Type 26 frigates being built by BAE Systems on the Clyde and less complex Type 31 ones by Babcock at Rosyth in Fife. An order for another five of the Type 26 variety is yet to be finalised, while Poland has joined Indonesia in agreeing to buy the Type 31 design. The intention is to get naval shipbuilding into the top rank of productivity within eight years, and for efficiency to match the best European civil shipyards also by 2030. It has a long way to get there. The next Cal-Mac ferries are to be built in Turkey, with the current order well over double its budget and more than four years late at Ferguson's shipyard in Inverclyde. Royal Navy support ships will have a substantial foreign input. The shipbuilding strategy is part of the ""levelling up"" agenda, a political project as well as an economic one, to emphasise to the north of England and elsewhere that the UK government is spending money to boost industry and employment. It's so important that it requires a ""shipbuilding tsar"" - a title bestowed upon the Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace.                     But seeing this as a boost to the economy and jobs misses an important point. It looks less like an elephant in the room and more like a very angry bear. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its belligerent growling at Nato are bound to give the Ministry of Defence leverage for much more spending to raise Britain's military defences and readiness for war.  Yet the shipbuilding strategy makes no mention of Russia. And in the new circumstances, calling yourself a ""tsar"" seems a tad inappropriate. The Institute for Fiscal Studies notes that current plans make the Ministry of Defence the only major spending department to see a real terms budget cut in the next three years. It is inevitable that will be reversed, observes director Paul Johnson.  That's while there are many other pressures: with the NHS backlog, and to mitigate the acute pain coming the way of household budgets as inflation picks up pace, with both National Insurance and council tax on the way up. MPs have been asking Boris Johnson about boosting expenditure on defence. He has avoided giving any clear answers. Germany set the pace for a big lift in western defence spending soon after the invasion, with a stunning reversal of both its refusal to supply arms to foreign conflicts, and its arms budget. It is increasing its 50 billion euro annual defence budget by 50%, with a one-off boost of 100 billion. Other countries bordering Ukraine and Russia are also stepping up their defences, with ministers indicating that spending will go up in Denmark, Poland, Sweden and Italy. Britain and the US, already past the target of 2% of national output, are using existing resources to boost their presence on Nato's eastern border. So Vladimir Putin has succeeded where Donald Trump failed - pushing Nato's Europeans into a big uplift in defence expenditure, wary that the return of Trump or someone like him could mean that America's reliability against the Russian threat to its Nato neighbours comes back into doubt. Constanze Stelzenmuller, a German defence expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington, says that historic break with post-war doctrine is politically much easier for the new left-Green alliance in Berlin than it would have been for Angela Merkel. Even without a hot war breaking out, the sequel to Cold War One will require more of lots of hardware, as well as software, including cyber-warfare capacity that was not a feature in the last one. Just one indicator of the prospects for that is the rise in share prices for several of the West's biggest arms manufacturers. To take just four of the international firms that manufacture in Scotland, share prices since the start of the year are up 15% for Raytheon and 49% for France-based Thales. The US giant Lockheed Martin is up 25% and BAE Systems, which has Clyde shipyards and much else besides, is up 33%. So where will extra money be required? The disparity in land forces is striking. Military pundits point to Russian tanks vastly outnumbering those defending Nato's borders. That's not to say the tanks will work, or that they have the same role in modern warfare as the one envisaged in the first Cold War. Air superiority, if it can be established, leave them vulnerable, and Ukrainians seem to be doing a lot of damage with Belfast-made anti-tank missiles among others. Britain's contribution to the eastern defences may see more army spending, and the cost of replacing those anti-tank and other weapons that have been given to the Ukrainian armed forces. The Treasury provides the Ministry of Defence with a flexible fund for that, which flexed up to £4bn per year during the Afghan conflict, but is more often in the hundreds of millions. But if we're looking to Cold War 2 or worse, there is also a need to defend Nato's Atlantic flank, which was Britain's main role after 1945. That returns several Scottish military bases into the front line. Unst in Shetland has regained its listening post at RAF Saxa Vord. After years without maritime surveillance, that has returned to Lossiemouth. Russia has been probing UK airspace with military aircraft, if only to make the unsettling point that it can. An anonymous Royal Navy assessment of its naval fighting capacity, openly available online, sees its larger northern fleet as a mixture. There are ageing Cold War relics, including its one aircraft carrier, which audaciously belched its fumes through the English Channel a few years back. It has some more modern surface ships, but the assessment focuses more concern on Russia's modernised submarine fleet. Partly, that is because it poses a threat to the UK's nuclear-armed submarines, if they can be found out there in the Atlantic. But far more vulnerable are the seabed cables that cross the Atlantic and represent vital infrastructure for Nato members' economies.  Defending those cables has become one of the key tasks of Nato naval strategy. It also has to contend with the vulnerability of hundreds of oil and gas platforms in UK and Norwegian waters, and the pipelines that link them to the land. The Royal Navy has a key role in that.  A recent speech at Rosyth by the new First Sea Lord set out the case for this being a time for the Royal Navy to return to the forefront of Britain's military thinking. ""Having spent the last five years in the operational space and seen what Russia is doing, I say to my Russian counterparts we are watching you and we will match you. ""The Russian Navy itself has gone through a major recapitalisation programme in the last decade and a half. It's upgrading its frigates, its amphibious ships and its submarine force."" The plan is not to match Russia hull for hull, or to match China, which the admiral says is growing its naval force at ""an astonishing rate"", but to ""pack more punch - more lethality"" in the Navy's ability to project force. This is the Royal Navy's moment,says its chief, arguing 11 days before the Ukraine invasion that history feels like it is at an inflection point: ""The geopolitical tectonic plates are moving, as we shift from the large land centric campaigns of the last 20 years. It feels as if we are returning to a maritime era. Our government realises that."" The First Sea Lord will surely have read carefully a scathing assessment of the Royal Navy's many weaknesses, set out by MPs on Westminster's defence committee last December; procurement that goes off course and lessons not learned, a lack of fleet support ships, weapon systems being retired and not replaced, a failure to procure the communications necessary across the fleet, a limited ability to do much without allies, reliance on shipyards that are not fit for purpose, and new, high-end ships stuck in port because their propulsion systems don't work, and which won't be fixed until 2028 at the earliest. ""When ships do get to sea they act like porcupines - well defended herbivores with limited offensive capabilities,"" the MPs concluded. ""This is a result of decisions by successive governments to limit budgets and prioritise defensive capabilities. ""Over the next five years or so, at least until the new classes of surface escorts come on stream, the Royal Navy will be asked to do even more with even less. This is a clear risk, which those beyond these shores can calculate just as readily as we can."" At the Royal United Services Institute in London, Prof Malcolm Chalmers says: ""On the balance of investment, the Ministry of Defence would be well advised to examine very carefully what can be learned from this war in Ukraine: weaknesses to be exploited, strengths where we thought they had weaknesses, and then prioritise how best we deal with Russia. ""The UK will not fight Russia by itself, and it's important to think about how the UK can contribute to Nato."" The professor adds: ""What's happening in Germany is mind-blowing"". While Berlin's military planners are best placed to play the key role in stepping up defences on Nato's eastern land borders, he expects to hear calls in Britain for reversal of the recent decisions to cut army numbers. Yet Cold War 2, and the threat of a shooting war between Nato and Russia, is much more complex still. For years, Russia has been fighting a hybrid war, in which it uses various forms of non-military tactics to undermine its adversaries' capacity to retaliate. Interference in elections, and contributing actively to mistrust of mainstream media are among the more obvious.                                                            Dr Stelzenmuller says this has already gone beyond a second Cold War. That ended with the Ukraine invasion, she says. And fighting is no longer like a war game that can be planned by moving military hardware around the landscape.  ""We are seeing a massive focus on economic power, on weaponizing economic interdependence, in the form of sanctions and export controls,"" she says. It features cyber warfare, at which all sides can, and do, play dirty, and reach into every home and the basic infrastructure of adversaries' way of life, far from the military fronts.  It involves propaganda and disinformation to shape public opinion using methods that did not apply before. She also contrasts Cold War 1 and current hostilities with the ability of Russians to leave their country if they choose, for now. For Russia, that runs the risk of losing its intelligentsia and undermining its economic capacity for innovation. Leaving Russia may soon become much more difficult. The German defence analyst also sees a future confrontation in which the West can be disoriented by its adversaries by what is known as ""forum- and domain-hopping"", moving swiftly from physical to cyber warfare, or attacking in several places at once: a cyber attack in Romania, perhaps, a swift boat naval attack in the Baltic, and a terrorist outrage in Paris, orchestrated on consecutive days. What is also lacking compared with the first Cold War, she adds, is a safety net of treaties and trust-building measures - the infrastructure of de-escalation. These are the means by which warring nations can lower the heat, relieve pressure on civilians and ultimately achieve a ceasefire. Relationships were built up between military commanders on either side of the Cold War, to improve their understanding of each other. At Edinburgh University, Prof John Erickson played a significant role in brokering talks between them. Arms control treaties, which were hard-fought in the 1960s and 1970s, are no longer fit for purpose. Like an old submarine, they're rusting and of little use in a conflict. To Constanze Stelzenmuller, the role of the UK in Nato's military defences is not in doubt. What concerns her, post-Brexit and with her twin perspectives from both Washington and Berlin, is whether Britain can be counted as a politically stable and reliable partner."
economic indicators,Employment rate falls in Scotland,2024-09-15,2022-02-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-60385630,"Scotland's estimated employment rate fell from 74.9% to 74.1% between October and December, official figures show. During the latest period, the estimated unemployment rate among people aged 16 and over remained unchanged at 4.1%. Across the UK, employment rates rose from 74.6% to 75.5%, according to the Office for National Statistics. The Scottish government said HMRC estimates showed 2.4 million payrolled employees in Scotland in January 2022. That was 14,000 more than pre-pandemic levels in February 2020. Employment Minister Richard Lochhead said: ""Despite a period of further economic uncertainty due to the spread of Omicron, the Scottish government is firmly focused on doing all we can to seize our economic potential and build an economy of secure, sustainable and satisfying jobs. ""That is why the 2022-2023 Scottish Budget will invest an additional £68.3m in employability and training to help businesses address skills shortages and help build a fairer, more prosperous economy for everyone."" Scottish Conservatives' economy spokeswoman Liz Smith said it was ""extremely worrying"" that the number of people in work in Scotland fell in the last three months of the year, while employment levels rose in the UK as a whole. ""This is yet more alarming evidence that Scotland is starting to lag behind our closest neighbours in our recovery from the pandemic,"" she said. ""Despite their promises, the SNP failed to protect jobs and livelihoods in the wake of the Omicron variant.  ""Scottish employers suffered through harsher restrictions than elsewhere in the UK in December, and the SNP's dismally slow roll-out of support funding put businesses under even more pressure."" The Fraser of Allander economic research institute at Strathclyde University said that improvements in headline labour market indicators over the past 12 months showed that the economy was recovering from the worst of the pandemic, but warned there was ""still some way to go"". The institute's head of research, Dr Stuart McIntyre, said: ""Compared to two years ago, there are still over 34,000 fewer people in employment in Scotland, and over 15,000 more people unemployed. ""There is also an across-the-board weakening of labour market outcomes for men, in contrast to those of women where we have seen falls in unemployment, inactivity and increases in employment compared to two years ago."""
economic indicators,"You've never had it so good, although..",2024-09-15,2017-09-13,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-41256184,"Scotland has never had it so good.  Exceptionally low unemployment. Record high employment. Jobs growth motoring nicely. Only the south-east and south west regions of England have lower unemployment rates. The concerning rise in economic inactivity - those not counting themselves as available for work - has diminished since the start of the year. That's before we were able to find out why it was. Why is this happening? Judging by other indicators published in recent months, it has to do with a buoyant manufacturing and export market, helped by the fall in the value of sterling. Tourism is an export, even if it doesn't look like one. And it has had a bumper year, from foreigners and staycationers. There are some signs that the shake-out of jobs from the oil and gas sector has at least levelled off, and that has almost certainly been a big driver of the relatively poor economic performance in the past couple of years. As if to underline that point, the Scottish government has today announced it's winding up its Energy Jobs Taskforce, set up in January 2015.  There's much slapping on the back between ministers, employers and unions about a job well done, while its tasks are folded into mainstream arrangements. The fall in inactivity may also have quite a lot to do with the benefits system. Though ""fitness for work"" assessments have been controversial, they have forced at least some people back into the job search who might otherwise be counted as ""long-term sick"" or otherwise unavailable for work. Take also the case of parents. Jobs are becoming more available. Employers should be more willing to be flexible on hours in order to get the skills they need, while the real earnings from a sole breadwinner are being squeezed, there's more of a case for a parent (usually the mother) to go out to work. That's helped if childcare becomes easier or less expensive. There's a ""but"". Of course there is. And that squeezed pay is part of it. According to the Office for National Statistics, average real earnings have declined in the past ten years. More expensive imports have pushed up price inflation, now close to 3%. With pay up by 2.1% in the past year, you may already be doing the maths with your household budget.  And there's also the question of job quality and job security; routes out of minimum wage jobs are tougher and more people are having to make do in the gig economy, with its zero hour contracts, long hours and poor employment protection. Bear in mind also that the jobs market is only one indicator of the economy's health. Others are looking a lot more peely-wally, and uncertainty looms larger than usual. Where does that leave us? With an exceptionally tight labour market. As a bit of churn in the jobs market is inevitable and a good thing as people leave jobs for better prospects elsewhere, we're now effectively at full employment. The ONS shows British vacancies have been rising steeply. What does an economy need when it reaches that point? Migrant labour. There's a problem there, called Brexit. And allied to the political push to cut immigration, there's the problem of sterling's weakness making British wages less attractive to migrant workers once they've been converted into their home currencies. So if employers can't get workers from elsewhere, British-based workers have the bargaining power (or industrial muscle) to push up their pay. Or some of them do, at least. That's clearly happening in the public sector, with both the Scottish and UK governments breaking through the 1% pay barrier, at least for some. I heard of one interesting example recently. Lawyers who graduated seven to nine years ago found it very hard to get apprenticeships and secure posts. But a lawyer with seven to nine years of experience is the bedrock of what makes a legal firm work. They have the experience to do much of the work, and are willing to put in the hours to get up the career ladder, but they aren't as expensive as partners.  Because of the sharp fall in recruitment with the crunch, there's now a shortage of them, so their pay is going up handsomely. Across the economy, that process can lead to pay-led inflation - higher wages, so firms put up prices, so workers demand higher wages.  That's something for which the Bank of England will be watching closely, though there's not much sign of it yet. If it does become more of a concern, watch for an interest rate rise. Anyone with a memory of the 1970s will see how badly that can go, if everyone wants to play catch-up. Just one of the problems is that it strongly favours those with most bargaining power. The other direction for businesses and the public sector to go is by saying: if we can't get the skilled workers we need, we should get more from the ones we've got, by improving productivity. That would surely be a good outcome. Either that, or invest in more automation, to replace workers. That's not necessarily bad, but it points to one of the big challenges across the world economy, of how to handle the rise of the robot."

It is the major supplier of drugs to pharmacies, dispensing doctors and hospitals in Northern Ireland. The business was formed when AAH's parent company bought Sangers in 2016. It said that as a result of merging the two operations it has identified 48 roles for redundancy and staff have been made aware. In a statement, the firm said: ""As a result of this work to amalgamate our systems and centralise some of our processes, we will be removing the equivalent of 48 full-time roles across all areas of the business.  ""Our colleagues have been told and indications are that we will be able to achieve this number through voluntary redundancy."" The Unite trade union, which represents around 200 staff in the business, said it was also optimistic that the redundancies would be voluntary. George Brash, Unite regional officer, said: ""We will want to see assurances that the terms and conditions of our members are upheld throughout the process."""
economic indicators,"Reality Check: Does England need 300,000 new homes a year?",2024-09-15,2017-11-21,By Reality Check team,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42055623,"The claim: Building 300,000 new homes a year in England would start to make housing more affordable. Reality Check verdict: Experts seem to agree on 300,000 as a good starting point but there is not universal confidence that it would make much difference to affordability. Chancellor Philip Hammond told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that experts agree that 300,000 new homes a year would start to make inroads on the affordability of housing. The figure was recommended by a House of Lords economic affairs committee report last year, which described it as the minimum annual amount needed to meet demand in England (housing is a devolved issue) and ""have a moderating effect on house prices"".  We've spoken to a number of experts to see if they agree. Malcolm Tait, professor of planning at University of Sheffield, said that the 300,000 recommended by the report ""is on the high side of recommendations, but was derived due to their view that in order to keep house prices consistent with wages, this was the figure required"". Richard Disney, professor of economics at University of Sussex, said: ""The simple answer is this is a number plucked out of thin air, since affordability depends on price and income.""  But he pointed out that the Conservative manifesto of 2015 promised one million new homes by 2020 and that the pace of construction is going to have to pick up to meet that target. Between April 2015 and the end of March 2017, a total of 287,600 homes have been built, so if the government is going to meet its manifesto pledge from 2015 of a million homes by 2020, there will need to be a considerable increase in the next three years to an average of more than 237,000 a year. Steve Hayes from the Chartered Institute of Housing, said: ""We would certainly agree with this - to meet existing and new needs, 300,000 is about right. Of course the key is what type of housing."" By recent standards, 300,000 is a very high number - the last time that many were completed in a year was in the financial year 1969-70. Some of the experts disputed that 300,000 would make much difference to affordability. Prof Michael Oxley, director of the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research, agreed: ""Saying we need around 300,000 per year for several years is not a bad generalisation, but this is more houses to meet the requirements of a growing population."" He added that those extra houses would only have a very small impact on house prices. ""For the impact on affordability to be significant, a very large number of the extra dwellings would have to be social dwellings supplied by housing associations or local authorities,"" he said. David Clapham, professor of planning at Henley Business School, said: ""300,000 is the number required to meet annual demographic change. There is little evidence that this will impact on house prices unless it is sustained over a large number of years as new production is a small proportion of the total stock of housing."" He also criticised the government's Help to Buy programme for making the problem worse by increasing demand and raising house prices further. Christine Whitehead, professor of housing economics at LSE, questioned whether that many houses could be built. ""Would there be enough demand to make it worthwhile for suppliers to actually supply the housing? There are reasons why market completions have rarely exceeded around 170,000,"" she said. Lindsay Judge, from the Resolution Foundation, agreed with the 300,000 as a minimum annual figure, adding that: ""In recent years, the 'affordable' homes that have been built are increasingly higher-priced varieties. A greater proportion of genuinely affordable homes to rent and own will be needed to make housing less of a living standards burden for families.""  Since 2010, under the coalition government followed by the Conservative government, a total of 858,930 houses have been built at an average of 122,704 a year. The Labour government from 1997 to 2010 built a total of 1,894,930 new homes, an average of 145,764 a year. According to current projections, the number of households in England will increase by 210,000 every year between 2014 and 2039. Update 22 November 2017: There is another measure of homes built, which is net additional dwellings, which DCLG considers to be its leading indicator of housing supply. Net additional dwellings includes things like business premises being converted into residential property and subtracts properties that have been demolished. This measure is also well below 300,000 a year. Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter"

In an evaluation of 42 large cities by professional services firm PwC, Belfast has slipped to 32nd place, a third annual fall in a row. The report is based on a public survey of things like income and housing. In 2015, Belfast ranked fifth in UK. The fall is mainly attributed to Northern Ireland's economic recovery lagging behind other parts of the UK. Paul Terrington, of PwC Northern Ireland, said: ""We need to realise that Belfast is not growing at the same pace as cities elsewhere across the UK. ""Low productivity and long-term economic inactivity are all constraining growth and prosperity."" He said the Belfast Region City Deal, announced in the Chancellor's budget, ""could not have come at a better time"".

economic indicators,G20 agrees ways to measure risk,2024-09-15,2011-04-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13098537,"French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde (r) chaired the meeting Finance ministers and central bankers from the G20 have agreed a set of ""indicative guidelines"" to measure potential risks to the global economy posed by national economic policies. All members of the G20 will be monitored under the new system.  In addition, members who account for more than 5% of total G20 economic output will be subject to a deeper, second-stage analysis of imbalances. They include the US, China, Japan, Germany and France. This is to ""reflect the greater potential for spillover effects from larger economies"", the group said. The G20 did not formally name the countries this would apply to but French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said that France would be one of seven in total to face higher scrutiny. The group was meeting in Washington, ahead of the spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The G20 accounts for 85% of global output and is now the main forum for trying to reform the world's financial system. Many economists believe that global imbalances contributed to the recent financial crisis. Emerging market countries reinvested their surpluses in Western markets, causing banks to take excessive risks, so the argument goes. Finance ministers agree that they must find a solution to these kind of imbalances. But countries disagree over how quickly they need to act. China recognises that it must open its economy and allow its currency, the yuan, to get stronger, but it wants to do it at its own pace.  The US, on the other hand, wants to see this happen much faster.  After its last meeting in February, the group reached a deal on indicators to detect the economic imbalances. The Washington deal on measurement applies to these indicators, which include public debts and deficits, and private debt levels and savings rates. In its latest communique, the G20 said its monitoring would use four approaches: estimating what a country's imbalances should look like using economic models specific to that country looking at a country's imbalances in terms of their national historical trends comparing a country's imbalances with groups of similar countries comparing a country's imbalances with the full G20. The last three approaches will use statistics from 1990 to 2004 ""as this is the period that preceded the large build-up in external imbalances"", the communique said. This video can not be played Watch: European policy makers 'too complacent' over economic recovery ""Those countries identified by at least two of the four approaches as having persistently large imbalances will be assessed in-depth to determine in a second step the nature and root causes of their imbalances and to identify impediments to adjustment,"" the group said. The second step of assessment would be carried out independently by the IMF. ""The guidelines operate a little bit like a net which actually holds those of the countries that violate or do not respect the guidelines,"" said Ms Lagarde, who chaired the meeting as France currently holds the presidency of the G20.  ""And the net is a little bit tighter for those countries that are considered of systemic importance because they represent more than 5% of the GDP [gross domestic product] of the G20."" However, the group made no mention of any ""name and shame"" list which would identify those members in the most risky positions. Although the global economy appears to be on the path to recovery, the meeting took place at a time when plenty of threats to growth remain. Among the challenges are unrest in the Middle East, high oil prices, continued inflation in China and debt problems in Europe. The head of the IMF, Dominique Strauss Kahn, told the BBC that some policy makers thought ""the crisis was behind us"" and this was ""the wrong attitude"". In Europe, he said, there was no room for complacency regarding high levels of debt. ""A lot more has to be done by the Europeans to fix the [debt] problem,"" he said.

economic indicators,Reality Check: Does UK spend half as much on health as US?,2024-09-15,2018-02-06,By Reality Check team,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42950587,"The claim: The NHS costs half as much as the US health system, and cares for the whole population. Reality Check verdict: If you look at every penny spent on health by anyone in the country, then the UK spends about half as much on health as the US does. But if you  compare the amount spent on the NHS with the amount spent by the US government on public healthcare, the difference is much smaller. US President Donald Trump has caused a stir by tweeting his criticisms of the UK's universal healthcare, describing it as a system that is ""going broke and not working"". NHS England boss Simon Stevens responded that ""healthcare for everybody delivered at half the cost of the US healthcare system is something that people in this country are deeply and rightly committed to"".  In the UK, healthcare is universal, while in the States there are 28 million people who are not covered by public or private insurance.  But does the NHS really cost half as much? If you look at all healthcare spending, including treatment funded privately by individuals, the US spent 17.2% of its GDP on healthcare in 2016, compared with 9.7% in the UK.  In pounds per head, that's £2,892 on healthcare for every person in the UK and £7,617 per person in the US.  So as a proportion of the value of the goods and services produced by all sectors of the economy the UK spends a bit more than half what the US spends, and in spending per head it's a bit less than half. The difficulty is, when it comes to comparing healthcare in different countries, you're never exactly comparing like for like.  Almost all health systems are a mixture of public and private - it's the ratio that varies.  In the UK, the public health system can be accessed by all permanent residents, is mostly free at the point of use and  is almost entirely paid for through taxation. Americans are far more likely to rely on private insurance to fund their healthcare since accessing public healthcare is dependent on your income. Many European countries, meanwhile, have a social insurance system where insurance contributions are mandatory. This doesn't fall under general taxation but is not dissimilar from paying National Insurance in the UK and means everyone can access healthcare.  But even if you look only at public money spent on health, the US government's spending on healthcare still outstrips UK government spending, both in terms of the proportion of its GDP (the way we normally measure the size of a country's economy) and in terms of how much it spends per head. Almost half of US health spending still comes from public money including general taxation - although it's the only country in the G7 to pay publicly for less than 50% of all healthcare that's provided. What this doesn't tell you, though, is how effective a healthcare system is, and this seems to be what Mr Stevens was getting at.  The UK government spends less on health and provides a universal service where every permanent resident can access care.  In the US, even after major changes to the system, there are 28 million people who don't have any private or public insurance.    The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says life expectancy in the United States is slightly lower than average, despite very high levels of health spending. In many cases, the more a country spends on healthcare per person, the longer its citizens' life expectancy.  But while the US spends more per person than the UK on healthcare, in 2014, average life expectancy at birth in the USA was 78.8, compared with 81.4 in the UK according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). ""Japan spent the fifth most per person on healthcare and had the highest life expectancy, while Italy spent the least per person and had the second highest life expectancy,"" the ONS's statisticians point out.   Life expectancy is a helpful, although not perfect indicator of the quality of a nation's healthcare. It is affected by other complicated social factors, such as diet and the prevalence of smoking.  Americans consume more tobacco per head than Britons and are more likely to be overweight or obese. Opioid deaths and gun crime also affect average American life expectancy.  In the summer, US think tank the Commonwealth Fund ranked the NHS the number one health system in a comparison of 11 countries for safety, affordability and efficiency. It did less well when it came to cancer survival The US was ranked last out of the 11 countries.  The American health system came off badly in comparison when it came to infant mortality, life expectancy, and preventable deaths, but did relatively better on cancer, heart attack and stroke survival. Meanwhile, the UK's cancer survival rates have historically been below the European average, although they are improving for certain cancers.  The UK has fewer doctors, nurses and hospital beds than the OECD average. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter"
economic indicators,US economic growth slows as firms cut investment,2024-09-15,2023-04-27,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65414174,"The US economy slowed in the first three months of the year, as businesses reduced investments in the face of higher borrowing costs.  The economy grew 1.1% on an annualised basis, the Commerce Department said. That was down from a rate of 2.6% in the prior quarter, despite strong consumer spending.  Analysts are watching nervously to see how the world's largest economy handles a mix of higher interest rates and rising prices.  The latest report on gross domestic product - the widest measure of economic activity - showed the economy has now grown for three quarters in a row. The US economy had contracted in the first half of last year as trade flows adjusted from the pandemic and higher borrowing costs led to a sharp slowdown in home sales.  But a strong job market has kept consumer spending - the main driver of economic activity - resilient, despite rising living costs, helping to defy predictions of a recession.  Spending was up 3.7% on an annual basis in the January-to-March period.  US President Joe Biden has cast the slowdown as a necessary adjustment after the boom following the reopening from the pandemic.  ""Today, we learned that the American economy remains strong, as it transitions to steady and stable growth,"" he said in a statement following the report.  However, many forecasters still expect the US to fall into economic recession sometime this year.   ""Overall, the data confirm the message from other indicators that while economic growth is slowing, it isn't yet collapsing,"" said Andrew Hunter, deputy chief US economist for Capital Economics.  ""Nevertheless, with most leading indicators of recession still flashing red and the drag from tighter credit conditions still to feed through, we expect a more marked weakening soon."" The US central bank has pushed interest rates to more than 4.75%, from near zero last March, moving aggressively to try to slow the economy and ease the pressures pushing up prices.  Since the campaign started, inflation - the rate at which prices rise - has dropped back, falling to 5% in March, but it remains higher than the bank's 2% target.  Meanwhile firms - especially in sectors such as housing, finance and tech where low borrowing costs had fuelled growth - have been growing more cautious.  Recent weeks have been marked by announcements of job cuts from many big businesses, including consultancy Deloitte, manufacturer 3M, retailer Gap and tech giant Meta. Thursday's report showed the biggest drop in business investment in equipment since the pandemic in 2020, falling 7.3% on an annual basis. Analysts say they expect further pain ahead as the job market weakens and banks grow more wary of lending after a string of US bank failures last month. Retail sales have already slowed since the start of the year and consumer confidence has taken a hit.  ""GDP growth is being held up largely by the consumer at present, but growth in consumer spending appears to have lost momentum over the past month or two,"" Wells Fargo economist Jay Bryson said. ""We forecast that the US economy to slip into recession, which we expect to be of moderate severity, in the second half of the year."""
economic indicators,German car giants face EU diesel probe,2024-09-15,2018-09-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45558588,"German carmakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen are to face an EU inquiry for allegedly conspiring to restrict diesel emissions treatment systems. The European Commission said it was investigating whether they agreed to limit the development of systems to reduce harmful emissions. It said that if proven, this could mean that consumers had been denied the chance to buy less polluting cars. The firms were raided in 2017 as part of the Commission's earlier inquiries. The Commission said its in-depth investigation was intended to assess whether the carmakers colluded, in breach of EU anti-trust rules, to avoid competing on technology to clean up petrol and diesel car emissions. It said it was focusing on information indicating that the companies, including VW-owned Audi and Porsche, had met to discuss the development and deployment of emissions technology. Two kinds of emissions control systems are under scrutiny: ""The Commission's in-depth investigation in this case concerns specific co-operation that is suspected to have aimed at limiting the technical development or preventing the roll-out of technical devices,"" it said. All three companies issued statements saying they were co-operating fully with the Commission and would not comment further on the proceedings. Daimler pointed out that the proceedings related exclusively to Europe and that there had been no price-fixing allegations.  BMW said it was ""wholeheartedly committed to the principles of market economics and fair competition"". The Commission said it had no indications that the carmakers co-ordinated with each other on the use of illegal emissions-cheating ""defeat devices"". Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to using ""defeat device"" software in the US to cheat diesel engine emissions tests, plunging the company into scandal. Since then, emissions irregularities have surfaced at several major carmakers, although none were found to be as serious as at Volkswagen. Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent  This investigation could prove very costly for the carmakers concerned. If the Commission finds that there has been deliberate wrongdoing they could face very heavy penalties. Cartel action is frowned upon in Brussels. Fines can run into the hundreds of millions - if not billions - of euros.  Then there's the political backdrop. Since the scandal over emissions cheating at Volkswagen erupted three years ago, any hint that manufacturers may have been sabotaging efforts to produce cleaner cars has gone down very badly - especially in Germany. The fact the VW Group itself is involved is likely to raise further concerns.  Car companies do talk to each other regularly about issues such as technical standards or improving safety. All of that's allowed; the question is where they draw the line between essential cooperation and anti-competitive behaviour.  That's likely to be the focus of the Commission's inquiry, which remains an inquiry - for the moment. "

The Treasury said ""last resort"" support could be made available if a firm's failure would ""disproportionately harm the UK economy"". The move follows indications that a number of big firms are seeking government help to survive the crisis. These include Jaguar Land Rover, which is in talks to secure a £1bn loan. The government has already put in place various initiatives to help companies weather the pandemic, including loan programmes, deferring of tax payments and the furlough scheme, which allows workers to receive 80% of their salary paid by the government. According to latest figures, eight million workers are covered by the furlough scheme which has been extended until the end of October. But from August, businesses will be expected to meet part of the cost of the scheme.  Concern is growing that some big firms are still in difficulties even after making use of these options. The bailout plan, named ""Project Birch"", was mentioned by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps in Parliament last week when discussing the future of the aviation industry. It could involve the state taking stakes in companies, although extending existing loans would be preferable. Unite the union welcomed the plan but urged the government to act quickly. ""There is no more time to lose if we are to prevent a tsunami of job losses from sweeping through communities this summer,"" said Unite assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner. ""We still need to ensure that proposed changes to the job retention scheme do not undermine a plan to recover and rebuild and that workers continue to get their wages.""  A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We have put in place unprecedented levels of support to help businesses get through this crisis.  ""Beyond that, many firms are getting support from established market mechanisms, such as existing shareholders, bank lending and commercial finance. ""In exceptional circumstances, where a viable company has exhausted all options and its failure would disproportionately harm the economy, we may consider support on a 'last resort' basis.  ""As the British public would expect, we are putting in place sensible contingency planning and any such support would be on terms that protect the taxpayer.""  The BBC understands the Treasury would have to notify Parliament of any spend incurred, and although companies might seek financial assistance, this does not mean such support will be given. On Saturday, Sky News reported that Tata Steel, Britain's biggest steel producer, had approached both the Welsh and UK governments for financial aid that could run into hundreds of millions.  Earlier this week, Welsh MP Stephen Kinnock told parliament that Tata Steel, which owns the steelworks in Port Talbot, needs around £500m in order to survive the pandemic.  And according to the Financial Times, aviation industry bosses have been asking the government for a ""long-term investment facility"" that would help to support supply chains.  Jim O'Neill, former Treasury minister and ex-chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told the newspaper he had been in discussion with government officials about creating a public sector-owned funding body to take stakes in firms that would be ""inherently stable"" in times of normal economic activity.

economic indicators,Business and community leaders react to exit plan,2024-09-15,2021-03-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-56252635,"The NI Executive has set out its plan for exiting lockdown. The blueprint does not include a timetable, but there are five steps covering nine separate pathways, ranging from retail, hospitality, worship and sport and leisure. Progression through the plan depends on key health criteria being met. Business and community leaders have been reacting to Moving Forward: The Executive's Pathway Out of Restrictions. Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster ""We welcome the activity undertaken by the executive so far in bringing forward this roadmap.  ""However, it has been some time in coming and disappointing to see that parts of hospitality have been earmarked to reopen after non-essential retail and with no mention of an additional support package.  ""There is a genuine fear amongst many in our sector that businesses are going to fail and jobs will be lost at the eleventh hour.  ""We are really frustrated that this pathway shows no dates whatsoever and once again singles out our traditional (wet) pubs for extended closure. How are our pubs supposed to survive, and the industry plan for the re-emergence of the entire sector?"" Dr David Bruce, moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland Dr Bruce told BBC Radio Ulster that he welcomed the ""direction of travel"" outlined in the document. He said he hoped there could be a return to services in places of worship - with a risk assessment - from 2 April (Good Friday). He told Evening Extra that combined with the vaccine rollout, there was a clear ""rationale"" behind the plan.  Michael Henderson, director of Northern Ireland Takeaway Association ""The announcement today by NI Executive will be welcoming news to all our members.  ""But with the restrictions still in place for at least another four weeks we fear some of our takeaways won't last until April unless they are provided with financial support. ""Many of our members rely on the after 11pm trade with some members losing up to 60% of regular income.  ""We call on the Northern Ireland Executive to include these takeaways into the Covid Restriction Business Support Scheme Part B, this would ensure our takeaway owners who are financially struggling with current restrictions can stay open for business and secure jobs across Northern Ireland until restrictions are lifted."" Jacqui Pope, head of service at GLL which runs gyms for Belfast City Council ""A timely return to outdoor sports facilities for training and group activities is to be welcomed as a positive boost for the leisure sector, however it does not go far enough. ""GLL has been calling for the reopening of gyms and swimming pools to be prioritised in the recovery plans. These services are vital to public health and wellbeing and it is disappointing no dates have been specified. ""People have a right to look after their health and get back on track with regular training and gym classes, which are widely accepted as having a positive impact on mental health. ""Gyms are ready to open safely, have low rates of Covid-19 transmission and well-rehearsed safety measures in place."" Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium ""These pathways are welcomed by the whole of the NI business community, and particularly the retail industry, who have been one of the most affected parts of our economy.  ""While there is a clear pathway for leaving lockdown and reopening fully, there are still no dates in place.  ""We understand that the executive will follow the science, however it is vital that there is clarity about the criteria for reopening and that government ensures affected businesses continue to be supported in the coming weeks."" Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI  ""Sadly, this falls far short of what is needed for a viable roadmap.  ""It lacks detail, contains vague criteria for moving between the steps/phases and gives no certainty for retailers to plan ahead for reopening. ""Accepting that exact dates were not going to be in the document, the very least that could have been included should have been broad timelines to give retailers some idea of the next steps."" Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber of Commerce ""The executive may have agreed their route to reopening the economy, but the truth is none of us know when this journey will actually start or how long it will take. ""Each step will, no doubt, be subject to executive wrangling with businesses unable to plan properly.  ""It is not too harsh to say that as far as offering both hope and certainty, this falls far short. ""Not only are there no dates, but there is no clarity about where certain health indicators need to be to move us through each of the steps, there is potential for confusing communications as different sectors and sub sectors within the pathways are at different stages, and there is the real risk that no timetable will see many businesses calling it a day."" Dawn McLaughlin, Londonderry Chamber president ""While it is encouraging to see the publication of the Pathway to Recovery... the document does little to give businesses cause for optimism or certainty for the coming weeks and months ahead. ""They need to be given time to prepare and get ready for opening their doors to customers again, especially as we move into the busy summer period to allow badly-hit businesses the opportunity to fully maximise this important trading period.  ""They need to be given specific guidance on what vaccine or Covid case targets Northern Ireland needs to meet to reopen, under what circumstances they can reopen, and what safeguards and safety measures they need to put in place."" William Miller, national director of Funeral Directors  ""I think we're basically back to where we were before December, in terms of, we risk assess the venue - both externally and internally - and then advise on the numbers to families of how many mourners that can be at the funeral.  ""It is a bit easier, certainly better than online services.  ""It's hard for the health authorities to pinpoint a date, ideally a date would have been great for everybody.  ""We'll just have to work with it. We've worked with it since last March and we'll keep on working with it and looking after the bereaved and after the people who mean the most at the time of the death."" Ken Webb, chair of the Further Education Colleges Principal's Group ""The recovery plan is welcome and attention now must turn to the safe return of our students and staff to campus and the resumption of face-to-face learning. ""College life has been disrupted now for one year with lengthy periods being spent in online, remote learning.  ""This learning format cannot replace practical skills development that takes place in college campuses and coupled with remaining uncertainty over arrangements to replace examinations, there is real anxiety being felt amongst our college communities, between both students and staff."" Sandra Corkin, owner of Oasis Travel and Northern Ireland's ABTA representative ""We sort of new that foreign travel was going to be one of the last steps to happen and we already knew there wasn't going to be any specific dates given. ""There is confidence out there. Given what the UK government has said, that travel will start sometime this summer, we think Northern Ireland may follow suit.  ""We are feeling a bit more confident. Certainly our customers are feeling a bit more confident that they might get a holiday sometime this year."""
economic indicators,China spending and employment hit amid lockdowns,2024-09-15,2022-04-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61137195,"China's consumer spending fell and unemployment rose last month as Covid lockdowns confined millions of people to their homes, official figures show. Joblessness reached the highest level since the early part of the pandemic. However, overall the country's economy grew at a faster pace than expected in the first three months of this year. A surge in infections has triggered lockdowns in several major cities - including the financial, manufacturing and shipping hub of Shanghai. Retail sales fell by 3.5% in March compared to a year earlier, China's National Bureau of Statistics said. That was the first decline since July 2020. For the same period unemployment rose to 5.8%, the highest level since May 2020. The figures highlight the increased risk of a sharp slowdown in the coming months as major lockdowns and the war in Ukraine take their toll on the world's second largest economy. As a whole, China's economy grew at a better-than-expected rate in the first three months of the year. Gross domestic product (GDP), a key economic indicator, expanded by 4.8% compared to a year earlier, beating analysts' forecasts. However, that is below Beijing's goal of growing its economy by 5.5% this year. Tommy Xie, head of Greater China research at OCBC Bank, said that the lockdowns, which began in the second half of March, were so far having a ""limited"" impact but he expects the restrictions to be a significant drag on economic growth this month. ""[China] is likely to feel the full-blown impact from the lockdown,"" Mr Xie told the BBC. ""The impact in April is likely to deepen given the longer-than-expected lockdowns in Shanghai and spillover to other parts of China.""  On Friday, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said it would help more than 600 companies in Shanghai to restart operations. They included firms in the computer chip, car making and medical industries.  The regulator said it has sent a team to the city ""to ensure the supply of medical supplies and promote key industries"". Manufacturers, including Pegatron a major producer of Apple's iPhone, have halted operations in Shanghai because of the lockdown.  Richard Yu, an executive at Chinese technology giant Huawei, last week warned that technology, industrial and automobile supply chains ""will come to a complete halt"" if the city did not resume production by next month. ""That will pose severe consequences and massive losses for the whole industry,"" Mr Yu said in a WeChat post on Friday.  Earlier on Monday, Chinese authorities reported the deaths of three people from Covid in Shanghai, which was locked down in late March.  The three people were aged between 89 and 91, had several underlying illnesses, and were unvaccinated, authorities said.  Meanwhile, the strict lockdown of the Shanghai has stoked anger among some of the city's residents. In recent weeks people have taken to social media to complain about the restrictions and the lack of food supplies, while video footage has shown confrontations between police and residents."
economic indicators,British Steel to cut jobs amid fears for industry,2024-09-15,2023-02-21,By Simon Jack,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64725229,"British Steel is expected to announce on Wednesday the closure of its coking ovens in Scunthorpe with the loss of 300 jobs. The timescale for the closure is unclear, as is how many compulsory redundancies it will involve.  Coking ovens are used to turn coal into coke which burns at the higher temperature needed for the two blast furnaces that remain in operation.  The closure means British Steel will import coke. The closure of the coking ovens is seen as a worrying indicator about the health of the UK steel industry. Union officials told the BBC that the industry ""is on a knife edge"". Government sources described the decision as ""disappointing"" given that negotiations are still ongoing between British Steel's Chinese owners Jingye, Tata, and the Treasury about a support package worth £300m to each company. A British Steel spokesman said: ""Unfortunately, like many other businesses we are reluctantly having to consider cost cutting in light of the global recession and increased costs."" Jingye has invested £330m in three years, and is committed long-term, but British Steel is ""facing significant challenges because of the economic slowdown, rising inflation and exceptionally high energy prices"", the spokesperson said. UK steelmaking is ""uncompetitive"" internationally, the spokesperson added. Union sources said they understand the government offers have been rejected to date on the basis they come with too many strings attached, including job guarantees for 10 years. The offers are also too small to help with the estimated £2bn cost of transitioning from blast furnaces to more energy efficient electric arc furnaces, they said.  Electric arc furnaces do not burn hot enough to make virgin steel, and are fed with recycled steel. Currently it is cheaper to send scrap steel to Turkey and Indonesia than recycle it here.  Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch recently said it is ""not a given"" that the UK needs a steel industry while conceding the importance of the industry ""in the communities in which they operate"". Talks on how many voluntary and compulsory redundancies there will be will begin next week, and there are reports that the closure could happen by the end of the year. There are also fears for further job losses across the plant. At the beginning of February, British Steel was considering 800 job cuts at its Scunthorpe plant. At the time a Jingye representative described government support discussions as ""unsatisfactory"". The proposed support package did not address energy, labour, and carbon costs, and low domestic demand, the representative said."
economic indicators,New car sales in Wales dip sharply,2024-09-15,2017-08-08,By Sarah Dickins,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-40854750,"Sales of new cars in Wales have fallen by more than in any other nation or region of the UK in the past year.  The decline in sales in Wales was nearly 8%  compared with a drop of 2.2% across the UK.  That is three times as steeply as the rest of the UK, according to the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).  July was the fourth consecutive month that fewer new cars were sold in the UK, despite low interest rates.  Figures also showed that across the UK, business sales fell most steeply in the month of July - by 23.8% - followed by fleet car sales dropping 10% while private sales fell by 6.8%. There have been 50,608 new cars sold in Wales in the year to date - compared to 54,991 in the same period in 2016. Although new car sales in the traditional new registration month of March were up for a second successive year, the months since have all showed a decline. The July figure is 12.5% below the same month last year.  Ford models take the top three places in the Wales top 10, with the Fiesta accounting for 3,463 of new cars sold this year. Car sales are often seen by economists as an important indicator of confidence in the economy.  Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said: ""The fall in consumer and business confidence is having a knock-on effect on demand in the new car market and government must act quickly to provide concrete plans regarding Brexit."" Car sales matter to the Welsh economy and a decline can have an impact.  Prof Peter Wells, director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff Business School said:  ""Over the last couple of years with low interest rates, retail consumers have been reasonably strong but historically the corporate sector has been the underlying strength of the UK new car market. ""What this tells me now is that companies are perhaps looking at Brexit, perhaps at the uncertainty around where we will be over the next couple of years and are asking their own financial people to rein in a bit, looking at their company car policies and holding onto their cars for longer."" Altogether, 18,000 people are employed in more than 100 companies in Wales making components, a high proportion of which go into cars which are exported.   It also now faces the challenge of new technology and the long term death knell for new petrol and diesel cars being built. Prof Wells said big German components companies were already moving into electric vehicles and other alternatives. ""It can be done and engineers love a challenge, it's having the money, the investment and government support which can make a difference,"" he said. Toyota on Deeside makes engines for new hybrid models being built in Derby and in Turkey. ""Toyota sales in July in the UK were just over 20% up from the same period last year and if you look at our figures year on year then we are up 5%,"" a spokesman said. "
economic indicators,What is happening to the size of the Army?,2024-09-15,2018-01-22,By Reality Check team,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42774738,"The government has announced a reduction in the number of soldiers it plans to have in the Army by 2025, as part of its Integrated Review, examining ""the long-term strategic aims"" of UK national security, as well as defence, development and foreign policy. Although the number of soldiers will be falling, the UK's annual defence budget will be £7bn a year higher than previously committed to, by 2024-25. It had been widely reported that the government would be announcing a cut of 10,000 to the size of the Army, but that is not quite what is happening. What is being cut is the target for the number of fully-trained people in the Army, which is called the ""workforce requirement"". It is going down from 82,040 today to 72,500 in 2025. Full-time trained strength is the number of soldiers who have completed both their general, basic training and a second phase of specialised training for a specific role. But the Army is not currently meeting its target - there are actually only 76,350 such soldiers in the Army, which is almost 6,000 short. So the Ministry of Defence is already well on the way to getting down to its new target. ""We've seen reductions in forces all over Europe as requirements for expeditionary responses have changed,"" Fenella McGerty, from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) told BBC News.    She added that it would enable the government to put a higher proportion of defence spending towards things like technology and research and development.  But BBC Newsnight's defence editor, Mark Urban, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the reduction could have an impact on the type of operation the British military conducts in future. ""If you were going to try and do an ongoing commitment as Britain did in Helmand [in Afghanistan] for all those years of about 10,000 rolling over from one brigade group to the next...it would be extremely difficult with a force that size"". From 2010 to 2017, annual defence spending fell by £6.6bn in real terms (after factoring in rising prices over this period). That was a cut of 14.6% compared with the 2009-10 Budget, according to an analysis of government figures by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Since the 2016-17 financial year, however, annual defence spending has increased by £3bn in real terms.  The extra funding promised as part of the Integrated Review means that by the 2024-25 financial year, the defence budget will be £51.7bn in cash terms, which is £7bn more than previously planned. Trevor Taylor, of the Royal United Services Institute, said: ""This was an unexpectedly generous settlement that sent a signal that the government intended to maintain defence at a higher rate of GDP than 2% for several years at least."" GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product and is the value of everything produced by the economy in a year. An IISS study attempts to rank the world's biggest defence budgets. It puts the UK fourth behind China, India and the United States.  The USA spends more on defence than all of the other countries in the top 10 combined, with a budget of $738bn (£557bn) a year.  But when defence expenditure is analysed as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP), the UK falls to seventh in the world.  While the UK makes it into the top 10 in terms of spending, it comes way down the list in terms of military personnel. Data from the World Bank for 2018 puts the UK in 42nd place, well behind the likes of India, China, North Korea, Russia and the USA.    In 2019 the UK spent 2.1% of GDP on defence. Since 2014, Nato has set a target for its members to spend 2% of GDP on defence. However, there has been criticism surrounding the methodology used to calculate these numbers, such as whether war pensions count as defence spending.

economic indicators,"Drone downing by Iran 'accidental' , says Trump",2024-09-15,2019-06-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48711229,"Iran ""made a very big mistake"" in shooting down a US military surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz, President Donald Trump says. However, he told reporters it could have been the result of human error, saying: ""I find it hard to believe it was intentional."" Iran said the drone had violated Iranian airspace, but the US military denied this. The incident comes amid escalating tension between the two countries. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran would take its complaint that the US ""encroaches on our territory"" to the UN. Iran's UN ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi said the drone was engaged in a clear spying operation in what he called a blatant violation of international law.  In a letter to the UN secretary-general and the Security Council, Mr Ravanchi said that while Iran was not seeking war, it reserved the right to to defend its territory against hostile acts. Speaking at the White House, he called the drone's downing a ""new fly in the ointment"". Mr Trump said it was ""documented"" that the unmanned drone had been over international waters and not in Iranian airspace. ""I think probably Iran made a mistake - I would imagine it was a general or somebody that made a mistake in shooting that drone down,"" he said. ""It could have been somebody who was loose and stupid,"" he added. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has warned that war between the US and Iran would be a ""catastrophe with unpredictable consequences"". UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint. In the US, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the US had no appetite for war with Iran, while the leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden, called Mr Trump's Iran strategy a ""self-inflicted disaster"". The top Democrat in the US Senate, Chuck Schumer, said:  ""The president may not intend to go to war here, but we're worried that he and the administration may bumble into a war."" The Republicans' leader in the House, Kevin McCarthy, called for a ""measured response"" to the incident. Meanwhile Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told the BBC his country was trying to send a message to Iran that its behaviour was ""not acceptable"". ""Nobody wants to start a war. But we can't let Iran go on a rampage like this. The evidence of Iranian involvement is very compelling. They said they would do it, and now they are doing it,"" he said. Oil prices have jumped by about 5% following the incident. United Airlines has suspended its Newark to Mumbai flights, which pass through Iranian airspace, after ""a thorough safety and security review"". Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said its air force had shot down a US ""spy"" drone in the early hours after the unmanned aircraft violated Iranian airspace near Kuhmobarak in the southern province of Hormozgan. In a speech on Iranian state TV, IRGC commander-in-chief Maj-Gen Hossein Salami said the drone's downing was a ""clear message"" to the US that Iran's borders were ""our red line"". Foreign minister Javad Zarif later said Iran had retrieved sections of the US military drone ""in our territorial waters where it was shot down"". He added that the aircraft had taken off from the UAE in ""stealth mode"".  Iran released unverified footage of what it said was the US drone being destroyed. The US military's Central Command confirmed that a US Navy Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS-D) aircraft was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile system while operating in what it said was international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz at approximately 23:35 GMT on Wednesday (04:05 Iran time on Thursday). ""Iranian reports that the aircraft was over Iran are false,"" spokesman Navy Capt Bill Urban said. ""This was an unprovoked attack on a US surveillance asset in international airspace."" Lt Gen Joseph Guastella, Commander of US Air Forces Central Command, later said the drone had been operating at high altitude and was about 34km from the nearest point on the Iranian coast when it was shot down. US naval assets have been dispatched to the drone debris field in international waters, a US source told Reuters. The BAMS-D is a RQ-4A Global Hawk High-Altitude, Long, Endurance (HALE) drone that can carry out surveillance and reconnaissance missions over vast ocean and coastal regions, according to the US military. President Trump's comments suggesting that the Iranians' shooting down of an unmanned US aircraft over the Gulf was possibly a mistake tends to confirm earlier reports from Washington that the White House was eager to dial down tensions.  The Iranians had already attempted to shoot down a smaller US drone earlier in the week, and the two episodes are a powerful reminder of the dangers of escalation, with US and Iranian forces operating in close proximity. The head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps had earlier characterised the incident as a clear warning to Washington.  Mr Trump appears to be holding out the possibility that not everyone in Tehran is following the same playbook, perhaps leaving space for more moderate voices there similarly to reduce the tension.  On Monday, the US defence department said it was deploying 1,000 extra troops to the region in response to ""hostile behaviour"" by Iranian forces. It has already sent an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers. The US has also accused Iran of attacking two oil tankers with mines last Thursday just outside the Strait of Hormuz, in the Gulf of Oman. Iran rejects the allegation. It was the second time in a month tankers had been attacked close in the region, through which a fifth of the world's oil passes each day. On Monday Iran also announced its stockpile of low-enriched uranium would next week exceed limits it agreed with world powers under a landmark nuclear deal in 2015. Iran stepped up its production in response to tightening economic sanctions from the US, which unilaterally withdrew from the deal last year.  Last week, the US military accused Iran of attempting to shoot down a US MQ-9 Reaper armed drone with a surface-to-air missile in an attempt to disrupt surveillance of one of the tankers that was attacked, the Kokuka Courageous. The drone had earlier observed a fire on board the other tanker, the Front Altair. The previous week, another US MQ-9 Reaper was shot down over Yemen by a surface-to-air missile fired by the Iran-backed rebel Houthi movement.  The US military said the altitude of the engagement ""indicated an improvement over previous Houthi capability, which we assess was enabled by Iranian assistance"". Iran denies providing weapons to the Houthis. In 2011, Iran said it had captured a US RQ-170 Sentinel reconnaissance drone that had been reported lost by US forces in neighbouring Afghanistan. It developed its own version of the drone, one of which was shot down by Israel last year. May 2018: US President Donald Trump withdraws unilaterally from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, and begins reinstating sanctions to force Iran to renegotiate the accord. Iran's economy slumps as they take effect.  2 May 2019: Mr Trump steps up pressure on Tehran by ending exemptions from secondary sanctions for countries still buying Iranian oil. 5 May: The US sends an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the Gulf because of ""troubling and escalatory indications"" related to Iran. 8 May: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says Iran will scale back its commitments under the nuclear deal in retaliation for the sanctions, including by allowing its stockpile of low-enriched uranium to increase. Enriched uranium is used to make reactor fuel and potentially nuclear weapons. 12 May:  Four oil tankers are damaged by explosions off the UAE coast in the Gulf of Oman. The UAE says the blasts were caused by limpet mines planted by a ""state actor"". The US blames Iran, but it denies the allegation. 13 June: Explosions hit two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The US again accuses Iran, releasing footage purportedly showing Iranian forces removing an unexploded limpet mine from a damaged vessel. Iran says the evidence is fabricated. 17 June: Iran says it will breach the limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium set under the nuclear deal on 27 June, unless Europe protects Iranian oil sales.  20 June: Iranian forces shoot down US military drone over the Strait of Hormuz."
economic indicators,Patients at risk as NHS and care 'gridlocked',2024-09-15,2022-10-20,By Nick Triggle,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-63336928,"The health and care system in England is gridlocked with patients at risk because they cannot access the support they need, regulators say.  The Care Quality Commission's annual report warned the problem was creating long waits for ambulances and in A&E.  A major factor is most patients cannot leave hospital when they are ready, it said, because of a lack of support in the community.  The system could no longer operate effectively, the CQC said. ""People are stuck - stuck in hospital because there isn't the social care support in place for them to leave, stuck in emergency departments waiting for a hospital bed to get the treatment they need and stuck waiting for ambulances that don't arrive because those same ambulances are stuck outside hospitals waiting to transfer patients,"" chief executive Ian Trenholm said.    This winter would be particularly tough, he warned, and he was worried about how the health and care systems would cope.  Alongside delays in accident-and-emergency departments and with 999 services, 500,000 people are waiting for council-funded care - an increase from just under 300,000 in a year.  The CQC report blamed staffing shortages, with one-in-10 posts in both the NHS and social-care sector vacant.  The regulator was also heavily critical of maternity care, pointing out two out of five services were rated not good enough.  The signs were services were becoming worse, it added. ""It's unacceptable,"" Mr Trenholm said. It comes after an inquiry into maternity care at East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust found evidence of significant harm to babies, due to a ""clear pattern of suboptimal care"" during an 11-year period from 2009.  The review, published on Wednesday, said up to 45 babies may have survived with better care.  Mr Trenholm said maternity services, like the rest of the system, suffered from a lack of staff but there also seemed to be a cultural problem where the concerns were not being listened to as they should or prompting the necessary response.  The East Kent report comes just months after similar failings were identified at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust.  The numbers in the CQC report paint a picture of a health and care system where the indicators are flashing red. Inevitably that only tells part of the story. Far harder to measure is the human cost in terms of families and care staff. Over the months I've heard from many families confronted by a care system that they believe has failed them. A daughter who described the fight she faced to find enough care to allow her mother to leave hospital so she could spend her last days in her own home. The family called it a totally broken system. Another daughter who found the only way to provide her mother with the care she needed was by giving up paid work. Others who weep as they talk about their exhaustion, up through the night caring for a person they love who has dementia - the respite care which could make a difference hard to find. And then there are the care workers who worry about having to tell desperate families they just don't have enough staff to help them. It perhaps adds to the emotional burn-out many feel in the wake of the pandemic. Combine such stories with the CQC statistics and even at a time of political and economic turmoil, it underlines the urgency of fixing a problem that many governments have ducked.  The wider issues across health and care, Mr Trenholm said, were undoubtedly linked to ""historic under-investment"" - and without action, would only worsen.   This would be especially visible in poorer areas, where access to care outside hospitals was most under pressure, he said.   In addition to the increased risk of harm, more people would be driven out of the labour market through ill-health or because they were supporting family members who needed care, Mr Trenholm added.    Louise Ansari, from the patient group Healthwatch England, said the findings echoed what many patients had been telling her.  The problems would be putting ""lives at risk"" and widening health inequalities, she said.  ""It's starting to affect the public's confidence that the NHS will be there for them when they need it,"" Ms Ansari added.  NHS England medical director Prof Sir Stephen Powis accepted that it was going to be an ""incredibly challenging"" few months.  Extra support was being provided to keep patients out of hospital, he said, including the rollout of rapid-response teams to treat patients at home after incidents such as falls. ""NHS staff are working hard to keep patients safe despite the record demand and pressures,"" Sir Stephen added. Have you been affected by NHS delays?

economic indicators,The life-saving surgery women don’t get,2024-09-15,2019-06-19,"Emma Bryce and Wana Udobang from Lagos, Nigeria",https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190612-caesarean-sections-in-africa-stigma-and-maternal-mortality,"Nigeria has one of the world’s highest maternal mortality rates. One reason? Patients often decline C-sections, even when it could save lives. These women are trying to change that. When Alice Ogbara recently divulged the details of her Caesarean section to a group of women, it wasn’t an ordinary “birth story” casually shared amongst friends: she was doing something that many would consider risky. That’s because she was talking about a surgery that some women would refuse to go through with, never mind talk about, even if they knew it could save their lives. “When I walked myself [into the operating theatre], I saw everything they were going to use on me, and I was crying,” Ogbara told the others. She said she was scared she would be damaged irreparably. Then a sheet was put over her belly. “The next thing I heard was my baby crying,” she recalled – prompting congratulatory applause from the women surrounding her. Beyond this courtyard in Lagos, Nigeria, Ogbara might not share her story so willingly. Concerns over the safety of the surgery, combined with religious and social factors, mean that C-sections are stigmatised in Nigeria. This causes many women to resist the surgery – or hide it when they do go through with it. Ogbara even kept her C-section secret from members of her family. “If you tell us Nigerians that you are going to go through Caesarean section, they will tell you: ‘God forbid’,” Ogbara says. You might also like these other stories in the Health Gap: • The unspoken effect of childbirth  • The world’s hidden health crisis  • Why isn’t this birth control used more? The meeting she attended was run by a Nigerian non-profit called Mamalette, which supports pregnant women and is trying to bring down maternal mortality rates across Lagos. Part of that effort involves tackling the stigmas around birth that intercept women’s access to lifesaving care. Across Nigeria, 58,000 women die in childbirth every year, giving the country the world’s fourth-highest maternal mortality rate. Part of the problem is the country’s low Caesarean rate: just 2%. The global rate is 21%.Meanwhile, there’s just one doctor for every 6,000 people in the country. Mamalette aims to provide for women what under-resourced healthcare workers often cannot: supportive health education, and a sympathetic ear for their concerns. Their grassroots approach is showing early success in improving health outcomes for pregnant women. But the small organisation is up against considerable challenges. Global disparity In the global context where C-section rates are rising rapidly, Nigeria’s numbers stand out. Between 2000 and 2015, C-section rates almost doubled across the world. In countries like the Dominican Republic, women now undergo the surgery in more than 50% of cases. In North America, it’s 32.6%; in the United Kingdom, 26.2%. In West Africa, an average of just 4.1% of births involve a C-section, and Nigeria’s rate is half that. To effectively prevent maternal mortality, a country’s Caesarean rate shouldn’t be below 5%, the World Health Organisation says. That’s because medical C-sections are essential for preventing obstructed labour in cases where a woman’s pelvis is too small, the baby is in a breech position, or is too large to exit the birth canal. Without intervention, a constricted baby may fatally rupture the uterus, or cause tears that catastrophically haemorrhage. “I think it’s the indicator in health with the greatest possible disparity of overuse and underuse,” says Carine Ronsmans, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and an author on recent reports detailing the global Caesarean increase. A very high number of C-sections can be concerning because Caesareans can increase the risk of conditions like placenta previa, which can cause severe bleeding. At the same time, “so many women still die from not having access”, Ronsmans says. “We really can't afford to forget these women.” In Nigeria the obstacles to access are especially high in rural areas, where roughly 58% of deliveries take place with unskilled birth attendants. In urban centres with more hospitals, cost and stigma are the primary barriers. Stigma is driven by notions that vaginal birth is aligned with womanhood, whereas C-sections are not – a common idea in countries like the UK, too. That’s fortified by religion in Nigeria: Christian women commonly hear that giving birth vaginally like a “Hebrew woman” is a sign of strength and competency. This originates from a passage in the Bible, which tells the story of “vigorous” Hebrew women who stoically give birth unattended by midwives. That mythic ability to give birth vaginally – and unattended – has been upheld as a symbol of maternal virtue in Nigeria. “Nigeria is a deeply religious country, and everything is very spiritualised,” says Adepeju Jaiyeoba, founder of Nigeria’s Brown Button Foundation which is  working to reduce maternal deaths. Hospitals routinely encounter women who – scared of shaming their families – simply refuse the surgery. Often women have limited control over their own births: one case study of a Nigerian hospital revealed that in 90% of cases, women believed men should be the ones to sign the consent form enabling them to undergo C-section – placing the decision firmly in male hands. In other countries like the United Kingdom and the United States, the situation may not be as extreme. But women still face stigma for having Caesareans. And high-quality obstetric care doesn’t necessarily translate to perfect conditions for pregnant women. In 2018, maternal rights charity Birthrights found that almost three-quarters of public hospitals in the UK don’t have a clear policy allowing women to request planned Caesareans, which contravenes national clinical guidelines. Birthrights believes that has a stigmatising effect  –  especially when women have specific reasons for avoiding vaginal birth, such as a history of sexual assault, or mental health issues, says Amy Gibbs, Birthright’s chief executive. “Women should be the primary decision-makers at birth. That right to choose what will happen to your body is so fundamental.” That principle is what Mamalette is fighting for in Nigeria, too. Health advocates Just off a chaotic street where three-wheeled keke taxis and motorbikes weave through gridlocked traffic, Anike Lawal sits inside Mamalette’s quiet, cool office in the tech hub that is Lagos’s Yaba neighbourhood. A thoughtful, softly spoken woman, she says she launched Mamalette as an online community where mothers could support one another. “I didn't set out to try to save anybody’s life,” Lawal says. But tapping into the widespread community of women showed her how much risk even urban mothers faced in childbirth. “When people talk about maternal loss, you never think of women who live in cities, women who have smartphones and Facebook,” she says. In 2017 Lawal started recruiting mothers to help local women in their communities safely through pregnancy. That evolved into today’s 20-member strong team that Lawal calls the “Mamalette Champions”. These mentors, who receive training from midwives, nurses, and doctors, currently work in 20 urban-poor communities across Lagos and one in the city of Ibadan, serving more than 300 people through one-on-one home visits. They ensure that women attend their antenatal classes and register at hospitals to give birth instead of using traditional birth attendants. Often, they attend hospital with women when they go into labour. “In a country when we don't have enough hospitals or doctors, preventive care is very important. That’s what we’re doing,” says Lawal. Uniquely, Mamalette also creates a safe space where women can talk about taboo subjects around birth, like Caesareans. Often, in the communities they serve, they’re the first port of call for women who want to discuss these concerns – ranging from stigmas to the quality of surgical care, which can be low in some facilities. “Mamalette is like an intermediary between the healthcare system and the people,” says Blessing Kolade, a former mentor who now works on the programmes team at Mamalette. “The healthcare system is so overwhelmed that even the healthcare workers do not have the time to break down the information. Women cannot open up; they can’t ask any questions,” she says. That means misconceptions slip through and stigmas go unchallenged. Many women who need a C-section contemplate it for the first time when they already are in labour. At that point they’re less likely to accept the surgery, because they’re grappling with entrenched beliefs that they’ll bring their families shame. “Because of that stigma you will see somebody who’s at the point of death and still refusing a Caesarean section, because she doesn’t want to go through all that,” says mentor Oluchi Anumni. Mamalette tries to address these problems before they get to this fateful stage. Mentors, who are specially trained to debunk misconceptions around C-sections, clearly outline the reasons why women may need a C-section, such as having a small pelvis, or medical conditions like preeclampsia. This takes the shame out of the equation, and provides women with facts that give them ammunition against the judgement they might receive. Some mentors even end up defending their mentees’ decisions in hospital. “We’ve had champions who have advocated for pregnant women with their families if they needed to have medical procedures done,” says Lawal. Anecdotally, the women have noticed that their group members are much more receptive to Caesareans. Mentor Adenike Lasisi-Opaleye says she invites women who have had C-sections to come and show mentees their abdominal scars to dispel the myths about what C-sections really do. “Their perception was that C-sections were a no-go. They are now informed that [it’s] not a death warrant,” Lasisi-Opaleye says. The data Mamalette collects also shows that the majority of women under their care are now giving birth in health facilities, according to Lawal. “I can proudly say that so many women have escaped death through the things they have learned,” Anumni adds. Complex solutions But when it comes to maternal health, simply tackling cultural and social barriers to C-sections isn’t enough.  Recent research revealed that across sub-Saharan Africa, C-sections are up to 50 times more fatal than in high-income countries. That mainly stems from untreated haemorrhaging and botched anaesthesia, says Salome Maswime, an obstetrician, gynaecologist and lecturer at University of the Witwatersrand, who was involved in the research. “As a doctor, I really feel access is the place to start. But I’m nervous to simply say access on its own,” Maswime says. “We need to pay attention to the quality of surgical care that women have.” She believes that if care improves, it would also lessen stigmas associated with the surgery: “I don’t think it’s as simple as counselling women,” Maswime says. “It’s a complex problem requiring complex solutions.” The cost of medical care is also a deterrent to obtaining surgery in Nigeria. Some countries have tried to improve access by making C-sections free. In Mali and Benin, removing user fees has been shown to increase hospital births and to lead to better health outcomes for women and their infants. In Nigeria similar changes are unfolding: the Lagos State government, for example, recently announced the launch of a new health insurance scheme that will make Caesareans free. Also in Lagos State, some hospitals now refer women who refuse C-sections to social workers to discuss their concerns, says Aduragbemi Banke-Thomas, a health policy researcher based at the London School of Economics and Lagos State University. He believes lending women a sympathetic ear is a powerful approach. “What we really need to be doing is trying to bring the women along as partners,” he says. In the UK, a similar “partnering” approach is helping hospitals increase women’s access to planned C-sections. Instead of banning planned C-sections outright – as Birthrights discovered was strikingly common, occurring in 15% of hospitals – some facilities now say that if women have been presented with the information they need to make an informed choice, their decision to have a planned C-section will be respected. That has soothed relations between patients who may previously have felt stigmatised or anxious about the lack of control over their births, and doctors who felt forced to override women’s concerns, says Nina Johns, an obstetrician at Birmingham Women’s Hospital which has adopted this new approach. “It provides that opportunity to work together, rather than antagonistically.” Whether it’s Nigeria or the UK, the fundamental problem and solution is the same, says Birthright’s Amy Gibb. “Often the woman’s right to choose what happens to her gets lost,” she says. “The way to get this right is to put women at the centre of choices about their care.” A legacy of change  Mamalette recognises the task they face is too big for one small organisation working in just a sprinkling of communities. But they believe that by empowering women with information, they’re also bringing about a longer-lasting kind of change. “Something that Mamalette is doing that we have not really seen is it’s giving women identity,” says former Mamalette mentor Olamide Ekpenyong. “We are trying to let women know that you have to stand and be bold. Don’t let society define you.” Encouraging women to assert their rights to lifesaving care crystallises that goal. “With that knowledge they educate others,” says another mentor, Christiana Ogunbowale. “Some of them have girl children, so Mamalette is already preparing the future for the women upcoming.” Alice Ogbara says her own outlook has changed. Now her daughter is a year old, and Ogbara is no longer so cautious about telling people how she gave birth. “I tell people around me, I share my own experience with them,” she says. She’s careful – advising women that if they need to have a C-section that they only should go to trusted hospitals, for example. But she’s also encouraging. “A C-section is not a bad thing,” she tells people. “It’s just a second way of delivering.” -- The reporting for this article was made possible with funding from the European Journalism Centre’s Innovation in Development Reporting Grant programme.

economic indicators,The truth about Icelandic happiness,2024-09-15,2016-05-11,Eric Weiner,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20160509-the-truth-about-icelandic-happiness,"Icelandic culture, shaped over centuries of hardship and shared suffering, reminds us of the importance – and the power – of resilience. Several years back, I visited Iceland in the dead of winter. I was researching a book on global happiness, and the small Nordic nation intrigued me. What was this country, adrift in the freezing North Atlantic, doing perched atop the world’s happiness rankings? In pursuit of answers, I buttonholed anyone willing to talk, dined on harkl (rotten shark), drank excessively, and, of course, took a dip in the Blue Lagoon, the otherworldly geothermal waters that have become synonymous with Icelandic bliss. Shortly after I left, Iceland’s largest banks went belly up and the nation’s economy teetered on the verge of collapse, collateral damage from the global financial meltdown of 2008. The unemployment rate spiked eightfold. Trust in institutions, like the banks and parliament, plummeted. I assumed that the nation’s happiness also nosedived. I was wrong. “The economic crisis had a limited effect on happiness,” according to health scientist Dora Gudmundsdottir, author of an exhaustive study published in the Social Indicators Researchjournal. Not only did the nation’s overall happiness dip only slightly during the crisis, but 25% of Icelanders reported greater happiness. What was going on? I emailed Karl Blöndal, a newspaper editor I had met in Reykjavik. “A lot of individuals have been hit hard, pensioners lost their savings. But one thing about living in a small community is that everyone you know is within reach,” he explained. “Those who lose their jobs are not isolated, the risk of estrangement is not the same as it would be in bigger societies.” Here was an essential truth about Icelandic happiness: it is largely a collective enterprise. Iceland, even with its cosmopolitan capital of Reykjavik, resembles a small town in many ways. People needn’t worry about falling into a black hole, Icelanders say, because there is no black hole to fall into you. There’s always someone to catch you. As one American immigrant to Iceland told me, if your car is stuck in the snow, someone will always, always stop.  In fact, trust levels are so high that it’s not unusual to see six-year-olds walking to school alone in the winter darkness. In a typically optimistic Icelandic statement, Blöndal even managed to see the opportunity embedded in the financial crisis. “Now we can wipe the slate clean. Who knows – this might just as well be an opportunity to forge a better, more open society where power is more diffused and the old vested interests and economic blocks have been cleared out of the way.” This idea of an open, fair society seems to be key. According to a recent United Nations report on world happiness, happiness is evenly distributed in Iceland. That is, most Icelanders are more or less equally happy, while in other nations – particularly those in the Middle East and Latin America – happiness levels vary tremendously. This is important because “new research suggests that people are significantly happier living in societies where there is less inequality of happiness.” In other words, we can achieve only so much happiness if our neighbours are miserable. Icelanders seem to intuitively recognise this essential truth. Icelanders have also developed a fierce resilience honed over centuries of deprivation and isolation. Think winter darkness, volcanic eruptions and unforgiving terrain so otherworldly that NASA dispatched the Apollo astronauts here in 1965 to train for their upcoming moon walks. You see this sort of stubborn optimism at work every day in Iceland. You see it in the way people swim outdoors, year round, or how there is no stigma attached to abandoning a bad job or relationship. This resilience can also be found in the country’s rich literary culture, one that dates back to the old sagas – Viking tales of heroism in the face of adversity. Today, Iceland publishes more books per capita than any country in the world. Some psychologists believe that literature – and other cultural resources – provides a buffer during difficult times. Stories provide a vehicle for expressing grief, and grief expressed is grief reduced. They also provide a means for a culture to channel its creative energies. And Icelanders certainly recognise the value of the written word, an attitude reflected in a common Icelandic saying: “Better to go barefoot than without books.” A happy thought, if ever there were one.

economic indicators,The world’s most generous countries,2024-09-15,2016-11-23,Lindsey Galloway,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20161111-the-worlds-most-generous-countries,"We spoke to people living in the five highest-ranking countries to find out what motivates them to donate their time and money, and how it affects the society there. It seems that lending a helping hand to a stranger can be more than just a good deed. In fact, according to research consulting company Gallup, a culture’s willingness to help others is a strong indicator of positive economic factors, including GDP and long-term unemployment, as well as multiple other benefits like encouraging greater overall wellbeing. To find out more, Gallup conducted surveys over more than 145,000 people across more than 140 countries, asking residents if they had recently donated money to a charity, volunteered for an organisation or helped a stranger in need. The encouraging results, collected in the 2016 Global Civic Engagement Report, were then projected to include the whole world – currently at 7.4 billion people – and found that in a given month, 1.4 billion people donate money to charity, almost 1 billion volunteer and 2.2 billion help strangers. Each country’s individual score varied widely, however, with residents of certain countries significantly more likely to engage in helping across all measures. We spoke to people living in the five highest-ranking countries to find out what motivates them to donate their time and money, and how it affects society there. Burma A majority of residents in this small southeast Asian country answered “yes” to each of the questions about giving, resulting in by far the highest country score in the survey. A strong Buddhist tradition informs much of the generosity here. Dr Hninzi Thet, originally from Yangon, grew up with a Catholic Goanese father and a Buddhist Burmese mother, and explained how the concept of karma in Theravada Buddhism, the school of Buddhism most prominent in Southeast Asia, plays a role. “Any good deed [Buddhists] do will be shored up for their next incarnation and they will have a better life,” she said. “For instance, on a child's birthday they offer a meal to monks, who depend on the public to feed them. [This action] will earn merit for them.” Hninzi Thet did say that donations of food and money have mostly only gone to monks and monasteries. “Only recently has there been an effort to start donating to orphanages and such in an organised effort,” she said, especially as the Burmese diaspora has brought more exposure to Western ideas of giving.  As political stability and general elections have come to the country in recent years, the number of foreigners moving to Burma has increased. In addition to their number one giving ranking, Burma also was recently named the world’s friendliest country in the InterNations Expat Insider 2015 survey, with more than 96% of respondents positively rating their affability toward foreigners. The United States Compared to Burma, Hninzi Thet, who now lives in Baltimore, has noticed there’s less of a religious basis to giving in the US, ranked second on the Gallup list. “There is less of a ROI [Return On Investment] attitude about it,” she said. “What I now admire about US giving is the pay-it-forward model, which is more in line with a civic sense.” Giving in US culture varies in type, depending on if the area is rural, suburban or urban. Naomi Hattaway, originally from Nebraska and founder of the I Am Triangle international cultural group for people who have lived abroad, has experienced each of them. “There are so many NGOs and non-profits in the [Washington] DC Metro, but as you spread to farther suburbs of the area, I would often hear people say that they had no idea how to volunteer, how to get involved or where to engage,” she said. But in the tiny town of Lucketts in Virginia, she found that “the spirit of giving, philanthropy and charitable acts was something that almost seemed mandatory for most residents. When someone would share a need, the residents would jump to help. During fundraising efforts, everyone pitched in without a thought.” This is a trait that some feel has been passed down for generations. “On both sides, my grandparents gave and gave and gave. They never bragged about it but they did tell me the stories, like hosting food and soup lines for many years through the Great Depression and both WWI and WWII,” said Zoe Helene, who lives in Massachusetts. “I think they wanted me to know that compassion for others was essential to character and that people need to take care of each other, otherwise civilization falls apart.” While those originally from this relatively wealthy country often feel they can and should be doing more, expat residents are more effusive in their praise. “As an Aussie living in America, I find the generosity of the US extraordinary,” said comedian Jim Dailakis, originally from Perth. “Living in New York City during 9/11, I witnessed overwhelming kindness and generosity. Personally, it didn’t surprise me. I find New Yorkers to be some of the friendliest people in the world.” Australia Making sure everyone has an equal chance to succeed – what locals call giving everyone “a fair go” – is a core part of Australian culture. “In other words, the chance to succeed on the same terms, without disadvantage, as others,” said Erik Stuebe, general manager of the InterContinental Melbourne The Rialto and originally from a small town in New South Wales. “As a young country, an island continent and with a small population, we are very proud of our ability to punch above our weight in most areas of national endeavour. There is great respect for someone who succeeds while remaining humble and genuine, connected to their roots and supportive of others in their efforts.” Melbourne in particular has a strong community spirit, and often holds events that contribute millions to local and worldwide causes. Some even go global, like the Movember Foundation, which started in the city in 2003 and now encourages men from all over the world to grow moustaches in November to encourage donations to men’s health. Crisis also brings out extreme generosity in Australians. “When the tsunami hit in Indonesia in 2004, Australians donated $42 million,” Dailakis said. “Bear in mind the population of the country at the time was probably no more than 20 million.” Again in 2009, when bushfires caused the loss of many lives and homes, locals stepped up. “Melbournians overwhelmed the system with donations of time, money, clothes, offers of shelter and messages of support,” Stuebe said. “I think Australians give whatever is needed, generously and to the limit of their ability.” Australians are particularly proud of the social trust and safety net that is protected by law, with strict gun laws, generous unemployment benefits and good healthcare leaving residents feeling secure. That doesn’t mean they don’t enjoy a good ribbing of their fellow citizens – Australians lean into self-deprecating and irreverent humour, and often have to assure outsiders that teasing is a sign of affection. New Zealand As residents of a small island nation and one that has historically been mostly rural, Kiwis have a long tradition of taking care of their neighbours. “There is a feeling sometimes that everyone knows each other or has ‘two degrees of separation’, so there is a duty to look out for each other,” said Katherine Shanahan, originally from Wellington who works at travel site GoEuro.co.uk. “Perhaps the strong sense of community is also a reason why the country appears to have this charitable trait."" Wellington hosts initiatives like The Free Store, where restaurants and bakeries donate food that wasn’t sold for the day, and people can take food that they might not otherwise be able to afford. In December, 18 locations across New Zealand will play host to the Great Kids Can Santa Run, a 2 or 3km run where every participant dresses up in a Santa suit to benefit local children affected by poverty. The Christchurch earthquake in 2011, which killed hundreds and injured thousands, also revitalised the nation’s giving spirit. “When I visited Christchurch five years after the earthquake, it was evident that the city was still finding it hard to get back on its feet. I was surprised to come across these ‘All Right?’ billboards,” said Shanahan. “I thought it was an interesting advertisement that was simple and sincere. Not trying to sell you anything but to just remind people to give each other a helping hand every now and then.” Those who live in New Zealand can also take plenty of time to enjoy the country’s natural beauty. As an island nation with a relatively small population, it’s easy to find and get to empty beaches, as no part of the country is more than 130km from the ocean. Sri Lanka Similar to Burma, giving in Sri Lanka is strongly informed by religion. “Most Sri Lankans are Buddhist and Hindus, and both religions endorse charity and sharing,” said Mahinthan So, who lives in the capital Colombo. A willingness to help is particularly evident in the southernmost city of Matara. “There is a saying in Sri Lanka, that says ‘No matter where you go in the island, in case of a need, you will always find a fellow from Matara and they'll definitely be happy to help,’” said Supun Budhajeewa, from Matara himself. “We have that feeling of belonging deep inside us. I think that sums us up.” From blood donation to school charity socials, there are always events in Matara and beyond that encourage benevolence. Many city-wide organizations and neighbourhoods often conduct dansel (large-scale free food stalls) during occasions like special Poya days, monthly state holidays during the full moon. Holidays are also a popular time for shramadhanas, or donating labour, such as public-road cleanups, hospital volunteering and building houses for the homeless. Along with helpful and smiling residents, Sri Lanka is also known for its diverse food. Influenced by the Portuguese, Dutch, British, Indian and Persian traders, dishes are often aromatic and full of spices, usually centred around rice and curry. Hoppers, pancakes made of egg, honey and milk, are another popular food, and the island also is known worldwide for its Ceylon tea, famous for its full body and citrus aroma.

economic indicators,Four of the best countries for women,2024-09-15,2023-09-28,Amanda Ruggeri,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20230927-the-worlds-most-gender-equal-countries,"BBC Travel talks to residents in four of the best-rated nations to find out what it's really like to live there. How is the world doing on gender equality? According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), the picture is mixed. The needle is moving in the right direction, according to its latest Global Gender Gap report, but incrementally. At the current rate of progress, the report finds, it will take 131 years to reach full parity between women and men (the report does not take into account non-binary or other identities). And no country has yet achieved full gender equality. While countries in Europe and North America tend to do better than the rest of the world, there is plenty of variation. The United States, for example, ranks 43rd, with the gender gap less than 75% closed, behind countries including Colombia, Belarus, Liberia and Cabo Verde. Australia (77.8%) ranked 26th, between Mozambique and Chile, and Canada (77%) ranked 30th, between Slovenia and Barbados. The report weighs aspects like women's economic participation (including the gender gaps in income, employment and leadership roles), educational attainment (with measures like literacy rates and educational enrolment), health and survival (such as life expectancy) and political empowerment (female representation in parliament, ministerial positions and years with a male or female head of state). Based on this data, which places perform the best – and what do women say it's really like to live there? BBC Travel talks to residents and expats in four of the top-ranked nations to better understand what it's like to travel in or move to these countries. Iceland For the 14th year in a row, Iceland takes the top position in the WEF rankings, with it gender gap estimated to be 91.2% closed. It is the only country to have closed more than 90% of its gap. Top 10 countries in the 2023 Global Gender Gap report: But the rosy picture depends on what, exactly, you look at. In the WEF report, Iceland ranks first in terms of political empowerment, thanks to the fact that nearly 25 of the last 50 years have seen a female head of state and that 48% of its parliament members are female, for example. But it comes in 79th in educational attainment and 128th for female health and survival. Even on measurements where Iceland performs well, such as the wage gap, the day-to-day picture is more complicated, says Hulda Tolgyes, a psychologist from Iceland. Iceland's wage gap between genders is smaller than most other countries, partly thanks to 2018 legislation declaring that companies with more than 25 employees must provide equal pay for equal work (or risk daily fines). Yet Tolgyes says she regularly is offered a lower amount of money for speaking fees than her husband, even when they're offered by the same company – such a common occurrence that she believes it must be sexism at play. ""It's very frustrating for me as a feminist to see how things really are around here,"" she said. ""We had a female president. We have a female prime minister. But what I see is tired and burnt-out women who are told they can do it all."" Still, Icelandic women say, there is a lot to appreciate. The country's First Lady Eliza Reid, a Canadian emigrant to Iceland who wrote the book Secrets of the Sprakkar: Iceland's Extraordinary Women and How They Are Changing the World, has remarked that her daughter has her surname, not her father's, and that her husband took several months of paternity leave for each of their children, for example. Along with Tolgyes, she agrees that the country has a long way to go – it isn't a ""gender paradise"". Still, she writes, it is a ""society where women are treated on par with men, or, at least, the intention to do so exists"". For people of all genders, there are other benefits to Icelandic living, too: among other things, it's been ranked as one of the world's happiest countries and the most peaceful. Norway Norway ranks second in the WEF's 2023 rankings, with a global gender gap estimated to be 87.9% closed. It also ranked first in the 2021 Women Peace and Security Index. The high performance isn't surprising, says Thea Ringseth, a Norwegian native who has lived in various parts of the country, including Oslo and Trondheim. ""Gender equality is quite visible in Norway,"" she explained. ""There are a lot more women in positions where they usually used to be men, like our prime minister, who for the last eight years was female, and there are a lot of female leaders in government and other key positions."" In particular, Norway has more women represented in ministry positions than any other country. Outside politics, Norway performs particularly well in terms of female literacy (it ranks first), the number of female professional and technical workers (also first) and income parity (ranking sixth). Of course, Norway hasn't reached 100% gender equality – and that's still shown in societal attitudes. ""It's expected that if your child is sick, for instance, it's usually the mother that stays home,"" said Ringseth. ""But these things aren't, I think, especially Norwegian."" Meanwhile, there's a focus on freedom and empowerment for all Norwegian citizens that Ringseth holds dear. ""As a society, it isn't frowned upon to further your needs, your education, your career, your social, economic needs [as a woman]"", she said. ""Being driven, career-oriented, ambitious – it is seen as something that is positive."" New Zealand New Zealand comes in fourth on the WEF report overall, making it the top performer in the Southern Hemisphere. It does particularly well in terms of political representation, with 50% of its parliament members female, while female enrolment in primary and secondary education is nearly on par with male. Jessica Vredenburg, a Canadian who has lived in New Zealand since 2016, is a marketing professor at Auckland University of Technology. ""In my experience, at least in the business school, the gender split is really quite even,"" she said. ""In our marketing department… we might even be more female-heavy than male. My dean is female. Most of my colleagues are female."" She's not aware of ever having had less-than-equal career opportunities than her male counterparts. Of course, like everywhere else, New Zealand is far from perfect. The WEF found that women earn an average $33,620 per year compared to $52,370 for men, for example, and in terms of wage equality for equal work, it ranks 37th. It also does relatively poorly for female life expectancy, at 109th in the world. The Indigenous Māori population is at particular risk, statistics show, with Māori women's life expectancy nearly seven years shorter than that of non-Māori women. ""My experience might be different for someone who has a Pacific Island or Māori background,"" Vredenburg said. Gender equality aside, residents say there are many reasons to love living in New Zealand. The beauty of the landscape, from the mountains to the beaches, is one part. That it's small and easy to get around is another. Then there's the overall vibe. ""It's very laid back, very easy-going, sort of chill. They really enjoy their sport and getting together – it's a friends-and-family, barbecue-and-gathering kind of culture that I quite enjoy,"" Vredenburg said. Namibia The only African country in the top 10, Namibia's gender gap is estimated to be 80.2% closed, putting it in eighth position. That means it bests many countries in other parts of the world, including the United Kingdom (15th, 79.2%), Spain (18th, 79.1%), Canada (30th, 77%) and the United States (43rd, 74.8%). The country's ranking makes sense to Penohole Brock, a Namibian former gender sensitivity trainer who is now at the Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation. ""A lot of our ministers are female. A lot of our ambassadors are female. And my work colleagues, I would say, do not face discrimination when it comes to career trajectory – it's been a very healthy work environment in that sense,"" she said. Still, representation is only part of the equation. ""Gender parity is a great step in the right direction. But now it's time to look at and analyse, 'Okay, but then what are these female voices advocating for?',"" she said. In terms of gender-based violence and sexual harassment, ""we still have quite a long way to go"". The 2021 Women Peace and Security Index, for example, placed Namibia 95th, behind other African countries including Mauritius, Rwanda, South Africa and Ghana. But Brock, who also has lived in both South Africa and Paris, says she wouldn't want to be anywhere else. ""The people, the music, the energy – I love it. It's so diverse. Each region is so different,"" she said. ""I see so much potential in Namibia. It's a wonderful place.""

economic indicators,Why Gen Z are so pay motivated,2024-09-15,2023-05-31,Megan Carnegie,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230530-why-gen-z-are-so-motivated-by-pay,"Young workers want to be compensated well from the get-go. Their quest to make higher salaries isn't simply a money grab. The oldest Gen Zers have had money on the brain since they first entered the workplace –and many have been dissatisfied with their pay packets. Data shows that as Gen Z enter and rise through the workforce, they’re highly pay motivated – and perhaps more than any other generation right now. The laser-focus on pay is not wholly new – 2016 data from jobs site Monster showed 70% of American Gen Zers named salary as their top work motivator, along with health insurance – but several years on, experts say the economic squeeze has made these young workers even more wage-conscious. In the past year, surveys show their salary expectations have skyrocketed: many are targeting six-figure salaries early in their careers.  This is in no small part due to the fact that Gen Z have found themselves in a unique position among generations. They’ve grown up watching their parents, largely Gen Xers, struggle with money amid economic downturns; now, they’ve graduated into their own economic turbulence, and are worried about securing their futures. As a result, they’re demanding more remuneration from their employers than ever, and at earlier stages in their career – and experts say many young workers are willing to walk for better-paying opportunities. To some people, Gen Z may seem salary ‘obsessed’. In some cases, say experts, it may be hard for older generations to understand why young workers have such an intense focus on pay. “At Gen Z’s age, older people worked 40 hours a week, and made enough money to buy a house and have barbecues on the weekend,” says Corey Seemiller, an educator, researcher and TEDx speaker on Gen Z. “Gen Z works 50 hours a week at their jobs, and another 20 hours a week side hustling, yet still make barely enough to cover rent.” But there’s more to the story than just the human desire to make as much as possible. And what’s more: their quest for higher salaries could benefit everyone. Downturns and turbulence Most of Gen Z, generally defined as born between 1997 and 2012, grew up against a backdrop of multiple global recessions and economic downturns. For some, instability is all they’ve known. “They were raised around their parents’ conversations about not having enough money and the bad things that happened because of that – homes were re-possessed, and savings decimated,” says Seemiller. Although money stress may have been abstract to many of them, observed largely through their parents’ experiences, the economic instability of the past few years has hit them personally – and head on – as they’ve entered the workplace.  Many of these young workers graduated into the workforce or were in their very first roles during the Covid-19 pandemic. Along with being professionally stunted and unable to climb the salary ladder, they also became susceptible to layoffs – according to some data, more than other generations. “Such experiences have shaped their values, and that fear of not having enough runs deep,” says Seemiller. They are also on entry-level salaries in extremely tough economic times, which has compounded their financial worries – and made them a feature of daily life. Spiking inflation has raised the cost of living; and as education costs have bloated, many young people are also carrying student loans. Bank of America data from 2022 shows a significant portion of Gen Z has reported the inability to save and pay down debt in the current climate. In short, they’re extremely worried about their finances, and often more than other generations. A Cigna survey of 12,000 global workers showed 39% of Gen Zers cite financial insecurity as their leading stressor, compared to 34% of millennials and 29% of 50-to-64-year-olds. Younger workers are particularly worried about the rising cost of living and how it will impact their futures.  “Both from the data and anecdotally, Gen Z workers clearly want to be fairly compensated and recognised for the value they bring to the workplace, but also seek stability,” says Sam Chen, the Gen Z founder and CEO of US-based job-matching site Fetti. Indeed, a 2022 survey from early-career jobs community Handshake shows 74% of 1,400 2023 US graduates surveyed said they prioritise stability and salary from employers, outweighing factors including a known employer brand (41%), a fast-growing field (39%) or overall benefits (66%). Essentially, says Seemiller, Gen Z are seeking high pay packets to ensure that security. “They want to be able to live off their salaries and not worry about paying their bills,” she says. “My studies have shown that being happy and fulfilled, and making enough to live comfortably top the most important features in Gen Z’s ideal careers – not being rich and travelling the world.” So, it’s not necessarily that Gen Z are greedy or money-grabbing; the majority, say experts, just want to cover their costs. Workers in locations with higher cost of living – mostly major cities – are particularly angling for higher pay; for example, by some estimates, the average entry-level salary for US workers in late 2022 was $55,260 (£44,627), yet a single adult living in San Francisco would need to be earning over $74,280 (£59,978) – after tax – to cover their costs. While, of course, all generations are experiencing the cost-of-living strains, Gen Z aren’t as far ahead in life stages, and are therefore less secure. Millennials, for example, have been in the workforce longer, and made more money cumulatively, with some able to buy homes before prices surged and Covid-19-inflation hit. “Gen Zers simply won’t be able to have a comparable life, in terms of financial stability, compared to older generations when they were entering the workforce,” says Seemiller. “Other generations, apart from perhaps millennials who entered the workforce during the recession, didn’t face these circumstances when they were young adults.” The right conditions for pay rises? Will Gen Z get the higher pay they want, then? In some cases, signs are positive. Current job-market conditions are setting up a good situation for young workers. Although hiring has cooled since its pandemic high, the jobseekers’ market is still “red-hot”  in many countries, which means workers still have the power to make demands on potential and current employers. Experts say this means that Gen Z are more confident in demanding a higher pay packet; emboldened by the intense competition for talent, some studies show that they’re feeling positive about getting their needs met. The Handshake data shows that more than 80% of survey respondents believe they can find a job that pays well – and fulfils them personally, to boot. There is a caveat, however. Data from recruitment-industry platform Sonovate, which surveyed 500 UK small- and medium-sized business owners that have increased salaries to get and keep talent, shows 54%doubt they will be able to keep up this pace of wage rises for long. Simply, even the most hopeful of young people may find themselves disappointed with their employer’s offer down the line. Many Gen Z employees may instead have to move companies if they want higher pay. And some Gen Zers are also taking the drive to make more into their own hands, especially if they’re not going to get what they need directly from their employers. In the face of pay that fails to keep up with inflation, they’re seeking new sources of income at a higher rate than older generations, with Gen Z most likely to take on a second role (30%) and increase their hours (32%) – significantly higher than Boomers, at 17% and 13%, respectively, according to Randstad’s 2023 Workmonitor Report. A rising tide Seemiller says older generations may stand to benefit from this salary motivation. Yes, Gen Z are trying to shore up their financial futures, but Seemiller also believes their salary quest is largely linked to their fine-tuned radars for fairness and equity.  “They’re a generation who call things out, speaking up when they feel the work they’re doing isn’t fairly paid,” she says. “By doing this, they’re drawing attention to the issues and getting other generations to feel empowered to ask for a fairer share, greater flexibility or more suitable hours.” Many companies are already feeling these changes. The April 2023 Beamery data shows 91% of 700 UK business leaders surveyed believe the needs and expectations vocalised by younger employees could have a positive impact onallgenerations. Ultimately, even as some older workers grumble about Gen Z’s hefty pay demands, salaries are becoming more important to all generations. Gallup has been tracking American jobseekers’ priorities since 2015, and salary has climbed from the fourth highest priority (with 41% claiming it very important) to the number one priority (64%). As for whether salary will continue to be a priority for Gen Z, Seemiller finds it hard to imagine them reneging or staying static once they reach a certain pay grade. “Our indicators point to a generation that cares about happiness, meaningfulness and fulfilment over a high salary just for the sake of it,” she says. “Either way, they’re hyper focused on equity and will continue to be the first to speak up if they’re not getting what they think should be.” "
economic indicators,Why we can't shake presenteeism,2024-09-15,2023-07-24,Josie Cox,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230718-post-pandemic-presenteeism-overwork-culture,"The pandemic changed nearly everything about work. Why are we still stuck with performative long hours? For many workers, Covid-19 altered our attitudes towards our jobs and how we do them. The conditions of the past three years catalysed a full re-evaluation of careers and values, and subsequently dislodged some staid traditions that have bogged down workplace progress. In the new world of work, many employees have received what they’ve wanted from their employers – new ways of getting things done including flexible hours, remote working and even shortened workweeks. Despite this, however, one entrenched feature of business culture that’s proved tough – and in some cases impossible – to shift, is presenteeism. Before the pandemic, presenteeism – a compulsion, often performative, to work long hours and be available around the clock even when unwell or unproductive – was a common part of the culture of many organisations. This has been particularly the case across industries including finance, consulting and tech, where bosses have historically expected to see long hours from their workers, even when it’s not quantifiably tied to output. Despite so many workplace-culture changes, evidence suggests that not only is presenteeism still entrenched – but it may also be getting worse. This might especially be the case as employee-employer trust waivers, and digital presenteeism rises alongside the fear of job security amid an uncertain economic climate.  Can it change? Evolving expectations In 2020, as Covid-19 forced companies to shut down offices, employees were given the chance to experience new ways of working.   Flexible and remote work was arguably the biggest change: many employees realised they could fulfil their professional responsibilities from home and remain just as productive. The opportunity to spend more time with family or to engage in leisure activities also created a desire for lasting change in job demands and working schedules. Indeed, many employers have risen to the occasion, making some dramatic changes. One 2022 McKinsey & Company survey of 25,000 US workers showed 58% of respondents report having the opportunity to work from home at least one day a week, while 35% of respondents said they had the option to work from home five days a week. A 2023 survey from the Pew Research Center showed about a third of workers with jobs that can be done remotely are working from home all the time, compared to just 7% who did so before the pandemic. Despite these changes, little has seemed to meaningfully chip away at a pervasive culture of presenteeism that still plagues much of the workforce. Indeed, in some cases, new ways of working may even exacerbate it. First, the dissolution of personal and professional boundaries during home working may have played a significant role. “Without a clear physical separation between work and home, individuals may find it challenging to disconnect and set clear boundaries,” says Peter Brown, who leads PwC’s Global People and Organisation practice. “This lack of separation can lead – and in many cases did lead – to longer working hours, increased workloads and difficulty taking breaks or time off, all contributing to presenteeism.”  Lucy Kallin, executive director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Catalyst, a workplace consultancy that focuses on gender equality, agrees. “The overnight switch to home-working in the pandemic undoubtedly increased some people’s workloads, as they were unable to switch off metaphorically and literally. Instead of using the commute home to wind down from work people stayed ‘always on’.” She adds a rise in trust issues between employees and employers hasn’t helped shake workers’ compulsion to be present for their managers, even if they are unwell or not on work hours. Amid the shift to remote work, some managers haven’t entirely trusted their workers to remain productive – but the issue cuts both ways. Gallup research published in April 2023 shows during the pandemic and in its aftermath, employee trust in organisational leadership faltered for reasons including poor communication around Covid-19, and a lack of direction in terms of the company’s plans and strategies for the future. Gallup data shows that in the US, only 21% of employees said that they strongly agree that they trust their company’s leaders. “Lack of trust is intrinsically linked to presenteeism,” explains Kallin. Simply, employees may have felt compelled to be always on, because they can’t rely on being valued for their contributions and achievements if they’re not always on. Brown adds as businesses scrambled to stay solvent amid Covid-19, employees may also have felt additional pressure to be excessively present. “During the pandemic, many organisations were focused on adapting quickly to remote work and ensuring business continuity. The immediate priority was to keep operations running smoothly, which may have inadvertently reinforced presenteeism,” he says. “Employees may have felt compelled to work longer hours or be constantly available to prove their dedication and productivity, even in a remote setting.” Only getting worse? As many employees continue to work at least partially remotely, the rise of digital presenteeism is also a factor in keeping the behaviour entrenched – and an increasing concern. In the UK, 2022 data from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) showed that while presenteeism among employees had fallen slightly throughout the past few years, some 65% of HR workers said that they were still observing it in their organisations. And the number of respondents who said they were seeing it among those working from home rose from 77% in 2021 to 81% in 2022. The CIPD also found ‘leavism’ – the practice of using allocated time off, such as annual leave, to work – to be prevalent.  Results from a 2021 academic research paper also point to more reasons why Covid-19 might’ve exacerbated digital presenteeism. One reason, posit the researchers, is workers’ increasing digital footprints. As formerly in-person work went digital, workers may have felt more aware that bosses could track how many hours they were putting in, and how much work they were producing via their online communication. “When employees recognize that their online activities generate digital footprints that can be followed by their employers, they may perceive their inputs and activities as extremely visible and under scrutiny, and therefore put in greater effort, which has been found to result in greater burnout,” wrote the researchers. “By intensifying the employees’ efforts at work, monitoring can promote a culture of being constantly available and generate feelings of attendance pressure, likely leading to working when sick.” Lead by example Cultures of presenteeism may have survived the pandemic, but that’s not to say that they’ll be here forever. To dislodge them, though, the impetus is largely on employers to understand why the behaviour is so entrenched, and subsequently remedy it in their cultures.  This may take managers really mining the root of the problem in their companies, says Catalyst’s Kallin. For instance, she says, senior leaders need to stop celebrating people for being “always on”, or praising people for working overtime. And crucially, firms also need to recognise the ways in which the pandemic-induced changes in the workplace – a shift to hybrid and remote working, for example – might have exacerbated presenteeism. Even though leaders can’t see the behaviour because it’s happening remotely, she says, they need to spearhead changes so employees feel willing and able to turn off from work. Brown adds that defining working hours and sticking to them can help employees disconnect and rebuild their work-life boundaries. Fundamentally, says Brown, for managers to dismantle a culture of presenteeism, they must make sure employees feel trusted and empowered. For now, employees may unfortunately be stuck with presenteeism in the workplace, as employers still need to recognise the issue and buy into the solution. Still, much continues to change in the workplace, so workers can stay optimistic that even this boulder may eventually move."
economic indicators,Markets braced for Yellen at Jackson Hole,2024-09-15,2017-08-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41042025,"The world's most powerful central bankers are gathering for their annual meeting at Jackson Hole in Wyoming. Janet Yellen, whose term as US Federal Reserve chair ends in February, is due to speak on Friday. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi will also give a speech at the conference. Stock market investors will scrutinise their speeches for hints on monetary policy and the outlook for interest rates. It could be Ms Yellen's last appearance at Jackson Hole. President Donald Trump has said National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn is a candidate to replace Ms Yellen, who also could be reappointed. Bank of England deputy governor for monetary policy Ben Broadbent will attend the conference, although governor Mark Carney will not be there. Mr Broadbent is a contender to succeed Mr Carney when he steps down in June 2019. The Fed remains the only major central bank to have begun raising rates in recent years.  It is also seeking to cut the huge amounts of government bonds it has built up while pumping cash into the US economy through quantitative easing. Markets will also be waiting to see if Mr Draghi gives any more indications of when the ECB will start to reduce its own bond-buying programme. The recent strengthening of the euro has brought more uncertainty into the timing of the move. In the global financial crisis central bankers stepped in to shore up flagging markets and business investment by loosening monetary policy. However, Allianz chief economic advisor Mohamed El-Erian told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was time for central bankers to ""step back"". ""Central banks had no choice but to step in with these experimental policies, starting in 2010 for the Federal Reserve, because other policy-makers were not stepping up to their economic responsibilities,"" he said. ""So the Fed, and then the ECB later on, went from focusing on normalising markets to taking, singlehandedly, responsibility for promoting economic growth."" But Mr El-Erian said while the Fed had bought ""time for the economy to heal"", it was now time for the political system to ""get its act together"". He said the policies, while beneficial, also came at the cost of financial markets getting used to central bank support. ""Yes, the time has come for [central banks] to step back. They have to do it very slowly, and very carefully, and the biggest hope is that someone will step in - and that means other policy-making entities,"" Mr El-Erian added."
economic indicators,The lawyer who broke birth control taboos in India,2024-09-15,2022-07-05,By Parinaz Madan & Dinyar Patel,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-62033246,"In 1933, a sari-clad teenager made international headlines.  Avabai Wadia, 19, became the first woman from Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to pass the bar exam in the United Kingdom. Her success encouraged the Ceylonese government to allow women to study law in the country. This was not the only time Wadia spurred government policies on women's rights. By the time she died in 2005, she had become a globally respected figure in the family planning movement, combining a lawyer's acumen with a dedication to socially uplifting women. Wadia was born in 1913 in a progressive Parsi family in Colombo. After qualifying as a lawyer, she worked in both London and Colombo despite omnipresent ""masculine prejudice"".  She moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) during World War Two and immersed herself in social work, but found her true calling in family planning.  ""It seems my life work presented itself to me rather than my consciously searching for it,"" she wrote in her autobiography, The Light is Ours. ""I did not feel it a waste not to carry on with a legal career, for law was a fortifying element in all that I undertook."" When she began working in the field in the late 1940s, family planning was a taboo topic across much of the world.  Aside from stoking opposition from religious conservatives, it also had ugly links with racism and eugenics.  ""The first time I heard the words 'birth control', I was revolted,"" Wadia noted. But she was profoundly affected by a female doctor in Bombay who said that Indian women ""oscillated between gestation and lactation until death wound up the sorry tale"".  Despite the threat of social ostracism, Wadia plunged into the cause.  In 1949, she helped establish the Family Planning Association of India (FPAI), an organisation she would head for 34 years.  FPAI's work ranged from promoting contraceptive methods to providing fertility services - the latter gave Wadia ""a real sense of satisfaction"" since she had suffered miscarriages and had no children. It was in large part due to Wadia's efforts that the Indian government became the first in the world to officially promote family planning policies in 1951-52. Under Wadia, FPAI adopted a decentralised, community-based approach, working with the urban poor and villagers from some of the most impoverished regions of India.  This meant that, quite often, the FPAI did ""anything but family planning"" - it undertook projects ranging from reforestation to road-building.  Linking family planning with a holistic agenda of education, skill development and health, Wadia and her team employed creative communication techniques such as singing bhajans (devotional songs) with social messaging and organising a family planning exhibition which zipped across the country by train.  FPAI's innovative style of work fostered public confidence and led to marked improvements in development indicators.  For instance, a project which began in the 1970s in Malur in Karnataka, resulted in reduced infant mortality, a significant increase in the average age of marriage, and the doubling of literacy rates. The project evoked such popular support that villagers took over its management after FPAI exited the scene. Perhaps due to her international upbringing, Wadia brought a global perspective to Indian family planning.  Inspired by the success of South Korean mothers' clubs, which bolstered widespread acceptance of family planning in rural areas, she organised close-knit groups where women could discuss pressing social issues ranging from dowry to female under-representation in politics. At the same time, she became a leading figure in the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), spotlighting the unique challenges faced by India in controlling its ballooning demographics. Politics further complicated these challenges.  During the Emergency, which was imposed from 1975 to 1977, the Indian government adopted draconian population control measures including forced sterilisation. Wadia condemned this, warning against coercion in family planning programmes and declaring that participation had to be strictly voluntary. Family planning was beginning to show good results but, she lamented, the Emergency ""brought the whole programme into disrepute."" In the early 1980s, Wadia faced another formidable challenge as president of the IPPF. She locked horns with the administration of US president Ronald Reagan, which cut funding from the country to any organisation which provided or endorsed abortion services.  Although the IPPF did not officially promote abortion, some of its affiliates provided abortion services in countries where it was legal.  The IPPF refused to cave into US pressure to change this arrangement, resulting in a loss of $17m in funding to its programmes.  Wadia ridiculed the Reaganite notion that free market economics would combat population growth. Anyone who believed that, she averred, ""has never been anywhere in the developing word - there are too many of the absolute poor, and you just can't leave it to laissez-faire"". In many ways, Wadia's career is of pressing relevance to contemporary dilemmas in family planning.  In the United States, conservatives have argued that the reversal of abortion rights in Roe v Wade should be followed by reconsideration of rulings on contraceptive access.  Wadia - who was involved in conceptualising India's own abortion law - worried about how abortion could be weaponised in a larger movement against birth control. ""Those who try to confuse the public by equating abortion with family planning,"" she argued, ""are trying to destroy human and individual rights."" Today in India, political debates abound about employing disincentives and coercive elements to restrict the sizes of families. Wadia cautioned against such approaches.  ""We cannot support disincentives which do not uphold basic human rights,"" she said in 2000, when Maharashtra state - in a bid to enforce a two-child norm - considered stripping any third-born child of food rations and free primary education. ""In practice, anyway, we have found that disincentives don't work."" These events have demonstrated that family planning is intrinsically linked to law and politics. Perhaps it was fortuitous, therefore, that India had a pioneering female lawyer as one of the principal architects of its family planning movement. Above all, Wadia's career is a reminder that family planning cannot be divorced from overall socioeconomic development. A few years before Wadia's death, MS Swaminathan - the scientist who led India's Green Revolution, which helped the country achieve food security - paid tribute to this fact.  ""More than anybody else,"" he said, Wadia ""knew that if our population policies go wrong, nothing else will have a chance to go right"". Parinaz Madan is a lawyer and Dinyar Patel is a historian."
economic indicators,Police 'tear gas protesters' in Tunisia,2024-09-15,2018-01-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42683794,"Police in Tunisia are reported to have fired tear gas to disperse a crowd of youths protesting against new austerity measures.  A Reuters witness said young people aged around 20 were throwing stones at police vehicles and setting fire to tyres. The clash happened in Ettadamen, a poor district of the capital, Tunis. President Beji Caid Essebsi had given a speech there earlier on Sunday promising to increase youth employment. Joblessness among the young is considered a key indicator of a country's economic prospects, and Tunisia's stands at around 35%. The president's comments came as Tunisians marked the seventh anniversary of the country's revolution. The 2011 uprising that launched the Arab Spring led to the toppling of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali after 23 years.  Ben Ali, now in exile in Saudi Arabia, was convicted in absentia of embezzlement and misuse of public funds, and sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment.  Several hundred people joined rallies in Tunis on Sunday at the urging of political parties and the UGTT, a prominent trade union. Protests are a common feature each January in Tunisia, as people commemorate the 2011 rallies. A increase in value-added tax and social security contributions brought in at the start of January has led to heightened emotions this year. Protesters are calling for a review of the 2018 budget, and a push to combat corruption. Tunisia is the only country to dislodge its long-standing leader in the Arab Spring without descending into serious violence. But nine successive governments have failed to revive its flagging economy. Both peaceful protests and nocturnal unrest have been seen across the country over the past week. More than 800 people have been arrested, according to the interior ministry, which accuses them of theft, vandalism and violence. In 2011 the slogan ""Work, Freedom, Dignity"" rang out in the streets, and protesters have revived it in recent days. On Sunday, many gathered on Habib Bourguiba Avenue, a major site in the 2011 demonstrations. Hundreds of riot police were deployed there. An interior ministry spokesman said on Saturday that around 97 members of the security forces and civil protection units had been injured during the protests. The number of protesters injured was not given. The government has tried to quell protests by unveiling a welfare package that includes better healthcare and an increase in aid for the needy. Officials say the 70m dinar ($28.5m) plan will help more than 120,000 Tunisians. But it's unclear how it will be funded.  The government's tax and price increases were imposed as it seeks to placate international donors by reducing its budget deficit. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave Tunisia a $2.9bn (£2.2bn) loan on the promise it would enact financial reforms. The tourism sector, once a vital source of revenue, was damaged in 2015 by a wave of jihadist attacks and is yet to bounce back. As 2018 begins, inflation is at a three-and-a-half-year high and food prices are rising by 10% annually. Taxes on items like mobile phones, cars and the internet have also increased. Ordinary people are suffering financially. The BBC's Mark Lowen, in Tunis, says the president's visit to the flashpoint district of Ettadamen was a bid to quell further unrest. He says the protesters are not only frustrated about the immediate tax increases, but more deeply by a loss of hope."
economic indicators,'Postcode lottery' for dying children,2024-09-15,2017-09-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41228164,"Families of dying children lack support because of a ""postcode lottery"" in palliative care services, according to a report. The Institute for Policy Research says 49,000 children have life-limiting or life-threatening conditions in the UK. The report says Scotland is ""leading the way"" in ensuring the right care is available to all, but the rest of the UK must follow suit. The government says it is committed to tackling end of life care variations. The IPR, based at the University of Bath, blamed a ""piecemeal"" approach to polices around palliative care and helping the bereaved for a wide difference in services across the UK - notably for children.  According to children's charity Together for Short Lives - which contributed to the report - seriously ill children are ""being forgotten or ignored"" by nearly one in ten clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in England as important services are not being made available. Only 73% of CCGs provide palliative children's nursing out of hours and at weekends, meaning children have to go into hospital rather than be treated in the community, the report found. After a textbook pregnancy, Liz Crook was looking forward to welcoming her baby boy into the world.  But when Logan was born seven years ago, a brain haemorrhage was the first of a string of illnesses that were set to limit his life.  ""We had no idea that was going to happen,"" said 35-year-old Liz, who lives in Bridgwater, Somerset with her partner and two other children.  ""It is always shocking when things don't go the way you planned and everything goes out the window, but you take everything as it comes and do what you can."" Logan has a range of debilitating conditions including cerebral palsy, epilepsy and secondary microcephaly. He is registered blind, needs a tracheostomy to support his breathing and is nil by mouth due to an unsafe swallow. Without the support from social services and the NHS, the family would struggle to cope. But the disparity of services makes things tougher. ""We moved home in October because our house was not suitable for Logan's long term needs, but he still doesn't have a downstairs bathroom and we have to carry him upstairs,"" she said.  ""It took 15 months to get the right wheelchair for him as they only wanted to fund a specific make, and I even had issues getting him the right shoes. It is all funding related.""   She added: ""When you are an adult and you go into palliative care, it is a short diagnosis for a short time, whereas with children it can go on for years and years. ""We didn't know if we were ever going to take him home, but he has just had his seventh birthday. We can't make him better but with the right support and the right people, we can give him the best quality of life.""  James Cooper, public affairs and policy manager at the charity, said: ""The way in which children's palliative care in the UK is planned and funded represents a postcode lottery.  ""The current policy and funding environment has failed to adequately acknowledge the needs of these children, their families, or those that work to support them."" He said families of children with life-limiting conditions have to co-ordinate a ""vast array of professionals and agencies"" for the care their children rely on. ""While a number of positive policy initiatives are being developed by the UK's governments and other agencies, more work is needed to make sure that they bring about more joined-up plans, assessments and services with children and families at their centre,"" he added.   The IPR report praised work in Scotland where the government is investing £30m following a pledge to provide palliative care for all who need it by 2021, ""regardless of age, gender, diagnosis, social group or location.""  But it criticised the rest of the UK for being ""ill-prepared"" for the ageing population, and left with ""disjointed policies"" for people of all ages. The report's lead author, Dr Kate Woodthorpe, said: ""For too long we have been complacent about death's social and economic consequences, and our policy responses.  Government can no longer ignore the many, many challenges outlined in this brief."" The report said the example of the devolution of powers and resources to Scotland offered a framework to tailor services to local populations and allow best practices to be shared. ""National and regional devolution is showing early indications that innovation and modernisation is possible, and Scotland is arguably leading the way with ambitious targets and re-organisation of key policy areas,"" added Dr Woodthorpe. ""It is up to the rest of the country as to whether they wait to see how well Scotland fairs, or whether they use this as an opportunity to review, consolidate and improve how they support dying, death and bereavement."" Scotland's Health Secretary Shona Robison, said it was ""extremely heartening"" to be recognised by the report, adding: ""It is a tribute to the compassion, commitment and dedication of those working across our health and social care services.  ""To achieve our aim it is essential we create the right conditions nationally to support local communities in their planning and delivery of those services and support - to help ensure that the unique characteristics of each individual and family are met."" The Department of Health said it had made a commitment to address variations within end of life care, including investing £11 million from NHS England into funding for the Children's Hospice Grant.  A spokeswoman said: ""We want all children and their families to receive high quality, compassionate and tailored care at the end of their life, regardless of where they live. That's why we have committed to improving care in all settings."""
economic indicators,Number of NI employees on payroll hits record high,2024-09-15,2021-08-17,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-58241354,"The number of pay-rolled employees in Northern Ireland last month was 1.3% higher than before the pandemic hit, official figures show. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) said employee numbers hit its highest record in July at 762,000. It is the second month in a row numbers surpassed March 2020 pre-Covid levels. HM Revenue and Customs payroll data is the most timely and best single overall indicator of the labour market. The figures showed an estimated 762,600 employees in July - that is 1.3% higher than March 2020 and 3.1% higher than the same time last year.  It includes furloughed employees, who numbered about 44,000 at the end of June. The furlough scheme is due to end in October and it has already begun to taper off.  That may be contributing to an increase in redundancies in June and July - 850 were proposed in July. The introduction of the furlough scheme helped to stabilise the job market near the start of the pandemic crisis. The unemployment rate for April-June 2021 was 3.8% - that is an increase of 0.4% over the quarter and 1.2% over the year.  Tuesday's figures were published against the backdrop of two significant jobs announcements in different sectors of the economy. Ballymena-based bus manufacturer Wrightbus is creating up to 300 jobs after winning new orders. The company which went into administration in 2019 was bought by Jo Bamford.  A total of 120 temporary roles are also being made permanent.  Mr Bamford said he hopes to expand the workforce from 56 workers two years ago to more than 900 by 2022. Meanwhile, US company called Workrise is creating more than 150 technology jobs in Belfast over the next four years.  The Austin-based firm matches up labourers with construction projects.  Invest NI has offered the firm almost £1m in support towards the 153 new positions, which will have salaries above the private sector average."
economic indicators,Jobless rate remains steady in Wales,2024-09-15,2018-06-12,By Sarah Dickins,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-44453530,"The unemployment rate in Wales has stayed at 4.4%, according to monthly Office for National Statistics figures. This remains slightly higher than the UK unemployment rate of 4.2%.  When we look at figures over three months, there were 7,000 fewer people unemployed between February and April, compared to November and January. The only part of the UK that had seen a greater drop in its jobless rate is North East England but that is higher at 4.6%. The Wales jobless rate has fallen by 0.5% in the quarter to April compared to the previous three months and by 0.4% compared to the same period in 2017. Wage growth slips despite jobless fall 'I felt too old and out of touch to work' Has Wales' economy lacked the big idea? Across the UK, unemployment fell by 38,000 on the quarter to 1.42m, the lowest figure since 1975. In Wales, the number unemployed is 67,000. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns pointed to figures which showed another 11,000 people had found work in Wales in the last quarter as a sign the jobs market was ""continuing to strengthen"". ""The indicators are moving steadily in the right direction and we have again narrowed the employment gap with the rest of the UK,"" he said.  ""Welsh business now has the clarity it needs to plan for Brexit after Welsh Government backing for the Withdrawal Bill and we'll keep working to sustain this encouraging picture."""
economic indicators,NI economic output falls slightly in second quarter,2024-09-15,2022-09-29,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-63076590,"Northern Ireland's economy began to lose momentum in the second quarter of this year, the latest official data suggests. Economic output was 2.4% higher than the same period last year but fell by 0.1% compared to the first quarter. That weaker short-term performance was mainly related to the service sector, which is the largest part of the economy. Retail sales figures were particularly weak, falling 2.4% over the quarter. The figures come the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) and are broadly in line with the wider UK performance. Nisra said that while Northern Ireland output had fallen back marginally, it broadly remained at a 15-year high point. However Northern Ireland's economy still remains 0.2% smaller than the peak of the 2007 housing bubble. Latest official figures for the construction sector also point to weakness in that sector: output was down by almost 4% on an annual basis and by 0.6% on the quarter. Construction has faced acute pressures from rising material costs and supply chain delays. The Nisra figures cover a time period before the ""mayhem which followed Friday's mini-budget"" but a ""nevertheless very interesting,"" according to the Ulster University Business School's senior economist Esmond Birnie. He suggested it was ""very likely"" that Northern Ireland along with the rest of the UK has ""already entered into recession"". ""Latest indicators at the UK-wide level suggest that UK output will decline in the third quarter,"" he said.  ""It is overwhelmingly likely that Northern Ireland will do likewise."" Mr Birnie added: ""Commentators such as the Bank of the England or the international body OECD were already predicting that next year would be characterised by close-to-zero growth or even negative growth even before the mayhem which followed Friday's mini-budget."" Prime Minister Liz Truss told BBC Radio Kent that the action taken in the past week had opened up new road projects and new infrastructure projects. But one industry body says that's not enough to help businesses in Northern Ireland. Mark Spence, from the Construction Employers Federation said: ""That will benefit some of the companies based in Northern Ireland who work in GB. Unfortunately in terms of infrastructure in Northern Ireland, that all comes out of the block grant we get from Westminster. ""What's clear is that block grant isn't increasing, we're living within a finite budget, and the problem is that the raging inflationary costs within construction means you get much less for the same budget."" Many construction deals are done based on a fixed price contract - a sum that is agreed before the work is started, and doesn't depend on the length of time the work will take.  Mr Spence said: ""The amount of construction available to be done within the public-sector budget is decreasing day on day. ""There are companies out there today that had started contracts before these costs really kicked in who undoubtedly are incurring a loss just to complete those contracts, but they're completing them. They're taking the hit. ""But they'll be very careful before they sign the next contract."""
economic indicators,House price growth at six-year low,2024-09-15,2019-04-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47960657,"House prices rose in February at the slowest rate since September 2012 while in London house prices fell, the Office for National Statistics said. Average house prices increased by 0.6% in the year to February 2019 but fell by 3.8% in London. The ONS said inflation was stable at 1.9% in March as a rise in fuel prices from February was offset by falls in food prices. The figures ease pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. The Bank of England targets inflation - the rate of price increases  - at 2% and last month kept rates unchanged at  0.75%, where they have been since August last year. The ONS said there had been a slowdown in house price growth over the past two years. The average UK house price was £226,000 in February, £1,000 higher than a year ago. The fall in London house prices was the largest fall since mid-2009, but the city remains the most expensive place to buy property with an average price of £460,000. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the fall in London house prices was the largest since the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis. ""This follows efforts by policymakers to cut down on riskier mortgage lending, though clearly uncertainty over Brexit will have played a large part in the capital's faltering housing market,"" he said. Other indicators have pointed to a subdued housing market. Halifax, the UK's biggest lender, said earlier this month that property prices had fallen by 1.6% in March compared with February. At 1.9%, the latest inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Prices Index, was a little lower than the 2% that had been forecast by economists. Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: ""Inflation is stable, with motor fuel prices rising between February and March this year, offset by falls in food prices as well as the cost of computer games growing more slowly than it did at this time last year."" Inflation in the games, toys and hobby sector fell to 1.1% in March from 3.1% in February helping to keep a lid on the overall basket of prices. Average petrol prices were 1.2p per litre higher at 120.3p. Mr Brettell said the inflation number made the Bank of England's job easier ""as there's no pressure to raise rates as it grapples with continued uncertainty over Brexit"". Howard Archer, economic adviser to the EY Item Club of forecasts said it was ""decent news for both consumers and the Bank of England"". It comes after data on Tuesday had shown that average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, rose 3.4% in the three months to February and the unemployment rate lower than at any time since the end of 1975. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will meet next month to discuss rates. Mr Archer said: ""Despite a tight labour market, it is difficult to see the Bank of England raising interest rates at their May meeting or any time soon, amid likely MPC concern that prolonged Brexit uncertainties will likely to weigh down on the economy"". However,  Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the inflation data would not give the MPC ""breathing space"" to keep rates on hold because ""the labour market is still tightening and the economy is coping with Brexit uncertainty"". The Bank of England has said that economic outlook would continue to depend ""significantly on the nature and timing of EU withdrawal"". In the short-term economists say pressure on inflation could come from household energy prices  in April when energy regulator Ofgem increases its price cap by 10%. Mr Archer said it was ""questionable""  whether earnings growth can continue as the growth in wages dipped to a five-month low of 3.2% in the month of February."
economic indicators,US business levels fall sharply amid coronavirus,2024-09-15,2020-02-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51591070,"Business activity in the US service sector fell last month for the first time since 2013, hurt by the coronavirus, according to a survey. The drop came amid a ""notable worsening"" in the services sector, which includes finance and retail, the IHS Markit research firm reported. New orders received by private sector firms also declined for the first time since 2009, it said. US financial markets fell sharply following the report. The latest IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index data found that services business activity fell to 49.4, from 53.4 in January, while manufacturing output slowed to 50.8, compared to 51.9 in January, a six-month low.  The combined score was 49.6, down from 53.3 in the opening month of 2020. Anything below 50 indicates contraction. The report added to fears spurred by recent trends in the bond markets, which suggest investors see the risks of holding short and long-term government debt as increasingly similar. That comparison is often tracked as an indicator of possible recession. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.7%, while the S&P 500 dropped about 0.9% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was more than 1% lower. Investors also turned to US government debt, considered a less risky investment, driving the prices up and yields on bonds down.  The IHS survey found that manufacturing output was hurt by delivery delays from China, while services industries such as travel also took a hit. Executives also reported spending more cautiously, amid questions about the upcoming presidential election and worries about the possibility of a wider economic slowdown.   The survey found a modest rise in business confidence, suggesting that executives are hopeful the slowdown will prove short-lived. But the rate of contraction last month was still severe, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS. ""With the exception of the government shutdown of 2013, US business activity contracted for the first time since the global financial crisis in February,"" he said.  In recent weeks, companies around the world, including Apple, sportswear firms, airlines and carmakers, have reported slowdowns.  But analysts have said that the US - where consumer spending drives much of the economy - should be relatively insulated from the effects, assuming the coronavirus outbreak wanes relatively soon. US jobs growth beat expectations last month, while the overall economy is growing at about 2.1%, according to the most recent government figures. However, traders are also now anticipating the Federal Reserve will move to cut interest rates further this year, although the head of the central bank said at its most recent meeting that it did not think the economy needed additional help.  The IHS Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) report will raise fears about the country's underlying economic health, said Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics, adding that the contraction in the service sector - which includes industries like healthcare - was especially alarming.  However, he added: ""We have a hard time believing the apparent message...that the economy is on the brink of a recession. ""Unless job creation and consumer confidence suddenly craters, it's difficult to see how the new downside risks that have emerged in recent months would be enough to sink the entire economy."""
economic indicators,House prices in 'largest monthly fall for 11 years',2024-09-15,2020-06-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52888991,"House prices fell 1.7% in May from the previous month, the largest monthly fall for 11 years, according to the Nationwide. Annual house price growth halved from 3.7% to 1.8%, as the coronavirus crisis hit market activity. The latest HMRC data showed that residential property transactions fell 53% in April compared with 2019. ""The medium-term outlook for the housing market remains highly uncertain,"" the Nationwide warned. ""We have already seen a sharp economic contraction as a result of the necessary measures adopted to suppress the spread of the virus,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. But he pointed out that the raft of policies adopted to support the economy should ""set the stage for a rebound once the shock passes"" and help limit long-term damage. ""These same measures should also help ensure the impact on the housing market will ultimately be less than would normally be associated with an economic shock of this magnitude,"" he predicted. The figures are based on Nationwide's lending data, do not include cash purchases, and may have a greater volatility owing to the very low levels of activity. Yet, the big month-to-month drop in Nationwide's house price index in May - the largest since February 2009 - ""is just the start of a protracted decline over the remainder of this year,"" warned Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Before the pandemic struck the UK, the housing market had been steadily gathering momentum, the Nationwide said.  Activity levels and price growth were edging up thanks to continued robust labour market conditions, low borrowing costs and a more stable political backdrop following the general election. ""Behavioural changes and social distancing are likely to impact the flow of housing transactions for some time,"" Mr Gardner said.  Recent Nationwide research suggested that one in eight people had put off moving because of the lockdown.   But the majority saw the current situation as a temporary pause in the market, with would-be buyers planning to wait six months on average before looking to enter the market. Early indicators of housing demand have picked up since in-person property viewings were permitted again on 13 May, said Pantheon Macroeconomics.  It said the daily volume of Google searches for the three main property portals had increased to be just 13% below its pre-lockdown level, having been down 50% in April. ""Relatively few people likely will be forced to sell their homes, given that mortgage payment holidays are easily available and home ownership has declined,"" said Mr Tombs.  ""Nonetheless, the huge size of the blow from Covid-19 to households' incomes and the deterioration in consumers' confidence suggests that house prices must drop."" He predicted a 5% fall in prices by the end of the third quarter of the year. Separate figures from the Bank of England show how the mortgage market decelerated sharply alongside the house sales shutdown. Some 15,848 mortgage approvals for house purchases were recorded in April - about 80% below February levels before the coronavirus crisis took hold, the Bank said. This was around half the number of approvals taking place in the trough during the financial crisis, and the lowest since the figures started in 1993. Approvals for re-mortgaging fell by a lesser extent during the month, to 34,400, some 34% lower than in February. The UK's financial watchdog has confirmed the support firms should give to mortgage customers who are either coming to the end of a payment holiday or who are yet to request one. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said last month that homeowners struggling financially due to coronavirus would be able to extend their mortgage payment holiday for a further three months, or cut payments. On Tuesday, it confirmed customers yet to apply for a payment holiday have until 31 October 2020 to do so. Meanwhile the current ban on lender repossessions of homes will be continued to 31 October. ""The measures we have confirmed today will mean anyone who needs to can get help from their lender, if they are still struggling to pay their mortgage due to coronavirus,"" said Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive at the FCA. ""It is important that if a consumer can afford to re-start mortgage payments, it is in their best interests to do so. Customers should talk to their firm about the best option available for them."" On Friday, the Nationwide's chief executive, Joe Garner, argued that it would be prudent for extensions to mortgage holidays to be marked temporarily on a borrower's credit file.  However, the FCA said the current guidance - that taking a deferral should not have a negative impact on a borrower's credit file - should continue. The regulator pointed out that lenders could still use details obtained from other sources, such as bank account information, when making their decisions on whether to grant other loans."
economic indicators,Analysis: Unrest in Abkhazia,2024-09-15,2014-05-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27607559,"Opposition leader Raul Khadzhimba addressing protesters in front of the presidential office in Sukhumi Unrest has erupted in one of the least understood conflict zones of the former USSR: the tiny, impoverished Black Sea territory of Abkhazia. It broke away from Georgia after a ferocious war two decades ago and has since been supported mainly by Russia.   Here Michael Cecire, external, an expert on the region at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia, answers questions for BBC News.      The frustration is likely to be real. Russia, and the de facto Abkhazian government, promised that the 2014 Sochi Olympics would be a boon to the Abkhazian economy, but it was anything but. The Olympics were billed as a way of boosting the economy by bringing tourism to Abkhazia or sourcing materials for construction, but the most noticeable effect was actually a source of frustration: the expanded security cordon that penetrated beyond the Russia-Abkhazia border. Some of Abkhazia's economic problems can certainly be attributed to the de facto government, but it is Russia that has the real power to improve conditions. For example, the Moscow-financed building boom in Chechnya has improved material conditions (even if human rights remain a deep problem), but nothing comparable has happened in Abkhazia. However, even this is only a part of the story. The opposition has certainly cited economic conditions as a major grievance, but the chief point of contention is President Alexander Ankvab's more liberal (relatively speaking) policy towards ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia, primarily concentrated in the Gali region. Mr Ankvab has advocated more fully integrating them into Abkhazian society, which includes giving them passports and Abkhazian ""citizenship"". The opposition, led by Raul Khadzhimba, has painted this as a purely political ploy by Mr Ankvab to expand his electoral base (they accused the late former President, Sergei Bagapsh, of the same) and say these policies could endanger Abkhazia's ethnic Abkhazian identity.  Mr Khadzhimba has also accused the Ankvab government of kowtowing to Moscow. Though there is a political consensus in favour of a security alliance with Russia, Mr Khadzhimba's opposition does not wish to allow Russians to buy Abkhazian property or to see Sukhumi integrate too closely within Russia. It is unclear just how much of a believer Mr Khadzhimba is - he is a former KGB officer and was once seen as Moscow's favoured politician. His political transformation suggests that his ideals are rather pliable, but he also may feel spurned by his former patrons. All we really know is that Mr Khadzhimba truly believes he should be in power. As for Mr Ankvab, his political longevity depends largely on Russia. If they see abandoning him as politically expedient, he will face a much more difficult time regaining power. He is an ethno-nationalist. He is not anti-Russia, as there is little room in the political landscape for anti-Moscow sentiments, but he has campaigned strongly against further integration with Russia at the expense of Abkhazian independence. His platform is to preserve the ethnic Abkhazian character of the state versus Mr Ankvab's broader view of citizenship. By all indications, he was actively backed by the Russians in his electoral contest against Bagapsh in 2004. Russian President Vladimir Putin even reportedly campaigned for him and, after he lost, there was a chilly period between Moscow and Abkhazia until a compromise was found. It was not a surprise. The opposition actually submitted a 5 May ultimatum to Mr Ankvab in late April for him to dismiss his government and make radical reforms. His response was essentially a shrug, so it was really only a matter of time until the opposition launched protests. The opposition's ability to quickly rally and force Mr Ankvab and his government to vacate is a more surprising development, but it was never unimaginable. I do not see the Kremlin or the Georgians involved in this. However, Russia may go with the more politically expedient choice if it becomes clear that Mr Ankvab cannot maintain stability. If Mr Khadzhimba gains power, the likelihood that Gali Georgians will see large-scale re-enfranchisement will strongly diminish, but the relationship with Russia is not likely to change appreciably. There may be a slowdown, or even some reversal, in Abkhazia's integration with Russia, but Mr Khadzhimba has not given any indication that he is willing to turn to Georgia or the West as an alternative. That means Sukhumi will continue to be reliant on Moscow for its budget and economy.    Not especially, other than popular anger against an incumbent who is accused of presiding over a diminishing, corrupt economy.

economic indicators,House prices fall the most in South East - Halifax,2024-09-15,2023-08-07,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66425947,"The value of a home in south-east England has dropped by £15,500 over a year after the region recorded the sharpest fall in house prices in July. Halifax, the High Street lender, said average house prices in the area, which includes the home counties, fell 3.9%. House prices in Wales, once the beneficiary of the pandemic ""boom"", also tumbled. Overall, however, Halifax said the UK's housing market was showing resilience, despite higher mortgage costs. It said average prices fell by 2.4% in the year to July, valuing a typical home at £285,044. That is slower than the 2.6% decline recorded in the year to June.  Despite the falls, prices remain much higher than before the Covid pandemic. Some regions saw sharper drops than others. The value of a home in south-east England dropped to £382,489 in July.  Wales, which Halifax said had seen ""some of the most rapid growth in house prices witnessed during the pandemic 'boom'"", recorded one of the largest annual falls at 3.3% to £214,495. Greater London also saw prices drop by 3.5% in July, but the average price is much higher at £531,141 compared to other regions.  Average house prices fell in almost all parts of the UK in July apart from in the West Midlands, where they remained unchanged. The north east of England remains the cheapest place to buy a home with the average price being £167,594. Commenting on the housing market in the UK, Kim Kinnaird, director at Halifax Mortgages, which is owned by Lloyds Banking Group, said it ""continues to display a degree of resilience in the face of tough economic headwinds"". ""In particular, we're seeing activity among first-time buyers hold up relatively well, with indications some are now searching for smaller homes, to offset higher borrowing costs,"" she added. Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates for the 14th time in a row. The increase from 5% to 5.25% will lift the cost of borrowing money for many mortgages. On Monday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate ticked lower to 6.84%, while the average five-year deal was unchanged at 6.35%, according to financial data firm Moneyfacts. But there have been suggestions that the current interest rate level could be the peak for consumers, with banks and building societies starting to cut mortgage rates, according to Laura Suter, head of personal finance at AJ Bell. Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England's governor, told the BBC there was an ""adjustment"" to house prices going on. But he cautioned: ""I think we should avoid preaching crisis at this point, it's not that."" Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story? Get in touch. Last week, the Nationwide building society said that house prices in July recorded their sharpest fall in 2009 but they remained £45,000 higher than February 2020, the last month before the first lockdown. During the height of the Covid pandemic, house prices soared as people who were forced to work from home at the time decided they wanted more space inside and out. The market was also boosted by a stamp duty holiday.  Halifax's Ms Kinnaird said while house prices will continue to fall into next year, she expects ""a gradual rather than a precipitous decline"".  ""And one that is unlikely to fully reverse the house price growth recorded over recent years, with average property prices still some £45,000, or 19%, above pre-Covid levels,"" she added. Marc von Grundherr, director of Benham and Reeves estate agents, said considering the surge in house prices during the pandemic, ""it is actually quite remarkable that the market is still standing so strong given the wider economic picture"". But LSL Property Services, one of the UK's largest providers of mortgage and valuation services, warned that its full-year profits would be ""substantially lower"" than previously forecast due to rising interest rates hitting homebuying activity. The company's share price tumbled by 13.8% on the warning. LSL Property Services, which owns mortgage adviser Primis and estate agency Your Move, said that ""the larger than expected increase"" in the Bank of England base rate in June - when it rose by half percentage point - had ""had a material impact on the mortgage market"". Nationwide said prices had dropped by 3.8% in the year to July. The figure paints a slightly different picture to Halifax's figures, which suggest prices have fallen by 2.4%. Each lender bases their data on their own mortgage approvals, meaning their calculations may differ. Read more here"
economic indicators,The salmon you buy in the future may be farmed on land,2024-09-15,2021-04-25,By Dan Gibson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56829129,"In a series of indoor tanks 40 miles south west of Miami, Florida, five million fish are swimming in circles a very long way from home. The fish in question are Atlantic salmon, which are far more typically found in the cold waters of Norway's fjords or Scotland's lochs. As the species is not native to Florida, and would be unable to cope with the state's tropical heat, the water tanks are kept well chilled, and housed in a vast, air-conditioned and heavily insulated warehouse-like building. The facility, called the Bluehouse, opened its first phase last year, and intends to be the world's largest land-based fish farm. Targeting an initial production of 9,500 metric tonnes of fish per year, its owner - Atlantic Sapphire - plans to increase that to 222,000 tonnes by 2031, enough to provide 41% of current US annual salmon consumption, or a billion meals. The company is at the forefront of a growing movement in Europe, Asia and the US towards land-based, indoor aquaculture. But what could it mean for traditional sea-based salmon farms, and most importantly - what about the welfare of the fish? ""When we started [exploring the concept] 10 years ago, people thought we were completely crazy,"" says Johan Andreassen, chief executive of Atlantic Sapphire, which is a Norwegian-owned business. ""No-one was recognising that raising salmon on land would ever become financially viable, or even doable. Then the incumbent industry started to become more questioning. But they were waiting to see how the technology evolves. ""And now with Atlantic Sapphire, we have proven that it's possible. So now it's a question of how competitive can this be, and how large can it become."" The technology that enables Bluehouse to operate is not new, but using it on a commercial scale only became viable in the last few years. Called ""recirculating aquaculture systems"", or RAS for short, they control everything from the temperature, salinity and pH of the water, to its oxygen levels, artificial currents, lighting cycles, and removal of carbon dioxide and waste. The latter are filtered out, and treated water is reused. As it is a closed-loop system, the salmon are not exposed to seaborne diseases and parasites, so unlike sea-based farms, Atlantic Sapphire says its fish do not need to be treated with antibiotics or pesticides. ""In general, compared to the [sea-based] industry, we have the lowest disease incidents and the lowest mortality rates,"" says Neder Snir, chief technology officer of Israeli firm AquaMaof. His company has now designed technology for 10 such RAS fish farms around the world. ""And it is important to note that this occurs without the use of any antibodies or vaccinations,"" adds Mr Snir. ""Because of the fact we're isolated and controlled."" Atlantic Sapphire has already invested $400m (£287m) in its US facility, and plans to spend $2bn in total. By 2031 it intends to have four million sq ft (372,000 sq m) of tanks across the 160-acre (65-hectare) site. But why did a Norwegian firm choose to build a vast salmon farm in Florida? Firstly so that it can supply the US market without having to fly in the harvested fish from Europe. And secondly because of the unique nature of the southern state's geology. In very simple terms, Florida sits on top of two separate aquifers - a fresh water one nearest the surface, and then a salt water one lower down. As salmon needs fresh water when it is young, and then salt water when it is older, Bluehouse has a ready supply of both. And somewhat controversially, it can then inject what waste water it does produce down to an empty layer in the rock even further below. The company says this layer is entirely isolated and therefore cannot contaminate the wider water supply. It adds that only ""minimal quantities of treated waste water [are released] per strict local regulations"". New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. When it comes to wishing to shorten supply chains, Mr Andreassen says that the coronavirus pandemic has focused people's minds about the issue. ""The value proposition has become much better since Covid,"" he says. ""People want short, lean value chains with increased traceability, where fewer people are touching your food before you eat it. ""And the cost of air freight, with the passenger air travel industry on its knees, has been pressurised through the roof."" However, the Bluehouse project has not been all plain sailing. In July last year an issue with its water quality meant that, in the words of Mr Andreassen, ""we faced a situation where we risked large [salmon] mortalities"". To avoid this outcome, the company decided to ""emergency harvest"" 200,000 fish before they had reached their full 20-month-old maturity. Another design problem in March this year caused further fish deaths, the firm had to report. And earlier this month it was reported that three workers at the facility had to go to hospital for treatment following the release of an unknown gas. Unsurprisingly, animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) is damning of Bluehouse and the 40 or so other firms developing such land-based fish farms around the world. These include a planned barramundi farm in Arizona. ""Fish farms [whether at sea, or on land] are pits of filth,"" says Dawn Carr, Peta's director of vegan corporate projects. ""Fish are not fish fingers with fins, waiting to be cut apart, but feeling, thinking individuals capable of joy and pain, and they belong to themselves, not to humans. ""Raising fish this way is wretchedly cruel and certainly unnecessary."" Mr Andreassen says that the welfare indicators of the salmon, such as fin shape and swim speed, are constantly monitored at Bluehouse. And despite such concerns, Atlantic Sapphire's Floridian salmon has already proven very popular with US consumers. Last year its Bluehouse-branded salmon fillets sold for $12 per kg, more than double the price of Norwegian imports. So should Scotland and Norway's traditional sea-based salmon farmers be worried?  Ragnar Tveteras, a business professor at Norway's University of Stavanger, and an expert on the industry, says questions remain about the viability of the land farms. ""I think there is a structural challenge there with respect to energy use, and then implicitly contribution to CO2 emissions,"" he says. ""And I'm still waiting for some better clues of what the cost performance will be. ""I'm not worried about the demand [for their salmon], but I worry what prices will emerge, and what that will mean for the [financial] returns of these land-based farms. I'm afraid for some it won't be profitable."" Alan Tinch, Scotland-based technical director at aquaculture services firm Benchmark Genetics, works closely with Scottish fish farmers. He predicts that they will stick to sea cages, although he says some do now rear young salmon, called smolts, in on-land tanks, before transferring them to the sea facilities. ""My view is Scottish salmon's advantage is in the quality reputation that it has, and part of that quality reputation is that it's produced in high-quality seawater in conventional cage production,"" he says.

economic indicators,Severn Bridge tolls cut for first time,2024-09-15,2017-09-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-41271239,"Tolls on the Severn Bridges will be cut in January for the first time, as VAT is removed from the fees. Cars heading for Wales will be charged £5.60 instead of £6.70, with vans paying £11.20 - down from £13.40 - and coaches £16.70, currently £20. UK ministers confirmed it was a step towards abolishing tolls altogether at the end of 2018, as revealed in July. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said tolls had been ""an economic and symbolic barrier to Wales' future prosperity"". It will be the first time since the first Severn Bridge opened in 1966 that the toll has been cut. The reduction takes effect on 8 January, the date the two crossings return to public ownership.  Motorists will also not face the usual inflation-related increase on New Year's Day. Mr Cairns will give the news to business leaders at a meeting of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Wales regional council in Newport on Friday. ""For so many years, the tolls on both Severn Crossings have been seen as an economic and symbolic barrier to Wales' future prosperity,"" he said.  ""Our decision to reduce the tolls - before abolishing them altogether - will cut costs for businesses, for commuters and tourists alike - helping boost jobs and trade in Wales and across the South-West [of England]. ""This is yet another strong indicator that Wales is open for business and of the UK government's commitment to making the right decisions for Wales' future as part of a strong United Kingdom."" The UK government said estimates showed abolition of the tolls could boost the south Wales economy by £100m a year and save regular motorists more than £1,400 a year. Michael Gough, co-owner of a haulage company in Llandrindod Wells, Powys, told BBC Radio Wales: ""Every reduction is a benefit to Wales. ""However you look at it, the Severn Bridge toll is a tax on every business that is based here. ""[The cut in the toll] is a start, and we as a company are looking forward to the abolition of it at the end of the year. ""That's a large saving - even as a relatively small company based in mid Wales we spend about £1,500 a week on the tolls, so as you can imagine that would be of great benefit to us."""
economic indicators,Economy continues to show signs of improvement,2024-09-15,2023-04-17,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65275557,"Positive signs of improvements in the Northern Ireland economy continued last month, according to an Ulster Bank survey. Every month the bank surveys firms in the private sector. They are asked about things like their staffing levels, order books and exports, in what is considered to be a reliable indicator of economic performance. Private sector growth in March rose at its fastest rate in a year. This was boosted by improved consumer confidence, with only London recording a sharper rate of growth among the UK regions. Inflationary pressures continued to ease in terms of both input costs and output prices but are still above the pre-pandemic long-term average. Growth was reported across all sectors in the survey, except construction. Ulster Bank chief economist Richard Ramsey said: ""Lack of a Stormont executive and a paralysis in decision-making is being felt and will continue to be felt in this sector.  ""This is reflected in the new-orders indicator, which has indicated declines for 21 months running. ""Whilst we are seeing notable short-term improvements and firms are relatively optimistic for the year ahead, there are lots of challenges that will impact on future growth."" Mr Ramsey added: ""The slowdown in the global economy is one factor but the outlook for the public finances is also bleak and this is compounded by the ongoing lack of a functioning Stormont executive.  ""Meanwhile, households will continue to battle with a cost-of-living crisis."" It comes as Danske bank has upgraded its forecast for the Northern Ireland economy this year, although a contraction is still expected. A report from the bank says the fall in annual economic output is expected to be about 0.3% in 2023 due to high inflation and changes to the economic policy environment. Previously the bank forecast a 1% fall in activity this year. However, it says the outlook is ""highly uncertain"".  Things are expected to pick up next year, with the bank forecasting that the Northern Ireland economy will grow by about 0.9% in 2024.  Danske Bank's chief economist Conor Lambe said: ""The economy has proved more resilient than previously expected and the labour market remains in a relatively robust position.  ""We still expect annual economic output to fall this year in Northern Ireland and the wider UK but we have revised our forecasts upwards relative to our previous report. Mr Lambe added: ""Persistent inflation is still a risk to the economic outlook, with inflation in the UK remaining near its multi-decade high. ""Although we think it has likely peaked, the rate of price rises is still expected to remain above its 2% target throughout this year.  ""If inflation remains higher than forecast and declines more slowly than anticipated, it has the potential to constrain economic activity even further."" Danske says it expects the rate of jobs growth to slow sharply this year.  The bank is forecasting the unemployment rate in Northern Ireland will average about 3.2% in 2023 before increasing to an annual average of about 3.5% in 2024.  However, the professional, scientific and technical services and information and communication sectors are expected to see high rates of jobs growth of 8.3% and 2.2% respectively. "
economic indicators,The pound's fall: A tale of two cities,2024-09-15,2019-07-12,By Russell Hotten & Dan Ascher,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48954323,"Rob and Chloe are sharing a small Starbucks while admiring the bright lights of New York's Times Square. Coffee cost? Almost $5. They've also had a cake and a sandwich. $16-plus.  Based on the exchange rate they got back in Kent, nurse Chloe estimates the total cost was around £17. ""Given where we are I suppose it wasn't too excessive,"" she says. ""But I think it's the most expensive coffee I've ever bought."" Lunch, in the heart of Little Italy, was also an eye-opener. Two margherita pizzas, two glasses of wine, and tip (obligatory everywhere): $96.  Chloe said: ""We are watching the pennies. It's not spoiling our trip... but there are things we thought we'd do that we won't now."" They'd come to Times Square for discounted tickets for Broadway shows. Even these were too pricey. ""We'll give it a miss this time,"" says Rob, who, like Chloe, did not want his surname used. Like tens of thousands of UK tourists, the couple picked an expensive time to visit America.  This week sterling hit a more than two-year low against the dollar, trading below $1.25, a rate not seen since April 2017. But these are commercial rates. Tourists get a worse deal when exchanging currency. And yet, sterling's recent weakness has failed to dent visitor numbers. According to the US Department of Commerce, 1.8 million Britons visited the US in the five months to 31 May, 8.2% up on the period in 2018. The overwhelming majority were tourists and people visiting friends and family. For 2018 as a whole, 4.7 million visited, up 4% on 2017. This, though, is below the peak year of 2015 when 4.9 million people visited. But analysts doubt the numbers will hold up for the rest of 2019. Indeed, Adam Sacks, president of Philadelphia-based Tourism Economics, thinks the official data over-estimates the picture.  For a start, airline passenger growth from the UK to the US is up only 4%, he said. ""Right now, the market [from the UK] is defying gravity."" It helps that the US is a bucket-list attraction. ""That will always underpin tourism,"" he said. But with sterling facing more headwinds because of Brexit, economic slowdown, and trade wars, ""I'm expecting inbound total traffic for the year to end about 2.5% up on 2018,"" he said. It's not the first time the Strattons, from Hatfield, Hertfordshire, have visited New York, but it's probably the most expensive.  They booked their hotel and flight last year, so think they got a better deal than now. ""And we're aware of all the free and discounted attractions that are available,"" says Annette. She advises visitors to do their research and seek these out to save money.  But, Richard says: ""Eating out for the four of us is very expensive - $100 a time at least. Sales taxes and tips mean costs soon increase. Even the hotel charges for wifi use."" They've split some breakfasts and drinks between them to help cut costs. And they had hoped to take in one of Broadway's blockbuster shows - hopefully Hamilton. ""But not at $1,200 for the family,"" said Richard. Annette says that when you're on holiday there's a certain ""pay what it takes"" attitude. And daughters Georgia and Kerensa say they are loving their trip - which as parents know, is what matters most. The girls are especially looking forward to next week, when they visit Florida's amusement parks. Mum, though, thinks it could be even more expensive than New York. Chris Heywood, an executive at New York's tourist board, NYC & Company, says it would take a sustained and prolonged sterling depression to hit hard the number of UK visitors to his city. Britons make up the single biggest group of overseas visitors, with 1.26 million seeing the sites in 2018. The number has grown steadily since 2012, when one million visited. ""People are planning their visits better. More come in the first three months of the year, when hotel rates drop,"" he said. His single biggest piece of advice: ""Check our website. There is so much free stuff to do.""  In London, however, Americans are getting slightly more bang for their buck. Joy Smith, from Colorado, was in London to meet her daughter, Reilly, who was on the final stop of a six-week European tour with husband Seth before the couple return to Texas. Joy said she was expecting prices to be higher but, in fact, the cost of food was ""very comparable"" to prices back home.  But the Baycroft family had a different London culinary experience. Johanna, had just bought her son, Cougar, a meal at McDonald's, which she said would have been almost half the price at home in Washington state. Nevertheless, prices overall were lower than she had budgeted for, although she had prepared for the worst and saved money by staying with her sister. Bob and Priya were leaving Hamley's with their two daughters, who had bought two teddy bears. The couple were used to New York prices so London ""wasn't a shocker"", Bob said. The EU referendum in June 2016 knocked the value of the pound, making things cheaper for US tourists. Before the vote, $1 was worth around 68 pence. It's now worth about 80p. And that spurred a big increase in the number of people crossing the Atlantic. The Office for National Statistics recorded a 13% jump in the number of Americans arriving in London in 2017, with 2.6 million visitors spending about £2.2bn - when $1 was worth an average of 81 pence. That helped to offset a slowdown in domestic spending, according to Henry Gregg, from the New West End Company, which represents Central London businesses. ""For domestic shoppers, it's bad because they see prices increase,"" he said. But it's good for international shoppers who can take advantage of the ""big pricing differential"" in the short term, he said. Luxury brands have been the biggest beneficiaries of the increase in spending by US tourists, Mr Gregg said. Budget retailers like Primark have also benefitted. It's been ""middle of the road"" clothes stores like Topshop that have missed out, he said. While the number of Americans visiting London increased slightly in 2018, they cut back on spending, forking out £2bn, 8% less than the previous year. Mr Gregg puts the tightening of purse strings down to a normalisation as retailers increase prices to reflect an increase in costs as a result of an unfavourable exchange rate for importers. But that's not deterring Americans from bringing their tourist dollars to London, according to the New West End Company, which also tracks room bookings - an early indicator of visitor numbers. It said projected visitor numbers would rise 4.8% for June-to-August. London, like New York, is on the must-see list of most tourists. Exchange rates may fluctuate, but the lure of the bright lights remains."
economic indicators,Firms' increased costs 'linked to Brexit red tape',2024-09-15,2021-02-08,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-55952462,"Northern Ireland firms increased their prices last month at the highest rate since 2018, according to an Ulster Bank survey. It says firms saw their costs rise at the highest rate in the UK, largely as a result of higher shipping costs. Every month the bank asks firms across the private sector about things to determine their economic performance. Staffing levels, new orders and exports are considered to be reliable indicators. Ulster Bank's Chief Economist in Northern Ireland Richard Ramsey said: ""Northern Ireland's firms signalled the highest rate of input cost inflation across the UK with input prices rising at the fastest rate since June 2018."" ""Higher shipping costs were widely cited alongside higher raw material costs and increased transport costs linked to the new Brexit arrangements."" ""As a result of these cost pressures, local firms, most notably retailers, hiked the price of their goods and services at the fastest pace since October 2018."" The survey also said output in the private sector fell at the sharpest rate in January since last May because of lockdown restrictions. Mr Ramsey said: ""Profit margins are being squeezed across all sectors but particularly construction."" ""2021 has been the year of the rollout on two fronts. The rollout of the vaccine will be the single biggest factor driving economic performance later in the year.  ""Meanwhile, the rollout of red tape linked to the new Brexit arrangements will hinder Northern Ireland's economic recovery by adding costs to business and restricting trade. ""While Northern Ireland has the advantage of remaining within the EU's single market for goods, it finds itself on the wrong side of a regulatory sea-border which has effectively redrawn the map of the UK's single market and customs union"" he added."
economic indicators,Extreme weather events are 'the new norm',2024-09-15,2021-10-31,By Matt McGrath,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59105963,"Extreme weather events - including powerful heat waves and devastating floods - are now the new normal, says the World Meteorological Organisation. The State of the Climate report for 2021 highlights a world that is ""changing before our eyes."" The 20-year temperature average from 2002 is on course to exceed 1C above pre-industrial levels for the first time. And global sea levels rose to a new high in 2021, according to the study. These latest figures for 2021 are being released early by the WMO to coincide with the start of the UN climate conference in Glasgow known as COP26. The State of the Climate report provides a snapshot of climate indicators including temperatures, extreme weather events, sea level rises and ocean conditions. The study finds that the past seven years including this one are likely to be the warmest on record as greenhouse gases reached record concentrations in the atmosphere. The accompanying rise in temperatures is propelling the planet into ""uncharted territory"" says the report, with increasing impacts across the planet.  ""Extreme events are the new norm,"" said WMO's Prof Petteri Taalas. ""There is mounting scientific evidence that some of these bear the footprint of human-induced climate change."" Prof Taalas detailed some of the extreme events that have been experienced around the world this year.  Another worrying development, according to the WMO study, has been the rise in global sea levels. Since they were first measured by precise satellite-based systems in the early 1990s, sea levels went up by 2.1mm per year between 1993 and 2002. But from 2013 to 2021 the rise has more than doubled to 4.4mm, mostly as a result of accelerated ice loss from glaciers and ice sheets.  ""Sea levels are rising faster now than at any other time in the last two millennia,"" said Prof Jonathan Bomber, Director of the Bristol Glaciology Centre. ""If we continue on our current trajectory, that rise could exceed 2m by 2100 displacing some 630 million people worldwide. The consequences of that are unimaginable."" In temperature terms, 2021 will likely be the sixth or seventh warmest on record.  That's because the early months of this year were impacted by a La Niña event, a naturally occurring weather phenomenon that tends to cool global temperatures.  But the report also shows that the global temperature record is on course to breach 1C for the first time over a 20 year period. ""The fact that the 20-year average has reached more than 1.0C above pre-industrial levels will focus the minds of delegates at COP26 aspiring to keep global temperature rise to within the limits agreed in Paris six years ago,"" said Prof Stephen Belcher, chief scientist at the UK Met Office, which contributed to the report. Commenting on the analysis, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres, said the planet was changing before our eyes.  ""From the ocean depths to mountain tops, from melting glaciers to relentless extreme weather events, ecosystems and communities around the globe are being devastated,"" he said.  ""COP26 must be a turning point for people and planet,"" said Mr Guterres. Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
economic indicators,Erdogan rival pledges to restore Turkish democracy,2024-09-15,2023-05-04,By Orla Guerin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65467117,"Danger comes in many forms. For Turkey's long-time leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, it comes in the shape of a former civil servant, given to making heart emojis with his hands. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, backed by a six-party opposition alliance, says if he wins he will bring freedom and democracy to Turkey, whatever it takes.  ""The youth want democracy,"" he told the BBC. ""They don't want the police to come to their doors early in the morning just because they tweeted."" He is the Islamist leader's main rival in elections on 14 May and has a narrow lead in opinion polls. This tight race is expected to go to a second round two weeks later. Currently Turks can go to jail for ""insulting the president"". Many have.  ""I am telling young people they can criticise me freely. I will make sure they have this right,"" says the 74-year-old, who leads the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP). Some of Mr Kilicdaroglu's supporters fear for his safety but he says it comes with the territory. ""Being in politics in Turkey means choosing a life with risks. I will walk my path whatever Erdogan and his allies do. They can't put me off. They can't scare me. I made a promise to this nation."" President Erdogan, 69, has mocked his rival in the past saying he ""couldn't even herd a sheep"". But he's harder to dismiss now. Arriving for a rally in the port city of Izmir, an opposition stronghold, the opposition candidate is greeted by a sea of flag-waving supporters.  There are chants of ""Kilicdaroglu is the hope of the people"". Many in the crowd are young. Five million Turks will vote for the first time in this election. At 15, Oguz is too young to go to the polls but couldn't stay away from the rally. ""He is a good person, and he sees the future positively. If he becomes president our economy will rise up, and we will rise up."" Mr Kilicdaroglu told me before the rally he would reorient Turkey, and prioritise relations with the West, not the Kremlin. ""We want to become a part of the civilized world,"" he said. ""We want free media and complete judicial independence. Erdogan does not think that way. He wants to be more authoritarian. The difference between us and Erdogan is the difference between black and white."" But will Recep Tayyip Erdogan go quietly if he is defeated after 20 years in power, first as prime minister and now all-powerful president? ""We will retire him, and send him to his corner,"" said Mr Kilicdaroglu. ""He will step back quietly. No one should have any concerns about it."" Others aren't so sure. There are indications that the Turkish leader may be preparing to dispute the result if he loses. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu has warned the vote will be ""a coup attempt by the West"".   Mr Kilicdaroglu said the combined opposition would be vigilant, trusting neither the president, ""nor his Supreme Election Council nor his judges"". ""By having more than one observer in all the polling stations, we want to ensure that votes are cast correctly, securely, and the counting is done properly. We have been taking precautions to achieve this, working hard for a year and a half."" In many ways he is the anti-Erdogan. He has recorded campaign videos at his modest kitchen table, tea towels hanging neatly in the background.   Showing he knows his onions, his rival appeared in one video with one in hand, warning prices would keep soaring if Mr Erdogan remained in power. ""Now, one kilogram of onion is 30 liras,"" he said. ""If he stays it will be 100 liras."" The president's economic policies are widely blamed for rampant inflation here. Whoever wins will inherit a broken economy and a divided nation - there's no magic bullet for either.  On stage, flanked by other opposition leaders, Mr Kilicdaroglu makes his trademark heart emoji for the crowds. ""Everything will be beautiful,"" he says. ""Believe it."" And they do. But his rally on the waterfront in Izmir came only a day after the president attracted his own large gathering, which was segregated. Many religious conservatives will stick with him. He speaks their language. And he has shored up his support with pre-election spending including wage increases.  As polling day draws near there is an undercurrent of tension.  Many conversations are peppered with election talk - and fears - and Turkey faces a stark choice of two competing visions. A new poll of opinion polls suggests that Mr Kilicdaroglu will win the presidency but that the president's alliance is ahead in the race for parliament.  With the election on a knife edge, no-one can be sure if the coming weeks will pass peacefully."
economic indicators,What will Trump do about the Iran nuclear deal?,2024-09-15,2017-10-12,By Jonathan Marcus,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41571984,"All the indications are that President Trump will refuse to recertify the present Iran nuclear deal some time before the due date of 15 October. This would light a fuse that could potentially explode the agreement. It raises questions about how Iran will respond. And it creates huge diplomatic difficulties between the US and many of its key European allies who wholeheartedly back the deal. The agreement, negotiated with Iran by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council together with Germany and the European Union, was reached in July 2015. Its aim was to ensure that Iran's nuclear programme was entirely peaceful.  The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), began to be implemented in January 2016. In return for the progressive lifting of a range of economic sanctions, Iran halted some of its activities and reduced others within strict limits, all open to verification by international inspectors. There are four crucial things to remember about the deal.  It was not perfect.  Forcing Iran to halt its nuclear activities altogether was not feasible. Many of the restrictions imposed by the JCPOA contain ""sunset clauses"", which run out after a number of years. What happens then is a valid question, but it was felt by all the parties that constraining Iran's nuclear programme for the immediate future was a deal worth taking. It is easy to forget that there was a real concern at the time the deal was being negotiated that without an agreement there could be a military conflict.  Israel was pressing for military action. Many of Iran's Arab enemies in the Gulf quietly backed such a step and there were questions as to whether the US itself might have to use force to prevent Iran developing the capability to manufacture and deliver a nuclear weapon.  Sound familiar? It is much like the position that the US is in today with North Korea. The JCPOA was intended to manage Iran's nuclear activities, avoiding a recourse to war. The JCPOA was about Iran's nuclear programme and nothing else. Iran does many things that the US, and its European and Middle Eastern allies, believe are damaging to security in the region.  That is an important but a different matter, one that I will come back to in a moment. The JCPOA was and is a nuclear deal, pure and simple.  And that brings me to perhaps the most fundamental point of all.  Everyone - and that includes the UN's nuclear watchdog and all of the signatories (including senior figures in the Trump administration) - believes that Iran is abiding by the agreement to the letter. Enter the US Congress.  It wanted to have some oversight over the application of the JCPOA and brought in legislation, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA), which requires the US president to certify every 90 days not just that Iran is complying with the deal, but that the continued suspension of nuclear-related US economic sanctions remains vital to the national security interests of the United States.  So far - despite criticising the Iran nuclear deal at every opportunity - President Trump has grudgingly recertified the JCPOA under this legislation. But now he looks set to change his mind.  Assuming he does now refuse to recertify the deal, insisting that it is no longer in US interests to do so, what then? What does it mean? And what happens next? The crucial point to grasp is that the Iran deal (JCPOA) and the US legislation (INARA) are two totally different things.  By decertifying the Iran deal, Mr Trump would not be withdrawing from it. He would certainly be making a fundamental point about his view of its utility. He would be opening up a path under which Congress could effectively cease US compliance with the deal.  But in practical terms, this is a multinational agreement that is being adhered to and thus it would remain active with or without a certification from Mr Trump. Of course, having decertified the deal, the president could simply reimpose some or all of the economic sanctions that have been waived under the JCPOA, and this would certainly mean that the US was no longer complying with its terms of the deal.  But the more likely scenario would be that - under the US INARA legislation - the whole issue would go to Capitol Hill for the US Congress to decide.  Opinion there is divided. There is clearly no warmth felt towards Tehran, but at this stage it is not clear what Congress might do.  Would it reimpose some or all sanctions - thus pulling the US out of the deal - or decide to bide its time? There are indications that some of those on Capitol Hill most critical of the deal at the time are now reluctant to tear it up. Now we come to another crucial aspect of this whole business: the ostensible reason why Mr Trump may decertify the agreement in the first place.  Iran is seen by the West and its allies as a major problem in the region. Paradoxically, the US itself helped to facilitate Iran's rise as a regional player through its destruction of the Saddam Hussein government in Iraq. Iran has an important say with the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad. It - along with its proxy militias - is a major player in Syria. And it has a hand in the conflict in Yemen, though there is debate about the scale of its activities there.  Add in worries about its missile programmes and its alleged support for terrorism, and there are good reasons for concern about its growing regional influence. The JCPOA agreement has not changed Iran's wider behaviour. The activities of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and its missile-research effort have continued. The JCPOA was never intended to tackle these wider issues. But in some basic sense, Mr Trump looks set to contend that Iran is not living up to the ""spirit"" of the deal - it's not playing nice - and that is why he will choose to decertify it. The Trump administration wants to get tough with Tehran. The president is likely to set his decertification of the JCPOA as part of a wider set of policies intended to punish Iran, as he would see it, for its bad behaviour.   All sorts of new sanctions could be on the table. Remember, there is still a whole battery of sanctions in place both from the US and the EU for a variety of other things - separate from the nuclear programme - such as terrorism or human rights violations.  One suggestion is that the Trump administration might decide to brand the whole of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist entity.  This body - part security force, part military, part ideological vanguard - also controls a significant part of the Iranian economy. More sanctions here could cause problems not just for Iran, but between the US and those of its allies who want to open up trade with Tehran. So if, as expected, Mr Trump does decertify the Iran nuclear deal, it is not necessarily the end of the agreement.  America's allies are lining up to encourage both the White House and Congress to stick with the deal.  Even if Congress chooses not to reapply sanctions for now, the next problem becomes the scope and impact of the Trump administration's wider policy towards Tehran. Iran for now is likely to do nothing. It will see decertification as an internal legal US matter, and is likely to continue to adhere to the agreement. Indeed, it may well relish the widening split between Washington and its key European allies.  But the way Tehran responds to any other US steps may well decide the fate of the nuclear deal.  Remember, this is a US administration dominated by military figures, many of whom have been up against Iranian-backed forces in the field.  They may back the nuclear deal, but also want to see Tehran held to account for its actions.  Insulating the JCPOA from team Trump's wider Iran policy is not going to be easy, and over time, it may well influence thinking towards the utility of the agreement in Iran itself."
economic indicators,Does GDP tell the whole economic story?,2024-09-15,2019-05-09,By Dharshini David,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48219687,"Answering a simple ""How are you?"" with an honest detailed answer may lead to an awkward silence.  After all, it's often just longhand for ""hello"". But the government's official number-crunchers at the Office for National Statistics genuinely care about the response.  Next week, they'll publish their statistics into how people across the country are feeling about their lives.  Have they gone soft? Not quite. They've realised that how we've traditionally measured living standards or economic well-being isn't up to scratch.  We typically turn to GDP - gross domestic product. That's the measure of how much companies, individuals and the government earn/spend/produce (in theory, each of those give the same answer), with an adjustment for exports less imports.  It measures the nation's net income, but may not tell the whole story.  First, there are things which can skew the big picture. Take the first three months of this year, when the economy grew by 0.5%, according to the latest official figures.  At the time, many companies were busy stockpiling components and finished goods due to fears of a no-deal Brexit.  That makes growth look stronger, but that buzz of activity reflects contingency planning rather than a response to strong demand.  And it may mean less of that activity further down the line, making growth look weaker in subsequent quarters.         Even without distortions, GDP may not reflect the individual situation. The fates of government businesses and households will differ hugely in any quarter.  The ONS provides a breakdown of some details. It has recently delved deeper into households' situations with a well-being dashboard, which looks at things such as incomes, debt and anxiety levels (Spoiler alert:  the most recent version shows most things on the rise).  And there'll be winners and losers across the country. The Bank of England has also doubled down on work to highlight the fate of different regions. But then there's what is left out by GDP: basically, anything unpaid, from volunteering to housework. In other words, items that aren't termed ""market activity"".  Economist Paul Samuelson joked that if a man marries his maid, GDP falls. It's not so much a joke as a criticism (and not just of outdated gender stereotyping) that statisticians fail to value certain types of work.  The problem is that without payment, such work is hard to put a price tag on.  Feeling a bit hard done-by aside, how much does that matter, given what policymakers actually use GDP for?  The Bank of England manages the economy by setting interest rates to influence spending and borrowing, while the government uses the figures to gauge how much tax might come in.   And of course, there's a multitude of other factors -  from crime to gender equality, biodiversity, access to clean energy and education levels - that hit our current and future living standards.  These are just a few of the Sustainable Development Goals that the US has spelled out. The ONS has embarked on a marathon task to identify and measure hundreds of indicators to reflect those.  They are about two-thirds of the way there - and even when they have finessed them, collecting the information on a regular basis may not be quick as gleaning GDP information.  The number-crunchers acknowledge the need for a more ""holistic"" gauge of our well-being.  GDP is three little letters that represents more than a trillion pounds of crucial and relatively easy to collect information on the financial state of our economy. It isn't perfect, but it still has its uses.    "
economic indicators,Why do billions of people still not have glasses?,2024-09-15,2019-11-20,By Tim Harford,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49991877,"Making spacecraft is not a job in which you can afford to be slapdash.  At Lockheed Martin, for example, it used to take a technician two painstaking days to measure 309 locations for certain fasteners on a particular curved panel.  But according to Shelley Peterson, the aerospace company's head of emerging technologies, the same job now takes little more than two hours.  What changed? The technician started wearing glasses. But not just any old glasses: specifically, the Microsoft Hololens.  It looks like a bulky set of safety goggles. And it layers digital information over the real world. In this case, it scans the curved panel, makes its calculations, and shows the technician exactly where each fastener should go. Productivity experts are gushing about the potential benefits of augmented-reality devices such as the Hololens and Google Glass.  When Google first demonstrated its smart glasses in 2012, their prospects seemed quite different. They were seen as a consumer device, something that would let us check Instagram and take videos without the hassle of reaching for our phones.  They did not catch on. The few people who ventured out in public wearing Google Glass attracted the dismissive soubriquet ""glassholes"".   Google soon realised it had misidentified its target market, so reinvented the glasses for the workplace. Many jobs, after all, involve frequent pauses to consult a screen that tells us what to do next.  With smart specs, we can see those instructions while we keep working. It saves a vital few seconds in getting information from internet to brain.  50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast. A thousand years ago, information travelled rather more slowly.  In Cairo, in the 1010s, the Basra-born polymath Hasan Ibn al-Haytham wrote his masterwork, the Book of Optics, but it took two centuries for his insights to be translated beyond Arabic.   Haytham understood vision better than anyone before him.  Some earlier scholars, for example, had said the act of seeing must involve some kind of rays being emitted from the eye. By careful experiment, Haytham proved them wrong: light comes into the eyes.  Before Haytham, optical devices had been cumbersome: the Roman writer Seneca magnified text using a clear glass bowl of water. But the gradual spread of knowledge inspired new ideas. Some time in the late 1200s came the world's first pair of reading glasses.   Who made them is lost to history but they probably lived in northern Italy. Venice, in particular, was a hub of glassmaking at the time - problematically so, as buildings in Venice were made of wood and the glassmakers' furnaces kept starting fires.  In 1291, the city's authorities banished the entire trade to the neighbouring island of Murano. By 1301, ""eyeglasses for reading"" were popular enough to feature in the rulebook of the Guild of Venetian Crystal Workers.  But historians' biggest clue to the origin of eyeglasses comes from a sermon in 1306 by one Friar Giordano da Pisa. The invention was now 20 years old, he told his congregation in Florence.  As Alberto Manguel notes in A History of Reading, the friar declared glasses to be ""one of the most useful devices in the world"".  He was right. Reading strained the eyes at the best of times: medieval buildings weren't famed for their big windows and artificial light was dim and expensive.   As we age, it becomes harder to focus on close-up objects; middle-aged monks, scholars, notaries and merchants were simply out of luck. Friar Giordino was 50. One can imagine why he appreciated his spectacles so much. But they were useful only to the small minority who could read. When the printing press came along, glasses reached a bigger market. The first specialist spectacle shop opened in Strasbourg in 1466.   Manufacturers branched out from convex lenses, which help people see close-up. They learned how to grind concave lenses as well, which help people focus on things far away.   Put concave and convex lenses together and you have the basic ingredients for a microscope or a telescope. Both inventions emerged from the spectacle shops of the Netherlands around the year 1600, opening whole new worlds to scientific study.   Nowadays we take glasses for granted - in the developed world, at least. A survey by the College of Optometrists suggests about three-quarters of people in the UK wear glasses or contact lenses or have had surgery to correct their vision. It's a similar story in America and Japan.   In less developed countries, however, the picture is very different - and only recently did we get a clearer view of it.  Historically, the World Health Organization has collected data on people who have really serious problems with their vision only.   Many more can see well enough to muddle through daily life but would still benefit from spectacles. But how many? The world's leading lens-maker, Essilor, decided to find out, one assumes not for entirely selfless reasons.  In 2012 came the answer: around the world, some two and a half billion people need glasses and don't have them. That's an eye-popping figure but serious people think it's credible.   And many of those people may have no idea glasses could help them.  In 2017, researchers tested the vision of hundreds of tea-pickers aged 40 or over on a plantation in Assam. They gave a simple $10 (£8.20) pair of reading glasses to half of those who needed them. Then, they compared how much tea was picked by those who wore the glasses and those who didn't.  Those with the glasses averaged about 20% more tea. The older they were, the more their tea-picking improved. The tea-pickers are paid by how much tea they pick. Before the study, not one owned glasses. By the end, hardly any wanted to give them back.    How widely we can extrapolate from this study is hard to say: picking tea may reward visual acuity more than some other jobs.   Still, even conservative estimates put the economic losses from poor eyesight into the hundreds of billions of dollars - and that's before you think about people's quality of life or children struggling at school.  One randomised trial concluded giving children glasses could be equivalent to an extra half year of schooling.   And the need is growing. Presbyopia is a long-sightedness which comes with age; among children there's now a global epidemic of myopia, or short-sightedness. Researchers aren't sure why, though it may have to do with children spending less time outdoors.   What would it take to correct the world's vision? Clearly, more eye doctors would help - the number varies widely from country to country. Greece, for example, has one ophthalmologist for roughly every 5,000 people; in India, it's one per 70,000; in some African countries, it's one per a million.   But while serious eye problems demand skilled professionals, people whose needs are more easily fixable could be reached by other workers.  In Rwanda, a charity trained nurses to do sight checks; researchers found they did them well over 90% of the time.   Could teachers identify students struggling to see? I've worn glasses since primary school, when my teacher saw me squinting at the blackboard and told my mother to take me to an optician.  Another study suggests they could. After just a couple of hours of training, teachers at schools in rural China could spot most children who would benefit from wearing glasses. It shouldn't be rocket science to roll out 13th-Century technology.  One wonders what Friar Giordano would make of a world in which we build spacecraft in augmented reality but haven't yet helped a couple of billion people fix their fuzzy views of actual reality. He'd probably tell us where to focus.  The author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

economic indicators,Businesses braced for cuts as energy prices soar,2024-09-15,2022-02-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-60310713,"One in five Scottish companies expect to reduce operations this year due to the increase in energy prices. A new report also reveals that only 7% of firms are expecting strong growth during the next 12 months. And inflationary pressures mean 80% of businesses anticipate the prices of their goods and services will increase in the year ahead. Other challenges include the ongoing impact of Covid and both attracting and retaining staff. Wholesale gas prices have been rising sharply over the last few months, which meant the regulator Ofgem was last week obliged to announce a rise in the cap that limits the amount companies can charge consumers. The higher cap means a typical household will pay £1,971 a year from April, 54% more than they pay now, with a further rise expected in October. Last Thursday the Bank of England increased interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% to try to dampen the pace of price rises over the longer term but it said inflation could still reach 7.25% in April. The results of the latest Addleshaw Goddard Scottish Business Monitor report found that all sectors reported positive net balances for the third consecutive quarter. It also found that all core business indicators, barring export activity, remained optimistic throughout 2021. But the report, produced in partnership with the University of Strathclyde's Fraser of Allander Institute, said more than half of Scottish businesses were finding it difficult to source the goods and services they required. And more than 80% were struggling to recruit the staff they needed, while almost a quarter were also finding it difficult to retain their own people. Mairi Spowage, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute, said: ""These results show us that despite the reintroduction of some restrictions over the Christmas period, business optimism remained throughout the final quarter of 2021. ""However, inflationary pressures and rising energy prices are a concern for firms.  ""Growing uncertainty throughout global supply chains is also causing problems for businesses across all sectors, particularly those in industries such as manufacturing."" Ms Spowage also highlighted the recruitment difficulties experienced by firms in the current climate. But she added: ""It is positive to see the lasting effects that COP26 has had on business attitudes, with the majority continuing to signal their commitment to reaching their net-zero targets. ""Businesses continue to see the opportunities and rise to the challenges of incorporating more sustainable practices, with more firms now putting the onus on suppliers to meet sustainable requirements."" David Kirchin, head of Scotland at Addleshaw Goddard, said: ""As we gradually move away from the major restraints brought on by the pandemic, these latest results show that Scottish firms expect business volume to increase.  ""However, they also see challenges ahead, whether linked to rising energy prices, supply-chain challenges or the hiring and retention of people."" More than 400 businesses responded to the latest survey in December and January, from across the Scottish economy.  It examined business sentiment in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the outlook and expectations for the coming months."
economic indicators,Investors bet on prisoner rehab,2024-09-15,2010-09-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-11254308,"Justice Secretary Ken Clarke has embraced the scheme A ""payment-by-results"" pilot project aimed at cutting reoffending has officially been launched. Investors have put £5m in social impact bonds to fund rehabilitation work with 3,000 Peterborough Prison inmates. They could earn a return of up to £8m from the government and the Big Lottery Fund if their cash helps rehabilitate criminals. Labour gave the groundbreaking scheme the go-ahead but new Justice Secretary Ken Clarke has fully embraced it. The government has said the pilot is the first project of its kind in the world. This video can not be played Toby Eccles from Social Finance explains how the scheme will work Mr Clarke has indicated the scheme, which may also cut court and jail costs, might be introduced in other prisons in England and Wales if it is successful. The social impact bond scheme is jointly run by the Ministry of Justice and Social Finance, an ethical investment bank run by a former top City banker.  The money raised by Social Finance from charitable trusts and social investment groups will fund organisations including the St Giles Trust, a specialist charity with a proven record in rehabilitating offenders.  Earlier this year the trust published an economic evaluation of its Through the Gates rehabilitation programme, external which suggested that the government saved £10 for every £1 invested in such schemes. The Peterborough prisoners will be given mentors when they are released and they will be given assistance to find jobs and housing and wean themselves off drugs if they need to. If the money helps cut reoffending, this scheme could return up to £8m to investors, comparable with an annual return of 7.5% in a conventional bond-market investment.  Reoffending among the target group must fall by at least 7.5% to trigger the dividend payments in each of the six years of the bond's operation.  The return on social impact bonds is seen as a share of the financial benefit gained by society when a criminal goes straight.  But as with other finance bonds, there is no guarantee of a return and investors could lose all their money if reoffending does not fall. Male prisoners sentenced to less than a year at Peterborough Prison will take part in the scheme.  Although the official launch was on Friday, the scheme began on 16 August - with the first prisoners to go through it leaving the facility on Thursday. Mr Clarke said that reoffending was the ""weakest bit of the criminal justice system"" and that the radical bonds would help tackle it without using taxpayers' money.  ""It pays by results,"" said Mr Clarke. ""We're going to pay what works and what works should therefore grow and what doesn't work will vanish. ""I like the innovative funding, the payment by results, the collaborative groups, and if it succeeds it will grow and if it doesn't, by that time we will be trying something else. ""But sooner or later, something has got to be done about reoffending."" Social Finance said there would be indications of whether the project was succeeding within a year but the full return would not be known until the end of the six-year investment term.  Social Finance director Emily Bolton said: ""Investors benefit and the government gets some cost savings. The better the reductions in reoffending, the higher the investors' return. ""It's not taking money out of the system, in fact it's enabling us to transfer the money to more socially valuable things."" Barrow Cadbury Trust chief executive Sara Llewellin said she was delighted the charitable foundation was among the first batch of investors. ""For us this is a win-win; we can invest rather than just give a grant.  If the intervention is successful, we can then invest any money gained in more socially useful projects,"" she said. Rob Owen, the chief executive of St Giles Trust said the scheme provided a ""rehabilitation revolution"" and he was pleased six caseworkers from the charity had been involved from the outset. ""It is about engaging the offenders while they're in prison and assessing their needs and helping to deal with them. They are literally met by one of our caseworkers as soon as they leave the prison and we give them the guidance we can. ""Most of these men will be in prison for just 30-35 days before they're on release - for us it's an intense period but we have to tailor our approach. One size does not fit all in these cases."" This video can not be played Jack Straw, Shadow Justice Secretary: ""I hope it will be extended"" Paddy Scriven, general secretary of the Prison Governors Association, said the scheme was a postive step foward but must not exclude the most persistent offenders. She said: ""The thing that has to be guarded against is that if this sort of scheme spreads and it is payment by results, that the not-for-profit sector people and charities that are administering it don't cherry-pick the most likely successes and leave the very hardline cases to the Prison Service, or more importantly the Probation Service. Then the success is measured unevenly."" Labour MP Jack Straw, who first announced the scheme in March while justice secretary, told the BBC the project involved an element of risk, but added: ""If you look at the difference between costs between turning someone round in probation rather than in prison, the benefits will flow back to the state rather quickly."" Jon Collins of the Criminal Justice Alliance, a reform campaign group, said the project could have the potential to help thousands and added: ""Bringing money in from new investors to fund this work will also ensure that it is able to continue at a time when the Ministry of Justice's budget is facing severe cuts.""

economic indicators,Happiness index 'not woolly' - PM,2024-09-15,2010-11-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-11833241,"This video can not be played Cameron: 'Happiness cannot be captured on spreadsheet' Prime Minister David Cameron has insisted his £2m plan to measure the nation's happiness is not ""woolly"". He said economic growth remained the most ""urgent priority"" but he wanted a better measure of how the country was doing than GDP. From April, the Office for National Statistics will ask people to rate their own well-being with the first official happiness index due in 2012. But before that it wants the public to give their views in a consultation, external.  Labour also attempted to measure quality of life when it was in power but then prime minister Tony Blair abandoned the idea, after it proved too difficult to pin down. But Mr Cameron, who first floated the idea of a ""happiness index"" in 2005, when he was running for the leadership of the Conservative Party, argues that gross domestic product (GDP) - the standard measure of economic activity used around the world - is no longer up to the job. Launching the consultation on Thursday, he said: ""We'll continue to measure GDP as we've always done, but it is high time we admitted that, taken on its own, GDP is an incomplete way of measuring a country's progress."" Quoting former US senator Robert Kennedy, who said GDP measured everything ""except that which makes life worthwhile"", he said the information gathered would help Britain re-evaluate its priorities in life. He also hit back at claims that he should be focusing solely on economic growth as the country tries to emerge from recession. He said the government's ""most urgent priority is to get the economy moving, to create jobs, to spread opportunity for everyone"". ""Without a job that pays a decent wage it is hard for people to look after their families in the way that they want, whether that's taking the children on holiday or making your home a more comfortable place. ""Without money in your pocket it is difficult to do so many of the things that we enjoy."" But he said the government also had to focus on the long-term and he said ""the country would be better off if we thought about well-being as well as economic growth"". GDP was too ""crude"" a measure of progress as it failed to take into account wider social factors - he cited the example of ""irresponsible"" marketing to children, an immigration ""free for all"" and a ""cheap booze free for all"", which had all boosted economic growth at the expense of social problems. He admitted measuring happiness could be seen as ""woolly"" and ""impractical"". ""You cannot capture happiness on a spreadsheet any more than you can bottle it - and if anyone was trying to reduce the whole spectrum of human happiness into one snapshot statistic I would be the first to roll my eyes."" But he said a new measure of national well-being ""could give us a general picture of whether life is improving"" and eventually ""lead to government policy that is more focused not just on the bottom line, but on all those things that make life worthwhile"". He said he wanted Britain to be ""in the vanguard"" of efforts around the world to change the accepted measures of national progress ""rather than following meekly behind"". The Office for National Statistics will lead a debate called the National Wellbeing Project which will seek to establish the key areas that matter most to people's wellbeing. Potential indicators include how people view their own health, levels of education, inequalities in income and the environment. National Statistician Jill Matheson said: ""There is no shortage of numbers that could be used to construct measures of well-being, but they will only be successful if they are widely accepted and understood. ""We want to develop measures based on what people tell us matters most."" She said questions would be added to the ONS household survey from next April - but she wanted the public to help come up with sort of questions that should be asked. The first official measure of the nation's well-being would be published in summer 2012, she added. The UK government is not the first to seek better measures of progress than GDP - the World Bank, European Commission, United Nations, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have all made the same commitment. Trade union Unite attacked the plan as ""another attempt by the coalition to pull the wool over peoples' eyes"". General Secretary elect Len McCluskey said: ""No doubt Cameron will use the index to claim that despite rising unemployment, home repossessions, longer NHS waiting lists and unaffordable education, the people of this country are happier under Tory rule. The reality is a gathering gloom.""

economic indicators,Parenting 'key to life chances',2024-09-15,2010-12-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-11903735,"How parents nurture their children is critical, Mr Field says Instead of increasing benefits for children, ministers should put the money into improving parenting skills, the government's poverty czar has said. In a major report, Labour MP Frank Field says improving the life chances of under fives is the key to cutting social inequality. But spending more on benefits was not always the best way to bridge ""huge class differences"". Labour said ""good intentions"" would mean little if child support was cut. Mr Field said he was urging the government to adopt a new approach in its fight against child poverty, focused on better support for parents of young children to improve their life chances. He told the BBC News Channel income was not the only factor in determining life chances - because some children from poor backgrounds did well, while others failed. ""In some years the government shouldn't be like a Pavlovian dog, jump up and say we are increasing, as we have always done, benefits for children. ""Let's have a debate with us in Parliament and the country - could all, or some, of that money be better spent, not increasing benefits, but in that year going to build up the foundation years."" This video can not be played Frank Field: ""Reading to your child... is one of the decisive things which ranks whether your child is going to fly or founder"" Mr Cameron said Mr Field's report, external was a ""highly valuable"" contribution to the national debate that must take place on the issue. A former Labour minister, who was asked by Tony Blair ""to think the unthinkable"" on welfare reform in 1997, Mr Field has been critical of efforts to reduce inequality in recent years. Mr Field's report concludes that, for many children from disadvantaged backgrounds, by the time they start school ""life's race is by then already effectively over"". New thinking on education, childcare and benefits was needed to ""prevent poor children from becoming poor adults"", Mr Field says. The approach should be to ""change the shape of the distribution of income in this country by eliminating the larger numbers of people who currently leave school to face, at best, a lifetime of low pay and, at worse, unemployment,"" he argues. Mr Field is calling for a new set of indicators to be devised help measure a child's physical, emotional and cognitive development at the age of three and five. These should be published annually by the government and applicable at local levels, he says, so parents can see what progress their children are making and hold local authorities and other providers of early years assistance to account. Allied to this, he is urging reform of the network of Sure Start childrens' centres, of which there are 3,500 in the UK, as part of increased focus on childrens' ""foundation years"". He says future contracts for running the centres should be put out to tender so that voluntary bodies, GPs, schools and housing associations are able to bid for them, and there should be financial incentives to target the most vulnerable and ""hardest to reach"" parents. Mr Field, who has said too many people lack basic parenting abilities, wants all schools to teach parenting and life skills, and says Sure Start has an important role to play in facilitating this.  ""Parents are the key drivers in determining their children's life chances,"" Mr Field adds. ""It is not so much who parents are - what their jobs are - but what parents do. How they nurture their children, the evidence shows, determines a child's life race."" Money spent on increasing child-related benefits every year could be better spent in other ways, Mr Field suggests, such as supporting nursery education and more flexible childcare. Responding to the report, Mr Cameron and his deputy Nick Clegg said they welcomed the idea of life-chance indicators as a way of looking at poverty and lack of opportunity ""in the round"". ""Income is one of a wide range of factors that define and describe poverty,"" they say in a letter to Mr Field. ""We need to look at people's experience of poverty in all its dimensions, and in real life, not merely in narrow statistical terms."" They add: ""As your report makes clear, we also need to focus on people trapped in poverty, sometimes over generations. Poor children are at a high risk of becoming poor adults. This violates any notion of fairness."" Labour said it was willing to consider ""fresh ideas"" as a way of helping the UK meet the last government's goal of abolishing child poverty by 2020. ""I welcome any new thinking that keeps poverty and social mobility on the agenda, especially the important role that parents play,"" Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Douglas Alexander said. ""No amount of good intentions, however, can disguise the fact that George Osborne's cuts to child care support and work incentives will make it harder to reduce poverty."" The TUC said the report understated the financial pressure on families having to live on the breadline. ""We remain a country with an exceptional level of economic inequality that needs significant fundamental structural change and government investment,"" general secretary Brendan Barber said. Imran Hussain, head of policy for Child Poverty Action Group, said: ""There are some good ideas on early years in Frank Field's report, but we must avoid too narrow a focus and retain the broad strategy across income, disability, fair pay, childcare, housing and basic living costs.""

French President Nicolas Sarkozy has said France and Germany will never let the euro fail. He acknowledged concerns about the future of the euro following bail-outs of Greece and the Irish Republic, as he addressed the World Economic Forum. ""Whether it be [German] Chancellor Merkel or myself, never will we turn our backs on the euro. Never will we abandon the euro,"" he said. He added that those who bet against the euro should watch out for their money. ""The euro spells Europe. The euro is Europe and Europe has spelled 60 years of peace on our continent, therefore we will never let the euro go or be destroyed,"" he insisted. France currently holds the presidency of the G20 and Mr Sarkozy was speaking about his vision for the group. He is keen to negotiate a deal on currency reform during his tenure. But his call for a new international monetary system has received a cool response from the US, which sees it as an attempt to undermine the dollar.  The French president said he was not trying to weaken the US currency, adding that France was ""deeply attached"" to its friendship with the US. ""The dollar will continue to be the world's number one currency,"" he said. He also called for the mandate of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be expanded to measure and enforce new rules on global economic imbalances.  He said the G20 should develop a set of indicators to define and measure imbalances on issues including currencies, trade and current accounts. ""I think it's worthwhile rethinking the IMF statutes to make it the organisation in charge of economic, financial and monetary policy co-ordination, and of enforcing the indicators."" French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde echoed these comments in a BBC World TV debate on global leadership. ""We want on the agenda of G20 the topic of global governance,"" she said, saying the roles of bodies like the World Trade Organization, the International Labour Organization and the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization - as well as the IMF - need to be looked at. ""We need to rebalance within those organisations and between the organisations so we can be effective and decisive not just in our speeches but in our actions,"" she said. World Economic Forum"
economic indicators,Economy shrinks more than thought,2024-09-15,2011-02-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12577154,"Bad winter weather is blamed for the bulk of the UK economy's contraction at the end of 2010 The UK economy shrank by more than previously thought during the last three months of 2010, revised figures show. Gross domestic product (GDP) slipped by 0.6% in the period, according to fresh data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Its initial estimate had suggested the economy had contracted by 0.5% - with heavy snow blamed for the slump. However the ONS said that the revision was not a dramatic one. ""It's not that much of a shock, this is a very small revision,"" the organisation's chief economist Joe Grice told BBC News. ""The snow effect we think is still 0.5%. On the basis of that, the economy is still flattish at minus 0.1%. The overall picture is still a flattish underlying economy in the fourth quarter."" The latest US GDP figures for the same period were also released on Friday and also revised down, from growth of 0.8% to 0.7%.  The pound fell slightly after the UK figures were released, to trade at $1.607, down 0.5 of a cent. Against the euro, the pound was unchanged at 1.17 euros.  The ONS statement, external said that production industries, which include manufacturing and mining, had grown slower than previously estimated.  The service sector had also contracted by more than first thought, by 0.7% rather than 0.5%, the ONS said.  But the slump in construction had not been as bad, with the output of the industry declining by 2.5% rather than 3.3%.  GDP figures for a particular quarter are produced first as a so-called ""flash"" estimate, and are later revised at least twice as more detailed information is collated.  Shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, said the latest figures were ""disappointing"". ""Of course, we should always treat one quarter's figures with caution, but it is not cautious for the Treasury to plough on regardless,"" he added, accusing Chancellor George Osborne of ""being complacent now in refusing to accept that his choice to cut too deep and too fast is holding back our economy and putting jobs at risk"". However Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said he expected the economy to recover. ""Of course, as we have said before these figures are disappointing. We have got to deal with the fact that we have inherited an enormous budget deficit - the previous government maxed out the nation's credit card.  ""But we have also got to do what we can to support the economic recovery. The early survey data suggests that the economy is able to bounce back and we are going to continue to do everything we can to support that."" One small business lobby group, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), said the weak figures meant the government should do more to help.  ""We need to see the government use next month's Budget to provide economic stability,"" said FSB chairman John Walker.  ""The government does have tools at hand to help boost the confidence of small firms, such as extending the National Insurance holiday to existing businesses that take on new staff and keeping to its manifesto promise and introducing a fuel duty stabiliser."" This video can not be played Joe Grice, Chief Economist at the ONS: It is 'a very small downward revision' The BBC's economics editor Stephanie Flanders cautioned against reading too much into the revision.  But she added that there was some ""bad news"" in the figures, especially the 2.5% decline in investment, which is considered an indicator of future business activity.  She added that net trade, once again, had made a negative contribution to the recovery - with exports growing 2.3%, but imports up 3%.  ING economist James Knightley said he expected the economy's poor performance to continue. ""The detail shows that government spending was the only positive growth driver. This is fairly worrying given we know about the wave of fiscal austerity that is now starting to hit the UK economy, meaning that we will soon be starting to see negative figures for this component."" Meanwhile Vicky Redwood, an economist at Capital Economics, said figures showing a worsening economics performance may cause a change of heart among those previously in favour of raising rates. ""The slight downward revision might give the more hawkishly inclined members of the MPC reason to pause for thought,"" she said.  Documents released on Wednesday showed three of the Bank of England's policymakers voted for a rate rise at their last meeting, with the remaining six Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members voting to keep rates at historic 0.5% lows. The minutes from the MPC's last meeting stressed that recoveries from recession were rarely smooth, so more weakness would not be unusual.  But it also said growth could pick up in the first quarter if the level of activity returned to normal after the snow, helped along by postponed expenditure. They also indicated that those who had been against a rise in interest rates this month would consider changing their minds if GDP figures for the first three months of 2011 suggested the economy had picked up.

At least three civilians were reportedly killed after police fired on mainly Shia protesters. Officials said three police also died. Troops have taken over a hospital treating the wounded. Officials have imposed a curfew and banned protests. The country's Sunni rulers on Tuesday called in Saudi troops to keep order. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was alarmed by developments in Bahrain.  ""We deplore the use of force against demonstrators, and we deplore the use of force by demonstrators. We want a peaceful resolution,"" she said in an interview with the BBC in Cairo. America's top diplomat stressed that the US had made it clear to officials in Bahrain that ""we think they're on the wrong track"", urging the ""highest levels of the government"" to resume a political dialogue. Bahrain's health minister, himself a Shia, has resigned in protest against the government's use of force, and the BBC's Caroline Hawley in Manama says Shia judges have resigned en masse.  Bahrain - which has a population of 800,000 and is home to the US Navy's Fifth Fleet - is the first Gulf country to be thrown into turmoil by the wave of unrest sweeping the Arab world. Protests there began last month. In other developments: The largest Shia opposition group, Wefaq, has urged followers to avoid confrontation with authorities, and said it had not organised any protests, Reuters news agency reports Senior Bahrain opposition MP Abdul Jalil Khalil, quoted by Reuters, described the crackdown as a ""war of annihilation"" President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, the major Shia power in the region, said the crackdown was unjustifiable and irreparable, and blamed the US The country's stock market said it had closed until further notice. Two of Bahrain's main banks - Standard Chartered and HSBC Holdings - said they had closed all their branches It is not clear whether soldiers from other Gulf states are taking part in the crackdown, but there are indications that the Saudi troops are being kept in reserve. After security forces moved in on Wednesday, plumes of black smoke rose as tents burned in Pearl Square, the centre of the protests.  There was a call for further protests mid-afternoon. But shortly afterwards a military officer announced a 1600 (1300 GMT) - 0400 curfew live on TV, to start just a half hour later, and there were no reports of further demonstrations. The crackdown comes a day after King Hamad Bin Isa al-Khalifa declared a three-month state of emergency. At least two people died in clashes on Tuesday and more than 200 were injured. On Wednesday, protesters had set up barricades in the square but they were no match for the military, our correspondent says.  An eyewitness, Dalal, told the BBC that police were firing rubber bullets at tents in the square, and set fire to cooking oil. ""People began retreating,"" she said. ""When the police saw that we were moving they ran towards us."" The security forces then moved into Manama's financial district, reopening roads which had been blocked by protesters.

The wounded are now reportedly being treated in mosques or at home.

""They are all around Salmaniya medical complex with their guns and they are shooting anybody,"" she said.  Meanwhile a surgeon told the BBC's Bill Law that he had been called to a private hospital to operate on a man with gunshot wounds but was forced to turn back. He said government claims that protesters were not being denied treatment were false. ""I am terrified,"" he added. ""This is a genocide directed against the Shia."" Human rights groups said live rounds had been used in some parts of the city. There are reports of dozens injured but our correspondent says it is difficult to get any sense of casualty numbers. Seven people had been killed during a month of protests prior to Tuesday's clashes.  The Shia majority complain of economic hardship, lack of political freedom and discrimination in jobs in favour of Sunnis. The king has reshuffled his cabinet but has not replaced the prime minister of more than 40 years, Sheikh Khalifah ibn Salman al-Khalifah.  The protesters were inspired by the recent uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, whose long-serving presidents were forced from power after weeks of demonstrations."
economic indicators,'Worrying' picture for UK economy,2024-09-15,2011-04-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12962862,"Manufacturers say they are under pressure to raise prices The UK faces a fragile economic recovery, with a worrying overall picture, according to the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). The BCC's latest quarterly survey said firms faced cashflow constraints. However, the survey also suggested that the economy returned to growth in the first three months of the year. Separate data suggested the UK services sector grew in March at its fastest pace in more than a year, providing further evidence of economic recovery. The Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 57.1, a ""marked improvement"" on the 52.6 recorded in February. Markit and the Chartered Institute of Personnel Managers, which compile the index, said employment had risen for the first time in nine months, while sales and new business enquiries had also increased. Together with more positive recent data from the manufacturing sector, Markit's senior economist Paul Smith said the latest PMI services data suggested economic growth of 0.8% in the first quarter of this year. The BCC was slightly less optimistic in its forecast for the quarter. ""The upturn in Q1 is likely to have been only slightly larger than the decline of 0.5% seen in Q4 2010"", when the severe weather caused disruptions, it said. That would mean output levels were only ""marginally higher"" than they were before the weather took its toll, it added. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) will release its first estimate of GDP for the first quarter on 27 April. The BCC, which questioned 6,000 businesses across the UK, said firms were being constrained by cashflow and price pressures. Some 80% of manufacturing firms said the cost of raw materials was putting pressure on them to raise prices. While exporting activity remained strong, there had been declines in confidence and domestic demand, with cashflow remaining a ""real concern for businesses,"" the group said. This video can not be played Watch: David Kern, British Chambers of Commerce, says 'don't squeeze this fragile upturn' Inflation was the primary concern for UK businesses, the BCC's chief economist, David Kern, told the BBC. However, he said the government had no choice but to go ahead with its planned spending cuts. ""The austerity plan has to be implemented, while it is important to pursue the growth strategies outlined in the Budget,"" he said. He stressed that the Bank of England must not raise interest rates in the coming months, as this would ""squeeze the fragile [economic] upturn"". ""It is incumbent on the Monetary Policy Committee not to raise rates,"" he said. To do so prematurely would be a ""massive mistake,"" he argued. BCC"
economic indicators,UK jobless total falls to 2.46m,2024-09-15,2011-05-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13436252,"This video can not be played Watch: Chris Grayling says drop in unemployment levels is 'step in the right direction' UK unemployment fell by 36,000 in the three months to the end of March to 2.46 million, the second quarterly drop in a row, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of unemployment in the UK was now 7.7%. Unemployment among 16 to 24-year-olds stood at 935,000, with the jobless rate for young people now at 20%. The number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance rose by 12,400 in April to 1.47 million, the ONS said. It added that the number of people in employment rose by 118,000 to 29.24 million, compared with a pre-recession peak of 29.56 million recorded in the three months to the end of May 2008. Some observers said the rise in employment was a sign the economic recovery was strengthening. ""The strong growth in full-time jobs is especially encouraging, as this is one of the key indicators of a sustainable recovery,"" said Ian Brinkley at the Work Foundation. ""It now looks likely that the economy expanded more strongly than last month's provisional estimates for output growth suggested,"" he added. Official figures showed that the UK economy grew by 0.5% in the first three months of the year. The latest ONS figures show that the number of unemployed men fell by 31,000 to 1.43 million, while the number of unemployed women fell by 5,000 to 1.03 million. But of the 12,400 extra people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance, 9,300 were women, the highest figure since October 1996. The number of male claimants rose for the first time since January. The number of people unemployed for more than 12 months increased by 20,000 to 850,000, the highest number since January 1997. Within the overall unemployment figures there were wide regional variations, with unemployment rising 6,000 by in London and by 4,000 in the North East. The South East, however, saw unemployment fall by 17,000. In Wales, the jobless number fell by 10,000, it Scotland it dropped by 8,000 and in Northern Ireland it declined by 6,000. Average earnings, including bonuses, rose by 2.3% in the the three months to March, compared with 2.1% for the quarter to February. Despite the rise, analysts said the figure showed that wage demands were unlikely to affect inflation in the short term. ""Wage pressures have remained modest, reinforcing the case against an early increase in interest rates,"" said David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce. The ONS also said that the number of working days lost through labour disputes in the year to March was the joint lowest total since records began in 1930. Employment Minister Chris Grayling said the figures represented a ""step in the right direction"", but he warned that the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance was likely to continue to rise. He said this was in part due to changes in benefits rules, which meant people were moving off other benefits and on to Jobseeker's Allowance. Some single parents, for example, were moving off income support and on to unemployment benefits, he said. John Philpott, chief economic adviser to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said this was a reasonable explanation. ""The labour market is not deteriorating enough [to explain the rise in claimants],"" he told the BBC. Shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said the government had to do more to get people back to work and questioned why unemployment was falling ""much faster"" in other developed economies, particularly Germany and the US. The government must ""stop dithering and start delivering"", he said. Some analysts warned that despite the fall in unemployment, the number of people out of work was likely to rise again in the coming months, largely due to government spending cuts. ""We suspect that likely below-trend growth will mean that the private sector will be unable to fully compensate for the increasing job losses in the public sector that will result from the fiscal squeeze that is now really kicking in,"" said Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight. He said he expected 2.67 million people to be out of work by the end of this year, with the unemployment rate rising to 8.4%. The British Chambers of Commerce said the government must do more to help the private sector make up for the jobs being lost in the public sector.  ""The burden of regulation on businesses, particularly small- and medium-sized firms still weighs too heavily and in many cases prevents companies from creating jobs,"" Mr Kern said. The government has started implementing extensive spending cuts that are designed to reduce the budget deficit, which is the amount it spends each year over and above its income. It says that the cuts are necessary to restore international investors' confidence in the UK economy, but critics argue that the cuts could jeopardise the UK's fragile recovery. ONS"
economic indicators,"Hard times ahead, economist warns",2024-09-15,2011-05-27,Hugh Pym,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13578420,"This video can not be played Spencer Dale: ""The next year or two will be a relatively bleak time, we have relatively hard times ahead"" The Bank of England's chief economist has told the BBC there are ""relatively hard times ahead"".   Spencer Dale said the possibilities of growth remaining feeble and inflation high were ""very significant risks"". Mr Dale, who sits on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), has voted for interest rates to rise in recent months. Mr Dale was on a two-and-a-half day visit to the Scottish Borders and Edinburgh.   He visited a textile factory and a timber processing plant, as well as speaking at meetings of the CBI and Chambers of Commerce.   It was part of the MPC's regular programme of trips around the UK to gauge the state of the economy.  During the visit, he took time out to speak to the BBC. I first asked Mr Dale about why he had voted at four successive meetings for a 0.25% increase in the Bank's official interest rate.    He has been in a minority on the committee, with the decisions coming down in favour of holding rates at the record low of 0.5%. He acknowledged that economic growth was subdued.   ""I am not confident about the strength of the recovery, particularly in terms of the weakness we see in the household sector and the implications that may have for consumption,"" he said. But the Bank's top economist added: ""I am even more worried about inflation and the risk that we may see price pressures from the rest of the world continue to push up and the high levels of inflation we have seen in the UK persist for longer than we otherwise expect."" So should households expect an increase in the cost of borrowing sometime this year? ""I think the level of interest rates at the moment is at an extraordinary low level - the Bank rate is at the lowest level it's ever been,"" he said. ""At some point, I do expect interest rates to rise, but how quickly and how much, I really can't say."" Mr Dale made it clear that he was open-minded and could change his vote at future meetings of the MPC. ""I could change my view at any point in either direction - that's the only way you can behave as a policymaker,"" he told me. ""You have got to approach this job with a big dose of pragmatism and humility. We don't know precisely what's going on in the economy at the moment and we know even less about how the economy is going to evolve going forward. ""So all you can do I think is remain open-minded, keep challenging yourself and then vote in terms of the interest rate you think is most appropriate to get inflation back down to target."" Households are facing an intense squeeze with average pay rises about half the annual rate of inflation.  Mr Dale argued that this was part of the rebalancing of the economy away from consumption and borrowing towards investment and export growth.   He pointed out that monetary policy could not offset this process.  But he added: ""I understand exactly the pain that many households are feeling and have huge sympathy for them."" I asked him whether there was light at the end of the tunnel with some indicators still looking bleak. ""I think the next year or two will be a relatively bleak time. I think we have relatively hard times ahead,"" he replied.  ""But I think we are starting towards a path of sustainable recovery.  ""The lower level of sterling should help to support this rebalancing of the economy and, moreover, I do expect inflation to start to fall in a year or two's time and that will also help to reduce some of the pressures."" But is he worried about growth remaining pretty weak? ""I am worried about growth remaining feeble and I am also worried about inflation remaining high - and if you like that's the dilemma facing the MPC at the moment - trying to balance these two very significant risks."" Mr Dale left the impression that the Bank of England was well aware of the conflicting pressures in the economy and that there would be challenging times ahead as policymakers decided when to make the first move on interest rates.

economic indicators,Greek MPs begin confidence vote,2024-09-15,2011-06-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13850580,"Greece's parliament has begun voting on a motion of confidence in the government, part of the administration's battle to win support for new austerity measures. The vote is a first step towards a vital 12bn euro ($17bn; £10bn) loan from the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Greece needs the loan to pay its debts. If the government survives, Greece's parliament will be asked to back the latest spending cuts - of 28bn euros. This vote will be held on 28 June. A result is expected after 0035 local time (2235 GMT). All the indications are that Mr Papandreou will win his vote of confidence with a handful of seats to spare, says the BBC's Malcolm Brabant in Athens.  But one former rebel MP who now plans to vote in favour of the government said the public's tolerance had been used up.  Panagiotis Kouroumplis also warned that politicians were increasingly losing touch with ordinary people demonstrating against the government across the country. Thousands of protesters have again gathered in Syntagma Square in Athens, in front of the Greek parliament.  One protester, Calliope Iris, told the BBC: ""The Greek police treat us like criminals. I used to have my own company and had to close it down at the beginning of 2010. The economic climate is forbidding anything new.  ""I will continue to go back to Syntagma Square to protest."" EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has said Greece faces a ""moment of truth"" when it votes next week on austerity measures.  This video can not be played BBC's Gavin Hewitt: ""Thousands of protesters are heading for the Greek parliament"" The EU and IMF will only release funds once the austerity measures have been voted through.  ""No-one can be helped against their will,"" Mr Barroso said in Brussels. ""Next week is the moment of truth, where Greece needs to demonstrate that it is genuinely committed to the ambitious package of further fiscal measures and privatisations put forward by Prime Minister [George] Papandreou's government."" Tuesday's vote of confidence in the government follows the appointment of the new Greek cabinet, which Prime Minister Papandreou put in place last Friday. Mr Papandreou hopes the new cabinet, and specifically the new Finance Minister, Evangelos Venizelos, will help secure parliament's backing for further austerity measures that are already proving deeply unpopular with the Greek people. At the weekend, eurozone finance ministers decided to postpone their decision on whether to grant Greece the 12bn euro loan until the country introduced the additional spending cuts and privatisation programmes. Greece needs this aid - the latest tranche of the EU and IMF's 110bn-euro aid package - by July to be able to keep up with payments to the creditors of its huge debts, which amount to 30,000 euros per person. If the Greek parliament does back the austerity measures, eurozone finance ministers will meet again on 3 July, with the funds expected to be released by the middle of next month. However, lawmakers are having to ponder their decision in the face of mass demonstrations, strikes, and even riots. The latest protest against the cutbacks involves workers at Greece's state-owned electricity company, who are on a 48-hour walkout. BBC Europe editor Gavin Hewitt, who is in Athens, says ministers have argued that without further austerity measures in exchange for a new bail-out, Greece is heading for bankruptcy. However, many Greeks appear to prefer that option to further austerity, he says. Mr Venizelos said the decision of the eurozone finance ministers to delay the loan showed that urgent action was now needed. ""We have plenty to do,"" he said. If Greece were to default on its debt - worth 150% of its annual GDP output - it would have to leave the 17-member euro group of nations. UK Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said the bailout would not help the people of Greece: ""This is not assistance for Greece, it's not how anyone there sees it. They understand perfectly well what the bail-out means, which is that the money will go to European bankers and bondholders, but the repayment will come from Greek taxpayers. So far from being helped, Greece is being sacrificed to save the euro."" IMF mission On 20 June, EU finance ministers agreed in principle on a second bail-out package for Greece, about the same size as the first - 110bn euros - passed last May.  The new package, to be outlined by July, will include loans from other eurozone countries. It is also expected to feature a voluntary contribution from private investors, who will be invited to buy up new Greek bonds as old ones mature. Officials said this money had to be freely given, or it would be seen as technical default on Greece's debt repayments. If Greece were to default - or seen to be in default - it would mean massive losses for European banks that hold Greek debt, including the European Central Bank. Officials said the new plan was expected to fund Greece into late 2014 and total about 120bn euros."

Australia has long struggled with its competing allegiances There is the historical, sentimental and constitutional attachment to Britain. There is the defence and strategic alliance with America. Then there is the commercial rapport with China, which has recently overtaken Japan as the country's major trading partner.  And we haven't even mentioned New Zealand, Australia's second largest source of immigrants and its long-time Anzac soul-mate. As part of the Power of Asia season on the BBC, we've been asking where the country's future lies. This video can not be played How does Australia feel about its increasingly Asian future?  From an economic perspective, the answer, obviously, is Asia. For even if China's growth slows, India, Vietnam, Japan and Indonesia will provide an expanding market for Australia's resources, like iron ore, coal and natural gas. The rise of Asia helps explain why average incomes here have doubled over the past two decades and why the country has managed to avoid recession during that entire period.  No wonder then that Colin Barnett, the premier of resource-rich Western Australia, says he spends more time in China than in Canberra.  Kevin Rudd advocated an Asian community during his time in office No wonder that former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (who speaks Mandarin) tried to institutionalise Australia's diplomatic influence in the region through the creation of an Asia-Pacific modelled on the EU. If you look at the demographics of Australia, most of the population still has British or Irish ancestry. But it is becoming increasing Asian - almost 10% of the Australian population is now of Asian descent, and the number of Chinese-born Australians has increased six-fold over the past two decades. This process that will no doubt accelerate as the Indo-Pacific century unfolds.  The former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating devoted more energy than any of his predecessors to reorientate his country towards Asia. He once said that if Australia could not succeed in Asia, it could not succeed anywhere. Since then, in a narrow commercial sense, it has done rather nicely.  But how does Australia feel about its increasingly Asian future? Uneasy is one answer. Indifferent is another. One indicator is the take-up of Asian languages in Australian schools, which was a central part of Paul Keating's push to make his country more Asia-literate. While Japanese remains the most taught language in Australian schools, and Mandarin Chinese has become more popular, the teaching of other Asian languages is in decline. Michael Wesley, of foreign policy think-tank the Lowy Institute, has just written an excellent book called There Goes the Neighbourhood: Australia and the Rise of Asia. Its basic argument is that Australia has become a lot more insular at a time when it should be projecting its pan-Asian influence. In an argument which offers an up-to-date take on Donald Horne's The Lucky Country, Mr Wesley suggests that much of this is borne of national complacency.  He writes: ""We've been incredibly successful without really even trying to understand the region. And the very logical conclusion that people can draw from that is that we really don't have to try that hard to succeed in Asia. But I think that's a very mistaken view to have."" Michael Wesley has some fascinating insights into how Australians approach, say, travel in Asia compared with travel in Europe and America. The tendency in Asia, in places like Bali and Thailand, is to spend a week or so luxuriating on a beach, without devoting much time to finding out about the local cultures (here, I plead guilty). Travel in Europe, on the other hand, is a much more educational and richer experience. That is symptomatic, he suggests, of a wider malaise. ""We've never really made the emotional or the cultural leap [away from] placing Europe and America at the centre of our consciousness. That's what makes it hard for those advocating greater cultural awareness."" Often this kind of debate presents Australians with a false choice: that they somehow have to choose between their history, their security and their prosperity. Australia's great post-war success, it could be argued, has been the extent to which it has balanced its relations with Britain, America and most recently Japan, China and other Asian neighbours.  But should Asia become a much bigger part of that mix? Or is that process inexorable?"
economic indicators,Would a new Irish government lift lockdown faster?,2024-09-15,2020-06-04,By Shane Harrison,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52902203,"Hotels in the Republic of Ireland are currently due to reopen on 20 July, the same day as those in Northern Ireland, but hotel bars will remain closed. Reopening hotels, subject to social distancing rules, is part of phase four of the Irish government's five-stage plan to relax Covid-19 restrictions. The plan was announced on 1 May. It says hotels can reopen ""initially on a limited occupancy basis (or number of people per square metre), and then increasing over time"". Restaurants and cafes in the Republic of Ireland are currently due to reopen on 29 June as part of phase three of the recovery plan but ""must comply with social distancing and strict cleaning protocols"". This has led to a campaign from publicans whose premises also serve food to allow them to reopen ahead of their current schedule of 10 August in phase five. If pubs open their doors again, so too would hotel bars. So as things stand, while hotel restaurants are set to open on 20 July, their bars will only be allowed to open on 10 August. The Republic of Ireland held a general election in early February but the coronavirus outbreak took hold before a new government could be formed. The current caretaker government has made it clear that its five-stage plan is not fixed in stone and may be brought forward or reversed, depending on the spread of the coronavirus. As the talks on forming a new government -  involving Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Greens and some Independents - near conclusion, there have been a number of straws in the wind that suggest a new coalition government might accelerate the relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions. Fianna Fáil leader Mícheál Martin, who is expected to be the next taoiseach (Irish prime minister) if there is an agreement, has indicated his reservations about many of the measures in the current government's Covid-19 recovery plan. In the Dáil (Irish parliament) last week, he said there was ""no remaining serious justification"" for the current 5km (3-mile) travel restriction, except for essential journeys. This is soon to be increased to 20km as part of phase two of the recovery plan, but Mr Martin said he could see no ""scientific basis"" for the restriction. He also described as ""arbitrary"" some of the timings as to when different types of retail outlets and shops can reopen. The Fianna Fáil leader also addressed the current two-metre social distancing rule at a time when many businesses would like to see it reduced to one metre. ""It has been acknowledged it is not required by the science; it has been helpful but it cannot be allowed to block Ireland restarting activity which is already underway elsewhere without a negative impact,"" he said. A new government with a comfortable Dáil majority would probably feel more relaxed about easing the lockdown measures at an accelerated pace, especially given the economic concerns about the impact of Covid-19. And any such relaxation would inevitably have consequences for Northern Ireland."
economic indicators,Petrol prices in record monthly rise,2024-09-15,2018-06-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44361016,"Petrol prices rose by 6p a litre in May - the biggest monthly increase since the RAC began tracking prices 18 years ago. Average petrol prices hit 129.4p a litre, while average diesel prices also rose by 6p to 132.3p a litre. The RAC said a ""punitive combination"" of higher crude oil prices and a weaker pound was to blame for the increases. It pointed out that oil prices broke through the $80-a-barrel mark twice in May - a three-and-a-half year high. As well as the higher global market price of crude, the pound's current weakness against the US dollar also makes petrol more expensive as oil is traded in dollars. The RAC said the average prices of both petrol and diesel had risen every single day since 22 April, adding 8p a litre in the process. The motoring body said this was the longest sustained price increase since March 2015. By Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor Reports of the death of inflation may have been premature. Today's figures on the price of filling up the family car reveal that upward pressure on prices is still very much with us. The re-imposition of US sanctions on Iran - the world's fifth largest oil producer - saw the oil price rise by 3% in May. At the same time, sterling weakened by 2%, making oil imports (priced in dollars) more expensive. For consumers other prices are also rising - higher energy bills, for example, have just started biting. And the sugar tax will add to the cost of many soft drinks. Two economic indicators tend to weigh on the confidence of many consumers. The price of fuel and the price of housing. The first is going up and the second is coming down. Which will raise a few alarm bells, not just among economists, but among politicians as well. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams described May as ""a hellish month for motorists"". ""The rising oil price together with a weaker pound is a punitive combination for anyone who drives regularly,"" he said.  ""For many people, there is little alternative to the car for the majority of journeys they have to make, so it is therefore very difficult to avoid feeling the pinch of rising pump prices."" Mr Williams said that the oil price had since cooled a little, suggesting that the constant increases in the cost of petrol might have stopped for the time being.

economic indicators,Opposition candidate elected S Korea president,2024-09-15,2022-03-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60685141,"South Korea has chosen a conservative opposition candidate, Yoon Suk-yeol, as the country's next president following a tightly-contested race. Mr Yoon, a political novice, edged out a victory over the Democratic Party's Lee Jae-myung based on promises to tackle class inequality. He called his win a ""victory of the great South Korean people"". But the result was one of the closest in history - with the final count separated by less than 1%. Early on Thursday morning, Mr Yoon told supporters at his victory ceremony he would ""pay attention to people's livelihoods, provide warm welfare services to the needy, and make utmost efforts so that our country serves as a proud, responsible member of the international community and the free world"".  Both presidential candidates were viewed as widely unpopular throughout the campaign. Analysts said voters appeared so disenchanted by the frontrunners that local media dubbed the vote ""election of the unfavourables"". Still, Wednesday's election saw a high turn out, with 77% of eligible voters casting a ballot. Top of voters' concerns were skyrocketing house prices, stagnant economic growth, stubborn youth unemployment and gender inequality.  Mr Yoon had also made abolishing the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family a central pledge of his campaign.  The ministry largely provides family-based services, education, and social welfare for children and spends around 0.2% of the nation's annual budget - less than 3% of which goes towards the promotion of equality for women.  During his campaign Mr Yoon had also leant heavily into a support base of young men, some of whom declared that there was no systemic gender discrimination in South Korea. Demographic breakdowns of the vote showed that many had voted for the third female candidate Sim Sang-jung who'd advocated for gender equality, the BBC's Laura Bicker reports. In the foreign policy space, Yoon has promised a tougher ""reset"" on relations with China and North Korea and indications of closer ties with the US. The White House has already sent its congratulations to Mr Yoon, saying US President Joe Biden is looking forward to further expanding the two countries ties Yoon will become president but with a Democratic Party-majority in the single-house National Assembly. The incumbent Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party had to step down due to constitutional five-year limits of the presidential term. South Korea is about to usher in a new era as a conservative has won the battle to be president. But only just. Yoon Suk-yeol's victory over his liberal rival Lee Jae-myung is far from decisive. He has won the presidency by less than one per cent - a sign of just how bitterly divided politics in the world's tenth largest economy has become. Mr Yoon only entered politics last year and rose to prominence for successfully prosecuting the former conservative president Park Geun-hye on bribery and corruption charges.  The political novice has been compared to the former United States president Donald Trump and has been prone to gaffes throughout the campaign.  He had to walk back a comment that the authoritarian president Chun Doo-hwan, who was responsible for massacring protestors in 1980, was ""good at politics"". He has pledged to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and has blamed the rise of feminism for the low birth rate in a country which has one of the worst records on women's rights in the developed world. He is more hawkish on foreign policy than the current liberal leader Moon Jae-in.  He has said he will aim to develop technology to carry out a pre-emptive strike on North Korea if Pyongyang looks to attack Seoul and he supports sanctions on Kim Jong-un's regime which will bring him more in line with the policies of South Korea's main ally, the United States.  He wants to be tougher on China and proposed that South Korea should co-operate more fully with the Quad security alliance between the US, Australia, India and Japan, an informal grouping created to counter Beijing's growing influence in the region. But he stopped short of saying Seoul should join the alliance. His views on foreign policy are a decisive shift from his predecessor who favoured engagement with Pyongyang and largely avoided taking a stance that would inflame China, the country's largest trading partner."
economic indicators,Coronavirus spread hits Chinese manufacturing,2024-09-15,2020-02-29,By Katie Prescott ,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51689178,"Factory activity in China fell at a record rate in February, as manufacturers closed their operations to contain the spread of coronavirus. The country's official measure of manufacturing activity - the Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) - dropped to 35.7 from 50 in January. It shows the virus is having a bigger impact than the financial crisis that shook the world last decade. The data also suggests that factories are struggling to find enough workers. PMI figures - calculated with data from monthly surveys of private sector companies - are a key indicator of a county's economic health, and can move financial markets. China makes up a third of world manufacturing and is the world's largest exporter, so this PMI drop - well below analysts' expectations - will have a knock-on effect on other countries. Restrictions in place in the so-called ""factory of the world"" have also affected companies such as Apple, Diageo, Jaguar Land Rover and Volkswagen, which rely on China's production and consumer market. The big question now is how quickly factories can return to normal. Many are dependent on China's 300 million migrant workers, a third of whom are still not working because of quarantine rules. According to Bloomberg Economics, Chinese factories were operating at 60% to 70% of capacity this week.  It is expected that China's economic growth will take a significant hit in the first half of this year because of the impact coronavirus has had on business and spending in the country.  Stock markets around the world fell dramatically this week after a surge in the number of companies warning about the impact of the outbreak on firms. There was one silver lining to the fall in Chinese output though: Nasa said pollution monitoring satellites had detected significant decreases in nitrogen dioxide over the country, which evidence suggests is ""at least partly"" related to the economic slowdown caused by the outbreak."
economic indicators,End of Covid rules 'kick-started' economic recovery,2024-09-15,2021-10-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-58903511,"The end of Covid-19 restrictions in August kick-started Scotland's economic recovery, a new report has found. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) quarterly economic indicator report found an increase in confidence across all sectors in the third quarter of this year. However, it also found businesses were still worried about inflation, tax and the energy crisis driving up costs. Tim Allan, president of the SCC, said progress was still ""under threat"". He said: ""The survey results indicate that confidence and domestic sales are generally strong across all sectors surveyed, with expectations in line with improving economic forecasts that the Scottish economy should return to pre-pandemic levels in the spring of 2022. ""However, that progress is under significant threat with increasing concern over the emerging energy crisis driving up business costs, inflation and taxation, the cost of raw materials and shipping, all of which are fuelling uncertainty at a time when businesses urgently need confidence and certainty to continue their recovery from the pandemic."" According to the report, businesses are also worried about labour shortages, with all sectors reporting difficulties in recruiting staff during the third quarter. Mr Allan said if Scottish businesses cannot get the staff they need, they risk ""falling dangerously behind"" the curve on recovery and growth. He called on the Scottish and UK governments to ""urgently"" back businesses with a clear economic plan and budgets focused on business recovery. He added: ""It is business which is driving the rapid return to economic growth and governments must stop adding upfront business costs and instead focus on supercharging recovery by creating the right environment for businesses to trade, invest and grow."" Mairi Spowage, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute which is in partnership with the SCC, said the research signalled ""an important boost in optimism across the Scottish economy"". However, she added the end of furlough and the universal credit £20-a-week uplift could have a negative impact on top of emerging labour shortages. Last month an HGV driver shortage led to problems for various industries from supermarkets to fast food chains. Many petrol stations also ran out of fuel which prompted widespread panic buying. The UK government introduced temporary working visas to tackle the problem, but Scottish External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson said the measure would not help all UK sectors. Ms Spowage said: ""It is unknown how many of the workers who were on furlough at the end of September will become unemployed or unable to secure the type and level of work they want. ""This uncertainty coincides with the cancellation of the universal credit uplift which will bring additional financial hardship to around half-a-million families in Scotland. ""As well as the risk of joblessness, labour shortages are becoming clear in many sectors, threatening goods shortages and adding to wider inflationary risks."""
economic indicators,Confidence in private sector rises,2024-09-15,2020-02-10,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-51420210,"Confidence in the private sector in January rose to its highest level in 21 months, according to an Ulster Bank survey. It is credited to the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive. While activity in the private sector continued to slow down last month, the rate at which it slowed down has eased. It found business confidence was the highest since April 2018 and suggested that the re-establishment of Stormont was the main reason for optimism. The construction sector is the most optimistic about the year ahead since March 2017. Every month the bank surveys firms from across the private sector about issues like staffing levels, new orders and exports in what is considered a reliable indicator of economic activity. ""Clearly the decisive general election result and the passing of the Withdrawal Bill in Parliament provided a much-needed boost to business confidence,"" said chief economist Richard Ramsey. ""Unfortunately, Northern Ireland wasn't one of the nine UK regions to record business activity growth last month. However, the rate of decline did ease."" He added: ""The resurrection of Stormont has clearly provided a boost to business sentiment, and indeed all sectors now expect growth in business activity in a year's time.  ""What is of course key though is the extent to which this increasing business confidence translates into rising business activity."" Mr Ramsey said: ""Brexit uncertainty continues to be cited as the main factor behind the decline in new business from abroad.  ""This issue is likely to remain until at least there is clarity on what the future trading agreement with the EU will be."""

economic indicators,Wales unemployment rate sees biggest rise in UK,2024-09-15,2023-05-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-65610675,"Wales has seen the largest year-on-year increase in unemployment in the UK, new figures suggest. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that unemployment rose to 4.6% in Wales for January to March. But the ONS has urged caution, and said it is too early to tell whether this fluctuation is down to the way it collects data or the start of a ""significant increasing trend"". The Welsh government said it is focused on reducing economic inactivity.  The figures for Wales represent a jump of 1.1% from October to December 2022, and an increase of 1.6% since the same January to March period last year.  These figures are estimates, and could be changed at a later date. But if they are correct, this is the first time in five months that unemployment has been higher in Wales than the UK average.  Within the 4.6% is anyone in Wales aged 16 and over, looking or able to work.  The employment rate in Wales has also dropped to 71.5% from January to March this year - a decrease of 2.6% compared to the same period in 2022.  Economic inactivity in Wales, which refers to people of working age who are not in employment or seeking work, remains the second highest of the UK nations and regions at 24.9%.  While this figure is a decrease of 0.5% from October to December 2022, it has jumped up 1.4% from January to March 2022.  The main cause of economic inactivity is long-term sickness and disability. There are currently 159,000 people long-term sick in Wales, the most in almost 17 years and accounting for 34% of all economic inactivity.  Finally, Wales has the third highest rate of those seeking work among UK regions.  Only the West Midlands and London are higher, at 5.1% and 4.7% respectively.  It's important not to over-interpret what is just a single snapshot of the first three months of this year.  Any statistician will tell you that looking at trends - successive measures over a period of time - give a more reliable picture of what you're measuring than looking at a single set of figures. Right now it's too soon to tell whether this apparent big increase in the unemployment rate for Wales is a statistical blip or a genuine problem. Especially when you consider that for the last five months the Wales jobless rate has been lower than the UK average. It's also worth bearing in mind that it's just one indicator among many of the health of the economy. Another important one is economic inactivity and that trend remains stubbornly high in Wales - nearly 25% of the working age population is neither in work or looking for it. That is a big problem for the Welsh economy and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.  Responding to the figures, Welsh Conservatives economy spokesperson, Paul Davies MS, said: ""While there are pressures UK-wide, the data is clear. Wales is falling behind and continually decreasing no matter the UK picture. ""The Labour government hold the economic levers in Wales and have consistently failed to manage the high rate of economic inactivity here for the last 25 years. ""Successive Labour ministers have been distracted with vanity projects, like expanding the size of the Senedd. They should be focussed on delivering high-paying jobs for the people of Wales not more high-paying jobs for politicians."" A Welsh government spokesperson said it was committed to creating equality and prosperity in Wales, and was supporting businesses ""to create more quality jobs, be more flexible and provide better-paid opportunities for workers"". They added: ""Our focus remains on reducing economic inactivity. Our economic mission confirms the levers we do have to narrow the skills divide, support better jobs and in turn tackle poverty.  ""Our plan for employability and skills prioritises people most in need of help. This includes supporting people to stay in work and those further away from the labour market to find employment."""
economic indicators,Investors bet on prisoner rehab,2024-09-15,2010-09-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-11254308,"Justice Secretary Ken Clarke has embraced the scheme A ""payment-by-results"" pilot project aimed at cutting reoffending has officially been launched. Investors have put £5m in social impact bonds to fund rehabilitation work with 3,000 Peterborough Prison inmates. They could earn a return of up to £8m from the government and the Big Lottery Fund if their cash helps rehabilitate criminals. Labour gave the groundbreaking scheme the go-ahead but new Justice Secretary Ken Clarke has fully embraced it. The government has said the pilot is the first project of its kind in the world. This video can not be played Toby Eccles from Social Finance explains how the scheme will work Mr Clarke has indicated the scheme, which may also cut court and jail costs, might be introduced in other prisons in England and Wales if it is successful. The social impact bond scheme is jointly run by the Ministry of Justice and Social Finance, an ethical investment bank run by a former top City banker.  The money raised by Social Finance from charitable trusts and social investment groups will fund organisations including the St Giles Trust, a specialist charity with a proven record in rehabilitating offenders.  Earlier this year the trust published an economic evaluation of its Through the Gates rehabilitation programme, external which suggested that the government saved £10 for every £1 invested in such schemes. The Peterborough prisoners will be given mentors when they are released and they will be given assistance to find jobs and housing and wean themselves off drugs if they need to. If the money helps cut reoffending, this scheme could return up to £8m to investors, comparable with an annual return of 7.5% in a conventional bond-market investment.  Reoffending among the target group must fall by at least 7.5% to trigger the dividend payments in each of the six years of the bond's operation.  The return on social impact bonds is seen as a share of the financial benefit gained by society when a criminal goes straight.  But as with other finance bonds, there is no guarantee of a return and investors could lose all their money if reoffending does not fall. Male prisoners sentenced to less than a year at Peterborough Prison will take part in the scheme.  Although the official launch was on Friday, the scheme began on 16 August - with the first prisoners to go through it leaving the facility on Thursday. Mr Clarke said that reoffending was the ""weakest bit of the criminal justice system"" and that the radical bonds would help tackle it without using taxpayers' money.  ""It pays by results,"" said Mr Clarke. ""We're going to pay what works and what works should therefore grow and what doesn't work will vanish. ""I like the innovative funding, the payment by results, the collaborative groups, and if it succeeds it will grow and if it doesn't, by that time we will be trying something else. ""But sooner or later, something has got to be done about reoffending."" Social Finance said there would be indications of whether the project was succeeding within a year but the full return would not be known until the end of the six-year investment term.  Social Finance director Emily Bolton said: ""Investors benefit and the government gets some cost savings. The better the reductions in reoffending, the higher the investors' return. ""It's not taking money out of the system, in fact it's enabling us to transfer the money to more socially valuable things."" Barrow Cadbury Trust chief executive Sara Llewellin said she was delighted the charitable foundation was among the first batch of investors. ""For us this is a win-win; we can invest rather than just give a grant.  If the intervention is successful, we can then invest any money gained in more socially useful projects,"" she said. Rob Owen, the chief executive of St Giles Trust said the scheme provided a ""rehabilitation revolution"" and he was pleased six caseworkers from the charity had been involved from the outset. ""It is about engaging the offenders while they're in prison and assessing their needs and helping to deal with them. They are literally met by one of our caseworkers as soon as they leave the prison and we give them the guidance we can. ""Most of these men will be in prison for just 30-35 days before they're on release - for us it's an intense period but we have to tailor our approach. One size does not fit all in these cases."" This video can not be played Jack Straw, Shadow Justice Secretary: ""I hope it will be extended"" Paddy Scriven, general secretary of the Prison Governors Association, said the scheme was a postive step foward but must not exclude the most persistent offenders. She said: ""The thing that has to be guarded against is that if this sort of scheme spreads and it is payment by results, that the not-for-profit sector people and charities that are administering it don't cherry-pick the most likely successes and leave the very hardline cases to the Prison Service, or more importantly the Probation Service. Then the success is measured unevenly."" Labour MP Jack Straw, who first announced the scheme in March while justice secretary, told the BBC the project involved an element of risk, but added: ""If you look at the difference between costs between turning someone round in probation rather than in prison, the benefits will flow back to the state rather quickly."" Jon Collins of the Criminal Justice Alliance, a reform campaign group, said the project could have the potential to help thousands and added: ""Bringing money in from new investors to fund this work will also ensure that it is able to continue at a time when the Ministry of Justice's budget is facing severe cuts.""

economic indicators,People buy less food at supermarkets as prices rise,2024-09-15,2022-06-24,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61920559,"Households are cutting back on food shopping as the rising cost of living bites into budgets. Nearly half of adults surveyed by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they had bought less food in the past fortnight due to higher prices. The price of food was also the most common reason for why those asked were seeing their monthly outgoings rising overall, the ONS said. Supermarkets Asda and Tesco have said customers are cutting back on shopping. Asda told the BBC that some shoppers are asking cashiers to stop scanning items when the till total hits £30 as they try to cut costs and also switching to budget ranges. Meanwhile, Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket, has said it is seeing early signs that shoppers are changing their habits due to high inflation - the rate at which prices rise - such as buying less food and visiting more frequently. The ONS said its feedback from supermarkets also suggested customers were spending less on their food shop because of the rising cost of living. It found that sales in supermarkets dropped 1.5% in May, with a 2.2% fall in specialist shops such as butchers and bakers. ""Many customers are buying down, particularly with food, choosing value-range items where they might previously have bought premium goods,"" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium. Retail sales overall fell by 0.5% in May, the ONS said, and it also revised down its sales growth figure for April to 0.4% from its previous estimate of 1.4%. Prices overall are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for 40 years, with UK inflation at 9.1%, the highest level since March 1982. The RAC motoring group revealed that the average price of a litre of petrol hit £1.90 for the first time on Thursday, while diesel was edging towards £2 a litre.  Fuel and energy prices are the biggest drivers of inflation, but food costs drove the most recent rise in May, with prices for bread, cereal and meat climbing. Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the ""horror"" of April's unprecedented rise in energy bills ""swallowed a much bigger slice"" of households' income and ""kept their appetite for spending under control"". ""It's not just the rising bills of today that are worrying us, it's the prospect of even higher bills tomorrow, and fears of a looming recession, which might cause our finances to unravel entirely,"" she added. Cutting back on food has emerged as the most tangible evidence of the effect of the soaring cost of living on our household finances. This ONS report chimes with a survey commissioned by the BBC which found 56% of people asked had bought fewer groceries, and the same proportion had skipped meals. The fact that it is food - a necessity for everyone, of course - shows how everyday life is affected, rather than just having fewer holidays or socialising less. By the autumn and winter, the focus may well shift to people heating their homes less. But whether it is heating, eating, or both, people are going to be looking at where they can reduce their spending for some time yet. In a BBC-commissioned survey of more than 4,000 people, 82% said they thought their wages should increase to match the rising price of goods and services. Workers and unions have been pushing for pay rises, with strikes on the railways this week and BA workers at Heathrow voting to strike over the summer. But the government has warned against employers handing out big increases in salaries over fears of a 1970s style ""inflationary spiral"" where firms hike wages and then pass the cost on to customers through even higher prices. The drop in food sales comes as a long-running measure of consumer confidence recorded its lowest score since records began in 1974. Market research firm GfK said its consumer morale index fell to -41 in June from -40 in May, below levels that have previously preceded recessions. The ONS said that while food sales fell, fuel sales volumes rose by 1.1% in May - despite record high petrol prices. Heather Bovill, deputy director for surveys and economic indicators at the ONS, said more workers returning to the office might be the reason in the uptick in fuel sales. But she said the rise, along with boost in clothing sales, were ""offset by falls for household goods and department stores, with retailers in these areas reporting consumer reluctance to spend due to affordability worries and higher prices."" The proportion of online sales slipped back in May but remains substantially higher than before the pandemic, the ONS said. How are you cutting down on your food shopping?

economic indicators,How might Russia react if Ukraine joins the EU?,2024-09-15,2022-06-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-61844552,"Ukraine has become an official candidate for European Union (EU) membership, the first step to joining the organisation.  The process could take years to complete and there is no guarantee of success. Moldova has also been granted EU candidate status. The EU is an economic and political union of 27 countries. Goods, services and money move freely between member countries. EU citizens can live and work anywhere within the union. It operates a single European currency, the euro, which is used by more than 340 million people in 19 of its nations. Members apply the same standards in areas including food safety, farming and employment rights.  The EU also gives grants to its poorer regions, to help strengthen their economies. President Volodymyr Zelensky began the application for EU membership five days after Russia invaded. He asked to join immediately. There would be financial benefits to joining the EU.  However, Ukraine's main motive is not economic, argues Dr Zach Paikin, from the Centre for European Policy Studies think tank.  ""EU membership would establish Ukraine firmly as an independent, sovereign European state,"" he says. ""Not merely part of the Russian world."" Although President Vladimir Putin is against Ukraine's long-standing desire to join the Nato military alliance, he insists he has ""nothing against"" it joining the EU.  However, the Kremlin said it will give the application ""increased attention"" because the EU is considering its own defence force.  ""The military, defence and security components are being discussed,"" it said. ""We are, of course, observing it all thoroughly."" Ukraine's President Zelensky has warned that Russia might retaliate over its application. ""Obviously, we should expect greater hostile activity from Russia,"" he said. ""And not only against Ukraine, but also against other European countries."" Firstly, the European Commission, the EU's civil service, assesses whether a country is suitable.  It considers whether it has a stable, democratic government, respects human rights, and has a free market economy. All existing EU members have to agree before a new country can become a candidate.  If successful, it has to adopt all the EU's laws and regulations. This normally takes several years. Finally, the country signs a treaty which all the other EU countries have to formally approve. For recent joiners Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia, it took between 10 and 12 years. Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia have been official candidates for years, but their applications have stalled.  Turkey became a candidate in 1999. However, the process stalled over concerns about its human rights record. Since 2017, Ukraine has been able to trade with EU states without paying tariffs - taxes on goods sent between countries - under a so-called association agreement.  As part of its preparation to apply for membership, Ukraine has already changed many of its laws and regulations to meet EU standards. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen says ""good work has been done"", but that Ukraine must make further ""important reforms"".  These include strengthening the rule of law, improving human rights, reducing the power of oligarchs, and tackling corruption. Another challenge will be cleaning up Ukraine's court system, which has been widely criticised.  Since joining 15 years ago, Romania's national income has tripled and Bulgaria's has doubled. The EU has given tens of billions of euros to both countries to support economic development - for example, building new roads and ports.  Between 2014 and 2020, Bulgaria received 11.2bn euros and Romania 35bn euros.  However, Transparency International argues a lot of this money has been lost through corruption.  Bulgaria remains bottom of the EU league in terms of wages, health and education, but Romania has risen from second poorest to sixth poorest.  Some 1.5 million Bulgarians and 4 million Romanians have used the EU's ""freedom of movement"" policy to travel abroad. Critics fear this ""brain drain"" could damage both countries' future prospects."
economic indicators,NI job market strong despite economic worries,2024-09-15,2022-12-13,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-63954959,"Northern Ireland's job market has remained relatively strong despite growing economic worries, the latest official data suggests. The quarterly employment rate, which measures the proportion of people aged 16 to 64 in work, increased by 1.7 percentage points to 71.3%. The level of redundancies is still very low with just 50 confirmed in November. The main concern in the latest figures is a gradual increase in the number of people claiming unemployment benefits. The claimant count increased for the third month in a row in November and now stands at 36,200.  However, as a proportion of the workforce the number of people claiming unemployment benefits was unchanged at 3.8%. Another job market indicator, the quarterly employment survey (QES) suggests that private sector jobs in Northern Ireland reached an all-time high in September. The QES measurement is a survey of about 6,000 companies, covering all employers with 25 or more employees and all public sector employers. Quarterly increases in employee jobs were seen within the services (+4,330 jobs), construction (+140 jobs) and other industry (+210 jobs) sectors.  The manufacturing sector reported a decrease of 980 jobs over the quarter.  Earnings data from HMRC also suggests pay rises are still running well below the rate of inflation. The data suggests a typical employee in NI had monthly pay of £1,999 in November, which is up by £140 or 7.5% over the year. However, with the main UK rate of inflation currently above 11% that will mean people are experiencing a decline in their real standard of living. Meanwhile, Danske Bank has revised down its forecast for the Northern Ireland economy next year. The bank expects the local economy to contract by around 1% compared to its previous estimate of a 0.5% fall in output. Danske Bank Chief Economist, Conor Lambe, said: ""The UK economy contracted in the third quarter of 2022 and we think that economic activity in Northern Ireland is also likely to have declined. ""Output is then projected to fall further in the final quarter of the year and through most of next year with both economies experiencing a period of recession as a number of factors adversely impact activity levels."" Mr Lambe said he expected the rate of inflation to fall gradually during 2023 but that it would continue to weigh down on household purchasing power. The forecast expect the retail sector to bear the brunt of the downturn with output estimated to fall by 4.5%. By contrast it expects the IT and professional services sectors to grow slightly."
economic indicators,Reality Check: Does UK spend half as much on health as US?,2024-09-15,2018-02-06,By Reality Check team,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42950587,"The claim: The NHS costs half as much as the US health system, and cares for the whole population. Reality Check verdict: If you look at every penny spent on health by anyone in the country, then the UK spends about half as much on health as the US does. But if you  compare the amount spent on the NHS with the amount spent by the US government on public healthcare, the difference is much smaller. US President Donald Trump has caused a stir by tweeting his criticisms of the UK's universal healthcare, describing it as a system that is ""going broke and not working"". NHS England boss Simon Stevens responded that ""healthcare for everybody delivered at half the cost of the US healthcare system is something that people in this country are deeply and rightly committed to"".  In the UK, healthcare is universal, while in the States there are 28 million people who are not covered by public or private insurance.  But does the NHS really cost half as much? If you look at all healthcare spending, including treatment funded privately by individuals, the US spent 17.2% of its GDP on healthcare in 2016, compared with 9.7% in the UK.  In pounds per head, that's £2,892 on healthcare for every person in the UK and £7,617 per person in the US.  So as a proportion of the value of the goods and services produced by all sectors of the economy the UK spends a bit more than half what the US spends, and in spending per head it's a bit less than half. The difficulty is, when it comes to comparing healthcare in different countries, you're never exactly comparing like for like.  Almost all health systems are a mixture of public and private - it's the ratio that varies.  In the UK, the public health system can be accessed by all permanent residents, is mostly free at the point of use and  is almost entirely paid for through taxation. Americans are far more likely to rely on private insurance to fund their healthcare since accessing public healthcare is dependent on your income. Many European countries, meanwhile, have a social insurance system where insurance contributions are mandatory. This doesn't fall under general taxation but is not dissimilar from paying National Insurance in the UK and means everyone can access healthcare.  But even if you look only at public money spent on health, the US government's spending on healthcare still outstrips UK government spending, both in terms of the proportion of its GDP (the way we normally measure the size of a country's economy) and in terms of how much it spends per head. Almost half of US health spending still comes from public money including general taxation - although it's the only country in the G7 to pay publicly for less than 50% of all healthcare that's provided. What this doesn't tell you, though, is how effective a healthcare system is, and this seems to be what Mr Stevens was getting at.  The UK government spends less on health and provides a universal service where every permanent resident can access care.  In the US, even after major changes to the system, there are 28 million people who don't have any private or public insurance.    The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says life expectancy in the United States is slightly lower than average, despite very high levels of health spending. In many cases, the more a country spends on healthcare per person, the longer its citizens' life expectancy.  But while the US spends more per person than the UK on healthcare, in 2014, average life expectancy at birth in the USA was 78.8, compared with 81.4 in the UK according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). ""Japan spent the fifth most per person on healthcare and had the highest life expectancy, while Italy spent the least per person and had the second highest life expectancy,"" the ONS's statisticians point out.   Life expectancy is a helpful, although not perfect indicator of the quality of a nation's healthcare. It is affected by other complicated social factors, such as diet and the prevalence of smoking.  Americans consume more tobacco per head than Britons and are more likely to be overweight or obese. Opioid deaths and gun crime also affect average American life expectancy.  In the summer, US think tank the Commonwealth Fund ranked the NHS the number one health system in a comparison of 11 countries for safety, affordability and efficiency. It did less well when it came to cancer survival The US was ranked last out of the 11 countries.  The American health system came off badly in comparison when it came to infant mortality, life expectancy, and preventable deaths, but did relatively better on cancer, heart attack and stroke survival. Meanwhile, the UK's cancer survival rates have historically been below the European average, although they are improving for certain cancers.  The UK has fewer doctors, nurses and hospital beds than the OECD average. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter"
economic indicators,Could it be Bernie Sanders v Donald Trump?,2024-09-15,2020-02-14,By Anthony Zurcher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51507205,"Bernie Sanders is firmly the front-runner in the race to become the Democratic challenger to Republican President Donald Trump, fresh from a victory this week in the second state-by-state contest. His support is fervent but is his party, let alone the country, ready to embrace such an unusual candidate? Bernie Sanders likes to call his presidential campaign a revolution, but these days it feels more like a touring rock concert. The Vermont senator may seem like an unlikely front-man for bands like Vampire Weekend and The Strokes, but both have served as his warm-up acts, playing at recent campaign rallies.  But the thousands of fans in packed arenas reserve their loudest cheers for the scruffy-haired 78-year-old candidate with a clipped Brooklyn accent.   After nearly a year-long marathon of rallies, meetings, debates and ground-laying, the Sanders campaign is now entering a sprint of near-nonstop activity that will carry it through dozens of states across the country - an impressive test of endurance for a man who just months ago was hospitalised for a heart attack. ""Bernie Sanders is the only candidate that has given me the courage to believe that we cannot only demand bold, radical change, but that it's actually very attainable,"" said Aletha Shapiro, who travelled to New Hampshire from Long Island, New York, to help the Sanders campaign.  ""If the people stick together, we can actually put power back in the hands of the people.""  The end result of all this effort was a split decision in Iowa, as former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg claimed the most delegates to the Democratic National Convention even though Sanders won a few thousand more votes. In New Hampshire, Sanders finished narrowly ahead of Buttigieg again, with the two tied in the state's delegate count.  That didn't stop Sanders from claiming victory both in Iowa and New Hampshire on Tuesday night, however, and looking ahead to a showdown with Trump in November. ""The reason we won tonight in New Hampshire, we won last week in Iowa, is because of the hard work of so many volunteers,"" he said. ""Let me say tonight that this victory here is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump."" The crowd, packed into a college gymnasium, responded with deafening applause, as though the volume of their cheers could will their beloved candidate to more victories in the days ahead.  ""It was electric,"" said Scott Sandvik, a music teacher from Boston. ""I really think it was a release of tension after a nail-biter of an election."" If the Sanders ""revolution"" does take hold - an outsider campaign pitted as much against the Democratic Party's establishment as it is the incumbent president - New Hampshire could very well be seen as where it all began.  But the campaign still has a long road ahead. Four years ago, Sanders also followed a tight result in Iowa with a victory in New Hampshire. That contest was actually more decisive - a 20-point win over Hillary Clinton, who was considered the prohibitive favourite entering the race. Sanders' 2016 New Hampshire triumph, however, was a springboard into an empty pool.  He followed his win in the overwhelmingly white New England state with a narrow loss in Nevada and a drubbing in South Carolina, where the Democratic voting population is majority black. Although there were a few bright spots after that - victories in Michigan and Wisconsin - Clinton spent the next few months pulling away from Sanders in the nomination race. Now Sanders is back, hoping history doesn't repeat itself. Facing a more crowded field, he appears to be in a much better position, as the nomination fight becomes a state-by-state slog on a battleground that stretches the breadth of the nation.  There is no Clinton machine waiting to do battle against the Sanders insurgency this time around. Instead, the Vermont senator heads out of New Hampshire along with a ragtag mix of candidates all scrambling for a foothold.  Joe Biden, the apparent front-runner through much of 2019, is grievously wounded by poor showings in the first two contests. Elizabeth Warren, the other candidate appealing to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, has finished behind Sanders twice now and shows no signs gaining any ground. Meanwhile, the continued presence of Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar among the moderates of the party ensures middle-of-the road and establishment Democrats will remain divided.   Buttigieg has money, but a thin resume and doubts about his appeal to the more diverse rank-and-file of the Democratic Party. Klobuchar is counting on media coverage of her late surge in New Hampshire to make up for depleted campaign coffers and a virtually non-existent national organisation.  The Sanders brothers: A tale of two underdogs How Bernie Sanders always beat the odds Meanwhile, Sanders has risen in national polls as Biden has faltered. He boasts a veteran campaign structure that has basically been up and running since 2015, and a donor and volunteer network that spans the nation.  His $25m (£19m) fundraising haul in January alone will ensure he has more than enough resources to compete in every state on the crowded March primary calendar.  He has been officially or unofficially supported by figures from UK Labour MP Diane Abbott to YouTube star Joe Rogan. On Friday, he picked up another endorsement, from New York mayor and erstwhile 2020 candidate Bill de Blasio.  If Bernie Sanders isn't the Democratic front-runner at this point, the word has little meaning. He's far from a lock for the nomination, but his path ahead appears to be the clearest of any of his competitors. On Tuesday night, Sanders essentially said as much. ""The reason I believe we are going to win is because we have an unprecedented grass-roots movement from coast to coast of millions of people,"" he said. ""The reason that we are going to win is that we are putting together an unprecedented multi-generational, multi-racial movement."" History is certainly on Sanders' side. Putting the Iowa popular-vote result in his column means the Vermont senator joins Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004, both eventual nominees, as the only non-incumbents to win there and New Hampshire. In fact, no candidate has finished outside the top two in New Hampshire and gone on to the nomination.  ""I think the people of the United States will unite around his message supporting the true hard working people of this country,"" said Tomas Amadeo of Hooksett, New Hampshire, echoing the optimism of many at the New Hampshire Sanders rally.  ""He can resonate with people of all ages."" The current disposition of the Sanders campaign has his supporters hoping for the best, however, a big chunk of the Democratic establishment and moderates in the party are fearing the worst. Last Friday, in the spin room before the Democratic candidate debate in Manchester, senior Sanders campaign adviser Jeff Weaver was clear-eyed about what's in store for his candidate, as a Democratic establishment that views Sanders as a meddlesome and disruptive outsider prepares to fight back. ""There's always a target on his back,"" he said of Sanders. ""They won't stop until they're beaten. Well, we're ready for it."" In Iowa, Sanders was the subject of negative television advertisements from both the left and the right. The conservative Club for Growth aired a spot that painted the Vermont senator as an extremist - and said that his health was suspect after his heart attack last autumn. A pro-Israel Democratic group ran an advert featuring Iowa voters saying Sanders couldn't beat Trump. ""It is no secret that our campaign is taking on the political establishment and the big-money interests who are now running negative ads against us in Iowa,"" Sanders said in response. ""The billionaire class is getting nervous, and they should."" There's reason to believe Sanders' political-jujitsu strategy could be effective.  In 2016, as the Republican establishment finally acknowledged the threat that Donald Trump's candidacy posed, its scions - including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney - began to speak out. Their attacks only made Trump stronger, however, as he painted them as the ""swamp's"" last-gasp efforts to stop him. ""The establishment has never taken Sanders seriously, and now that they're having to they're going to attack him,"" said Caleb Gates, a Sanders supporter from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who joined Sanders at a volunteer organisation event the day before the Iowa Caucuses.  ""But I think that will only increase his appeal to a lot of people, especially those who are not politically active."" In New Hampshire, Biden and Buttigieg hit at Sanders directly, both warning he was too extreme to be the party's nominee and that his ideological views were too rigid.  Buttigieg accused Sanders of ""dividing people with the politics that says, 'If you don't go all the way to the edge, it doesn't count', a politics that says, 'It's my way or the highway'."" Time and again, it's the ""electability"" criticism that is used as a cudgel against Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist. One recent poll indicated that more than half of Americans would not vote for a ""socialist"" president. Trump, at his rallies, regularly promises to his cheering support that ""American will never be a socialist nation"". The ""conventional"" view of a Sanders candidacy can be summed up in in a tweet by Sean Trende, an elections analyst with the website RealClear Politics. ""Bernie Sanders is a complete wildcard,"" he wrote. ""He could win by 10 points or lose by 20."" A blunter take by a Sanders critic was offered by New York Magazine's Jonathan Chait in a column that particularly irked the Sanders faithful. ""No party nomination, with the possible exception of Barry Goldwater in 1964, has put forth a presidential nominee with the level of downside risk exposure as a Sanders-led ticket would bring,"" he wrote. ""To nominate Sanders would be insane."" When the stakes are so high - defeating Trump has been a central focus of Democrats since the day he was elected in 2016 - why, they ask, would the party choose a candidate so far away from the comfortable middle of American politics? Moderate members of Congress, in particular, have expressed apprehension about sharing a ticket with the independent-minded Vermont senator who only joined the Democratic Party to run for president. Dean Phillips, a newly elected congressman from Minnesota who has endorsed Klobuchar, told CNN that Sanders could have a ""disastrous"" effect on congressional races in November, jeopardising the majority Democrats won in the 435-seat chamber in 2018.. ""There are probably 25 to 30 seats that absolutely would be impacted directly by having a self-avowed socialist at the top of the ticket,"" he said. ""He's not a Democrat, you know, and that's something that I wish was better understood."" The Sanders campaign clearly realises that winning the ""electability"" debate is essential to securing the party's 2020 nomination. It's why they hand out ""Sanders beats Trump"" stickers at their campaign events and chanted the refrain at his New Hampshire victory celebration. They're quick to cite head-to-head polling that shows little significant difference between a Sanders-Trump matchup and one between Trump and Biden, the candidate frequently offered as the safe and electable option. A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll had Biden on top 50-44, while Sanders led Trump 49-45 - a statistically insignificant difference. They also argue that the entire debate about electability is framed incorrectly. American politics, they say, isn't a battle for the middle, it's a battle of ideas and a battle for authenticity. ""What we did last time was nominate someone who was down the middle and another Washington person who wasn't going to change anything,"" said Pat Miguel Tomaino of Boston. ""There are people hurting in this country who bought a lot of fake change from Donald Trump, and now we're all suffering for it."" Tomaino, who volunteered for Sanders in New Hampshire, added that the economic collapse of 2008 destroyed the trust many Americans have in the current economic and political order, and unless the Democratic Party acknowledges this and adjust to the new reality, it's going to lose to Trump again. ""We have no illusion about elites coming to save us or tinkering around a little bit for a better technocratic way of ordering an elitist system where just 1% benefit,"" he said.  ""We know that Bernie Sanders doesn't want any of that. We know he has our back, and we have his."" To pull this off, however, the Sanders campaign has to successfully identify and turn out voters who have sat out past elections. They're counting on the younger voters who polls show overwhelmingly back Sanders for the nomination, as well other disaffected Americans who have been marginalised by the system. In Iowa, at least, the results were not encouraging. Although young voters made up a larger share of caucus participants, the total numbers were down from 2008, when Barack Obama's first campaign was electrifying many Democrats.  New Hampshire's numbers were better, but early indications are the higher turnout was in part due to moderate and independent voters showing up to support Klobuchar and Buttigieg. ""I've always believed strongly that our case for winning this nomination and also beating Trump is that we can expand the base,"" said Faiz Shakir, the Sanders campaign manager.  ""We have the most ambitious and difficult path to winning this nomination because it requires, by its nature, that people will be brought into this process."" He added that he thought the campaign had laid the groundwork for increased turnout in the states ahead, but there is reason the whole party should be concerned. ""We've got much more work to do,"" he said.  As the focus turns to Nevada, which holds its caucus a week from Saturday, Sanders is facing criticism from a different direction. The state's powerful Culinary Union is circulating literature suggesting Sanders's plan for replacing private health insurance with a government-run programme will abolish their union-negotiated plans.  The union then released a statement saying that Sanders supporters, upon learning of the union's criticism, had ""viciously"" attacked the organisation. Already Sanders' Democratic opponents, sensing a vulnerability in Nevada, are positioning themselves as defenders of union healthcare plans. ""Let's be clear: attacks on the union are unacceptable,"" Klobuchar wrote in a tweet. ""I come from a family of proud union members and I know when unions are strong, America is strong"" Four years ago Nevada was the staging ground for Clinton's counterattack, as she won over union support in Las Vegas hotels and restaurants - even without an outright endorsement.  If Sanders stumbles in Nevada again, the momentum he gained over the past two weeks could be lost, opening the door for one of the candidates he beat in New Hampshire - or for another, unexpected candidate who looms on the horizon in the weeks ahead. After Iowa and New Hampshire, the outcome of the race may be uncertain, but it has at least followed a somewhat predictable course. The field is narrowing as candidates struggle at the ballot box or run out of money. The hardiest campaigns have moved on to the later battlegrounds. That may all head out of the window soon. There hasn't been a presidential candidate quite like Michael Bloomberg.  The New York multi-billionaire is sitting out the first four Democratic nomination contests, and instead using his vast resources to campaign in later states, which award the lion's share of delegates to the Democratic national convention, where the party's standard-bearer will ultimately be decided. The Bloomberg challenge presents one additional, unprecedented hurdle Sanders must clear if he wants to be the party's nominee - a circumstance not lost on the senator's team. ""He's standing there waiting on Super Tuesday to try to block us if some if these other people can't,"" said Weaver of the Sanders campaign. ""So, this race has got a long way to go and the ruling class in this country will do whatever it takes to stop Bernie Sanders."" Sanders's supporters have been even more blunt. ""It's not subtle at all what Michael Bloomberg is doing,"" says Tomas Armadeo of Hookset, New Hampshire. ""It's very egregious how he's buying and funding his own way into this election. And I think people are going to see that."" Not everyone considers Bloomberg's presence as a threat, however. ""Bloomberg's a perfect foil for Bernie because Bernie has been railing against the billionaire class for decades,"" said Gates of Cedar Rapids. ""And the chances of running against an actual billionaire, I think that plays right into his strengths."" That may be easy to say at this point, but if Bloomberg does become a serious obstacle for Sanders - and if he either denies the Vermont senator a majority of the delegates at the convention or becomes the nominee himself - there could be hell to pay from the Sanders faithful. Outside a Sanders canvassing rally in Newton, a tiny town in central Iowa, campaign volunteer Krissy Haglund hands out leaflets and says Bloomberg is a ""test for the American people"". ""I think it's a test to see if they're willing to believe that money should be out of politics."" Four years ago Haglund, a physician from Minneapolis, Minnesota, said the American people missed the ""gift"" that Sanders was offering them. And when presented with the choice between Clinton and Trump, she opted to vote for the Green Party's Jill Stein. This time around, she's not sure she'd be able to support anyone but Sanders. ""I feel as though Bernie is in a class by himself and none of the other candidates are even close,"" she said. ""And I think if he doesn't get it, it will be because of politics and not that he hasn't earned it in the numbers or from the American people."" And if it's Bloomberg, she's definitely looking elsewhere. Follow Anthony on Twitter Additional reporting by Haley Thomas ."
economic indicators,Ex-council boss proud of Commonwealth Games legacy,2024-09-15,2022-07-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-62267343,"The £300m cost of Manchester's Commonwealth Games was ""undoubtedly"" worth it, as it led to  ""one of the most successful regeneration stories"" ever seen, the man behind it has said.  Sir Howard Bernstein, who was the council's chief executive, said the event was an ""important part"" in the city's ""evolution"" after the 1996 bomb. He said it was not a ""panacea"", but it brought growth, jobs and civic pride. ""We should celebrate that and continue to build on that success,"" he said. The games saw the building of major new sports venues, including  the Manchester Aquatics Centre, the National Squash Centre and the City of Manchester Stadium, which became the home to Premier League champions Manchester City. Away from sport, it also led to the areas around those venues, particularly in Beswick, Ardwick, Ancoats and New Islington, being transformed, with new homes, schools, shops and amenities being built in the two decades since the event. Sir Howard, whose endeavours earned him a knighthood a year after the games, said it built on Manchester's existing international recognition in sport and culture and paved the way for the city hosting major events, such as the Manchester International Festival, and being home to the likes of British Cycling and the Rugby Football League. He said more than anything though, it acted as a springboard for a ""remarkable regeneration"" of east Manchester. ""It was not a panacea; there are still challenges [but] people are choosing to live there and businesses are choosing to locate there,"" he said. Once the home of the city's heavy industries, much of the area was derelict by the 1980s.  Sir Howard said after the games, there was ""significant economic growth and development, thousands of jobs, better housing and [it] fostered civic pride to people in the city"". ""East Manchester is probably one of the most successful regeneration stories to be found anywhere in the western hemisphere,"" he said. ""We should celebrate that and continue to build on that success."" Sir Richard Leese, who led Manchester City Council from 1996 to 2021, said it was possible to still see the impact the event had on the city, as the ""sporting and cultural legacy is enormous"". He said the sporting facilities and events like the Great Manchester Run, which came out of the games, were the ""catalyst"" to east Manchester's regeneration"".  He said before the event, the area did not have a high school or a mainstream supermarket, leaving people without transport having ""to pay premium prices at local convenience stores"", but the opening of Asda at Eastlands, which was followed by other supermarkets, had fostered ""a positive community for people who want to live there"".  He said the legacy ""was not an accident"" and the games were actually ""built into a regeneration plan"" which started seven years beforehand. They were ""baked into a broader strategy"" and not a ""one-off"" event where everyone has a ""fantastic time"" and goes home, he added. He said the council had looked at regenerating the area since the 1980s, but work had been stalled by the banking crash and recession in 2008. ""In the last four to five years, it has got going again and it is fantastic to see [but there is] still much to do,"" he said. However, he said the fact people from Manchester still talk about the games 20 years on ""with immense pride"" showed how ""very special"" they were. Community charity 4CT has run the Grange Community Resource Centre in Beswick since 2005. Its chief executive Claire Evans, who has worked in east Manchester since 1996, said the regeneration had ""massively improved the area physically, socially and economically"".  She said some businesses had thrived thanks to the arrival of Manchester City and the increase in footfall on matchdays and some measures, such as alley gating, had cut crimes like muggings. However, she said ""some amazing things couldn't be sustained"", such as the community warden patrols which supported the police, and not all residents were happy with the transformation. She said some were ""put out"" by the investment being concentrated on social housing, as well as stadium traffic and noise. Dr Chris Mackintosh, senior lecturer in sport development at Manchester Metropolitan University's Institute of Sport said initial indications were that the legacy of the games ""did not lead to an increase in sporting activity in the area"". ""However, the economic regeneration for new East Manchester led to new local pools, increased community sport and infrastructure for volunteering, coaching and physical activity,"" he said. He added that the Sportcity development around the City of Manchester Stadium was ""an iconic success story for Manchester and the UK economy"". ""Provision of wider transport, leisure, retail and sport economy multiplier effects from events have provided a blueprint for other bids,"" he said. ""New East Manchester still remains an area with stubborn social inequalities and poverty, which remains a challenge for all agencies [but] sport and physical activity's multiple roles in addressing health problems is starting to become a reality.

economic indicators,"NI firms' recovery stalled in August, says survey",2024-09-15,2020-09-14,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-54145492,"Economic recovery in Northern Ireland stalled in August, according to an Ulster Bank survey.  Every month it asks private sector firms about staffing, exports and new orders in what is considered a reliable indictor of economic performance. While retail and construction initially bounced back in July, all indicators deteriorated in August. Employment levels fell for the sixth month in a row despite the government's job retention scheme being in place.  Unemployment is expected to continue to rise when the scheme comes to an end next month. Economic recovery appears to be taking longer in Northern Ireland than in other parts of the UK. ""Hopes of a 'V-shaped' recovery remain intact in other regions; but that is not the case in Northern Ireland,"" said Ulster Bank's chief economist Richard Ramsey. ""Interestingly, the devolved regions - who were more cautious in lifting lockdown restrictions - continue to lag their English counterparts,"" he added. This survey said that despite the boost from initiatives like the government's ""Eat Out to Help Out"" scheme which ran from during the month of August, Northern Ireland's service sector recovery is lagging well behind the rest of UK. Mr Ramsey said: ""Overall, Northern Ireland's loss of momentum in August does not look temporary."" ""The rise in the number of cases of Covid during September to date, combined with the heightened tensions surrounding Brexit, make the landscape a very challenging one,"" he added."
economic indicators,'The move with great expectations',2024-09-15,2017-07-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40651176,"Last month, the BBC Canada team asked readers about their immigrant experience in Canada as the country celebrates its 150th anniversary. In this story, we look at the difficulty even highly-skilled immigrants face getting work.  Ramanuj Basu arrived in Canada in 2013, excited to begin a master's degree in international business law. At 29 years old, he had already studied law at the University of London, and had gained practical experience at a Delhi corporate law firm as a senior associate.  But Basu and his wife Veronika decided they wanted to try another country and chose Canada for the ""quality of life"". ""We looked to it with excitement,"" he says, even though they were leaving behind family and friends. ""You're making the move with great expectations.""  They knew there would be some sacrifice. Veronika worked two jobs to support the couple as Basu completed his degree at Toronto's York University. Basu left behind his parents and sister in Delhi.  His father, Manoj, says they were ""optimistic"" about their success in a new country. Like so many other families separated by distance, he adds, modern communication is a blessing but not the same as seeing his son and daughter-in-law in person.  Basu knew he would need to prove his credentials. So he joined as a summer intern at a big business law firm, despite doing more advanced legal work in India.  He qualified to practise law in Canada in 2016, but Basu hit a wall he wasn't expecting - getting foreign credentials and work experience recognised.  ""I have seen numerous examples of foreign qualified professionals struggling to re-enter their field and in some cases, being compelled to give it up due to financial pressures,"" he says.  While Basu says Canadians are a ""very accepting people"" and ""very helpful"", ""professionally, it's a different story"".  Many employers told Basu they appreciated his experience but couldn't seem to find a way to make it fit into their organisation.  ""No one is willing to recognise the previous experience I had in India,"" he says.  Canada has long prioritised bringing in skilled immigrants and competes with countries like the UK and the US for their talents.  About 20% of the country is foreign-born and more than half of Canada's immigrant population is highly educated. People from India are a large part of that group. Between 2006 and 2011, more than 10% of the 1.2 million people who immigrated to Canada came from the south Asian country. Still, skilled immigrants struggle in the labour market. They face higher unemployment rates and have lower wages than people who are Canadian-born.  Canada's statistics agency says that in 2011, recent immigrants with a university degree earned 79% of the weekly wages earned by their Canadian-born counterparts. The country also ranks below the OECD average when it comes to matching skilled immigrants to jobs.  The cost of licensing fees, exams and training upgrades for foreign credential recognition can also drain finances.  Basu says he would tell other new immigrants not to count on overseas experience when it comes to looking for a job in Canada, and thinks Indian companies value foreign experience more.  ""They tend to view it as exposure to different cultures, different business practices, to different ways of doing things,"" he says.  While the couple aren't living quite the life they envisioned, Basu says they have settled in and plan to stay. He eventually found a good job, working in global sanctions at a Canadian bank, though not in the legal profession as he had hoped. His wife has a full-time job and they've bought a flat in the Toronto area.  ""I recognise the fact that I am doing far better than a lot of recent immigrants are,"" he says, but adds it still wasn't an easy experience. He hopes employers will take a chance on people who pick up and move to another country to build a new life.  ""It takes quite a bit of gumption and quite a bit of confidence in yourself, ""he says.

economic indicators,Reports highlight impact of virus on Scots economy,2024-09-15,2020-05-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-52624765,"The huge impact of the coronavirus crisis on the Scottish economy has been highlighted in separate reports. An RBS survey indicated that private sector activity in Scotland fell at an ""unparalleled"" rate last month. Its Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) recorded the biggest drop in new business on record. Meanwhile, the Scottish Council for Development and Industry warned key sectors of the economy could be facing a ""particularly difficult"" future. The PMI for April suggested services saw a quicker decline than manufacturing, although both sectors saw survey record falls in overall activity. RBS said the coronavirus pandemic ""continued to clatter the private sector economy"". In April, the index plummeted to 10.7 from 29.7, reflecting a huge fall in output as about a quarter of business stopped trading, and many others cut back sharply. Of the nations and regions of the UK, only Northern Ireland recorded a lower figure, at 8.3. Any figure below 50 suggests economic contraction. All the other index indicators were far out of the usual ranges, with firms reporting record cuts in new orders, capacity, and in backlogs of work and employment, although some included furloughed workers. Looking ahead 12 months, Scots manufacturers registered a positive outlook. However, including the much bigger services sector, Scottish firms were more pessimistic than most other nations and regions about their prospects. Malcolm Buchanan, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland's Scotland board, said: ""The Covid-19 pandemic continued to cause severe repercussions for the Scottish economy in April, with latest data pointing to an unprecedented reduction in private sector activity.  ""The Covid-19 induced downturn formed part of a wider UK trend in April, but Scotland fared worse than the UK as a whole, with the decline quicker than at the national level.  ""Although there is some discussion of an exit plan from the current quarantine restrictions, it is unlikely that the economy will recover quickly from such a severe downturn."" Meanwhile, a separate report has warned that key sectors of Scotland's economy could be facing a ""particularly difficult"" future due to Covid-19. A briefing paper produced by the Scottish Council for Development and Industry (SCDI) warned of the impact of the pandemic on areas including oil and gas, aviation, tourism and hospitality. ""These sectors are highly significant for Scottish GDP in terms of their contribution to employment, productivity and growth,"" the paper said. The economic development agency noted forecasts from both the Scottish government and the UK Office for Budget Responsibility that GDP could fall by about a third as a result of the virus outbreak. While it said Scotland's labour market was in ""good health"" prior to the virus, it said this had ""changed radically in March and April"". The SCDI noted that early indications suggested Scottish employers shed jobs at the fastest rate in over two decades in March, adding that this had happened at a faster rate than in UK-wide firms. It said just over half (51%) of Scottish businesses had reduced staff numbers while 81% had cut staff working hours."

economic indicators,The tech allowing thousands of students to sit exams at home,2024-09-15,2020-11-30,By Mary-Ann Russon,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54881746,"The phones began ringing off the hook at Piero Tintori's company Better Examinations back in April. His tech business allows tens of thousands of students to remotely sit exams at the same time, with each needing just a laptop, a webcam and an internet connection. The firm's software uses machine learning (ML), an advanced form of artificial intelligence, to detect patterns in user behaviour that could indicate attempts to cheat. Its technology can also automatically mark multiple-choice answers and mathematics exams. In addition, it checks each exam-sitter's identity using the webcam, to ensure that no-one else is sitting the test for them. The Better Examinations program also temporarily restricts access to the internet, or certain websites and applications on each person's computer. ""We had 60 organisations from all over the world contact us out of the blue, who wanted to run exams online in May and June,"" says Mr Tintori. ""Everything from universities, to professional organisations, to schools."" With the firm's headquarters in Dublin, plus offices in the US, Australia and Poland, it uses Amazon's cloud computing system Amazon Web Services, to allow everything to work online. Mr Tintori says he was also contacted directly by five governments (whom he declines to name), who were keen for school exams to go ahead. Better Examinations is just one example of the increased use of ML in response to this year's pandemic, with the technology being used to do work far more quickly than humans, such as marking exam papers. But what exactly is ML? It is a method of data analysis, whereby computer algorithms are used to speedily process vast amounts of data, to make predictions, identify patterns and replicate actions that humans do in their day-to-day jobs.   The use of ML is expected to grow so much over the next four years that its estimated global economic value is expected to rise from $7.3bn (£5.7bn) this year, to $30.6bn in 2024, according to one study. Global law firm DWF, which helps the in-house legal teams of large corporations, is another business now increasingly using the technology. It was approached by a large real estate company that had an ""impossible"" task. The client wanted 10,000 property lease documents, stored on paper and electronically, and in different locations, to be digitalised into a central database. This firm also wanted to know the exact terms of each of the leases, to discover new commercial opportunities. ""Traditionally, you would get paralegals under supervision to plough through the documents. But from a cost point of view it doesn't work, and also it's inconsistent,"" says Mark Qualter, chief executive of DWF's managed services division.  DWF designed an ML system to classify each lease document into categories, identify specific types of details, and then extract data from the document.  The banking sector is also embracing ML. UK building society Nationwide had asked US computer giant IBM to build an artificial intelligence ""chatbot"" called Arti for it, to help first-time buyers understand how to get a mortgage. But when the UK went into its first lockdown in March, and mortgage holidays were announced, the lender was instead inundated with queries about them. In just four days, Arti - powered by AI platform IBM Watson - was retrained to answer mortgage holiday questions. The virtual agent also dealt with other questions as Nationwide saw online banking registrations jump by 89%. ""In just over two months, Arti had responded to more than 10,000 queries, and a further 350 per day since, freeing up hundreds of hours for frontline teams to focus their time handling more complex requests from members,"" says Michael Conway, UK lead for artificial intelligence at IBM Services. ""Put simply, it allowed Nationwide to focus its resources on those who needed the most help, without ignoring the needs of everyone else."" Meanwhile, another UK retail bank has been using ML algorithms to identify customers who are showing indications of financial difficulty, so that they can be contacted automatically, and then offered support before matters get out of hand. This has been provided to the lender by BJSS, a multinational technology engineering consultancy headquartered in Leeds. Sri Harsha Tharkabhushanam, head of data science for BJSS, says that previously of those in arrears, 30% had got to a severe position where ""there was very little the bank could do for them at that point"". But after implementing the ML model, the automated prompts meant fewer people were getting into severe difficulties, with the figure falling to 10%. Business intelligence gathering using AI is also becoming a big deal.  For instance, a large European pharmaceutical firm, which wants to remain anonymous, wanted to make sure that if there was a new product launched, or start-up bought, by any of their competitors, it knew about it quickly. New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. The company employed Filament AI, a machine-learning software firm in London, to build it a bespoke ML system that could monitor 1,000 websites, 200 story feeds, and roughly 200,000 news articles a day round the clock. Michael Osborne, a professor of machine learning at Oxford University, says that companies across many industries are now ""desperately trying to get their hands on ML"", as many more things are now being quantified digitally, making it easier to analyse them to gain insights. Martha White, associate professor of computing science at the University of Alberta in Canada, agrees that the use of ML is growing fast. ""The combination of more data, and more powerful computers, and a focus on leveraging both has really propelled the field forward,"" she says. ""The prevalence will continue to grow for a few reasons. Firstly, there is still lots of low-hanging fruit, and the ability to monetise with the existing technology. Secondly, we are going to get better at improving our own decision making, using predictions from machine-learning systems."" But although ML is becoming increasingly popular, there are concerns it has been oversold as a ""magic wand"", and the public's distrust of it is only rising, warns Prof Osborne. ""ML is not this all-singing, all-dancing solution to our woes,"" he says. ""Instead it's something that delivers value only when working hand-in-hand with humans, and having humans tailor it to their specific needs. ""ML is powerful, but not a fully general-purpose technology. It needs a lot of careful tweaking to get it to work for any new application."""
economic indicators,China cuts mortgage rate as property crisis deepens,2024-09-15,2022-08-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62629144,"China's central bank has cut its mortgage rate as officials work to support the crisis-hit property market. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) lowered the five-year loan prime rate (LPR) by 1.5 percentage points, which matches its biggest cut on record. The world's second largest economy faces a property crisis that has seen some building projects grind to a halt. Lockdowns due to the country's strict zero-Covid policies are also affecting businesses and consumers. On Monday, the PBOC reduced the five-year rate to 4.2%, which will bring down the cost of home mortgage repayments around the country. It also lowered the one-year loan prime rate, which is usually used to determine corporate loans, from 3.7% to 3.65%. Iris Pang, Greater China chief economist at ING Bank, said the moves are part of a wider effort to shore up the real estate industry. ""At the same time, some local governments have started to lend to property developers to continue the construction of uncompleted homes,"" she said in a note on Monday. ""The two measures together should reduce the concern of existing home mortgage borrowers,"" she added. China's property crisis is estimated to have wiped more than a trillion dollars off the value of the sector last year. Home sales in China have fallen for 11 months in a row, official data shows. That is the longest slump since China created a private property market in the late 1990s. Several Chinese developers have halted building work on homes that had already been sold, because of concerns over their finances. Hundreds of home buyers are also known to have threatened to stop paying their mortgages until the work restarts. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has signalled that the country may miss an annual economic growth target of 5.5%. The Politburo - the ruling Communist Party's top policy-making body - did not mention the official growth target after its quarterly economic meeting in July. It only said leaders ""would strive to achieve the best results possible"". Last week, Chinese premier Li Keqiang said the government will take more steps to boost consumption and grow investment in the country. This came after indicators for consumption and output unexpectedly slowed."
economic indicators,Polluted city's children could face shorter lives,2024-09-15,2019-07-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-48907879,"Children who live in Birmingham could have their lives cut short by up to seven months due to the levels of air pollution, a study has found.  King's College London researchers say that an eight-year-old born in 2011 may die between two to seven months early if exposed to projected future levels throughout their lifetime. The Department for Environment said it was taking ""concerted action"". Birmingham City Council said the findings are ""absolutely shocking"". Birmingham has more pollution-related deaths than Manchester, according to the report, and should ""reasonably spend"" up to £470m a year tackling the problem. Males were more likely to be affected than females, the report said, with boys born in 2011 expected to lose up to 41 weeks. Girls were due to lose 35 weeks. Children living in Erdington could be more affected, with between 75 to 91 deaths in that area in 2011 attributed to pollution. By contrast Hall Green saw the lowest number of deaths, at 46 to 57. The study looked at the combined impact of two pollutants - particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide - which experts say are among the leading causes of poor health from air pollution. Levels of nitrogen dioxide are a ""good indicator of traffic pollution"", the report said. ""Somewhere between 150 and 700 deaths"" in the city could be attributed to the 2011 combined pollutant levels, the report said. Conversely, if levels had improved from 2011, the average life expectancy of a child born that year would have improved by up to four months. Polly Billington, director of the clean-energy network UK100, which commissioned the work, said: ""This report should be a wake-up call to policymakers not just in Birmingham but across the country."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, said that ""air pollution continues to shorten lives, which is why we are taking concerted action to tackle it"". Councillor Waseem Zaffar, cabinet member for transport and environment at Birmingham City Council, said the local authority was confronting pollution with its plans for a Clean Air Zone, which will see drivers of the most polluting vehicles being charged to drive their vehicles into the city centre. He said: ""As a father of young children myself, these findings are absolutely shocking. They demonstrate the sheer scale of the major public health crisis we are dealing with in Birmingham today. ""One life cut short by poor air quality is one too many, so this is exactly why the city is taking forward measures such as the Clean Air Zone and why we continue to work with other cities across the country to tackle this problem together, but we also need strong leadership on this issue at a national government level.""

economic indicators,Is the PM trying to achieve the impossible?,2024-09-15,2020-05-10,By Nick Triggle,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52611507,"The prime minister is effectively trying to pull off the impossible. He wants to try to restart normal life, while keeping the virus at bay with limited means to do so.  With no vaccine, the government is reliant on containing any local outbreaks. But the problem is that even with the extra testing that has been put in place over the past month, there are big holes in the UK's ability to suppress the virus. It takes too long to get test results back - several days in some cases - and those most in need of regular testing, such as care home staff for example, are still reporting they cannot always access tests. Our ability to trace the close contacts of infected people remains unknown - the piloting of the system, which involves the use of an app and an army of contact tracers, has just started on the Isle of Wight. It means we are effectively fighting this ""invisible killer"" with one hand behind our back. We are not alone in struggling, similar problems are being encountered by other countries. But we are still some way behind the best prepared and equipped, such as Germany and South Korea. Could it be any different? Should it be any different? Some argue we were too slow to react to the growing threat. For example the UK largely relied on a network of eight government testing labs for the best part of two months following the first diagnosed coronavirus case. Eventually other partners were brought on board, but it meant until late April we were still only able to do 25,000 tests a day. Others have picked holes in the strategy taken.  The care sector, for example, believes more should have been done to protect care homes, given the rising number of deaths that are being reported - there are indications that these account for half of all deaths now. Then - on the flip side - there are the difficulties the lockdown itself is causing.  It has had a huge economic and social impact as well as harming health - referrals for cancer care are down, while visits to A&E have dropped by a half since the epidemic started. Is this being factored in enough? Schools in England are being given a tentative green light to return, but only certain years. Yet children are the least likely to develop serious symptoms - and some evidence suggests they may not pass on the virus that easily. It is partly because of this that some question whether we should even be so obsessed by keeping the infection rate of the virus down below one - the so-called R number which refers to the average number of people an infected person passes the virus to. The prime minister committed to this in his address, but with the R currently at between 0.5 and 0.9 there is virtually no wriggle room to lift the restrictions that are in place without it going above one. However, last week academics from Edinburgh and London universities published modelling suggesting the virus could be allowed to spread in a controlled way in the healthy population if the vulnerable were shielded. The R could be safely left to rise towards close to two if this were to happen. The theory being that the overwhelming majority of the risk of serious illness and death lies with older people or those with health conditions. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, one of the country's leading statisticians and a government adviser, pointed out the risk to anyone under 25 was ""trivial"", while researchers at Stanford University have said deaths in anyone under 65 without a pre-existing illness are ""remarkably uncommon"". It means the initial reaction to the statement - the government is planning to published more detailed guidance about its plans on Monday - is one of frustration, certainly in the scientific and medical community. Prof Trish Greenhalgh, a health care expert from the University of Oxford, perhaps best sums it up. She is worried we could now find ourselves in the ""worst of both worlds"" by both trying to move forward and kick-start the economy (by encouraging people to return to work) while maintaining the lockdown is effectively still in place. Employers will not yet have worked out how social distancing can be incorporated into everyday life, while its not clear how the public transport system can cope with more passengers given the reduction in service that has been seen during lockdown. It is, she says, the ""have cake and eat it"" maxim."
economic indicators,South Africa eases lockdown as virus cases fall,2024-09-15,2020-08-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53795339,"South Africa's president has said coronavirus infections appear to have peaked in the country, as he announced a sweeping relaxation of lockdown measures. President Cyril Ramaphosa said nearly all restrictions on the country's economy will be eased from Monday. A controversial ban on the sale of alcohol and tobacco will be lifted. Domestic travel, small family gatherings and the reopening of businesses will all be allowed. In a TV address on Saturday, Mr Ramaphosa said the easing of restrictions will help to revive the country's flagging economy after a period of great hardship for the country. However, he called on South Africans not to let their guard down against Covid-19 despite ""signs of hope"", warning of difficult times ahead. The country has recorded more than half of Africa's coronavirus infections, with more than 570,000 cases and 11,500 deaths to date. South Africa also has the fifth-highest number of cases in the world after the US, Brazil, Russia and India, but infections have started to dip in recent days. Mr Ramaphosa said the number of new daily confirmed cases had dropped from a peak of more than 12,000 to an average of 5,000 over the past week. The number of active cases has declined to about 105,000 and the recovery rate risen to 80%, the president said. ""As we look back at the past five months, all indications are the South Africa has reached the peak and moved beyond the inflection point of the curve,"" Mr Ramaphosa said. In March, the South African government introduced some of the toughest lockdown restrictions in the world. Borders were shut to international travellers, schools were closed, alcohol was banned and people were told to stay at home. Those measures were credited with slowing the initial spread of Covid-19, giving the health sector valuable time to prepare for more patients. Meanwhile, the economy faltered as businesses struggled to stay afloat during lockdown. To ease the economic pain, the government began a gradual reopening in June, but restrictions were reintroduced last month as infection rates began to rise again. A state of emergency was declared effective until 15 August. A large proportion of South Africa's coronavirus infections have been reported in Gauteng, the country's financial hub. The influx of patients has put an incredible strain on South Africa's hospitals. A BBC investigation found an array of systematic failures that had exhausted healthcare professionals and brought the health service in some areas near to collapse. This is a big moment for South Africa. Praising his government's response to the pandemic, President Ramaphosa spoke of a new phase, and signs of hope. And he has a point. The official death toll here is 11,000. But a quick, aggressive response has enabled most hospitals and provinces to contain an outbreak many feared would overwhelm the nation. The economic price has been devastating, though. President Ramaphosa spoke of hardship and hunger for millions, and warned it would take years to rebuild the economy. There are still big concerns about a second wave of infections, which, Mr Ramphosa warned, could be worse than the first.  But many South Africans - still sporting face masks in public - will be relieved that the lockdown is easing. Mr Ramaphosa said, as of midnight on 17 August, South Africa will move to level two of its five-stage coronavirus alert system.  ""The move to level two means that we can remove nearly all of the restrictions on the resumption of economic activity across most industries,"" Mr Ramaphosa said. Mr Ramaphosa said his government would end the ban on the sale of alcohol and tobacco. Alcohol sales were prohibited to ease pressure on hospitals, and tobacco products were restricted due to the risk of spreading Covid-19 via the sharing of cigarettes. The restrictions were unpopular, with bar and restaurant owners protesting against the ban on selling alcohol.  Mr Ramaphosa said travel between provinces will now be allowed, but restrictions on international arrivals will remain in place. He said other restrictions will remain in force as well, including a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people and crowds at sporting events."
economic indicators,Trade war infects Asia as exports plunge,2024-09-15,2019-07-17,By Karishma Vaswani,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49013571,"If you were in any doubt that the US-China trade war is having an impact on Asia, look no further than Singapore's latest export figures. Singapore saw exports fall for a second month in a row, this time by 17.3% in the month of June compared to a year ago.  This dramatic fall comes as Singapore's growth figures released last week showed a 3.4% decline in growth in comparison to the last quarter.  So why should you care if Singapore is selling less of its stuff to the world than it used to?  The city state is one of the most trade-dependent economies in the world, and is often seen as a global indicator for trade.  Analysts are calling Singapore's data the ""canary in the coal mine"", a reference to a well-worn expression to indicate there is danger ahead.  The phrase comes from when miners used to carry caged canaries into mine shafts, to let them know if it was dangerous. The canaries would die if there was even a hint of poisonous gas in the mines, providing a warning signal for the miners to get out.  The worry among Asia-watchers is that Singapore's numbers are just a sign of more bad news to come from the rest of the region.  There is increasing evidence to show that Asia's economies are being hit by the US-China trade war.  ""Around the region it is a similar story,"" says Song Seng Wun, South East Asia economist for CIMB Private Bank.  ""This trade war is coming at a time when global growth is slowing down after ten years of relatively stable times. Even if by some miracle a fairy taps her magic wand and the trade war disappears, all that would happen is that things would just be less bad - rather than really bad."" Data from India, Indonesia and South Korea reads like a list of bad news. June was a particularly gloomy month for the three countries.  India saw exports fall by 9.7%, the first time in nine months.   Indonesia, which counts China as its biggest trading partner, also saw exports fall by 8.98% in comparison with the same period last year.  And South Korea also saw exports fall by 13.5%.   All of these countries sell products ranging from palm oil and chemicals to semiconductor chips to China.  This week China posted the lowest quarterly growth it has seen in close to three decades, partly on trade war worries. US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods now cover more than half of what China sells to the US.  Which means that Chinese companies either have to cut their costs for their buyers, or sell less to the US.  And that means the countries supplying Chinese factories with products are also getting hit.  It doesn't look like it's going to get any better anytime soon.  A report from the Japanese research house Nomura released this week on Asian exports shows that exports ""should remain in the doldrums in the coming month"". Nomura blames this on the ""lack of progress on US-China trade negotiations"", heightened global uncertainty weighing on corporate investment decisions and signs that trade protectionism is being used as a ""weapon of foreign policy"" around the region.  It isn't entirely clear yet when or if the US-China trade war will come to a resolution - or whether this is the start of a ""broader shift in US policy away from free trade"", as think tank Capital Economics points out.  Mr Trump has already indicated that Vietnam - which up to now has been a beneficiary of the US-China trade war - could be next on his tariff list, and economists say Taiwan and South Korea could also be next in line.  Asia is home to the world's next generation of companies and consumers.  By 2050 it could see its share of the global economy grow to 52%, according to the Asian Development Bank - which means the region would also be the main driver of global growth.   But analysts say if the US's anti-free trade trend continues and hits more of Asia's economies, that could hurt the region's long term potential growth rate - in turn hurting the rest of us."
economic indicators,Scotland: 'The Saudi Arabia of renewables'?,2024-09-15,2020-11-02,By Claire Diamond,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-54441613,"""As Saudi Arabia is to oil, the UK is to wind"" - that's how Boris Johnson described the country's potential to capitalise on renewable energy recently. For Scotland, it's not the first time comparisons have been drawn with Saudi Arabia.  Back when he was first minister, Alex Salmond said Scotland had the potential to be the ""Saudi Arabia of renewables"".  With a year to go until Glasgow hosts COP26, a UN climate change conference, BBC Scotland considers how renewable energy has developed.  The PM said: ""As Saudi Arabia is to oil, the UK is to wind - a place of almost limitless resource, but in the case of wind without the carbon emissions and without the damage to the environment. ""We've got huge, huge gusts of wind going around the north of our country - Scotland. Quite extraordinary potential we have for wind."" So the comparison is a reference to the scale of resources available - Saudi Arabia has a lot of oil reserves and was once the biggest oil producer in the world.  It has since been eclipsed in production by the US but remains the largest exporter.  Well, Scotland is one of the windiest countries in Europe.  So in terms of resource for wind power, there is a comparison to be drawn. And the UK also has plenty space to build offshore wind farms.   But there are challenges to be overcome.  The energy generated by renewable means can't be moved about as easily as oil which can be shipped around the world in tanks. The development of wind power requires networks to be built to deliver that electricity to where it's needed.  The wind doesn't blow to order, so sometimes storage systems are required as well so energy is available when the need is greatest.  Another approach is to use renewable energy to produce transportable fuels, such as hydrogen, but that technology is still at a relatively early stage of development.  Back in 2009, only 27.2% of Scotland's electricity came from renewable energy sources. It was 90.1% in 2019.  The Scottish government has set a target of having the equivalent of 100% of Scotland's electricity demand coming from renewable energy sources by the end of 2020.  In order to achieve this, Scotland has been moving away from burning fossil fuels, with the last coal-fired power station, Longannet, closing in 2016. The only remaining gas-fired power station is at Peterhead in Aberdeenshire.      Onshore wind delivers about 70% of capacity, followed by hydro and offshore wind as Scotland's main sources of renewable power. Scotland's largest single source is the Beatrice offshore wind farm. Its 84 turbines - each with three 75m (246ft) blades - went into operation last year. The wind farm is is capable of generating enough power for 450,000 homes. The Seagreen Wind Farm, under construction off Angus, will eventually be even bigger and able to power 1.3m homes. Some argue that Scotland's wind power sector could have been better established by now had it not faced delays in its infancy.  Major offshore wind farm projects were stalled after conservationists opposed the developments over concerns for birds. And who could forget Donald Trump's opposition to a major North Sea wind power development, on the grounds that it would spoil the view from his Aberdeenshire golf course. Given that more than 90% of Scotland's electricity needs are already met by renewable energy, you might think we're most of the way there to providing all the electricity the country needs.  Once that extra 10% is achieved, though, there will still be a way to go.  The whole point of renewable energy is to find an alternative to fossil fuels.  So pretty much all the things that currently use fossil fuels will have to be switched over to greener energy sources - that will massively increase the demand for renewable electricity. The Climate Change Committee predicts ""around a doubling of today's electricity demand"" through the transition to electric vehicles and low carbon heating. Scotland's renewable energy industry has been around for about 20 years, and continues to grow.  While the oil and gas industry has been around for more than 50 years, production peaked in 1999 and has been falling since. When it comes to their economic impact, renewable energy was worth £3.3bn in added value to the Scottish economy in 2018, while oil and gas extraction from Scottish waters with the support industry around that was worth £11.6bn.  When it comes to jobs, about six times as many people are employed by the oil and gas sector. It supports about 110,000 jobs here.   While the number of people working in Scotland's renewables sector has grown, the most recent figures available said in Scotland the sector employed 17,700 people.  Producing oil and gas is operationally intensive. Oil and Gas UK estimate that there are about 10,000 people working off shore at any one time.  After construction, the Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm resulted in about 370 jobs a year.  While more jobs are involved in construction, often Scotland loses out as contracts are awarded overseas.  Overseas yards are able to build at scale and do it cheaper. They may also gain from government subsidy on a scale which the Scottish government says it isn't legally allowed to provide because of state aid rules.  Before highlighting Scotland's potential to harness renewable energy in general, Alex Salmond was saying (back in 2008) that Scotland could be ""the Saudi Arabia of tidal power"".  But the promise of tidal power has struggled to come to fruition.  Today, it still has some big challenges to overcome before it contributes energy to the grid in a meaningful way.  However, there is one tidal generator that has shown promise - it generated more electricity in its first year than Scotland's entire wave and tidal sector had produced before it. When the oil came in the 60s and 70s it was like all Scotland's economic Christmases had come at once. In no time at all an entire industry had grown from the black stuff and in the North East many were living the high life. However, that windfall for Aberdeen was thanks to a fluke of nature; it was the nearest North Sea port to where the drillers struck lucky. That's not quite the case with wind.  It's everywhere.   But in fact Scotland is one of the windiest places in Europe with one of the largest bodies of sea. And so the potential for offshore wind far exceeds what Scotland could consume meaning we're on course to be a net-exporter and putting the nation in the driving seat of this second energy revolution."

economic indicators,Why do Welsh place names appear around the world?,2024-09-15,2019-08-11,By Caleb Spencer,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-49240433,"Why does Swansea pop up on the map several times in the USA and Australia? How did magnificent Milford Sound in New Zealand come to bear the name of Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire? And what is the story behind Llandudno in Cape Town, South Africa? The answer, according to Swansea University's Gethin Matthews, is fairly complicated but relates to how Welsh skills in heavy industries were highly sought after. ""It's all about economics - Irish emigration was much more about desperation, while Welsh emigration was driven by aspiration,"" he said. The story involves a Welshman who played a major role in extending the American Civil War and a Swansea businessman who built a copper smelting plant in the Arizonan desert. Dr Matthews said the biggest wave of Welsh emigration came in the late 19th Century. Scranton, Wilkes-Barre and Pittsburgh, all in Pennsylvania, had the biggest Welsh populations before 1900, Dr Matthews said. Many of these places were likely given their names during the first wave of religious migrants between 1682 and 1700. But the figures are sketchy. For example, estimates of the number of Welsh people who emigrated to the United States between 1820 and 1950 range from 90,000 to 300,000. Most of these lived in Pennsylvania and Ohio, with relatively smaller numbers spread across New York, Illinois, Wisconsin and Iowa. From the 1850s onwards, emigrants were able to cross the Atlantic on steam ships within two weeks, although the trip to Australia would have been far more unpleasant. In Australia, Dr Matthews said many of the ""obvious"" examples of Welsh place names were in New South Wales or Tasmania, which have towns called Neath and Swansea. But bearing the name of a Welsh town or city was not necessarily a good indicator of the level of Welsh immigration, he added. Swansea-born George Mitchell emigrated to the USA in 1888 and established a massive copper smelting plant in Arizona. The new town would be named after his birthplace. ""Unfortunately he didn't think through that you need more coal than copper ore,"" Dr Matthews explained. ""He had lots of copper ore but it cost more to build a rail road to get coal there and he blew a fortune."" Welsh expertise was highly sought after in two particular fields: coal and iron. Prof Anne Knowles, who teaches at the University of Maine, has written about Welsh agricultural and industrial migration to the USA. She taught at Aberystwyth University in the 1990s and has descendents from Llanbrynmair, in the county now known as Powys. ""Welsh iron workers could demand a premium in wages,"" Prof Knowles explained. Rhys Davies, from Tredegar, was ""very skilled"" and ""knew how to build a first-class iron works"". He left south Wales in 1833 to help build an ironworks in Richmond, Virginia. The works he designed and helped build - named the Tredegar Ironworks - extended the American Civil War by giving the Confederate South a huge arsenal. Prof Knowles said Welsh workers also introduced the idea of organised labour and class identity. But this brought them into conflict with owners and managers, who liked their expertise but not their assertiveness. ""People who owned the iron works - Americans - quite clearly didn't want to put up with 'uppity' workers. Welsh workers were more independent and went on strike."" The Welsh workers also refused to work with slaves. ""Slaves were much more reliable, and it was clear to the workers that if they trained the slaves, they would be training their replacement. ""There was no feeling of anti-slavery. I certainly found no evidence of that - they were as racist as the rest."" Many of the agricultural emigrants came from an area called Mynydd Bach in what is now central Ceredigion. Land was scarce for farmers in mid Wales and the lure of the abundance of America was strong. One farmer who gave into temptation was a man from Pontrhydfendigaid called Richard Jones, who kept sheep on a farm called Bronberllan. ""That is what he named his farm in Wisconsin,"" said Prof Knowles. His farm in Wisconsin was 200 acres (81 hectares) compared with 20 acres in Wales, according to Prof Knowles. ""He was known as King Jones because he was wealthy and had the biggest house around,"" she added. While Prof Knowles was living in Madison, Wisconsin, she was taught Welsh by a woman called Eluned Evans, from Llanerfyl in Powys, who would later develop Alzheimer's disease. ""When I went to see her recently she seemed pretty out of touch,"" she explained. ""I started talking to her about Llenerfyl and Llanbrynmair, and she turned to me and said 'I know a girl from Llanbrynmair' and started reminiscing about her and how she taught her Welsh. ""It showed me in a very personal way the emotion attached to place names and why people named these new places they were coming to after their home in Wales."""
economic indicators,South Africa: the economic challenge,2024-09-15,2018-02-16,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43073781,"South Africa's new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, will have a daunting in-tray, including a formidable economic agenda to tackle. Growth under Jacob Zuma's leadership has been weak and unemployment is painfully high.  It is one of the most unequal countries on the planet - the legacy of apartheid is still evident. And businesses face many barriers that make it harder to contribute to addressing these problems. Here are some figures to set out the challenge. Over the last decade, the South African economy has grown at an average annual rate of 1.4%. An emerging economy should be able to manage much better, perhaps something close to 5%. Turkey and Malaysia both have, and China, in spite of its much vaunted slowdown, has done a good deal better. South Africa's growth in the last few years has weakened to such an extent that it's slower than the increase in population. GDP (gross domestic product) per person, which is a rough and ready indicator of average living standards, has declined. The unemployment rate is worse than one in four.   The degree of inequality is extraordinary. A measure that's often used is the Gini coefficient, which ranges theoretically between zero for complete equality and 100 where all the income goes to a single person.  In the most equal countries, Nordic and some other European countries, the figure is in the mid to high 20s, for the UK it's in the mid-30s and the US around 40. For South Africa it's more than 60. So the new leader has plenty on his agenda. Land reform is an area which will be hard to resolve. Here too, South Africa's troubled history is in the air. Enabling the black majority to own land was always an important principle for Mr Ramaphosa's ruling African National Congress.  But in practice it has been controversial and beset by problems. Much of the land that has been redistributed is now unproductive. How to address that will be an important question for the new president. As a warning for how wrong land reform can go if it's done badly, there is the disastrous example of neighbouring Zimbabwe, where it led to a collapse of agriculture and contributed to hyperinflation. Education is particularly important. South Africa's performance is weaker than it should be. Ensuring more young complete their education and acquire basic skills would make them more employable.   The IMF says weak educational attainment ""contributes to wide income disparities and high unemployment, perpetuates the intergenerational transmission of poverty, and constrains economic growth."" In part the problem reflects the long shadow of apartheid. Many teachers received inadequate education themselves as they were schooled under apartheid. There is also the big issue of corruption that has hung over the Zuma presidency. Last year, the anti-corruption campaign group Transparency International supported a no confidence motion against the former President, because of what they called ""the mounting evidence of grand corruption and state capture"".   Quite apart from the ethical concerns, corruption can come with heavy economic costs, and there are concerns in South Africa that the political uncertainty surrounding the previous leader has weighed down on business investment. There are some key energy services that businesses need that are ripe for improvement, notably energy transport and telecommunications. State owned enterprises are key players in these areas, and the International Monetary Fund has called for steps to make it easier for private sector suppliers to get involved.   The IMF says availability of power is no longer a constraint on economic activity, but more competition for the state owned utility would be useful. It could help reduce prices. In transport, one specific issue mentioned by the IMF is that port tariffs are high and also the allocation of broadband spectrum has been a problem.  The IMF also presses for labour market reform, to make it easier for young people to get their first job, and give small firms more flexibility. And there is the standard agenda for any government - including managing its own finances. Government borrowing is quite high in South Africa and the burden of accumulated debt has risen markedly in the last decade. Two of the three major credit rating agencies classify South African government debt at a level known informally in finance as ""junk"". The budget, due next week, is likely to include tax increases. Still, if the new president can make progress on the rest of the economic agenda and get some decent growth it would do a lot to reinforce the public sector's financial position. "
economic indicators,Sunshine factor in business performance,2024-09-15,2018-09-10,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-45471779,"Growth in the Northern Ireland private sector eased in August after a strong performance in June and July, Ulster Bank data has suggested. The bank surveys private sector activity monthly in what is considered a reliable indicator of the economy. The August survey saw overall business activity expand at its weakest rate since April. Manufacturing saw the strongest performance with a notable growth in new orders. The bank's chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said the weather again appears to have had an influence. ""In the early part of 2018, the Beast from the East disrupted business activity, therefore impacting on output.  ""More recently, the incredibly good weather has been cited as a major factor behind faster rates of growth in the private sector during June and July.  ""Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the milder weather, August saw something of a slowdown."" Mr Ramsey said it would become clearer in the coming months if the latest slowdown is simply an easing back from June and July's weather-related high or whether an underlying weakness was emerging. "
economic indicators,US jobs growth picks up speed amid reopening,2024-09-15,2021-07-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57697649,"US jobs growth picked up speed in June as the economic reopening continued, official figures show. Employers created a larger-than-expected 850,000 jobs last month, driven by new posts in bars and restaurants, retail and education. Despite the boost in hiring, the unemployment rate was little changed at 5.9%, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics said. It comes as different industries offer incentives to battle a worker shortage. Although the number of job vacancies has seen a record high of 9.3 million, firms such as McDonald's and Chipotle in the hospitality industry, for example, have increased the minimum wages in their company restaurants to try to entice new staff. The new monthly figures showed that average hourly earnings rose 0.3% last month after increasing 0.4% in May.  Although more than half of the jobs added in June were in leisure and hospitality, employment in those sectors is still down by about 2.2 million on pre-pandemic levels. But President Biden said the figures marked ""historic progress pulling our economy out of the worst crisis in a hundred years."" He said on Friday: ""We've now created over three million jobs since I took office, more jobs than have ever been created in the first five months of any presidency in modern history, thanks to the incredible work of the entire team."" And some experts said the figures suggested a recovery was ""well underway"". ""Key for us was the fact that jobs gains were led by the services sector, signalling the strong positive momentum in these areas,"" said Xian Chan, chief investment officer of wealth management at HSBC. ""It also reminds us what a difference a year makes! In April last year, about 15% of people in the US were unemployed - a figure worse than the global financial crisis."" He said that in contrast, it now looks like there are not enough workers to fill vacant positions. Surveys have suggested that some people are hesitant to re-enter the workforce because of healthcare risks, child-care issues and unemployment benefits. Under the $1.9tn coronavirus rescue package that President Joe Biden signed into law in March, some workers can get a $300 weekly supplemental benefit if they are out of a job. But at least 25 states have opted to cut unemployment benefits prematurely, so people are not persuaded to stay at home. ""With economic growth booming, labour demand is strong and job openings have risen to all-time highs,"" said John Leiper, chief investment officer at Tavistock Wealth. ""Now it's just a case of letting supply catch up."" As part of its decision on when and how to tackle the rising cost of living, the Federal Reserve is monitoring unemployment and wage increases as supply in the labour market remains tight. Mr Leiper added the better-than-expected June figures ""make it more likely the Fed will pull back sooner, and with greater force, than currently anticipated."" Fed officials, including its chair Jerome Powell, have played down worries, saying that rising costs reflect ""transitory factors"" as the economy reopens. He recently said it was important to continue support as the recovery from the Covid crisis is still underway. ""The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit,"" he said in June. It was certainly a strong figure for a single month's job gains as the US labour market continued to repair the damage done to it by the pandemic.  That was reflected in the large contribution from leisure and hospitality, industries that have been hit very badly and which are now responding to the easing of restrictions.  But there is still a long way to go. The number with a job, though much improved on last year's low, is still 6.8 million below its pre-pandemic peak. It is even further adrift of what it would have been without the health crisis as job growth would otherwise surely have continued.  The number of unemployed is also far below its worst, but is still higher than before the arrival of the coronavirus. Another important statistic is the number of people classified as not in the labour force, which covers people who don't have and are not seeking work.  Many of the 100 million or so Americans in that group are there because they want to be - they may be homemakers, students or retired. But many are not, some thinking the opportunities are not available.  The fact that the number is five million higher than at the start of last year is another indicator that the jobs recovery is far from complete. "
economic indicators,China property giant warns of up to $7.6bn loss,2024-09-15,2023-08-11,By Peter Hoskins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66470170,"Country Garden, which is one of China's biggest property developers, has warned that it could see a loss of up to $7.6bn (£6bn) for the first six months of the year. The announcement is the latest sign of the major issues faced by the world's second largest economy. This week official figures showed China had slipped into deflation for the first time in more than two years. Exports have also fallen sharply, while youth unemployment is at a record high. Shares in Country Garden Holdings were down by more than 5% in Hong Kong trade on Friday afternoon. Country Garden ""is expected to record a net loss ranging from approximately RMB45 billion [$6.24bn; £4.9bn] to RMB55 billion for the six months ended 30 June 2023,"" the company said in an announcement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The expected loss compares to a $265m profit for the same time last year. The firm also said it has set up a special task force, headed by its chairman Yang Huiyan, to find ways to turn the business around. Earlier on Thursday, rating agency Moody's downgraded the company's rating, citing ""heightened liquidity and refinancing risks"". It came as China faced a number of economic challenges, which have raised questions about the pace of its post-pandemic recovery. Earlier this week, official figures showed the country's exports fell by a larger-than-expected 14.5% in July compared with a year earlier, while imports dropped 12.4%. Youth unemployment, which is at a record high, is also being closely watched as a record 11.58 million university graduates are expected to enter the job market this year. On Thursday, US President Joe Biden said China's growing economic issues make it a ""ticking time bomb."" At a fundraising event in the western state of Utah, Mr Biden also said ""China is in trouble"" as he highlighted its high unemployment and aging workforce. The country is also tackling ballooning local government debt and challenges in the housing market. Last month, Evergrande, which was once China's biggest real estate firm, revealed that in 2021 and 2022 it lost a combined $81.1bn. It came as the firm, which defaulted on its debts in late-2021, reported its long overdue earnings to investors. Evergrande has been struggling with an estimated $300bn of debts. The huge losses highlight how much the developer was rocked in recent years by the property market crisis in China. Problems in China's property sector - which includes everything from building homes to industries making white goods that go in them - can have a major impact on the country as it accounts for around a third of the economy."
economic indicators,UK considers joining new European nations club,2024-09-15,2022-09-20,By Jessica Parker,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-62967084,"The UK is weighing up whether to attend a new European political ""club of nations"" next month. The first meeting of the ""European Political Community"" is due to be held in Prague in early October.  Downing Street wants to see more detail on the summit before Prime Minister Liz Truss commits to attending it and no final decision has been made. The European Political Community is an idea championed by the French President Emmanuel Macron. He proposed it, in May, as a ""new space"" for co-operation. Mr Macron suggested the group could discuss security, energy and transport as well as the movement of people, particularly the young. The broad intention is to establish a forum that goes beyond the immediate 27 EU member states. Similar ideas have been floated for decades but this is the first big push for such a forum since Brexit. UK officials are said to be seeking assurances that the meeting will not be too dominated by EU countries or institutions.  Britain would want to see other ""big players"" from outside the EU in attendance. All 27 members of the EU are set to be invited as well as the UK, Ukraine, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey. Six Western Balkans nations are also likely to be invited, along with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. EU officials have told the BBC that a ""save the date"" memo has gone to capitals, with formal invitations to follow. But, before responding, there are indications Britain also wants to consult Ukraine's government, as well as the defensive military alliance, Nato. The inaugural meeting of the ""European Political Community"" is due to take place on 6 October in the Czech capital, Prague. The Czech Republic currently holds the rotating European Council presidency. A provisional agenda suggests discussions would centre on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the economy and Europe's energy crisis. However, there are few details about what such a ""political community"" would look like in the longer-term.  Critics, within the EU, are wary of what they see as a ""vague"" French-led project. There's also suspicion that France, a known sceptic of EU expansion, wants to create a ""parking lot"" for countries who aspire to join the European Union. EU leaders have insisted the community would not ""replace"" its enlargement policy.   Ukraine became an official EU candidate country in June while numerous Western Balkans nations have been in the process of trying to join the bloc for years. Getting Britain around the table, to discuss core issues facing the continent, is now a key aim - according to some EU diplomats. There are hopes the gloomy economic outlook and energy crisis could bring Liz Truss to the table. However, there are concerns that the new UK prime minister will ultimately turn down the offer, in part to avoid antagonising some Conservative Eurosceptics. Timing has also been raised as an issue with the summit taking place just a day after the Conservative party conference. Ms Truss previously rejected the idea of British participation. As foreign secretary, she said that Nato and the G7 were the UK's ""key"" military and economic alliances. Her predecessor as prime minister, Boris Johnson, appeared to express interest in the proposal, even claiming ""paternity"" of it.  The new UK government is said to have given the issue ""limited"" attention so far, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II. Ms Truss is expected to hold talks with President Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the UN General Assembly in New York, within the coming days. Relations between Brussels and London have been strained by the row about post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland; an issue the pair are expected to discuss."
economic indicators,NI exporters 'benefit from weaker pound',2024-09-15,2017-10-09,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-41526616,"Northern Ireland exporters are continuing to benefit from a weaker pound, an Ulster Bank survey suggests. The bank surveys private sector activity monthly, in what is considered to be a reliable indicator. The September survey showed the strongest rate of output growth this year, with the service sector showing greatest growth. Respondents also said that extra staff were taken on to deal with increasing workloads. That suggests that unemployment in Northern Ireland could continue to fall in coming months. Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank's chief economist, said Northern Ireland's private sector ""continued to defy political and economic uncertainty"" in September. It saw marked increases in output and new orders that were ""both the fastest in 2017 so far"", he added. ""Local firms are also faring better than their counterparts across the UK as a whole at present, with the acceleration in growth contrasting with signs of a slowdown at the UK level,"" Mr Ramsey said. ""Part of the improvement in new business was reflective of continued growth of new export orders."" Most economists forecast only slight growth in the Northern Ireland economy as a whole this year. That is because growth in the relatively small exporting sector is expected to be offset by continuing public sector austerity and weaker consumer spending."
economic indicators,How Kim the outcast became popular,2024-09-15,2018-06-06,By Laura Bicker,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44368321,"Kim Jong-un has suddenly become the new popular leader in the political class of 2018.  After years in isolation, he has emerged as a powerful player. Leaders from China, Russia, Syria, South Korea and the US have all met or are due to meet Mr Kim this year. They are literally lining up. Vladimir Putin has just extended an invitation for him to come to Vladivostock in September and Syria's President Assad has said he would also like to visit Pyongyang. ""We are witnessing the making of 'Kim Jong-un, international statesman',"" said Jean Lee, the former Associated Press bureau chief in Pyongyang. ""This is such a different international debut than we saw in 2010, when Kim Jong-un stepped forward as the unknown, baby-faced heir apparent. ""Now, with a proven intercontinental ballistic missile under his belt, Kim is stepping out as the leader of a country that sees itself as a nuclear power on par with the world's other nuclear powers, including the United States. "" This is of course the kind of prize he was looking for when he accelerated his missile testing programme in 2017, as Ken Gause, the author of North Korean House of Cards, points out in a recent essay. ""Kim Jong-un most likely came to the conclusion that the only way to ensure success on the diplomatic front was to escalate to de-escalate… North Korea would have to force its way to the negotiating table from a position of strength. "" But little did Kim Jong-un know he was going to get THE prize. A summit with the US president. It gave him the diplomatic street cred he was hoping for. And it also offered him an opportunity to say North Korea was open for business. ""Kim has kept himself at arm's length with the outside world for such a long time that foreign officials do tend to jump at the chance to meet him, if only to gain insight into who he is and what he wants for his country,"" says Jean Lee. And jump they have. Two things helped Kim Jong-un's new diplomatic outreach. South Korea elected a liberal president who campaigned with the promise to engage with North Korea. This allowed him to establish a relationship with his neighbour.  Then came the invitation to the US president. Previous commanders-in-chief had wanted some kind of guarantees in place before a summit.  But not Donald Trump. The unpredictable US president who'd spent a year threatening Pyongyang with a pre-emptive strike made a snap decision to agree to face to face talks.  When Mr Kim walks out to greet Donald Trump in Singapore, it's worth remembering that in just six months he has gone from complete international isolation to being one of two leaders at the centre of one the world's biggest geo-political dramas.  The summit itself has given Kim Jong-un political leverage. This new diplomatic strategy does not just arise from a position of strength, but also out of necessity.  Having declared that his weapons programme was complete, Mr Kim announced that his main focus would be on the economy. To do that he needed to forge alliances and rebuild old friendships.  First stop was, of course, China, North Korea's main trading partner. President Xi Jinping helped enforce Donald Trump's maximum pressure strategy at the end of 2017, cutting off vital supplies much to the disgust of Pyongyang. The state even turned away a Chinese envoy when he tried to visit at the end of last year.  But now Kim Jong-un has caught the travel bug. Two visits to China in under two months. First to Beijing and then to Dalian in early May where he took a stroll along the beach with President Xi and apparently talked trade.  It had echoes of his historic meeting in April at the Korean border with the South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Just friends taking a walk, talking about the future of their two countries. Kim Jong-un has looked willing to engage in a way his father and grandfather never were. It's worth noting the timing of his China trips. Each visit was made just days before Mr Kim met the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. A cunning strategic move which may have allowed him to play one off against the other.  China is in favour of a slower approach to denuclearisation and would prefer sanctions to be lifted to keep North Korea's economy stable.  Mr Kim can turn around to the US and say - look who I've got in my corner. He made a similar move using Moscow as leverage just last week. Former North Korean spy chief Kim Yong-chol was on his way to the United States with his leader's rather large letter, when Kim Jong-un decided now was the time to welcome the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to Pyongyang.  It was the first visit by a senior Russian diplomat in over a decade. It may of course have been a coincidence, but Donald Trump wasn't happy about it. ""I didn't like the Russian meeting. I said what's the purpose of the Russian meeting? If it's a positive meeting, I love it. If it's a negative meeting, I'm not happy,"" he told reporters. He may have good reason not to be happy. Russia views itself as an alternative moderator in any denuclearisation discussions. It shares a border with North Korea and key economic interests. So if Washington thought North Korea was trapped in a corner, Kim Jong-un was sending them a message and parading his other options. Adam Mount from the Federation of American Scientists told me: ""Each new relationship provides leverage against American efforts to pressure the regime. Outreach to Beijing has made sanctions relief a virtual certainty, especially given that the Trump team has positioned itself as the one endangering a peace process.  ""Growing indications of an alignment with Moscow are particularly worrisome. If they continue to expand, they could afford Pyongyang a variety of ways to break out of containment in the future."" Syrian President Bashar-al Assad's relationship with Pyongyang is one that may also worry the US and the UN.  The North's state-run media agency said that he plans to make a visit to Pyongyang.  It is an old alliance. The North established diplomatic relations with Syria in 1966 and sent troops and weapons to the country during the Arab-Israeli war in October 1973.  A UN report leaked in February accused the North of making 40 shipments to Syria between 2012 and 2017 of materials including acid-resistant tiles, valves and pipes that could be used to make chemical weapons. The international community will be now watching this particular alliance even more carefully.  But not everything has gone North Korea's way.   Pyongyang's vice-foreign minister last month issued a harsh statement which criticised US Vice-President Mike Pence as ""stupid"" and warned the United States that it faced a nuclear showdown if diplomacy failed.  Most on the Korean peninsula know this is typical North Korean rhetoric and the South Korean administration has been very careful not to react to similar swipes.  It was also perhaps utterly predictable after Mr Pence and National Security Adviser John Bolton both compared nuclear disarmament in North Korea to Libya. But the words rattled the White House. It gave Donald Trump ammunition to walk away and cancel the summit. I heard so many analysts from Washington on that night as I reported from Seoul wondering if Pyongyang would go on the offensive, maybe even test another missile. They didn't. Instead they attempted to take the moral high ground. There was a hastily arranged meeting with President Moon at the border to smooth things over with the South.  Kim Jong-un hugged his neighbour - a gesture designed perhaps to portray a gentler side. He then despatched his right hand man to New York to try to get things back on track and wrote President Trump that now famous letter. Some may have felt there was a whiff of desperation from the North Korean leader. Perhaps he seemed a little too eager to save his prized summit which he saw slipping away.  But luckily for him, it paled in comparison to the daily dramas of the White House. And many wondered if Donald Trump really knew what he was doing. As sociologist Aidan Foster Carter tweeted: Kim Jong-un has changed the rules of the game. Last year his nuclear arsenal was a liability, now he has turned them into a diplomatic tool.  But what is North Korea's end game? And what happens after the summit?  Former US state department official Joel Wit, who also founded the North Korea analysis site 38North, told a press briefing: ""This isn't a 'charm offensive', this isn't a sort of tactical trick. There is enormous momentum in Pyongyang behind what they're doing. I personally don't think it's because of sanctions.   ""That may have played a small role.  But it's something they decided internally and it has to do with the size of their nuclear arsenal, the missiles, the desire for modernization of their economy.  All of these different issues have sort of come together at this moment. ""And I think what you need to do is pay attention to what the North Koreans are saying. It's not just propaganda.  He doesn't just say things. This is a new formulation that is very important."""
economic indicators,Who really influences the price of oil?,2024-09-15,2018-12-07,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-46468678,"Opec, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has certainly had its share of criticism over many years.  President Trump recently accused the group of ""ripping off the rest of the world"" and keeping oil prices ""artificially high"". It has sometimes been charged with holding the world to ransom - notably in the mid-1970s when it cut supplies and the price tripled.  But as Opec energy ministers meet in Vienna, does the group really wield that much influence any more? They are being joined by some non-member oil-producing countries, notably Russia. The group wants to stabilise or increase crude oil prices, which turned sharply downwards in early October.   The main tool it has is to manage its own production levels - either by cutting if it wants prices to rise or increasing supplies if it wants them to fall, at least to a point that would not cause prices to collapse. Opec's presence in the market is certainly big enough to make an impact.  It accounts for more than 40% of global crude oil production. It was higher - more than half in the early 1970s - but the current figure is still a substantial share.  But the other 60% of the industry also matters.  Two non-Opec countries are especially important in different ways: Russia and the United States.  Russia has contributed to Opec's current effort to move prices higher. It began in 2016 with an Opec decision ""to implement a production adjustment"", which means a cut of 1.2 million barrels a day.  Crucially, Russia and a number of other non-Opec members joined in the effort with their own commitments to restrain production.  Following that, prices did gain with the main international price, Brent Crude, reaching $86 (£67) a barrel in early October - it was below $50 a barrel in the period before that decision.   That is not to say the decision by Opec and partners was the only factor.  Political turmoil in Opec countries Venezuela, Libya and Nigeria has made it impossible for them to produce the amount of oil that in theory they could.  Iran has been hit by the reimposition of US sanctions over its nuclear programme. The possibility that Iran's oil might be unavailable to the global market - or that there would be less of it - has been an important factor pushing prices higher this year.   But some of Iran's biggest customers - China, India and Japan - have been given temporary exemptions and can continue to buy Iranian oil for now without being hit by US action.  As a result, prices actually turned down as there was less demand for oil from other producers than had been expected. That said, the rise in prices since late 2016 did owe something to the agreement between Opec, Russia and others.  Within Opec, Saudi Arabia has been key.  According to estimates from the International Energy Agency, Saudi Arabia accounts for more than a third of Opec's total production capacity and more than half of the group's spare capacity.  That is an indicator of the extent to which production is being restrained.  Important though Saudi Arabia is, it was reluctant to act alone over prices.   So it expected, as it generally does, other Opec members to make some sacrifice, but it also wanted Russia involved.   There is a third very large player in the global business; the United States, currently the biggest producer of all.  The US is a very different beast from the others.  Oil is produced by private industry making decisions on the basis of what is profitable. Russia's big oil companies are close to the government and the dominant firm in Saudi Arabia - Saudi Aramco - is state-owned.  American oil producers do not co-operate with Opec to manage prices, because that would be illegal under US anti-trust or competition law. But something has happened in the US in the last decade or so that has transformed the global industry - the rise of shale oil.  There are two important aspects to this. The exploitation of a relatively new type of resource has reversed a long-term decline in US oil output.   The country still has to import oil.  But now it can meet two-thirds of its own needs whereas just over a decade ago, it was one-third.  Also shale can respond more quickly to a changing market.   It does not need such large-scale investment as conventional oil. The investor can get their money back much more quickly, so shale output can be boosted more rapidly when prices start to rise.   Shale was one of the reasons that oil prices fell sharply after mid-2014. One possible reason Opec did not respond sooner than it did was a desire on the part of some members, notably Saudi Arabia, to see US shale producers squeezed by lower prices.  Opec does still matter, but it is far from being fully in charge of the global oil market. And in the longer term, if global efforts to address climate change mean we become less reliant on oil - a big if perhaps - then Opec will matter a great deal less.

economic indicators,China fights a 'war on two fronts',2024-09-15,2018-10-19,By Karishma Vaswani,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45898619,"The world's second largest economy is losing steam and with some big risks on the horizon, that slowdown is likely to continue.  Data released on Friday show China's economy grew at an annual pace of 6.5%.  That's a slight slowdown from the previous quarter when China grew by 6.7% - but this is the lowest reading since the first quarter of 2009 when China's growth tanked in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, growing by just 6.2%.  You should always have some healthy scepticism around China's official growth figures, but they remain a relatively useful indicator of the trajectory of the economy.  These figures are also the first to be released by the Chinese government since US President Donald Trump hit China with two sets of tariffs since July, encompassing $250bn (£192bn) worth of Chinese goods, which will add weight to the current narrative that China's economy is under pressure from the trade war.  But it is worth bearing in mind that China's economy was already slowing down before the trade war between Washington and Beijing kicked into high gear earlier this year. This has been a managed transition - a decision the government said it needed to take to focus on quality of growth, not quantity.  There's no denying, though, that the trade war has changed that narrative. While this set of data doesn't necessarily show that the trade war has hit China just yet, there will almost certainly be more pain to come.  ""There's been no discernible impact on end demand that we've seen yet from our industry contacts,"" Vinesh Motwani of Silk Road Research told me, after a recent trip back from Beijing and Shanghai.  He spends a lot of time on the mainland, talking to medium-sized Chinese owned businesses about their outlook. ""In fact, if anything we're seeing some companies benefit from a short term tailwind as a result of the trade war. That's because American customers were trying to buy as much as they can from China before the tariffs kicked in."" Still, this may just be a blip on the radar because longer term, as Mr Motwani points out, the outlook is grim.  ""Unanimously, what businesses there are worried about is the uncertainty of the trade war. If there was no trade war, Chinese companies would be far more optimistic about 2019."" That grim outlook on the ground is being echoed by economic forecasts too. A number of investment banks, the International Monetary Fund and the Economist Intelligence Unit have all lowered their China growth forecasts to 6.2% in 2019, on the back of the trade war.  All of this comes at a time when China's typical engines of growth - fixed asset investment, consumption and exports - are slowing down.  As one China observer told me during my trip to Beijing last month, the country wasn't expecting to fight a trade war at a time that it was also trying to manage systemic risks in the economy.  And it's not like they have a lot of options on the table. Policymakers are unlikely to pump massive stimulus into the economy the way they did after 2008. Partly that's because of that new focus on the quality of growth, rather than just growth.  The other problem is that China has racked up an extraordinary amount of debt in the economy - by some estimates close to 300% of GDP - and that's the major risk it is trying to manage.  This means that now Beijing is fighting a war on two fronts, without all of the cavalry at its disposal. And it's fighting an increasingly unpredictable and volatile enemy, in the form of an aggressive US administration. None of which bodes well for China's economic growth outlook. "
economic indicators,China's economic slowdown: How bad is it?,2024-09-15,2019-09-26,By Ana Nicolaci da Costa ,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49791721,"China's economy has been slowing for the better part of the past decade, but a recent run of poor data has prompted fresh concerns. What is making investors nervous, and how China has responded? China became a key engine of world economic growth as developed countries licked their wounds after the 2008 global financial crisis.  Now, the world's second-largest economy is expanding at its slowest pace since the early 1990s. China saw industrial output grow at its slowest pace since 2002 in August.  Weeks later China's Premier Li Keqiang said it would not be easy for the country to sustain growth rates of above 6%.  Domestic issues, the US-led trade war, and swine fever are all putting a brake on China's rapid expansion. ""The slowdown in China is becoming quite significant,"" says Tommy Wu, senior Asia economist at Oxford Economics. ""Both the weakening in the domestic economy and deteriorating external environment, including both a global slowdown, and the US-China trade tensions, have a role to play in China's slowdown."" Given China's importance in the global economy, and its healthy demand for anything from commodities to machinery, any downturn is likely to have far-reaching consequences. Gary Hufbauer, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, estimates that a one percentage point drop in Chinese growth would probably take 0.2 percentage points off global growth. The official data paints an increasingly cloudy outlook. Industrial output is growing at its weakest pace since 2002, and retail sales are slowing. Chinese exports fell in August by 1% from a year earlier, and by a sharp 16% to the US - a clear sign that the dispute with the US is hurting bilateral trade. But while growth is down from double digit levels in the mid-2000's, the more recent slowdown has been relatively gradual. China's economy grew 6.2% year-on-year in the second quarter, easing from 6.4% in the first three months of the year, and from 6.6% in 2018. ""It's not as if Chinese growth has completely fallen off a cliff,"" says Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC.  ""On the contrary, there are still many pockets of growth,"" he adds, pointing to housing construction and spending in the services sector. China's government has sought to support the economy this year through tax cuts, and by taking measures to boost liquidity in the financial system. But Mr Neumann says that this time around, the government was being ""fairly restrained"" when providing credit to firms and individuals, and administering stimulus. That's because the government believes China needs to curb the risk in its financial system, and cool the rapid credit growth of recent years, he adds. ""Chinese authorities are not really showing signs of wavering from this track... so it's by design in many ways, rather than by accident, that we've seen weaker economic growth numbers,"" says Mr Neumann. Having relied heavily on infrastructure spending to stimulate the economy over the years, analysts say Beijing had limited room to do much more on that front. Instead they have opted for tax cuts, which tend to be less effective in boosting growth than infrastructure spending, says Mr Wu. Mr Wu expected Beijing to do more to stimulate the economy going forward - both through fiscal and monetary policy -  but worried this would not be enough. ""We do expect more to come to help stabilise growth by next year. But the key downside risk is that the authorities do not step up policy support enough to stabilise growth."" The US and China have been fighting a trade war for more than a year, and more tariffs are expected. The impact from the US tariffs has been offset to some extent by a weaker yuan, says Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics, while China has also sought to bypass the taxes by exporting to the US via other Asian countries. He says that China's share of global exports has actually grown over the past year, showing that the fall in Chinese exports has been less pronounced than those from other countries. Western businesses, meanwhile, are finding it increasingly hard to navigate the uncertainty. Some have been shifting production out of China, even though the numbers have not been large enough to show up in the economic data, says Mr Evans-Pritchard. ""The longer these tariffs remain in place, the longer this drags on, the higher the chance we are going to see more firms shifting out of China, and it also makes the country a less attractive place to invest in the first place,"" he says. While many firms will want to keep some production in China to cater for its important domestic market, there are signs some firms are already considering their options. According to a 2019 survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, 65% of members said trade tensions are influencing their longer-term business strategies. Nearly a fourth of all respondents are delaying China investments, it said. The deadly swine fever has placed an additional drag on the Chinese economy over the past year. China, the world's biggest producer of pork, has struggled to control the disease even after slaughtering more than one million pigs. The supply shortage has sent pork prices soaring - by 46.7% in August on a year earlier- and that is eating into household incomes. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: ""The price of pork has almost doubled,"" said the Peterson Institute's Hufbauer, adding that this was ""very painful for low income Chinese."" Pork is one of China's main food staples, and accounts for more than 60% of the country's meat consumption. While for now the surge has been partly offset by more subdued non-food inflation, analysts say this could quickly change. ""What worries me is that they just don't seem to have gotten the disease under control yet. The pig stock is still falling,"" says Mr Evans-Pritchard.  ""At this stage it's already pointing towards pork price inflation rising above 80% year-on-year within the next six months."" "
economic indicators,UK 'cannot duck' post-Covid inequalities,2024-09-15,2021-01-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55536722,"The UK ""cannot duck"" tackling inequalities of health, ethnicity, education and jobs post-Covid, a major review has warned. The report's chairman, Nobel laureate Sir Angus Deaton, says a lot of work to repair and rebuild the damage will be needed after the pandemic. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) Deaton Review of Inequalities warned the fabric of society was under threat. Launched 18 months ago, the review says Covid-19 worsened existing problems. The review says there is a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity to tackle the disadvantages faced by many that this pandemic has so devastatingly exposed"". ""We now face a set of challenges which we cannot duck."" Sir Angus said: ""As the vaccines should, at some point this year, take us into a world largely free of the pandemic, it is imperative to think about policies that will be needed to repair the damage and that focus on those who have suffered the most. ""We need to build a country in which everyone feels that they belong."" While the pandemic had highlighted the disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups and deprived communities, it also showed that the UK's best-paid and most highly educated have been ""much better able to ride out the crisis"", the report said. Children from poorer households found it harder to do schoolwork during lockdown and have been more likely to miss school since September, it noted. And while the biggest risk factor for coronavirus is age, younger people have been hit harder by the economic consequences of the crisis. The cost of the pandemic is ""just colossal"" IFS director Paul Johnson told the BBC's Today programme. ""We've seen the biggest reduction in national income, essentially in history, over the last year, we've seen the biggest public deficit in history outside of the two world wars, so there's no getting around the fact that the pandemic and the response to it has had a bigger effect on the economy than anything essentially in the whole of history."" The report highlighted the effects of the pandemic on different groups, including on education, which is ""probably more worrying"" than the overall economic effect, Mr Johnson said. ""The first lockdown lockdown saw a dreadful impact on the education particularly of poorer children... they were getting less in the way of online lessons from their schools. ""There's a huge private school/state school divide in this, but also a big divide within state schools between those children who had support at home, had the facilities at home - laptops and internet and so on - but who also had the support from school - so there's a big impact on education but also a very unequal one,"" he added. The review is calling for extra support for children who have fallen behind and help for school and university leavers to find jobs.  It says the welfare safety net must be adapted so it supports non-traditional forms of employment, including insecure and self-employed workers, and minority ethnic groups must be given greater economic opportunities. Progress in reducing poor mental and physical health could be ""one of the clearest indications of success of economic and social policy"", it adds. Mark Franks, director of welfare at the Nuffield Foundation, which funded the review, said: ""Individuals are subject to a wide range of potential vulnerabilities around dimensions including age, ethnicity, place of birth, education, income and the nature of their employment. ""Where these vulnerabilities intersect, they can amplify and reinforce one another and play a huge role in driving unequal outcomes."" However, the government said it was already spending vast sums to support people and the economy through the pandemic.  A spokesman said: ""We're doing everything we can to ensure our coronavirus support reaches those who need it the most, which is why we've invested more than £280bn to protect the incomes, livelihoods and health of millions of people across the UK."" This included an additional £9bn for the welfare system and £2bn for the Kickstart Scheme, tripling traineeships, incentives for firms hiring apprentices and doubling the number of work coaches ""so that nobody is left without hope or opportunity"", the spokesman said."
economic indicators,UK told to 'hold fire' on April tech tax,2024-09-15,2020-01-22,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51201750,"The UK has been told to ""hold fire"" on a new tax on big technology firms planned for April. The OECD said that there needs to be a global agreement on technology company tax. Without such an agreement, there would be the risk of ""a cacophony"" with countries going their own way. The warning came as France agreed to delay a new tax on multinational technology firms after an angry response from Washington. The organisation charged with brokering a global compromise on an issue threatening a transatlantic trade war has said the UK should hold fire on its digital sales tax. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer arrived at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s Secretary General Angel Gurria told the BBC that without a global solution to technology companies paying less than a fair share of tax, there would be a ""cacophony and a mess"" of 40 countries going their own way with ""tensions rising all over the place"". In regards to the UK plan to levy a 2% tax on the UK revenues of search engines, social media companies and online marketplaces from April, Gurria, said that the government should ""absolutely hold fire and contribute to a multilateral solution"". Elsewhere at the World Economic Forum, there were indications that the French Government will delay its implementation of a tech tax to until the end of the year. The UK, France and several other European countries want to make sure that technology giants pay their ""fair share"" of tax in countries where they operate. These governments are concerned that technology giants - the largest of which are US companies - are avoiding taxes in the European Union.  They argue taxes should be based on where digital activity takes place not where firms have their European headquarters. Italy, Austria and Turkey are also considering imposing new levies. Washington is opposed to the tax which it says unfairly targets US firms.  However, Chancellor Sajid Javid has on Wednesday said the UK would push ahead with its digital tax, which could generate revenues of £500m a year.  Mr Gurria is hosting a meeting between the French finance minister Bruno Le Maire and US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to confirm a ceasefire that should prevent a tit for tat trade war between the US and Europe. But Mr Mnuchin, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, warned other countries including the UK that ""they'll find themselves faced with President Trump's tariffs. We'll be having similar conversations with them"". However, tech companies are queuing up to say the tax system should change. Microsoft President Brad Smith told the BBC ""it does make sense for big tech companies to pay appropriate taxes"".  And Apple chief executive Tim Cook in Ireland on Tuesday backed the OECD's effort to find a global solution. Officials preparing US-UK trade talks have expressed concern that the US would raise its objections to a UK digital sales tax in trade negotiations. The Treasury said: ""We've committed to introduce our Digital Services Tax from April 2020. It will be repealed once a global solution is in place""."
economic indicators,Bank pumps £100bn into UK economy to aid recovery,2024-09-15,2020-06-18,By Szu Ping Chan,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-53093127,"The Bank of England will pump an extra £100bn into the UK economy to help fight the ""unprecedented"" coronavirus-induced downturn. Bank policymakers voted 8-1 to increase the size of its bond-buying programme. However, they said there was growing evidence that the hit to the economy would be ""less severe"" than initially feared. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) also kept interest rates at a record low of 0.1%. The move comes just days after Bank governor Andrew Bailey said policymakers were ready to take action after the economy suffered its biggest monthly contraction on record. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% in April, while official jobs data showed the number of workers on UK payrolls fell by more than 600,000 between March and May. The Bank said more recent indicators suggested the economy was starting to bounce back. Minutes from the MPC's June meeting said: ""Payments data are consistent with a recovery in consumer spending in May and June, and housing activity has started to pick up recently."" However, Mr Bailey warned that the outlook for the economy remained uncertain. He said: ""We don't want to get too carried away by this. Let's be clear, we're still living in very unusual times."" The minutes added: ""While recent demand and output data had not been quite as negative as expected, other indicators suggested greater risks around the potential for longer-lasting damage to the economy from the pandemic."" Back in May, policymakers warned the economy was heading for its sharpest recession on record. Scenarios drawn up by the Bank suggested the economy could shrink by 25% in the three months to June. However, the MPC said more recent evidence suggested the contraction would be less severe. The extra monetary stimulus - known as quantitative easing (QE) - will raise the total size of the Bank's asset purchase programme to £745bn. Policymakers said the injection would help to support financial markets and underpin the recovery. However, Andy Haldane, the Bank's chief economist, voted against the increase. He said the recovery was happening ""sooner and materially faster"" than the Bank expected in May. Policymakers said the jobs market was likely to remain weak for some time, with a risk of ""higher and more persistent unemployment"". Millions of workers have already seen their pay packets shrink as a result of lower pay for furloughed employees. A survey by the Bank said other companies had postponed or cancelled pay rises this year.  Mr Bailey said: ""Even with the relaxation of some Covid-related restrictions on economic activity, a degree of precautionary behaviour by households and businesses is likely to persist. The economy, and especially the labour market, will therefore take some time to recover towards its previous path."" Mr Bailey also addressed the recent fall in UK inflation in an open letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), fell to 0.5% in May, from 0.8% in April - well below the Bank of England's 2% target. Mr Bailey said weak inflation had been by driven by falling oil and energy prices, as well as a global drop in economic activity. The Bank expects inflation to return to target within two years. Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics expects the Bank to increase QE again later this year. ""Unemployment looks set to rise sharply in the second half of this year and to fall back slowly thereafter,"" he said. ""The resulting prolonged weakness in domestically generated inflation likely will necessitate the MPC doing more to stimulate the economy in the winter."" The Bank of England has increased its support for the economy, despite it assessing that the outlook is not quite as awful as its scenario last month. The economy is on course for a hit in the second quarter of about 20% compared with the final three months of 2019. That's still historic, and off the scale, but not quite as extreme as the 27% it predicted in May.  The extra £100bn of purchases of government bonds also has the air of an insurance policy. Most of the MPC were concerned about a couple of factors, A less awful outlook does not mean the recovery will be quick. This is for two reasons stretching beyond economics.  There is a fear that the ""prevalence of the virus"" in the UK will mean that Britons will continue to socially distance, voluntarily, holding back the recovery more than other nations (Germany would be an example).  Related to that was the idea that more QE now could mitigate the economic impact of ""higher rates of Covid-19 infection going forward"" - a second wave.  So the news is still bad, but less awful. But risks beyond the purely economic led to more billions being injected into the economy."
economic indicators,"Mothers, your country needs you!",2024-09-15,2018-12-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-46558562,"When China ended its one-child policy three years ago, there was hope couples would have a second child to help slow the pace of an ageing society. But the move isn't working, reports London-based China analyst Yuwen Wu. The declining birth rate is now one of the most talked-about topics across China - and there's a real sense of crisis.  After decades spent trying to curb the population, state propaganda slogans now exhort couples to ""Have children for the country"", prompting criticism on social media that government policy is intrusive and insensitive. Measures now being discussed range from extending maternity leave to encouraging people to have a second child with straight cash incentives or tax breaks. Some are even calling for limits on the number of children to be abandoned altogether. Aimed at curbing population growth, China's one-child rule was introduced in 1979, a year after economic reforms. The policy was strictly enforced for most people. Those caught violating the policy could be fined, lose their jobs or face forced abortions and sterilisation. But the fertility rate had already gone into steep decline a decade earlier. For years China benefited from demographic dividends - its massive population (almost a fifth of the world's) provided plenty of manpower - and manageable numbers of very young and old people - to fuel the country's rapid economic rise. Now all that is disappearing, fast. In order for China to continue its economic development and support its aged, the population needs to grow rather than decline.  The ending of the one-child policy in 2015 was meant to boost this, but the data suggests the opposite - despite the freedom to do so now, young people don't seem to want more children.  According to China's National Statistics Bureau, there were 17.86m births in 2016, and the Chinese population grew by 1.31 million, with a rate of 12.95 births per 1,000 people, the fastest since 2001. But in 2017, which should have seen the full effect of the two-child policy, there were 17,230,000 births, a decrease of 630,000 compared with 2016; the birth rate stood at 12.43 per 1,000, down 0.52% from 2016. This is below even the most pessimistic forecast before the new policy was introduced. Predictions for the future look even bleaker:  Not surprisingly, the looming crisis has got everyone talking. On 6 August, the Communist Party's official newspaper People's Daily devoted a whole page to the issue, including an op-ed entitled ""Having children is a family matter but also a national matter"". The editorial warned that the state needed new policies to deal with the impact of the low birth rate on the economy. This prompted much coverage and debate in the media. One article in Xinhua Daily - by two scholars from Nanjing University - sparked an outcry. They suggested a birth fund be set up, to which everybody below the age of 40 contribute. If a couple were to have a second child, they could withdraw money from the fund; if not, they would have to wait until retirement.   ""Fined whether one has a child or not? - please stop targeting people's wallets,"" was just one of the articles in response to the idea, which has been labelled inconsiderate, unfair and unnecessary.    Some urged the state to address the root cause of why young people don't want more children and try to lower the cost of raising a child, rather than penalising people financially. China is fast becoming an ageing society.  As well as the birth rate falling, people now live longer - life expectancy was 66 when the one-child policy was introduced, and it is now about 76. This will put great strain on China's economy in the decades to come. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the number of people aged 15-64 topped 1 billion in 2013, but has been declining steadily since and will continue to do so. At the same time, the number of old people is growing. In 2017, China's total population stood at 1.39 billion - including 158 million people aged 65 and over, constituting 11.4% of the population.  That's more than one and half times the UN's definition of an ageing society (when 7% of the population are 65+). The UN's 2017 Revision of World Population Prospects forecasts that 17.1% of the Chinese population will be over 65 by 2030. This trend entails that old people are supported by fewer and fewer people of working age. According to an article by Ning Yi published on ifengweekly, there were 3.16 young people for each old person in 2011; by 2016, the age dependency ratio was down to 2.8. It is predicted that by 2050, it will be just 1.3. As in other countries with similar age ratio projections, this has huge implications for the economy, for paying pensions and for meeting elderly care needs.  Why aren't people having more children? Many young people in China who grew up during the three decades of strict family planning and break-neck economic development have a different mindset from their parents. They are used to being the centre of attention and enjoying much better material wealth and personal freedom.  They are also marrying late (if at all), having children late (if at all), and focusing more on their own careers and happiness, a trend not confined to China. When they contemplate starting a family, one big concern is whether they can afford it. Surveys show that on average, raising a child in a city can cost more than half of a Chinese family's income. Childcare places are always oversubscribed, so many have to rely on grandparents for help. And then there's the mortgage and other burdens on the family budget. In other words, to have one child is a struggle; to have another needs even more resources and support. None of the young people I talked to recently in China wanted a second child.  ""Our generation has a tremendous burden on our shoulders,"" one woman, who did not want to be named for this article, told me. ""Our ageing parents, our young children, our own careers. These combined together can easily crush us."" The woman, who is in her 30s, already has a five-year-old son, but she and her husband have decided not to provide him with a sibling. Lack of childcare is a big reason. ""So what often happens is we hire nannies to look after the baby, and ask our parents to keep an eye on the nanny.""  1979: Government proposal encourages all couples to have just one child 1982:  Family planning becomes basic state policy 2000:  A couple can have a second child, if both of them are only children 2013:  Couples allowed to have a second child if one of them is an only child 2015:  End of one-child policy and all couples are allowed to have a second child. On the other hand, some older women, already in their early 60s, were quite firm that had the one-child policy ended earlier, they would have tried for another child, even up to their late 40s.    So, did the one-child policy go on for too long? And was there a robust enough national debate? Many people are now asking these questions.  All censuses carried out after 1990 point to the rapid decline of the total fertility rate (the average number of children born to a woman over her lifetime) in China, which is lower than the 2.1 needed as a replacement fertility rate.  But there has been fierce disagreement over the true figure. For instance, a population survey in 2000 indicated the total fertility rate was an alarmingly low 1.22; family planning officials, however, marked it up to 1.8, arguing many births were unreported. In the end, the authorities went with 1.8.  Might the difference mean that an otherwise urgent situation was downplayed and action delayed? Even today, one struggles to find an authoritative figure for China's current total fertility rate - some put it at 1.2-1.4; others between 1.5 and 1.7 - which is lower than in the US (1.8) or India (2.3). Some did voice their concerns and call for changes to stem the decline in population growth, but little heed appears to have been paid. More than a decade ago Ye Tingfang, a member of China's top political advisory body, the CPPCC (Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) argued that it is against nature to intervene in the reproduction process. He tabled a motion at the 2007 People's Congress session, calling for an end to the one-child policy as soon as possible. The State Family Planning Committee told him the country would not change the one-child policy. His follow-up petition met with silence. Other dissenting voices include a book in 2012 entitled ""Are there too many Chinese?"" written by James Liang and Jianxin Li, two professors from Peking University.  They argued that China's birth rate had become too low, and if the trend continued, the country would age too fast, the economy would suffer and society would become unstable. They urged adjustment to family planning policy as well. It is difficult to guess what went on behind the scenes with decision makers; the fact is, it was not until 2013 that we saw some relaxation of the one-child policy.   These days one thing that has changed is there does seem to be more open discussion about population matters in China. In some places authorities have stopped collecting fines for children borne outside of the quotas. Some experts propose using 2% to 5% of GDP to encourage births, through tax reductions and cash incentives.   Others say people should be allowed to have as many children as they want. And there is a lot of propaganda - which people poke fun at. ""'One child makes you poor, two children make you rich' - it's too soon for such slogans, we need some breathing space!"" shouts one netizen. ""'You regret if you don't have children, and you have nobody to look after you when you grow old' - this is so against what we were told growing up (to marry late and have fewer children). The change is too fast!"" laments another. Mock posters are doing the rounds too. And this is really what has changed. Individuals happen to be more free-thinking now and independent - and not easily swayed by propaganda or lukewarm incentives. They live for themselves, not for the country any more. It turns out it is much harder to encourage population growth than to curb it - in the end, it's down to individuals to make the decision. "
economic indicators,US in emergency rate cut and huge stimulus plan,2024-09-15,2020-03-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51901998,"The US has cut interest rates to almost zero and launched a $700bn stimulus programme in a bid to protect the economy from the effect of coronavirus. It is part of a co-ordinated action announced on Sunday in the UK, Japan, eurozone, Canada, and Switzerland. In a news conference Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the pandemic was having a ""profound"" impact on the economy. US President Donald Trump said the emergency action ""makes me very happy"". The Fed has cut rates to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and said it would it begin buying bonds - quantitative easing - a move that pumps money directly into the economy. The central bank had already cut interest rates by half a percentage point after an emergency meeting on 3 March. That had been the first rate cut outside of a regularly scheduled policy meeting since the financial crisis in 2008. Stock markets have plunged in recent days amid fears that economic paralysis will wipe out corporate profits and spark a global recession.  But early indications suggest the Fed's move may not shore up financial markets. US stock market futures, which anticipate the direction of shares when trading begins, were almost 4% down.  Speaking after the emergency meeting, which was held in place of the Fed's regular rates setting decision scheduled for this week, Mr Powell warned that although it was clear the outbreak was already having a major impact on the economy it was still too early to tell just how far-reaching the effects will be. ""The economic outlook is evolving on a daily basis and it is depending on the spread of the virus... that is not something that is knowable,"" he said. As part of Sunday's announcement, the Fed will work with other central banks to increase the availability of dollars for commercial banks.  These so-called currency swap lines were an important tool in maintaining financial stability after the 2008 banking crisis. ""Today's coordinated action by major central banks will improve global liquidity by lowering the price and extending the maximum term of US dollar lending operations,"" Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in a joint statement with Andrew Bailey, who succeeds him as BoE chief on Monday. The Bank of Japan also eased monetary policy by pledging to buy risky assets at double the current pace and announced a new loan programme to extend one-year, zero-rate loans to financial institutions. The Federal Reserve has now fired most of its remaining big guns to stimulate a US economy facing a serious financial shock from the coronavirus.  Interest rates were slashed by one full percentage point to just above zero, and the bank restarted the pumping of hundreds of billions of dollars into financial markets. Global central banks, including the Bank of England, joined in to ease the flow of dollars around the world. It was the full crisis toolkit designed to inject confidence into markets that ran riot last week as the outbreak turned into a global pandemic. While the moves should soothe the financing of US business, they also reflect that the health emergency in the US has become far worse than expected and reveals US authorities are running short of options. Interest rate cuts are a blunt instrument to deal with a pandemic, and more is expected from Congress and the White House, in particular. President Trump welcomed the cut, but it was his decision to ban European travel that sparked the latest record share sell off on Thursday. There is some hope that a video conference call later between leaders of the G7 western industrialised nations, including President Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, will result in a more coordinated global approach to the virus. The authorities will be watching markets carefully today, including Mr Bailey, on his first day in the job. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at UK-based CMC Markets, described the co-ordinated move as throwing ""the kitchen sink at the markets. [It] serves to underscore the seriousness of the economic shocks coming our way"". And in the US, Greg McBridge, chief financial analyst at online bank and mortgage firm Bankrate.com, said: ""Desperate times call for desperate measures and the Fed is doing just that in an effort to keep credit markets functioning and prevent the type of starving of credit that nearly toppled the global economy into a depression in 2008. ""Reducing interest rates to borrowers will ease the burden of existing debts slightly but is unlikely to spur the usual surge of borrowing as consumers and businesses batten down the hatches for a coming drop off in US economic activity."""
economic indicators,Bank surprises with interest rate vote,2024-09-15,2017-06-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40288125,"UK interest rates have been kept on hold at 0.25%, but in a surprise move three of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee backed a rate rise. The 5-3 vote by the Bank's policymakers was the closest for a rate rise since 2007, and comes with inflation close to a four-year high of 2.9%. Inflation is now well above the Bank's target rate of 2%.  News of the vote pushed the pound up by more than a cent against the dollar, although it fell back later.   Ian McCafferty, Michael Saunders and Kristin Forbes were the three members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) who voted for an increase. Ms Forbes had been the sole vote in favour of a rise at the MPC's previous two meetings.   However, the decision of Mr Saunders and Mr McCafferty to back an increase as well surprised economists. ""The more hawkish tone of the MPC appears to reflect some concern about inflation - which has accelerated faster than it expected over recent months and is now forecast to exceed 3% this year - as well as the strength of employment that is continuing to erode slack in the labour market,"" Capital Economics said. Hargreaves Lansdown senior economist Ben Brettell said it appeared that the ""willingness of the MPC to 'look through' higher inflation and leave rates on hold is wearing thin, and if inflation continues to surprise we could see higher rates by the end of the summer"". Sterling, which had been trading below $1.27 before the minutes were released, surged to almost $1.28 in response, while the FTSE 100 share index was down more than 1%.  In the minutes of its meeting, the MPC said the ""driving force"" behind the recent pickup in inflation had remained the depreciation of sterling that followed the Brexit vote in June last year. However, it added that a ""number of indicators of domestically generated inflationary pressure"" had also increased in recent months.   The committee said inflation could exceed 3% by the autumn and was expected to remain above the 2% target for an ""extended period"" as the weaker pound pushed up prices while pay growth remained ""subdued"". The three MPC members who voted to raise rates were swayed by the inflation fears, and also took into account growth in ""business investment and net trade"" which appear ""on track"" to compensate for weaker consumption. They also thought that interest rates would still leave monetary policy ""very supportive"". However, the five committee members who voted to leave rates unchanged took into account the recent slowdown in consumer spending and economic growth as a whole. They said ""it was too early to judge with confidence how large and persistent"", that would be.   ""It is as yet unclear to what degree weaker consumption would be offset by other components of demand"". the minutes said.  While different members of the MPC placed different weights on these arguments, the minutes said that ""all committee members agreed that any increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent"". Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, said: ""This gradual shift in stance represents the MPC's efforts to foretell and communicate a forthcoming hike. Don't ignore it."" However, other economists said it could still be some time before the Bank votes to rise rates. ""It is far from certain that interest rates will rise in the near term,"" said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. ""There is the potential for the balance of views to alter, with the imminent changes in the MPC's membership. Kristin Forbes who has been a strong advocate of raising interest rates is now leaving the MPC, while another member is due to appointed as the committee is currently one short."" "
economic indicators,US jobless rate falls to 18-year low,2024-09-15,2018-06-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44330250,"US jobs growth was faster than expected in May, as employers added 223,000 positions. The unemployment rate fell further to 3.8%, having fallen to 3.9% the previous month, bringing the rate to an 18-year low. The average hourly pay of private sector workers increased 2.7% year-on-year, compared with 2.6% in April. Surveys of economists had predicted that there would be a gain of about 188,000 jobs in May. Analysts said the positive jobs data fuelled expectations that the central bank, the Federal Reserve, would raise interest rates at its next meeting later this month. The unemployment rate has not been this low since April 2000 and has already fulfilled the Fed's forecast of 3.8% by the end of 2018.  President Donald Trump previewed the strong jobs report with a Twitter post, writing that he was ""looking forward"" to seeing the numbers. The tweet raised eyebrows due to its allusion to embargoed data, which the White House has access to prior to its release.  President Trump has been rebuked previously for celebrating jobs figures within an hour of their publication, a violation of a federal rule intended to preserve the neutrality of the statistics. Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst for Bankrate.com, said the president's post ""doesn't look good"" even if he avoided an outright break of the embargo. ""This is another case where... President Trump would be wise to spend his time doing something other than tweeting,"" he said. Economist Lawrence Summers, who held top economic posts under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, wrote on Twitter that a similar statement made in those administrations ""would have been a major scandal"". However, the president's decision to draw attention to the report underscored the positive numbers, which added to other healthy economic indicators. All major sectors of the US economy registered job gains last month. Construction added 25,000 jobs in May after notching up gains of 21,000 jobs the month before.  Manufacturing created another 18,000 jobs last month in addition to the 25,000 created in April.  Revised data for March and April also showed the economy adding 15,000 more jobs than previously thought. Economists had previously said bad weather was to blame for slower job growth over those two months. Even the widest measure of unemployment - including people working part-time and discouraged workers - is hovering at its lowest rate since 2001.  While wage growth was not as strong as might be expected given the tightening labour market, economists said they expect these figures to rise in coming months."
economic indicators,NI employment levels continue to fall,2024-09-15,2020-08-10,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-53685656,"Business activity in NI picked up last month, signalling economic recovery, but employment levels are continuing to fall, an Ulster Bank survey suggests.  Every month, the bank conducts a survey of a representative sample of firms. It is considered a reliable indicator of economic performance. Private sector firms are asked about output, staffing levels and exports.  Output and new orders picked up after sharp falls earlier in the year but employment levels continued to decline. Retail, manufacturing and construction have reported a strong rebound in growth coming from very low levels.  However services, the biggest sector in the Northern Ireland economy, is continuing to contract.  While some firms benefited from reopening, others are reporting that new work has not been as quick to return as expected. This survey links the speed of recovery to the pace of easing lockdown.  In comparison to other UK regions, Northern Ireland's rebound is lagging behind England, but outperforming Wales and Scotland. But challenges remain around profitability - rising costs including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) mean the squeeze on profit margins has intensified. Ulster Bank chief economist Richard Ramsey said a rise in demand in the domestic market boosted new orders. ""A further easing of lockdown restrictions in July helped secure growth in private sector activity for the first time in 17 months,"" he said. But he warned there will be further job losses ahead. ""The phasing out of the furlough scheme is anticipated to lead to further redundancies in the months ahead,"" he said. ""While the return to growth is welcome news it merely marks the start of a long road to recovery. There remains a huge gap relative to pre-pandemic levels of output/activity.  ""Bridging this gap will take years not months and the twin challenges of Covid-19 and Brexit will have to be navigated along the way."""
economic indicators,"Work-life balance in crisis, say Greens",2024-09-15,2018-10-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45750920,"People's free time should be recorded as a way to measure the UK's ""well-being"", the Green Party says. The party is calling for a ""Free Time Index"" and says that time spent outside work and commuting is a better measure of how well the UK is doing than GDP. Co-leader Sian Berry told the BBC work-life balance was ""in crisis"" and more people were working while commuting. The party also said it wanted paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.  Calling for new free time indicators to be included in the next Budget, Ms Berry told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Work-life balance is an incredibly important indicator of people's well-being and it is in crisis at the moment. ""People are constantly 'on', even when they are commuting. There's an enormous amount of unpaid caring going on which doesn't get measured, which doesn't leave people with very much free time either. We have got a mental health crisis and we think we should be measuring this.""  She added that other indicators of a healthy society should be measured, like ""resource use, housing affordability and health"". ""It should be used as a more important indicator than GDP of how our country is doing,"" Ms Berry said, arguing it could then be used to inform policy. Pressed on whether Green policies, which include a four-day working week, would mean less money to invest in infrastructure and public services, she said people with more fulfilling work and more free time could be more productive. The Green Party failed to make its hoped-for breakthrough in the 2017 general election, as its vote was squeezed by Labour. But it made headway in May's council elections, adding eight seats. Last year the party announced a four-day working week policy, amounting to a maximum of 35 hours, and there have been reports suggesting Labour is considering a similar policy, as a way of sharing technological advances with staff. In Friday's speech to the Greens' autumn conference in Bristol, Ms Berry promised ""radical common sense for the common good"" and said her party was a real alternative to Labour as ""we go further and we do it better"". She said the momentum behind calls for a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations ""feels absolutely unstoppable"" while her co-leader Jonathan Bartley described Brexit as a ""pitiful charade"".  Mr Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" in response to the threat from climate change, adding: ""We won't debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".  In response to the Greens' free time proposals, Len Shackleton, research fellow at the free market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ""GDP is not the only measure of how well the country is doing, but it is the most useful for comparisons with other countries and with the UK over time."" He said life satisfaction, happiness and anxiety indicators were already published by the Office for National Statistics, adding: ""We have regular time-use surveys which could be used to create something like what the Greens want. But what would it show, really?  ""People might have more time to spend with their families if unemployment rose dramatically. There are different perspectives within the family. ""Using GDP as our prime indicator cannot deal with these concerns, but nor can any other simple measure."" The ONS carried out a survey of leisure time in the UK in 2015, which suggested that UK men spent an average of six hours nine minutes a day on leisure activities - while women spent five hours 29 minutes. Most of that time was spent watching TV, listening to music or reading. There has been some research which suggests that using money to free up time is linked to increased happiness.  The coalition government attempted to measure the happiness of UK citizens and the first national well-being survey was published in 2012.  The ONS recently published its latest ""personal well-being"" statistics, which suggested that, compared with both the UK and the other countries, people in Northern Ireland had ""better average ratings across all personal well-being measures""."
economic indicators,"US economy strengthens despite Delta, says Fed",2024-09-15,2021-09-22,By Daniel Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58659476,"The US economy continues to strengthen, albeit at a slower rate because of the Delta variant of Covid, the US Federal Reserve has said.  The central bank said the jobs market was improving and that currently high rates of inflation remained transitory.  It said it may start reducing its emergency support for the economy ""soon"", but did not say when. Half of its policymakers also projected interest rates will need to rise in 2022 from current rock-bottom levels. The US economy has rebounded strongly this year from its pandemic lows, but there are fears Delta will derail the recovery.  The country added fewer jobs than expected in August as rising infections hit spending on travel, tourism and hospitality.  Inflation, which measures the increase in the cost of living over time, is running at 5.3%  - the highest in nearly 13 years. It comes amid surging consumer demand, rising energy prices, and supply chain-related shortages.  Despite this, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets US monetary policy, said overall indicators of economic activity ""have continued to strengthen"". ""The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the rise in Covid-19 cases has slowed their recovery,"" it said.  ""Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to US households and businesses."" The FOMC said the path of the economy still depended ""on the course of the virus"". And it expects to keep monetary policy loose until more progress is made on stabilising unemployment - which stands at 5.2% - and consumer prices. However, it said if progress continues ""broadly as expected"", it may soon pare back its $120bn-a-month bond-buying programme which has helped keep borrowing rates low. Analysts said the bank was taking a cautious approach, noting no formal date was set for pulling back support.  ""While the Federal Reserve has laid the groundwork for an eventual taper [of asset purchases] later this year, the Fed erred on the side of caution given that the macroeconomic landscape has deteriorated somewhat over the last few months,"" said Candice Bangsund, a portfolio manager at Fiera Capital. ""Preconditions for a formal taper announcement will largely depend on economic conditions over the coming months, with an emphasis on data dependence.""  Gurpreet Gill, a macro strategist at Goldman Sachs, said ongoing supply chain disruption, the spread of Delta and higher inflation still weighed on the minds of Fed committee members. ""Given uncertainty around the health of labour market and inflationary pressures, we would not be surprised if the 'dot plot' changes again in the coming months as the pace of the recovery and underlying inflation dynamics become clearer."" The Fed has two goals. It aims to keep US inflation at about 2% and to achieve maximum employment, whereby everyone who needs a job has one.  During the pandemic it has supported the economy by slashing interest rates to historic lows and pumping billions of dollars into the financial system by buying government and corporate bonds."
economic indicators,"Scottish unemployment rises by 9,000",2024-09-15,2017-10-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-41664751,"The number of people out of work in Scotland rose by 9,000 to 113,000 in the three months to August. The Scottish unemployment rate was 0.3% higher than the previous quarter and now stands at 4.1%. The UK jobless total fell by 52,000 over the same period to 1.4 million, or 4.3%. The number of people in work in Scotland rose by 40,000 to a near-record high, with the employment rate hitting 75.3%.  The UK rate was 75.1%.  Figures from the Office for National Statistics also showed that total earnings, including bonuses, rose by an annual 2.2% in the three-month period. However, pay still failed to keep pace with inflation, with the real value of earnings down 0.3% over the past year. The Scottish government described the latest employment figures as ""encouraging"", highlighting that Scotland had higher employment and lower unemployment rates than the UK. Scotland's Employability Minister Jamie Hepburn said: ""Youth unemployment rates continue to outperform the UK. This comes on top of us fulfilling our commitment to reduce youth unemployment by 40%, four years ahead of schedule.  ""While these figures are positive we recognise there are still many barriers to getting people into work and are continuing to work to improve labour market conditions. ""We are expanding the range of opportunities available to young people through our apprenticeship programme and recently announced £96m of investment to deliver fairer employment support services through the new Fair Start Scotland programme."" Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: ""It is encouraging to see an increase in employment, which remains close to record levels.  ""But the rise in unemployment is disappointing and shows we must remain focused on boosting Scotland's economy. ""Growth in Scotland lags behinds the rest of the UK and I'd urge the Scottish government to use their considerable economic levers more effectively."" Stuart McIntyre, from the Fraser of Allander economic research institute, said the latest figures showed ""robust"" employment in the three months to August. He said: ""These data represent some good news for the Scottish economy with continued growth in the employment rate.  ""Nevertheless, the relatively fragile economic growth experienced over the past two years in Scotland remains a concern, as do wider indicators of the health of the economy.  ""In addition, with inflation spiking to 3% and weak wage growth, there will continue to be a drag on household consumption going forward."" Scottish Chambers of Commerce chief executive Liz Cameron said: ""With inflation continuing to rise, and many industry sectors observing pay growth below 2%, the Bank of England must hold their nerve on interest rates.   ""An increase at this point would damage consumer confidence and spending at a critical period for the retail sector."""
economic indicators,Wedding and weather lift economy in May,2024-09-15,2018-07-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44777214,"The UK's economy grew by 0.3% in May, helped by the royal wedding and warm weather, latest figures show. The latest assessment by the Office for National Statistics marks a change in the way the UK's GDP is calculated. From now on, the ONS will release a monthly indicator and a rolling three-month figure. Previously it only put out growth data every three months. In the three months to May, the economy grew by 0.2% compared with the previous three-month period. ""The first of our new rolling estimates of GDP shows a mixed picture of the UK economy with modest growth driven by the services sector, partly offset by falling construction and industrial output,"" said the ONS's head of national accounts, Rob Kent-Smith. ""Retailing, computer programming and legal services all performed strongly in the three months to May, while housebuilding and manufacturing both contracted. ""Services, in particular, grew robustly in May, with retailers enjoying a double boost from the warm weather and the royal wedding. Construction also saw a return to growth after a weak couple of months."" Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: ""The long awaited bounce-back from a weak first quarter has failed to materialise, with the rolling three-month growth rate unchanged into May.  He added: ""The fact that first-half growth is set to be below trend hardly makes a compelling case for an August rate rise."" However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the upturn in May was ""just strong enough to tip the balance"" in favour of an August rate rise, ""provided the government doesn't implode before then"". Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor Getting a little better, pretty slowly. Today's economic growth figures for May reveal that the ""bounce-back"" from the weather-related misery of the first three months of the year is small, though not insignificant. The services sector - which accounts for 80% of our economy - is stronger. Construction activity was also up by 2.9% compared with the previous month - although we must always take care with monthly figures, which can tend to be volatile. This morning's retail sales figures from the British Retail Consortium also revealed a pick-up. We are all doing a bit more shopping. The royal wedding and sunny weather are doing their bit now, in the way the snow and frost depressed February and March. There is little in today's figures that will surprise the Bank of England, which is contemplating increasing interest rates next month. It predicted a ""bounce-back"" earlier in the year. And against a subdued background, there is evidence today that is happening. Other figures also released by the ONS showed: Basically, in an effort to make them more reliable. Until now, the ONS used to release a preliminary estimate of GDP four times a year. But this early quarterly estimate was based on about 40% of the information necessary to produce a full estimate of GDP, so it was subject to change as more data came in. The new policy should mean that the figures do not need to be revised as much in subsequent months. The ONS's new monthly and rolling three-monthly estimates will be compiled with what it calls ""a significantly higher data content"". The office says it has spent money on upgrading its systems so that it can gather and analyse information in a more timely fashion. In particular, the service sector, which contributes 80% of the UK's GDP, will now be measured more speedily than before, it says. It will bring the UK more into line with other developed economies, which tend to produce more accurate initial quarterly estimates that don't need such big revisions. In fact, the ONS intends to leapfrog other countries, by making the UK the first big economy to produce a monthly figure. However, in the short term, it could be bad news for one of the ONS's biggest customers, the Bank of England. The Bank's interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee is due to meet on 2 August, amid speculation that it could raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 0.75%. Under the old timetable for release of GDP figures, MPC members would have been armed with a preliminary estimate of second-quarter growth. But now those figures will not be available until 10 August. The ONS says those figures will be more comprehensive and accurate because of the delay. But that is no help to Bank policymakers as they wrestle with their key economic decision."
economic indicators,England's regional Covid tiers to be set out,2024-09-15,2020-11-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-55078888,"Most of England is expected to be placed in the two toughest tiers of coronavirus restrictions when the national lockdown ends next Wednesday.   Health Secretary Matt Hancock will set out the plans in the Commons later. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she understood only a ""handful"" of areas would have the lowest level of restrictions, tier one. Most areas, including London, would be in tier two with ""significant numbers"" in tier three - the highest level. Differences between the tiers include limits on where households can meet up - for instance, in the new tier one, the rule of six applies indoors and out. In tier two, the rule of six remains outdoors but there is no household mixing indoors. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told BBC Breakfast the new tiers represent a ""tangible change compared to the last four weeks"" of lockdown in England. ""There are significant differences to that - more of our life can resume, more of our economic activity can resume,"" he said. The system will be regularly reviewed and an area's tier level may change before Christmas - the first review is scheduled for 16 December. Decisions on tiers are based on public health recommendations informed by the following factors:  An area could be moved up a tier if these indicators are not improving, and likewise down to a lower one if they improve. Mr Sunak said a meeting of the Cabinet would consider the new tiers on Thursday morning, before Mr Hancock addresses the Commons. The final decisions will be made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the government said. He will lead a Downing Street news conference later. The new system will be stricter than the previous one and more local authorities will be in higher tiers. Mr Hancock has urged people to follow the rules so ""together we can get out of these tough measures"". ""I know for those of you faced with tier three restrictions this will be a particularly difficult time but I want to reassure you that we'll be supporting your areas with mass community testing and extra funding,"" he said. Areas placed in tier three will be eligible for rapid or ""lateral flow"" tests - which give results in about 20 minutes without the need for a lab - to help bring down infections and reduce restrictions. And they will be offered support by NHS Test and Trace and the armed forces to deliver a six-week rapid community testing programme. Tier allocations will be reviewed for the first time by 16 December, allowing for ""the possibility of areas which continue to make progress in slowing the spread of the disease"" to be moved down a tier before Christmas, the government said. On Wednesday, the government recorded another 696 UK deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, the highest daily figure reported since 5 May. Total deaths now stand at 56,533. A further 18,213 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus were also reported. It is clear the government is taking a tougher approach to regional tiers post lockdown. Not only has it beefed up the system - the top two tiers in particular have stricter rules for hospitality - but very few local authority areas will end up in the bottom tier with the most relaxed restrictions. By the time England went into lockdown 170 local authority areas - well over half - were still in tier one, meaning mixing indoors was allowed. Very few will start there this time. That's because an analysis by the University of East Anglia found the bottom tier was not effective at suppressing the virus. But it did find the top two tiers had an impact. One of the problems, it said, was that the government was too slow to move areas up a tier when infection rates started to rise. The government will be much more cautious this time, starting from the premise that it is better to have areas in higher tiers and move them down over time rather than the reverse. But for the public it means post-lockdown life will still see some very strict restrictions for the immediate future. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it would be the ""right and sensible decision"" for the capital to be placed in tier two, as he warned that tier three would be a ""hammer blow"" to businesses. Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said he hoped the area - which was the first area of England to enter the highest tier in October - would not return to tier three restrictions. He said the city region had made ""remarkable"" progress since being put into tier three, with infection rates in two areas dropping from about 750 per 100,000 people ""to 180 across the city region"". Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the city's mass testing programme had enabled it to reduce infections. He said the armed forces have been in the city for three weeks carrying out mass testing and bringing the virus ""back under control again"". Meanwhile, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said it was ""more likely than not"" his area would be put into tier three. He said although infection numbers in Greater Manchester were still high, the rates were falling. Elsewhere, Lancashire's council leaders have submitted a proposal to the government to divide the county into two different tiers when the lockdown ends next week - as coronavirus rates are lower in places like Lancaster and Wyre than they are in East Lancashire. A request has been made for Hyndburn, Rossendale, Burnley, Pendle and Preston to go into tier three restrictions while Fylde, Wyre, Lancaster, Chorley, South Ribble, Ribble Valley and West Lancashire would go into tier two. This would mean there would be different restrictions on socialising and the hospitality sector in different parts of Lancashire. Meanwhile, the Nightingale Hospital in Exeter will receive its first coronavirus patients on Thursday, officials have confirmed. The 116-bed hospital built on the site of a former retail unit will treat people with Covid-19, taking patients transferred from the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust as it is ""very busy"". Devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations, though all four UK nations have agreed a joint plan for Christmas. In Scotland, there is a new five-tier system of restrictions and all non-essential travel between Scotland and the rest of the UK is not allowed. The Scottish government has also said that Christmas bubbles of three households there should contain no more than eight people. Children under 12 are not counted towards the eight. In Wales, lockdown restrictions were eased on 9 November and current rules allow two households to form a bubble with up to 15 people able to meet for organised indoor activities. And Northern Ireland will go into a two-week circuit-break lockdown from 00:00 GMT on Friday 27 November. "
economic indicators,"NI jobs market is now weakening, figures suggest",2024-09-15,2023-09-12,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-66783574,"The Northern Ireland jobs market may have peaked and is now weakening, the latest official figures suggest. Most of the official short term indicators point to a slowdown in recent months. In August, the number of people on company payrolls fell slightly, according to HMRC data. A survey of businesses also suggests the number of employee jobs fell slightly in the second quarter of 2023. The Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) surveys about 6,000 companies, covering all employers with 25 or more employees and all public sector employers. It suggests the number of employee jobs was 813,450 in June 2023; that was an increase of 13,740 jobs (+1.7%) on the same period in 2022 but a decrease of 1,370 jobs (-0.2%) compared to the first quarter of 2023. That was the first quarterly decrease in employee jobs following eight consecutive quarterly increases. Meanwhile, the number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits increased in August, up by 0.4% to 36,700. The overall unemployment rate in May to June also showed an increase, up to 2.7% from 2.4% the previous quarter. The employment rate, which measures the percentage of working age adults in a job, also weakened over the quarter, down from 72.4% to 71.1%. The statistics agency, Nisra, says the employment and unemployment figures should be interpreted carefully as the quarterly changes are not statistically significant. HMRC data also suggests that average pay rises in Northern Ireland are continuing to run behind the rate of inflation. In August, typical pay in NI increased by 0.1% (£2) over the month to 6% (£119) over the year. The UK's main rate of inflation in July was 6.8% and is likely to show a similar rate for August. Meanwhile, a major investment summit is to bring more than 100 global investors and businesses to Belfast this week. Essentially a sales pitch, the Northern Ireland Investment Summit will try to persuade companies to invest or re-invest here - while showcasing local businesses specialising in cyber security and green manufacturing.

economic indicators,The wheels could come off the car industry,2024-09-15,2020-04-07,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-52197819,"It shouldn't be any surprise that new car registrations plummeted last month.   As consumers lost confidence and pulled back on commitments to buy, and then as showrooms were forced to close, the number dropped by 44% across the UK, and by 49% in Scotland. That was a drop of more than 200,000 cars compared with March 2019.  In Scotland, the total nearly halved to 18,438. If that seems a lot, it's because March should be a very busy month for sales.  It's one of two months when new plates are introduced - in this case ""20"" - and that brings a peak. It's when dealers need to be very busy. Small van sales were down by even more, dropping 53% since last year - arguably a more sensitive indicator of economic health.  And having previously estimated that the number of new registrations might almost hold steady this year, at 1.7m vehicles, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders is estimating a full-year fall of 29% in 2020. That follows on some bumper years.  March 2017 saw more than twice as many UK registrations as last month.  It's not an industry that invites sympathy, so long as it's allowed to get on with doing what it does very well. But it was already facing a set of difficult challenges.  While geared to around half the market being diesel, and with Britain a big manufacturer of diesel car engines, that segment of the market has fallen precipitously due to polluting particulates, emissions scandals and growing restrictions on big engines through tax and urban low emission zones. The drop in new diesel registrations in March 2020 compared with March 2019 was 62%. That steep downward trend has been a feature of the market for years. Less than a fifth of new cars now are diesel. The range of alternatively-fuelled cars is expanding fast, from a low base.  Hybrid petrol cars saw a mild decline last month, while plug-ins and plug-in hybrid were the only categories on the rise. At nearly 12,000 across the UK, plug-in electric was close to reaching one in every 20 new cars last month, and that is expected to rise fast.  It's welcome in providing a greener future to the industry, but making the shift is a profound challenge to the industry to adjust, to get the right models to the market, and to have the right set of workshop skills to service them. And a pandemic in the midst of that is no help at all. It has meant Europe's auto industry finding, first, a struggle with supply chain disruption from Chinese factories that had not reopened after New Year.  Then they face disruption to their staffing, due to ill-health, followed by an enforced shutdown. And with unemployment expected to rise, possibly very sharply, that will mean less money available to buy big-ticket items. Will people turn to the used car market instead? That's not easy to say.  That market has also tanked, also because forecourts are closed. And if they're not shifting, that stock is costing business a lot of money. It's hard to price used cars until a number of factors become clearer in the new car market. To help stimulate the economy and help the sector in the last big crisis 11 years ago, Alistair Darling as Chancellor of the Exchequer poured public funds into a scrappage scheme - known in the US as ""cash for clunkers"".  With lots of dirty old diesel engines on the road, this could be a way of reducing emissions and helping the industry. But if it has a wish list for helpful government measures, it's more likely the car makers would choose a delay to Brexit and then a good deal to secure the least friction to trade. No, Brexit is not the top priority at the moment, but yes, it's still there, with negotiations curtailed to video-conferencing between UK and EU negotiating teams. April 6th brought a strongly-worded document from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (EAMA), pointing out that there's not much time left to strike a Brexit deal. Supply chains require one.  And with battery technology, they are set to become more integrated. Britain does not have its own significant battery-making capacity. Its car makers need to import, and they want to do so without hindrance. EAMA director general Erik-Mark Huitema says that, in a good year, €54bn of cars are traded between the EU and UK.  Within that trade are €14bn worth of parts crossing the North Sea and English Channel. ""The clock is ticking for these complex negotiations, and we are very concerned that the time remaining under the transitional arrangement is insufficient, especially given the ongoing Covid-19 crisis,"" he warned.  ""The unintended consequence of this could be a no-deal scenario. In terms of tariffs alone, this would have a massive impact, with some €6bn being added to the cost of doing cross-Channel trade. ""Such an outcome would be catastrophic to the automotive sector, and to the European economy in general. It should be avoided at all reasonable cost."""
economic indicators,Warning over future of British Steel as it cuts jobs,2024-09-15,2023-02-22,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64729316,"Unions have warned on the future of UK steelmaking after British Steel announced it will shut its coking ovens in Scunthorpe and cut up to 260 jobs. The Chinese-owned firm blamed an ""unprecedented"" rise in energy costs and demands to be greener. The biggest steelworkers' union said the cuts could have a ""catastrophic impact"" on steel production in the UK. Coking ovens turn coal into coke which burns at the higher temperature needed for furnaces used in steel production.  The closure of the ovens at its Scunthorpe headquarters, which means British Steel will import coke, has been seen as a concerning indicator about the health and future of the UK steel industry. The government said the decision by British Steel was ""very disappointing"" while negotiations were ongoing with the sector over funding support. British Steel currently employs around 4,200 workers in the UK and is owned by Chinese company Jingye. Making steel requires a lot of energy, and with prices soaring in recent months, the costs of making the metal have also gone up. The company said its energy bills and carbon-offsetting costs increased by £190m last year and ""decisive action"" was needed.  It added that its coke ovens were ""reaching the end of their operational life"" and that closing them would ""bring environmental benefits including reductions in emissions to air and water"". Alun Davies, national officer of the Community Trade Union, which represents the majority of steelworkers, said the union would ""not accept redundancies"" and added ""nothing is off the table when it comes to protecting our members' jobs"".  ""British Steel's plan to close the coke ovens could have a catastrophic impact on jobs and steel production at Scunthorpe and the UK as a whole,"" he added. Mr Davies claimed closing the ovens would see the company ""depending on unreliable imported coke"" wand would ""risk our sovereign capability to produce steel in the UK"". The Unite union, which also represents steelworkers, accused Jingye of reneging on investment promises and said the UK government had ""no serious plan for the industry"". General secretary Sharon Graham added that she was yet to see ""any financial justification for the closure of the coking ovens"".  But British Steel chief executive Xifeng Han said steelmaking in the UK was ""uncompetitive"" when compared to other international markets. ""Our energy costs, carbon costs and labour costs are some of the highest across the world, which are factors that we cannot influence directly,"" he said. Mr Han said the plan was to ""streamline"" the business while keeping ""the period of uncertainty for our colleagues as short as we can"". He said the company was undergoing its biggest transformation in its 130-year history, ""to make sure we can deliver the steel Britain requires"". The government has been holding negotiations with British Steel's owners over a £300m support package, along with others in the industry. The government said it would continue to work with British Steel to find a ""solution for the business and the wider sector, which plays a vital role in the UK economy"". Jingye has invested £330m in British Steel since it bought the business in 2020. Mr Han said the owners were ""committed"" to the company for the long term, but warned the transition to greener forms of energy to make steel was a ""major challenge"". Government offers to the firm have so far been rejected on the basis they come with too many strings attached, including job guarantees for 10 years, union sources have previously told the BBC. The offers are also too small to help with the estimated £2bn cost of transitioning from blast furnaces to more energy efficient electric arc furnaces, they said. Jonathan Reynolds, Labour's Shadow Business Secretary, said workers needed ""a government on their side securing the bright future our steel sector could have""."
economic indicators,WPP boss £48m pay rejected by a fifth,2024-09-15,2017-06-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40184352,"More than one in five shareholders at advertising giant WPP have voted against chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell's £48m pay package. The move makes it the seventh year in a row that more than 20% failed to endorse the boss's pay.  Investors also raised concerns over succession plans at the business when Sir Martin, 72, finally retires.  Last year 34% of investors refused to back his pay deal of £70.4m - the biggest in UK corporate history. The vote took place at the company's annual general meeting on Wednesday and saw 21.3% of shareholders either vote against his pay or abstain. WPP has attempted to reign in the vast sums paid to Sir Martin since 2012, when he faced a 60% revolt by investors. Since then, he has been paid more than £210m. Investors said they also wanted the board to give clearer indications over the company's future. Major investment funds, including Standard Life Investments, Royal London Asset Management and Hermes asked chairman, Roberto Quarta, for clarity. Deborah Gilshan, stewardship and governance director at Standard Life Investments, which has a 1.5% stake in WPP, said: ""[Succession] remains the key governance risk to our long term investment in WPP. ""Unusually, the CEO's service contract may be terminated by either the company or Sir Martin without any notice. ""Given this, we suggest the board consider what lead time would be required to ensure an orderly succession and discuss this with Sir Martin."" Mr Quarta insisted succession planning was well underway with key talent across the WPP group meeting the board. He added that a ""constantly refined list"" of external candidates was also available. Sir Martin has constantly defended his high pay, pointing out that WPP, which he essentially founded in 1985, continues to grow from strength to strength. Royal London Asset Management (RLAM), which holds shares worth £106m, remained unconvinced. Ashley Hamilton Claxton of RLAM, explained why the organisation voted against the pay package. She said: ""Executive pay at WPP continues to look excessive. ""Whilst we acknowledge that the reduction in the total long term bonuses and incentives available to executives under the new remuneration policy is a step in the right direction, the sheer scale of these remains exceptionally high, at over nine times the salary for the CEO."""
economic indicators,India's digital sprint is leaving millions behind,2024-09-15,2019-10-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49085846,"India has more than 630 million internet subscribers. But for every Indian who has access to the internet, there is at least one who does not and that person is most likely living in a rural area. Smriti Parsheera writes on the country's continuing digital divide. There is an exuberance around India's digital story.  The country is home to the world's second-largest internet user base, consisting of more than 630 million subscribers. That is more than the total population of the US, the United Kingdom, Russia and South Africa put together.  It also has the cheapest mobile data prices, which has allowed a large population to use the internet just in the last four years. Besides the size of the pie, data consumption is also on the rise.  The average internet user now consumes more than 9GB of data per month. That translates to watching 16 hours of video a month compared to just 15 minutes in 2015.   Other positive trends include a competitive e-commerce market, a booming video streaming industry and a choice of affordable devices.  At the government's end, electronic governance, mobile health and digital finance are at the heart of many policy discussions. All of this excitement is, however, surrounded by the sobering reality of India's continuing digital divide.  This refers to the gap between those who have access to the internet and other digital technologies and those who do not.  The divide is shaped both by the availability of internet services in different regions and the ability of individuals to tap into those services. A person's location, income, gender, education, language, and age are some of the factors that define their access. As per data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, the country has an internet density of 48.4. This represents the number of internet subscribers per 100 people in the population. Even though 66% of the country's population lives in its villages, rural internet density is just 25.3. In comparison, urban areas have a significantly higher density of 97.9.  This means that for every Indian who has access to the internet, there is at least one who does not and that person is most likely living in a rural area. We see stark variations in the access levels across the country's 28 states and nine union territories. States like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in the north and Orissa in the east are known to perform poorly on human development indicators, and they also fare badly in internet use density. The availability of internet infrastructure is also affected by geographic conditions.  For instance, the remote mountainous areas of Himachal Pradesh, sparsely populated deserts of Rajasthan and dense forests in Madhya Pradesh face greater digital exclusion. It so happens that many of these remote locations are also home to India's tribal and marginalised communities. Poor connectivity can therefore unwittingly end up perpetuating existing disadvantages. Gender is another important factor that shapes digital access. Only 16% of Indian women were found to be using mobile and internet services, a 2019 report from the GSMA, a body which represents mobile operators, said. On a comparative scale, women were 56% less likely to use mobile internet than men. This situation stems from a mix of economic, social and cultural factors placed against the backdrop of a deeply patriarchal setup. On the economic front, while data access charges have gone down drastically, the cost of internet-enabled handsets is still a barrier for many households.  The financial dependence of women and their lower position in the household pecking order naturally reduces the likelihood of them owning such devices. Besides ownership, lower literacy rates and digital awareness among women are some of the other limitations. Many of these factors also contribute to reduced access among the elderly population. Digital empowerment is known to create greater awareness and independence, which may be perceived by some as a threat to the established social order.  This thinking has manifested itself in several reports about some village-level community bodies imposing restrictions on the use of mobile phones and social media by women, particularly younger women. Finally, when it comes to the educated classes, the issue shifts from that of basic access to the chronic under-representation of women in various ways. From online spaces to research labs to meeting rooms, India mirrors the global trend of digital technologies continuing to remain the primary domain of men.  The Indian government has not been immune to these problems. One of its flagship programmes, the Digital India project, identifies universal access to mobile connectivity as one of its main pillars.  The government is trying to achieve this by providing broadband connectivity to the country's 250,000 village councils. This project has been in effect from 2011 but so far a little less than half of that target has been achieved. The number of locations where the completion of the work has led to functional internet is even lower. The government's National Digital Communications Policy acknowledges that much more effort is needed on this front.  It speaks about the need to bring connectivity to all under served areas and identifies specific groups, like marginalised communities, women and persons with disabilities that merit specific attention. The policy also lays emphasis on solving last-mile connectivity issues in both urban and rural areas, through the use of public Wi-Fi infrastructure. The policy discourse is clearly moving in the right direction.  From broad claims about the need for universal access, it has evolved to recognise some specific factors, like location, gender, and marginalisation, that shape the digital divide.  What India needs next is for policymakers to undertake a rigorous data-driven exercise to measure which factors are causing what level of exclusion and the reasons behind it. Only when we fully understand the beast of India's digital divide can we design targeted solutions to tame it. Smriti Parsheera is a Delhi-based technology policy researcher"
economic indicators,"Stormont needs to find £800m, civil servants say",2024-09-15,2023-05-02,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65454672,"Stormont officials believe they will need to find £800m in cuts and revenue raising measures in the wake of last week's budget. The figure is included in an assessment of the budget by the independent Northern Ireland Fiscal Council (NIFC). It said Stormont's overall budget for day-to-day spending would fall by 3.3% in real terms in this financial year. That is a tougher settlement than central government departments, which are facing a 0.7% real terms cut. This is particularly stark for Northern Ireland education, which is facing a 2.7% cut while the schools budget for England is due to rise by 6.5%. The NIFC said the relatively large cut for education may reflect that it was the largest overspender last year. The council said Stormont's real overall budget cut would have been 5.5% if last year's overspend had to be paid back immediately. The Treasury has agreed the £300m overspend can be repaid over two years rather than one. The NIFC said that while this ""avoids a very sharp real terms cut in departmental spending this year"" it still means ""tough decisions on spending and revenue raising"". It adds: ""The NI Civil Service believes it they may need to find £800m this year given the pressures on its budgets.  ""Revenue raising would likely be focused on fees and charges as the secretary of state has already set the regional rate for 2023- 24."" The government has said the overspend can be cleared by using any additional in-year funding from the Treasury. Should this not cover the full amount, the outstanding balance would be paid in 2024-25 by reallocating money from previously announced Northern Ireland funding packages. The NIFC suggested that the money is most likely to be found in two pots - the 2020 'New Deal' funding to help businesses following Brexit and the 2014 Stormont House Agreement funding for institutions to address the legacy of the Troubles.  The former totalled £400m, although it is not clear how much has already been spent. The latter totalled up to £150m over five years. Separately, an independent review by the NIFC has concluded that public spending per head in Northern Ireland needs to be 24% higher than in England to deliver comparable public services. The work uses population indicators such as age and long term illness to assess relative need. It calculates that spending her head in Northern Ireland is currently 23% higher than England. But it warns that under the current public spending model that premium will fall to 20% by the end of this decade. As recently as 2018-19, the Northern Ireland premium was as high as 40% due to pots of one-off funding related to various political deals. The NIFC says that the reduction in that premium has contributed to the current budget pressure on Northern Ireland departments. Sir Robert Chote, chair of the NIFC, said ""For many years NI departments benefited from funding-per-head that was not only well above spending in England but also above estimates of relative need."" He added that the funding premium has ""fallen sharply to broadly in line with relative need - which has already proved very challenging - and it is set to drop even further"". He said this would increase the pressure on a restored Stormont Executive to deliver reform and improve efficiency, as well as confronting it with difficult choices over cutting services or raising more revenue.  Sir Robert added that another option would be to put a ""funding floor"" under the block grant in line with relative need, as happens in Wales.  That sort of arrangement would need to be negotiated and agreed with the UK government. The Democratic Unionist Party has been tentatively floating the idea of an arrangement similar to the one that applies in Wales."
economic indicators,Has the home ownership dream soured?,2024-09-15,2017-10-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-41581824,"""Trapped"" and ""frustrated"" - This is how people describe being unable to sell homes whose values have yet to recover from the financial crisis that started more than a decade ago. House prices are lower in real terms than they were in 2007 in more than half of England and Wales, according to analysis for BBC News. Those who wish to sell can find themselves with a home worth less than they paid for it, particularly in northern England. In the areas where values have continued to rise buyers are finding it impossible to find an affordable home, particularly in London and the South. But what is it really like for those of us trying to get a step on the property ladder or move? The large number of for sale signs and boarded up homes tell the story of a depressed sales market in Horden, County Durham The former mining community is not attracting buyers or investors and house values, when adjusted for inflation, have fallen by about 57%. Lee Percival paid £112,995 for his home on a newly built estate in 2007. The estate has never been finished due to the financial crash and his home has dropped in value by about £30,000. ""I regret buying it at the time we did, my wife loves it here, but I just feel - well we have made a loss haven't we? ""Yes, I feel trapped."" Mr Percival admits if he had to move it would be hard to sell. ""We could lose more than that, we might have to take less than that for it. ""I know I could never sell it at the moment."" In parts of Bradford values have crashed by up to 50% in real terms and one of those who have found themselves with a house worth less than it cost is Isaac Stott. The charity worker bought his home in 2007 and paid £86,500 for it. ""Everything was going really well it looked like a good investment but within nine months the property value dropped to around £35 to 40,000."" He said the market has improved but his three-bedroom home is on the market for £76,500 - £10,000 less than he paid. ""It is frustrating to see how much it has dropped and how much it is worth. ""My sister in Kent lived in a very small house and she just sold that for just over £250,000 and it is like - great."" Isaac and his wife admit trying to sell and the potential financial loss is worrying. ""It has taken up space in our life. I can find myself coming home and thinking 'Oh I wish we had sold this'. ""It weighs on my mind."" Lucian Cook, residential property research director at Savills, said one of the principal reasons for the stark regional differences is economic. ""What you have is a two speed-economy much more weighted to London and the south leaving a lot of the north behind. ""What that tends to mean is there is much greater population pressure in the south and as a result you have much greater shortages of house building which has pushed prices up in a way that hasn't happened in the north."" He said the disparity means homeowners in northern England, who have bought since 2007, have not seen significant growth in prices. ""That makes it very difficult for you to accumulate equity in the house that you own and in turn that makes it difficult to trade up the housing ladder unless you have managed to pay off a very significant amount of your mortgage."" Bank Hall, Burnley, has seen prices drop by about 53% in real terms in 10 years but investor Indinar Madhar is not concerned. ""I think there was a bubble that burst around 2007/08. ""I've bought and kept them, I do it purely for rental income and I don't see myself selling. ""People are happy to pay about £40,000 in this area. I have another house I bought in this area for £42,000 and I'd be lucky to get £40,000 so it's not worth my interest to sell."" She said she bought because the 15 houses were cheap and has no regrets. ""It made sense for me to buy cheap houses and charge rent and get a good return on my investment for my rent so that's why I did it."" She also says businesses in the area are encouraging more people to live in Burnley, in particular major employers. ""That's one thing about Bank Hall, it's so close to the facilities of the town. You should expect for it to have a price tag on it. Maybe in time it will turn that corner."" For Neil Potter it is a different problem. He rents a three-bedroom house in Halberton in Devon because he says it is still far too expensive for him to buy. ""We rent our house - we can't get on the market because we've got three kids and to buy a four-bed, you're looking at £330,000... house prices in Devon and this area are quite expensive."" Values have fallen in Halberton, by more than 40% in a decade, the largest drop in the South West; but that brings little comfort for Mr Potter. ""We've been here 12 months - we rented in Tiverton before. ""That was a four-bed and to buy that, it was about £260,000. The three-bed we're renting in Halberton is worth around £330,000 - silly money."" Long-term residents in the area were surprised to learn values had dropped in real terms. Heather Adwick has lived in the village for 39 years and said she did not think the village was a cheap place to buy. ""I didn't think the prices had gone down because we're amazed by one house - a cottage - on the main road which is up for £410,000. ""I can't believe it - we're always amazed by how much people are putting them up for."""
economic indicators,US condemns reports Russia may seize firms' assets,2024-09-15,2022-03-11,By Annabelle  Liang,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60703359,"The United States has condemned reports that Moscow may seize the assets of businesses which have stopped operating in Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. White House press secretary Jen Psaki warned that such a move will result in ""more economic pain"". Her comments come as the US Congress passed a spending bill which includes almost $14bn (£10.7bn) of emergency aid for Ukraine. President Biden is expected to announce new measures against Russia on Friday.  Russia seizing the assets of foreign companies would be a ""lawless decision,"" Ms Psaki said on Twitter. ""It will compound the clear message to the global business community that Russia is not a safe place to invest and do business,"" she added. In response to a growing number of firms suspending their operations, Moscow has warned that it may nationalise production plants or factories where work has been suspended. The ruling United Russia party proposed the move on Monday, although Andrei Turchak, secretary of its general council, acknowledged it was an ""extreme measure"". ""But we will not tolerate stabs in the back, and we will protect our people. This is a real war, and not against Russia as a whole, but against citizens,"" Mr Turchak said.  On Thursday, the party said President Vladimir Putin was finding ""legal solutions"" to put the plan in place. In light of the reports, global corporations that are cutting business ties or have halted operations in Russia told the BBC that they currently do not intend to change their plans. ""We have had no indications from Russian authorities that they intend to nationalise our assets,"" a spokesperson for Coca-Cola said. BP, which announced that it will offload its stake in Russian state-owned oil firm Rosneft, said its ""position is unchanged"".  ""We have decided to exit our shareholding in Rosneft and our businesses with Rosneft in Russia, and we are pursuing that. There isn't a change or an update on this,"" a spokesperson said. In Washington on Thursday, the US Congress passed a $1.5tn spending bill, which includes almost $14bn in emergency aid for Ukraine. The bill is expected to be signed into law by President Biden before government funding is due to run out on Friday night. Also on Friday, the US, along with the Group of Seven (G7) and the European Union, is expected to move to remove Russia's ""most favoured nation"" trading status over its invasion of Ukraine.  Revoking the preferential trading status would mean that the US and its allies would be able to impose tariffs on Russia, which would further isolate its economy. The G7 is made up of the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada. Pushan Dutt, a professor of economics and political science at the INSEAD business school, believes Russia underestimated the global response to the war. The country has been ""pushed to a corner"", he said, as it underestimated the pushback from Ukrainians, the resulting international sanctions, and the ""will of NATO and the US to carry a full-fledged economic warfare"".  ""I suspect they will go ahead and nationalise these assets, because their economy is under heavy pressure,"" Professor Dutt told the BBC.  ""If all these factories shut down and start laying off workers, then they face internal pressures at home as well. The only way to maintain support internally is to make it an 'us versus them', Russia versus the rest of the world kind of picture,"" he said."
economic indicators,UK economy ‘stalls’ over Brexit fears,2024-09-15,2019-02-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47127927,"The UK's service sector stagnated last month, with new orders falling for the first time in two-and-a-half years, according to the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI). The figures showed a reading of 50.1 in January, lower than December's 51.2. IHS Markit's Chris Williamson said the results indicated that the UK economy ""is at risk of stalling or worse"". He said this was because of growing Brexit uncertainty coinciding with a wider slowdown in the global economy. Economists had expected a reading of 51 - a figure above 50 indicates growth. It follows last Friday's news that the PMI figures for manufacturing fell to 52.8 last month - the second weakest reading since July 2016. The figures revealed that UK manufacturers were preparing for Brexit by stockpiling raw materials at a record pace and that there was a risk of the sector slipping into recession. Speaking about the service sector figures, Mr Williamson said: ""Growth ground almost to a halt in January, matching similar disappointing news in the manufacturing and construction sectors. ""The last three months have seen the economy slip into its weakest growth spell for six years and indicate that GDP likely stagnated at the start of 2019 after eking out modest growth of just 0.1% in the fourth quarter. ""The survey results indicate that companies are becoming increasingly risk averse and eager to reduce overheads in the face of weakened customer demand and rising political uncertainty.  ""Such worries were in turn most commonly linked to heightened Brexit anxiety, though wider global political and economic factors were also seen to have been taking their toll on demand."" Andy Verity, economics correspondent Until very recently, what's been most remarkable is not how much of an economic impact all the Brexit-related uncertainty has had, but how little. Growth has continued. The number employed keeps hitting new records. The services sector which makes up four-fifths of our economy has continued to expand.  But, crucially, those upbeat figures on jobs and growth are lagging indicators, about two months behind reality. The purchasing managers' index is more up to date, surveying the people in firms taking financial decisions.  According to them the most forward-looking indicators - such as new orders from customers - are down.  However - before we assume the politics of Brexit is stalling the economy, it's worth noting something. Back in July 2016, right after the referendum, respondents to the survey were even gloomier than they are now.  Some economists predicted capital flight; others predicted recession. Those fears, so far at least, have proved largely misplaced.  Mr Williamson's views on uncertainty over the impact of Brexit were backed up by other experts. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Services firms could not be clearer in blaming Brexit uncertainty for the stagnation of activity in January."" He added that the figures suggested that activity could fall over the coming months, but said that similar forecasts in 1998, 2001 and 2003 ""failed to materialise"". And Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said: ""Brexit uncertainty continues to be at the heart of the malaise, as clients delayed orders and consumers were deeply reluctant to spend under the continuing cloud of hesitation, indecision and ambiguity."""
economic indicators,Zimbabwe hopes to rise from the ashes in 2018,2024-09-15,2018-01-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42547456,"In our series of letters from Africa, journalist-turned-barrister Brian Hungwe looks at what is in store for Zimbabweans in 2018 following the resignation of 93-year-old Robert Mugabe in November after 37 years in power. A year ago, no Zimbabwean would have predicted the tumultuous events that led to Mr Mugabe's political demise and the elevation of his sacked deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa to the presidency.  Whatever the circumstances that ushered Mr Mnangagwa into office, the one thing all Zimbabweans yearn for this year is an economic revival. There is a biting cash crisis, with long queues at banks. With elections due in August, the new president has seven months to demonstrate that he is no Robert Mugabe. His predecessor was accused of squandering opportunities - it was, according to some, a period of misrule that allowed the economy to be run into the ground. But to win the elections, Mr Mnangagwa has to fix the economy. And he knows it. Last month, he went to South Africa, the region's economic power, to woo back investors, frightened off by Mr Mugabe's indigenisation laws that required that 51% of companies be in the hands of black Zimbabweans. Mr Mnangagwa's government has softened the legislation - and it now only applies to diamond and platinum companies. The packed gathering in South Africa was also attended by those who fled Zimbabwe's economic crisis over the last two decades - it is estimated that more than three million Zimbabweans now live in the diaspora. Mr Mnangagwa wants them to come home and invest - and assured them that the economy was his number one concern. ""Mr Mnangagwa does not seem to mind the colour of the cat as long as it catches mice"" Insiders talk of an economic miracle in the offing, returning the country torn by political strife to the envy of the region - after decades of international isolation. There is a projection the economy will grow by more than 4.5% this year. While Mr Mugabe adopted a ""Look East"" policy, after being spurned by the West, Mr Mnangagwa is keen to show he is not taking sides. He does not seem to mind the colour of the cat as long as it catches mice. Sources say he has strong Chinese backing to revive the country and improving relations with the UK, the country's former colonial power. In his inauguration speech, Mr Mnangagwa said Zimbabweans should not remain hostages of their past. ""Let us humbly appeal to all of us that we let bygones be bygones, readily embracing each other in defining a new destiny of our beloved Zimbabwe."" It was an admission that Mr Mugabe's policies had damaged the country and implied the new leader intended to do things differently - despite the fact that he had been part of the old system.  Yet the statistics are stark. Some estimates put Zimbabwe's rate of unemployment at 95% - most people eke a living in the informal economy. The country's manufacturing sector has shrunk by at least 50%, according to the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries.  There are also no significant revenue inflows, and import and export disparities are huge. More on Zimbabwe post Mugabe: Rampant corruption has also corroded the fabric of society, leaving many dispirited. Mr Mnangagwa said he would act - and many arrests have taken place. This has given some people hope. However, ""the crocodile"", as Mr Mnangagwa is affectionately known because of the unit he fought in during the liberation war, will have to tame himself to keep these hopes alive. He cannot afford to ""Mugabenise"" Zimbabwe again if he wants to win popular support in elections due before the end of August, though sceptics suggest the ruling Zanu-PF party - given its now open backing from the military - could simply return to its strong-arm tactics to remain in power. Either way, the year ahead looks rocky for the opposition. Weak and divided, it is unclear whether it will unite behind one candidate to challenge Mr Mnangagwa. The new president insists that it will not be business as usual in 2018 - on the political or economic front. He wakes up early for work and spends weekends in the office - in contrast to his 93-year-old predecessor, who was often pictured napping on the job.  The indications so far are that ""the crocodile"" does mean business. And business is what matters.

economic indicators,Argentine leader Macri trounced in primary vote,2024-09-15,2019-08-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-49317750,"Conservative Argentine President Mauricio Macri suffered a resounding defeat in primary elections on Sunday. The primary, in which presidential candidates from all parties take part, was won by his left-wing rival, Alberto Fernández. Mr Macri, whose austerity measures have turned many voters against him, is hoping to win a second term in office in the presidential poll on 27 October. But analysts say his chances of beating Mr Fernández now look very slim. Voting in the primaries is compulsory and is not restricted to party members but open to all those eligible to cast their ballot in the presidential polls. Whoever wins is therefore seen as a favourite for the presidential polls on 27 October. The primaries were introduced in 2009 to cut down on the number of candidates running in the presidential elections with contenders having to win a minimum of 1.5% to be eligible to stand for the presidency. With more than 95% of votes counted, the coalition backing Mr Fernández had 47.7% of the votes and that supporting President Macri had 32.1%. Third was centrist former economy minister Roberto Lavagna with 8.2%. The remaining candidates all had less than 3%.  The result is seen as a rejection by voters of the harsh austerity measures introduced by President Macri in an effort to stabilise Argentina's battered economy. Argentina is in a recession and has one of the highest inflation rates in the world. The local currency, the peso, lost half of its value against the dollar last year. While inflation has come down in recent months from a high of 57.3% in May, this seems not to have translated in support for President Macri's policies.  If Mr Fernández were to get the same percentage or more of votes in the presidential election on 27 October, he would win it outright, without the need for a second round. Under Argentine election rules, if a candidate wins at least 45% of the vote or gains 40% with a 10-percentage-point lead, that candidate is declared the outright winner. If there is no outright winner, a second round will be held on 24 November pitting the top two candidates against each other.  The 60-year-old lawyer is a member of the main opposition coalition, Frente de Todos.  His candidacy for the presidency came as somewhat of a surprise as former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner - to whom he is not related - had been widely tipped to be the opposition coalition's candidate for the top office. But in May she announced in a video posted on social media that she had ""asked Alberto Fernandez to lead a team that includes both of us, him as the presidential candidate and me as candidate for the vice position"". While Mr Fernández served as cabinet chief both under Ms Fernández and her husband and predecessor in office, Néstor Kirchner, he does not have the same name recognition as his more famous running mate.  Mr Fernández's relations with his running mate have been rocky in the past. After leaving her administration in 2008. Mr Fernández became a vocal critic of his former boss but he later dismissed their disagreements as ""what happens to many Argentines, that you fight among friends because you disagree over politics"". Mr Fernández celebrated his success by stressing his commitment to change. ""We are confident that Argentina needed to end with this chapter and start another page. I am confident that today Argentines have started to write another story,"" he said after the results were announced. President Macri said that he ""recognised"" that he had had a ""bad election"" and that he would ""redouble"" his efforts to gain the support he needs to win the presidential election in October.  Argentine markets reacted with predictable dismay to the news that the country is likely to be in for a change of political direction. In early trading, Argentina's main Merval stock index fell 10%, while the peso slumped 25% against the dollar. Investors fear the return to power of Ms Fernández de Kirchner, who presided over an administration remembered for a high degree of protectionism and heavy-handed state intervention in the economy. Edward Glossop, Latin America economist at Capital Economics, said Mr Macri's government would probably pull out all the stops to try to shore up popular support. This could include easing the pace of economic austerity imposed as part of Argentina's agreement with the International Monetary Fund. ""An outright loosening of the purse strings is possible. The IMF would probably turn a blind eye to this, since it is in its interest for President Macri to secure re-election,"" he said, but added: ""We doubt that these efforts would be enough to change voter perception."""
economic indicators,Recession fears prompt selling in global stocks,2024-09-15,2019-08-14,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49352760,"Global stock markets fell around the world as concerns about the US-China trade war and the global economy prompted investors to dump shares. The three main US stock markets closed 3% lower overnight, European stocks fell across the board, while Asian stock markets opened lower. Weak data from Germany and China on Wednesday helped fuel a rush for safe assets like bonds and gold. Bond market moves pointed to possible recessions in major economies. The US central bank also came under renewed pressure from US President Donald Trump for not doing enough to support the world's largest economy.  There are concerns that renewed attacks by Mr Trump on the Federal Reserve could erode investor confidence on its ability to make independent decisions. Analyst Oliver Pursche, from financial services company Bruderman, said the global picture was precarious. ""What's happening in Hong Kong, what's happening with Brexit and the trade war, it's all a mess,"" the chief market strategist said. ""Every central bank around the world is trying to prop up economies and every politician around the world is trying to destroy economies."" News that Germany's GDP contracted in the second quarter, and that China's industrial growth in July hit a 17-year low, had already spooked markets in Europe. The FTSE 100 closed more than 1% lower, while in Germany and France the markets finished more than 2% lower. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped some 2% in early trading on Thursday, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index opened 1.4% lower. Both later regained some ground. Disruptions related to pro-democracy protests have also weighed on the stock market in Hong Kong.  Another worry was that bond markets are flashing recession warnings.  The yield on two-year and 10-year Treasury bonds inverted for the first time since June 2007.  This means investor appetite for safety is such that they are willing to get lower returns for holding bonds for a longer period. Usually investors demand higher returns for holding bonds for longer due to the risks involved with parking your money away for a long time. Historically, such bond movements have been a reliable indicator of possible recessions, and preceded the last global downturn more than 10 years ago. The UK bond yield curve also inverted for the first time since 2008, while the yield gap between 10-year and 2-year German government bonds was at its tightest since the financial crisis. Meanwhile, the CBOE volatility index - the so-called fear index - jumped higher, and spot gold prices rose. On Wednesday, Mr Trump again attempted to deflect the market turmoil onto the US Federal Reserve and its interest rate policy, calling Fed chief Jerome Powell ""clueless"". In raising interest rates four times last year ""the Federal Reserve acted far too quickly, and now is very, very late"" in cutting borrowing costs, the president tweeted. ""Too bad, so much to gain on the upside!"" Recent presidents have avoided commenting on Fed policy, in a sign of respect for the bank's independence. Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent The recession signal from the bond market will only heap pressure on the Federal Reserve to give the president what he wants - more rate cuts. Wall Street certainly thinks it's inevitable, pricing in a cut in September. Last month, America's central bank reduced its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2008. That failed to impress Donald Trump who berated Fed Chair Jay Powell for not cutting rates quickly enough. And as the havoc on the financial markets was unfolding, President Trump was back on twitter defending his administration's tariff war with China and attacking the Fed, calling the chairman clueless.  But if Mr Trump gets what he wants, it may come at a steep price.  The Fed's recent rate cut didn't buoy the markets like it used to. So it's not clear that more rate cuts will blunt the damage from his ongoing trade war with China which is creating uncertainty and raising costs for businesses and consumers. Earlier on Wednesday, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox Business Network the central bank should cut rates by half a percentage point ""as soon as possible"", an action he claimed would lead to stock markets soaring. Despite the US delaying the 1 September imposition of tariffs on some Chinese imports into the US, it has done little to ease concerns.  ""The challenge is that Trump's trade policy has proven so erratic that you cannot relieve the sense of uncertainty,"" said Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon.  As of September last year, the US central bank had a relatively rosy outlook for the economy, expecting that the stimulus from the Trump administration's massive $1.5tn tax cut package and spending in 2018 would sustain growth and justify steadily higher interest rates. Mr Trump wants to make the economy a central part of his case for his 2020 re-election campaign. In an interview scheduled to air on Fox Business Network on Friday, former Fed chief Janet Yellen said she felt the US economy remained ""strong enough"" to avoid a downturn, but ""the odds have clearly risen and they are higher than I'm frankly comfortable with""."
economic indicators,Nigeria FA boss Pinnick blames probes for failures,2024-09-15,2019-11-20,Oluwashina Okeleji,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/50492089,"Amaju Pinnick has been the Nigeria Football Federation president since 2014 Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) president Amaju Pinnick has blamed investigations by the anti-corruption authorities for the country's recent failures on the international scene. He added that the NFF was facing a lack of funds as he responded to a call by Nigeria's sports minister Sunday Dare at a meeting on Tuesday for an explanation to 'several failures' from the football administrators. , external Nigeria's under-17 and under-20s suffered round of 16 exits at this year's World Cup, the team of locally-based players failed to qualify for the 2020 African Nations Championship (CHAN) as well as suffering an early exit from the regional Wafu Cup tournament. More recently both the men's and women's teams failed to qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games football tournaments. The NFF boss responded to Dare's comments with a 15-page statement, external on what problems the body is currently facing. ""Issues of funding (inadequacy and late release of same) and the toxic and disruptive environment in which the NFF has had to operate for the past 18 months (with the Federation's leadership and brand falsely and maliciously dragged from one investigative agency to the other and from one court to the other on same baseless allegations) are the core reasons for the poor outings of the Super Falcons, CHAN Eagles, Golden Eaglets and Olympic Eagles in recent international matches/tournaments,"" an NFF statement said. The NFF has been under scrutiny both on and off the pitch in recent months. The Nigerian government recently dropped its corruption case against five officials of the football authority, including president Pinnick.  But despite this month's development, two other bodies are continuing its investigations into the NFF. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) still has two corruption cases against the federation while the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission's (ICPC) seized properties in September as part of yet another probe. The ICPC is yet to bring a formal case against the federation or any of its member but BBC Sport understands that the investigations are looking at allegations of how sponsorship money generated from the second tier of the country's game was spent. All five top officials have always denied any wrongdoing. Despite the numerous challenges, the NFF is optimistic about the future and draw some positives from the recent performance of the Super Eagles. ""The best performance indicator for any country in international football is the A team, in this case Super Eagles, which in recent times drew with five -time world champions Brazil and Ukraine in friendlies,"" says Pinnick. ""And they defeated Benin Republic and Lesotho in 2021 Afcon qualifying matches. These, after finishing third at the first-ever 24-team Afcon in Egypt this year summer.""

economic indicators,Six months of Brexit: Business pays the price,2024-09-15,2021-06-26,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-57623090,"The story of Brexit can be told in three-word slogans: Take Back Control, Brexit Means Brexit, Get Brexit Done.  So five years after the referendum, and six months from leaving the single market, what's the slogan from businesses most affected? Bureaucracy, delay, cost. Many businesses aren't much affected. The 10% drop in the value of sterling during the night that results came in has been forgotten and priced in. Most firms don't export. And the focus has been much more on the extraordinary challenges of surviving Covid-19 than on Brexit-16. Some businesses look to opportunities from the new regime. Some are already looking to the upside in more distant markets which British ministers are keen to open wider - Scotch whisky distillers among them, looking to an end of Australia's 5% tariffs. But for those who grew out of Britain's close integration into the European Union, its customs union and its single market, the disintegration of that union has left them paying the price.  The Scottish government sought to highlight the problems from Brexit this week, publishing a dossier of negative outcomes. It cited evidence from Scottish Enterprise's engagement with 670 importing and exporting businesses between January and April across a range of sectors. Some 41% of them reported the top challenges they faced at the time were caused by the end of the Brexit transition period, such as transportation costs (cited by 17% of the businesses) and disruption at UK borders (13%). Over the months, we've reported on those exporting plants, who find themselves completely barred from sending any produce into Europe or Northern Ireland with earth attached to it. Seed potatoes were also completely barred from export into the customs union, though potatoes are not. We've heard the concerns of berry farmers in eastern Scotland who now lack access to the EU nationals on whom their business model was built, and hotel operators in remote areas as well as cities who depend on skilled European recruits. Universities which depend on recruiting the cream of European young academics are finding it much tougher to recruit them, where networks and their future careers no longer stretch across national boundaries. The loss of seamless access for touring performance artists and fashion houses was raised again at Westminster this week, pointing to the loss of cultural exchange, which is apparent also from the difficulty of bringing European artistes to festivals in the UK. And while whisky may gain from the Australian deal, we've heard from sheep and cattle farmers who foresee the arrival of meat into the British market without quota or tariff, with industrial-scale production and less stringent standards than those required under current EU and UK regulations. For the Brexit project, the problem here is that the gains from wider and deeper access to more distant markets will have to be very big to make up for the loss of seamless access to Europe. And they will take time to develop, while the people and firms who lose out do so much faster and make a bigger noise about it. It is perhaps to the advantage of the project that Covid has masked much of the impact. We cannot know how much exports of food, market prices and disruption of business travel would have changed if hospitality and commerce had continued without the infection control measures in the UK and its trading partners. But there are some indications of the Brexit effect, in the 19% decline of food trade with the EU in January to April compared with 2018, while non-EU trade fell 4%. Six months in, I've been hearing from sectors and companies about how Brexit now looks close up.  ATL Turbines in Dundee has a niche in servicing large, chunky equipment for aerospace, military and power plant customers around the world. Dale Harris, its chief executive, echoes the familiar refrain that selling into Europe used to be as easy as selling to a customer down the road. Now, consignments to European customers are more difficult than to Canada or the USA, delayed by incorrect paperwork, often resulting from the failings of fast couriers. With a four-fold increase in both import and export paperwork, and each one taking around three times longer, the wrong exchange rate or commodity code holds things up for days and sometimes weeks. There's an admission that the work for European clients has suffered.  Doing business with Britain has become more difficult for Europeans. While the Dundonians get more used to what's required for outbound pallets and packages, the problems persist with inbound: EU suppliers of spare parts and materials are still not tuned in to the bureaucracy. There's also the issue of safety accreditation - a vital component of work in aerospace. That used to be done under the umbrella of Europe's aviation regulator. Not any longer. And the price of access to European accreditation as a non-EU company is five times higher. ATL is confident it has a strongly established niche, and that it will retain customers. But finding common cause with the engineering sector more widely, it worries for those whose produce can be easily replaced by an EU-based rival. British exporters into the EU are marked down as problematic and their deliveries unreliable.  Some in the seafood sector thought escape from Europe's Common Fisheries Policy could only be for the better. They're thinking differently now. The deal done last December did them few favours. Talk of a 'sea of opportunity' rings hollow. As a newly independent coastal state, Britain has failed to get agreement with non-EU northern neighbours on shared catch quotas.  Access to the big EU fish market in Boulogne-sur-Mer was the first to find paperwork was a big problem. Each consignment requires a health certificate, signed by a vet on despatch from the UK. They have to be on paper, not electronic, in certain ink colours, numbered in precise ways, but with these rules inconsistently applied at different border posts. Big exporters, such as salmon farmers, have got used to the rules, and trucks get through. But they do so with delays for checks which mean the produce has less shelf-life when it reaches the customer, and therefore it's worth less. The inability to promise delivery times has reduced the Scottish salmon premium, though total tonnage has held up well. Smaller consignments, in so-called groupage, are still not faring well. These are a few pallets at a time, shared in a truck, moving through customs at the speed of the least well prepared paperwork. Hauliers are reluctant to take them on, and prices are up. With family roots in Madrid, three generations of the Buesa family have built up an integrated seafood catching and processing company based at Troon harbour, Ayrshire. These haven't been easy decades for fisheries, but they've never seen anything like this before. Four of their boats have been put on the market, with no sign of buyers. Jordan Buesa, the third generation who runs the fleet while a semi-professional ice hockey player with the Fife Flyers, says Brexit is behind difficulty in supplying the family firm's chandlery. Marine grade plywood seems impossible to source. So is hydraulic oil. Costs are up, including fuel. Without free access to European recruitment, he explains the firm cannot crew its boats. They would normally be busy at this time of year, but most of them are tied up in the harbour. Local crews are self-employed, paid on a catch-share basis, and say their earnings are down by around 40% because seafood prices are so low. SB Fish can illustrate how the surreal and politically explosive position of Northern Ireland is having an impact on this side of the North Channel. The company lands a lot of prawns, langoustine and 'tails' - the least valuable of the species that become scampi. Production of scampi used to be on several sites, but pre-Brexit, these were consolidated in Northern Ireland.  To get 'tails' to the province, SB Fish has to send them to Glasgow for a vet's stamp on a health certificate, and then south to Cairnryan, for the ferry and a check on paperwork when it docks.   What used to be as little as five or six hours from Troon harbour to the factory is now at least three or four times as long. It's no wonder that the Clyde Fishermen's Association reports quayside prices in Scotland can be half those in the province. For the first time, they're getting complaints about quality once it arrives. Customers are paying less for prawns on the continent, and one phoned up this week to say unreliable delivery times mean they can't order as much. All that is before a customs post is erected at Cairnryan. The Brexit deal on Northern Ireland requires food arriving on the British mainland will have to be checked for compliance. The UK Government is reluctant to give the go-ahead for building. But the position remains unclear as Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, locks horns with the European Commission on how the deal should be interpreted. According to James Withers, chief exeuctive of Scotland Food and Drink trade body, that refusal to check inbound food has frustrated his members. While they have to contend with costly delays in reaching European markets, European suppliers to Britain have been given an unfettered run at the British market. On the frontline are the hauliers. Twenty of the biggest ones, including Scotland's Malcolm Group, signed a letter this week urging Boris Johnson to ease the difficulties they've got with driver shortages and customs delays.  Martin Reid, Scottish policy director of the Road Haulage Association, says the problems in Scotland are the same as elsewhere, and with fewer drivers, delays, rising costs and tight margins, don't be surprised if there are shortages of supplies ahead. The Government didn't listen, he told me.  At the start of the year, it was only concerned about queues at ports and shop shelves being empty.  Neither happened. But he warns that we're beginning to head in that direction now. ""A number of members have trucks parked up because they can't get drivers to fulfil their duties. And so it's inevitable that not only will costs of goods go up, but there will be a supply issue as well for some of the goods you see on the shelves."" What's next? The political instability of Northern Ireland has arisen from a protocol that put an economic border between it and the British mainland. Grace periods for some of the checks on fresh food going into the province and the European single market are coming to an end.  Some large hauliers who gave Brexit six months to see how things worked out are minded to give up on supplying Northern Ireland, according to Martin Reid. By the end of the year, engineering firms are facing a change in the regime for testing and certifying their products as safe. The few UK laboratories that handle the tests are at full stretch already. Delays to implementation of changes to pharmaceutical regulation are coming to an end over 24 months. That could slow up the process of approving drugs (though it did not do so with Covid vaccinations) and implications for supply of medicines from European manufacturers, in the words of the Scottish government, ""remain unknown"".  Applications for European nationals to get 'settled status' are closed this month. There are concerns for children and older people who may not yet realise that they could be deported without the right to remain. The consequences of new trade deals are becoming clearer, and a new form of politics in Britain is emerging around trying to influence trade policy.  The secretive ways in which deals have been done so far, without the promised, independent Trade and Agriculture Commission, will come under pressure inside politics, as well as from UK and foreign business and pressure groups on labour rights and the environment. We're moving from the short term, mixed up with the impact of Covid, into the medium term.  Is Brexit done? Far from it."
economic indicators,Economic downturn 'may have begun' in NI,2024-09-15,2019-07-08,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-48885176,"Northern Ireland's economy may have begun a downturn, research from Ulster Bank has suggested. The bank conducts a monthly survey of private sector activity in what is considered a reliable indicator of the economy. It indicated there have been four consecutive months of falling output since March. The output decline in June was at the steepest rate since November 2012.  The bank's chief economist Richard Ramsey said a clear trend was emerging. ""After six years of growth, it appears that the economic cycle has turned,"" he said. ""The severity or otherwise of that downturn will depend on a range of factors.  ""The kind of Brexit that we see will of course be a major factor."" Mr Ramsey said data for new orders and exports was a particular concern. ""Both domestic and overseas order books are contracting at a rapid rate, which suggests that activity will be subdued in the coming months. ""Indeed, export orders fell at their fastest pace in almost eight years.  ""The manufacturing sector appears particularly weak at present, with output falling at its fastest pace in June for more than a decade."" This type of survey is known as a Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) and is used widely in developed economies. It uses an index approach where any reading above 50 is growth and below 50 is contraction. The headline business activity figure for Northern Ireland in June was 44.1 down from 46 in May. PMIs are considered a fairly reliable guide to what later official data will show. Northern Ireland was not alone in having experienced deteriorating business conditions in June. Similar surveys for the UK have suggested that the manufacturing and construction sectors contracted in June with output in the dominant services sector flat.  Mr Ramsey said US/China trade disputes had having a dampening effect across global manufacturing. The most recent official output data for Northern Ireland covers the final quarter of 2018. It indicated that the local economy had expanded by 0.2% compared to the previous quarter. The data for the first quarter of 2019 is due to be published next week."
economic indicators,Rise in Living Wage 'may have to wait',2024-09-15,2017-08-04,By Brian Milligan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40824937,"Forthcoming rises to the National Living Wage may need to be delayed because of uncertain growth in the economy, small businesses have said.  The wage is currently scheduled to rise to £8.75 an hour by 2020. But the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said that target may have to be reconsidered, following a string of poor economic data. The FSB said real incomes, productivity and GDP growth were all falling, with only employment levels improving. As a result, it said the National Living Wage (NLW) should rise from £7.50 an hour to no more than £7.85 next year. ""It's vital that the NLW is set at a level that the economy can afford, without job losses or harming job creation,"" said Mike Cherry, the FSB's national chairman.  ""Cost pressures on small businesses are building, and with most recent economic indicators underperforming, we are now facing the reality that the NLW target may need to be delayed beyond 2020."" The Low Pay Commission is due to make its recommendations to the government on the National Living Wage in the Autumn. It has to work out whether higher pay rates are affordable, or whether they could damage the jobs market. The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, will announce the final decision in this year's Autumn Budget. The FSB's latest research suggests that most small businesses are already paying their staff more than the National Living Wage, but that 43% of firms have had to increase pay rates. Most small businesses are making lower profits as a result, but 39% have increased their prices to make the pay rises affordable. The National Living Wage applies only to employees over the age of 25. Workers younger than that are paid the National Minimum Wage."
economic indicators,Confusion over Venezuela's economic plan,2024-09-15,2018-08-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-45245479,"A government plan to curb hyperinflation is coming into force in Venezuela amid confusion about how it will work. From Monday, new banknotes denominated in ""sovereign bolivars"" are legal tender, with five zeros taken off. The measures come after the International Monetary Fund predicted that inflation could reach one million per cent this year. Economists have warned that the new measures could make things worse. The move is effectively a redenomination. President Nicolás Maduro is lopping five zeros off the current currency, the ""strong bolívar"", and giving it its new name. Eight new banknotes and two new coins will also be launched. The new notes will have a value of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 sovereign bolivars.  Most old bolivar notes will continue to circulate ""for a time"", Venezuelan Central Bank President Calixto Ortega announced. Only the lowest current notes, worth less than 1,000 strong bolivars, will be phased out straight away, Venezuela has been suffering from hyperinflation. According to a recent study by the opposition-controlled National Assembly, prices have been doubling every 26 days on average. Some economists have been using the price of a cup of coffee with milk as an indicator of inflation. On 31 July cafes in the capital, Caracas, charged 2.5m strong bolivars for a cup, about double the amount recorded five weeks earlier. Under the new system, the drink will now cost 25 sovereign bolivars.  For a time, it should make cash transactions easier. Someone wanting to pay for their cup of coffee in cash until now had to carry huge wads of banknotes.  The biggest denomination in the old currency was the 100,000 strong bolivar note. So the minimum amount of notes you could pay your coffee with would have been 25.  High denomination banknotes were very sought after and banks imposed strict restrictions on how much cash each customer could take out of their account per day.  So Venezuelans would find themselves paying either with rucksacks full of lower denomination bills or increasingly avoiding paying by cash altogether and transferring money electronically. As the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson found, even tips were being paid via bank transfer.  The government hopes that its new economic plan will not only curb the country's hyperinflation but also put an end to the ""economic war"" which it says has been waged against it by ""imperialist forces"". It says the introduction of the new currency is accompanied by key measures which will help Venezuela's battered economy recover. Among them are: President Maduro tweeted [in Spanish] that his government would ""dismantle neoliberal capitalism's perverse war to install a virtuous, balanced, sustainable, healthy and productive economic system"". But economists have been warning that the new measures do not address the root causes of inflation in Venezuela and that the printing of new notes could exacerbate inflation rather than curb it.  They say the rise in the minimum wage will only drive inflation up faster. Some analysts estimate that the benefits of the new currency could be wiped out by hyperinflation ""within months"". Even though Monday is the date on which the new notes were due to be introduced, President Maduro declared it a bank holiday. Not only will banks remain closed, financial institutions have also been told to suspend all electronic transactions for 24 hours starting at 18:00 local time on Sunday. The new notes will therefore not start circulating until Tuesday and with long queues forming at banks even on average days many Venezuelans fear the sudden introduction of the new currency could lead to chaos.  Ahead of the changes, many Venezuelans stocked up on whatever staple goods they could get hold of amid longstanding shortages.  Economic experts have also questioned the wisdom of anchoring the new currency to the petro.  Even though the government says the virtual currency has been a huge success, details of how it operates have been hard to come by.  The US has banned its citizens from trading in it and one cryptocurrency site, ICOindex.com, has even labelled the petro ""a scam"".  ""Anchoring the bolivar to the petro is anchoring it to nothing,"" economist Luis Vicente León told AFP news agency. "
economic indicators,NI sees fastest economic output rise since 2014,2024-09-15,2021-06-14,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-57446809,"Lockdown easing in May caused economic output in Northern Ireland to rise at its fastest rate since 2014, according to an Ulster Bank survey.  However, inflationary pressures are also at a record high.  Every month the bank asks firms across the private sector about things such as staffing levels, exports and new orders. The survey is considered a reliable indicator of economic performance across the region. Services, which is the largest sector in the Northern Ireland economy, reported growth for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic hit.  In May, growth was reported across all four sectors - manufacturing, retail, services and construction - for the first time since January 2019.  Inflationary pressures were also rising at a record rate with firms in Northern Ireland continuing to deal with a rise in their input costs.  That means manufacturers, retailers and construction firms raised their prices last month at the fastest pace in the survey's 19-year history.  ""Across the UK, Northern Ireland firms continue to experience the most severe rates of inflation with firms invariably linking the increased costs and lengthening delivery times to Brexit paperwork,"" said Ulster Bank Chief Economist Richard Ramsey. While optimistic about growth in the next month or two, Mr Ramsey said significant challenges remain.  He said: ""Global supply chain disruption and inflationary pressures, though expected to be transitory, will act as a headwind to the rapid recovery.""  ""Meanwhile as we saw last week, the continuing saga that is Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol, will be a source of political and economic turbulence for the foreseeable future,"" he added. "
economic indicators,Pressure builds over lockdown transparency,2024-09-15,2020-04-23,By Laura Kuenssberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-52404692,"It's not when, but how.  The UK government has already given five criteria that will have to be met before any of the restrictions on our lives can be eased off.  Bluntly, it's when the disease is spreading at a slow enough rate to be as sure as possible that it won't come roaring back in a second spike, threatening many more thousands of people.  Ministers are confident that they have strong public support for the regime that is in place at the moment, and the polling certainly suggests they are correct. The tests ministers are happy to talk about will decide when the restrictions might start to be eased.  But it is getting harder for the UK government to keep putting off any discussion of how the lockdown might be removed, even step by step, inch by inch.  That's not just because the opposition is pushing for an exit strategy to be published, a small but vocal group of Conservative MPs are asking for firmer indications, and businesses want to be able to plan while the economy is largely suspended.  It's also because on Thursday Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon started what she called a ""public conversation"" about what the route out of lockdown might look like, published in black and white in a document. For good measure, she suggested this was important in order to treat the public like ""grown-ups,"" and that it was ""incumbent"" on governments to consult the public on the ""horrendous decisions"" leaders have to make. As we have discussed here before, the tweaks to limits that could emerge in the coming weeks might see more businesses opening, as long as workers and customers can keep their distance - for example, B&Q has opened some stores this week.  Children might be able to back to school again, but in a limited way, at different times, or with changes to buildings.  There is the possibility too of different parts of the country emerging from lockdown at varying rates, even though the four administrations have been co-operating closely and are sharing the same government data and science.  The chief scientific adviser for the whole UK, Sir Patrick Vallance, said there could be a two- or three-week gap between the peak in London and other parts of the country.  As ever, some decisions that affect the public are taken at a UK-wide level - and some in Belfast, Edinburgh and Cardiff - but the devolved administrations have power over many of the vital choices here. There isn't much that Nicola Sturgeon set out today that you don't hear said in private between ministers and government officials.  And crucially, she did not give any dates. But there is a marked difference in the approaches taken in Edinburgh and London when it comes to the conversation politicians are having with the public. UK ministers are understandably concerned about sending mixed messages that could be dangerous, or giving false hope, and the data on which decisions will be taken is evolving day by day.  But with economic and political pressure building, don't be too surprised if hints of steps that could be taken emerge before too long.  P.S. Whatever route we take out of lockdown in any part of the UK relies on a much expanded programme of testing, to emerge before too long.  The government had shied away from focusing on these kinds of widespread testing regimes, with slowing the spread and testing and treating those with the illness the immediate priority.  But on Thursday night Health Secretary Matt Hancock promised that a much bigger testing and tracing programme is on the way - acknowledged for some time as part of the exit strategy, but with the rate of testing under pressure too."
economic indicators,UK economy ‘stalls’ over Brexit fears,2024-09-15,2019-02-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47127927,"The UK's service sector stagnated last month, with new orders falling for the first time in two-and-a-half years, according to the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI). The figures showed a reading of 50.1 in January, lower than December's 51.2. IHS Markit's Chris Williamson said the results indicated that the UK economy ""is at risk of stalling or worse"". He said this was because of growing Brexit uncertainty coinciding with a wider slowdown in the global economy. Economists had expected a reading of 51 - a figure above 50 indicates growth. It follows last Friday's news that the PMI figures for manufacturing fell to 52.8 last month - the second weakest reading since July 2016. The figures revealed that UK manufacturers were preparing for Brexit by stockpiling raw materials at a record pace and that there was a risk of the sector slipping into recession. Speaking about the service sector figures, Mr Williamson said: ""Growth ground almost to a halt in January, matching similar disappointing news in the manufacturing and construction sectors. ""The last three months have seen the economy slip into its weakest growth spell for six years and indicate that GDP likely stagnated at the start of 2019 after eking out modest growth of just 0.1% in the fourth quarter. ""The survey results indicate that companies are becoming increasingly risk averse and eager to reduce overheads in the face of weakened customer demand and rising political uncertainty.  ""Such worries were in turn most commonly linked to heightened Brexit anxiety, though wider global political and economic factors were also seen to have been taking their toll on demand."" Andy Verity, economics correspondent Until very recently, what's been most remarkable is not how much of an economic impact all the Brexit-related uncertainty has had, but how little. Growth has continued. The number employed keeps hitting new records. The services sector which makes up four-fifths of our economy has continued to expand.  But, crucially, those upbeat figures on jobs and growth are lagging indicators, about two months behind reality. The purchasing managers' index is more up to date, surveying the people in firms taking financial decisions.  According to them the most forward-looking indicators - such as new orders from customers - are down.  However - before we assume the politics of Brexit is stalling the economy, it's worth noting something. Back in July 2016, right after the referendum, respondents to the survey were even gloomier than they are now.  Some economists predicted capital flight; others predicted recession. Those fears, so far at least, have proved largely misplaced.  Mr Williamson's views on uncertainty over the impact of Brexit were backed up by other experts. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Services firms could not be clearer in blaming Brexit uncertainty for the stagnation of activity in January."" He added that the figures suggested that activity could fall over the coming months, but said that similar forecasts in 1998, 2001 and 2003 ""failed to materialise"". And Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said: ""Brexit uncertainty continues to be at the heart of the malaise, as clients delayed orders and consumers were deeply reluctant to spend under the continuing cloud of hesitation, indecision and ambiguity."""
economic indicators,Recession fears prompt selling in global stocks,2024-09-15,2019-08-14,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49352760,"Global stock markets fell around the world as concerns about the US-China trade war and the global economy prompted investors to dump shares. The three main US stock markets closed 3% lower overnight, European stocks fell across the board, while Asian stock markets opened lower. Weak data from Germany and China on Wednesday helped fuel a rush for safe assets like bonds and gold. Bond market moves pointed to possible recessions in major economies. The US central bank also came under renewed pressure from US President Donald Trump for not doing enough to support the world's largest economy.  There are concerns that renewed attacks by Mr Trump on the Federal Reserve could erode investor confidence on its ability to make independent decisions. Analyst Oliver Pursche, from financial services company Bruderman, said the global picture was precarious. ""What's happening in Hong Kong, what's happening with Brexit and the trade war, it's all a mess,"" the chief market strategist said. ""Every central bank around the world is trying to prop up economies and every politician around the world is trying to destroy economies."" News that Germany's GDP contracted in the second quarter, and that China's industrial growth in July hit a 17-year low, had already spooked markets in Europe. The FTSE 100 closed more than 1% lower, while in Germany and France the markets finished more than 2% lower. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped some 2% in early trading on Thursday, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index opened 1.4% lower. Both later regained some ground. Disruptions related to pro-democracy protests have also weighed on the stock market in Hong Kong.  Another worry was that bond markets are flashing recession warnings.  The yield on two-year and 10-year Treasury bonds inverted for the first time since June 2007.  This means investor appetite for safety is such that they are willing to get lower returns for holding bonds for a longer period. Usually investors demand higher returns for holding bonds for longer due to the risks involved with parking your money away for a long time. Historically, such bond movements have been a reliable indicator of possible recessions, and preceded the last global downturn more than 10 years ago. The UK bond yield curve also inverted for the first time since 2008, while the yield gap between 10-year and 2-year German government bonds was at its tightest since the financial crisis. Meanwhile, the CBOE volatility index - the so-called fear index - jumped higher, and spot gold prices rose. On Wednesday, Mr Trump again attempted to deflect the market turmoil onto the US Federal Reserve and its interest rate policy, calling Fed chief Jerome Powell ""clueless"". In raising interest rates four times last year ""the Federal Reserve acted far too quickly, and now is very, very late"" in cutting borrowing costs, the president tweeted. ""Too bad, so much to gain on the upside!"" Recent presidents have avoided commenting on Fed policy, in a sign of respect for the bank's independence. Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent The recession signal from the bond market will only heap pressure on the Federal Reserve to give the president what he wants - more rate cuts. Wall Street certainly thinks it's inevitable, pricing in a cut in September. Last month, America's central bank reduced its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2008. That failed to impress Donald Trump who berated Fed Chair Jay Powell for not cutting rates quickly enough. And as the havoc on the financial markets was unfolding, President Trump was back on twitter defending his administration's tariff war with China and attacking the Fed, calling the chairman clueless.  But if Mr Trump gets what he wants, it may come at a steep price.  The Fed's recent rate cut didn't buoy the markets like it used to. So it's not clear that more rate cuts will blunt the damage from his ongoing trade war with China which is creating uncertainty and raising costs for businesses and consumers. Earlier on Wednesday, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox Business Network the central bank should cut rates by half a percentage point ""as soon as possible"", an action he claimed would lead to stock markets soaring. Despite the US delaying the 1 September imposition of tariffs on some Chinese imports into the US, it has done little to ease concerns.  ""The challenge is that Trump's trade policy has proven so erratic that you cannot relieve the sense of uncertainty,"" said Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon.  As of September last year, the US central bank had a relatively rosy outlook for the economy, expecting that the stimulus from the Trump administration's massive $1.5tn tax cut package and spending in 2018 would sustain growth and justify steadily higher interest rates. Mr Trump wants to make the economy a central part of his case for his 2020 re-election campaign. In an interview scheduled to air on Fox Business Network on Friday, former Fed chief Janet Yellen said she felt the US economy remained ""strong enough"" to avoid a downturn, but ""the odds have clearly risen and they are higher than I'm frankly comfortable with""."
economic indicators,The ill economic winds of coronavirus,2024-09-15,2020-04-06,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-52180789,"The economic crisis has moved from the stress indicators of global stock markets, which can often seem unreal and irrational, to the real world. Market indices have stopped falling so fast (""too late to sell, too early to buy"" was one investor's observation) and we are now beginning to get a sense of the scale of job losses. The tourist industry was hit very hard with the denial of two big earners as far away as August in the Edinburgh festivals (cancelled) and the COP26 environment conference in Glasgow in November (postponed). That underlined the heightened level of exposure for hospitality and tourism, and was a signal of how long this is going to affect the economy.  The prospect, of spectator sport potentially not returning until 2021, adds to that sense that it won't be over by Easter, or summer, or long after that. The most startling numbers were from the USA. One way of measuring unemployment in the States is by the number of people who register each week. In Britain, we don't have data that responds that fast. The US figure the week before last was up by 3.3m, more than four times the previous one-week record. This week, that was up to 6.6m. The closest indicator in the UK is the number of people registering for Universal Credit, up nearly a million in only nine days. A lot of worklessness - that is, having nothing to do - is mitigated by the UK government pouring money into job retention schemes, both for the employed and the self-employed.   That may be a much bigger number than the government thought it would be. A lot of employers are turning to that as a means to keep people on their books, and to handle the sudden drying up of cash flow. Can we be sure those put on furlough will return to work? Not if employers are seeing it as a stepping stone to redundancy.  A downturn like this is an opportunity for companies to shake out inefficiencies. The jobs market has been very tight, putting workers in a strong position. But it's suddenly switched to giving bosses more leverage to cut their payroll costs. Football clubs show that happening. Putting workers on furlough for three months does not guarantee they'll be taking all those people back.  Trade unions are alert to the risk that this furlough could lead to redundancy, so they're pushing for furlough deals that will not lead to redundancy, such as the one announced for more than 30,000 employees of British Airways. One forecaster, the Bank of America, has estimated a drop in UK output of 7.4%, with most of that lost ground being made up next year.  But recovery, it said, depends on the UK Government and the Bank of England taking ever more unconventional measures.  That looks like a hint of much more money-printing (in reality, the buying of bonds using money created by the central bank, as only it can).  And to spark spending, it could push interest rates into negative territory, meaning we would have to pay the banks to look after our savings. A huge amount of government money has been committed to business grants, business rates holidays, loans and loan guarantees. That's borrowed money, of course, with the Debt Management Office saying that it's about to auction £45bn of bonds. The scale of the commitment is staggering. But for companies, borrowing money to get through this, however cheap that debt is, does not look that attractive to many in business, and less so when their banks add tough conditions when the government lending is put out into the market.  The government will back 80% of a loan with its guarantee, and banks have been looking to protect their position with demands of personal guarantees - on company directors' homes, for instance. One of the interesting things to watch in recent days is the way the banks have been prodded, pushed and then forced into relaxing the discipline they usually require of their customers. The financial regulator also stepped in to tell banks to ease up on individual customers, reducing the cost of overdrafts. Holidays are being required on loan repayments and credit card bills, without harming credit ratings. What banks fear is their loan books going badly sour.  Any shock or shakeout in the economy is going to push the weaker companies over the edge.  So we began to see the collapse of some that were already a bit shaky, for various reasons - Brighthouse, the rent-to-ownership retailer was one. Carluccio's restaurant chain was already closing outlets, including two in Scotland.  Debenhams was already working through a programme of closing 50 stores. On Friday, it set about protecting itself against creditors who are not being paid for supply of stock. Others will inevitably follow. The money being thrown at this crisis is intended to ensure it doesn't spread to those in fundamentally good financial health, with the potential to return to business as the economic lockdown is relaxed."
economic indicators,Some NI businesses 'not seen any recovery',2024-09-15,2020-10-06,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-54436275,"The NI economy showed some initial signs of recovery in the third quarter of this year but some businesses have not seen any signs of improvement. That is according to a survey by NI Chamber of Commerce and consultancy BDO.   There were 250 businesses in NI that took part in the survey; collectively they employ about 20,000 people. Some improvement was inevitable after the fastest and deepest decline ever was recorded in the second quarter. Despite unprecedented levels of government support through the job retention scheme, half of members told the survey they have already or planned to shed jobs. Around half of businesses said domestic sales and cash flow were getting worse. About 13% have seen no sign of improvement or are at risk of closure. Chief executive of NI Chamber Ann McGregor said: ""Previous survey findings told us that Northern Ireland's economy entered the Covid-19 crisis in an already fragile state. ""Today's report confirms that while many indicators have improved when compared to Q2 they remain negative, which tells us that business conditions among many local businesses continue to worsen. ""Some businesses have performed well/reasonably during the pandemic (37%) but the majority have been negatively impacted (62%) with many seeing little to no signs of improvement in trading conditions (43%). ""This emphasises the need for continued targeted intervention by government to support the many great businesses in Northern Ireland to survive this unnatural crisis in our economy.  Every quarter the survey asks members how they are feeling about Brexit. The survey says members concerns around Northern Ireland's future trading relationship with Great Britain.  The government has set up a Trader Support Service to help businesses in Northern Ireland prepare for the end of the transition period. But this survey suggested only one in three firms have heard of it and only 12% of members who took part  Almost three quarter (73%) said they were concerned about a no-deal Brexit at the end of the transition this year. Many businesses in the survey said the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted Brexit planning. Ann McGregor said: ""Our members are expressing growing concern about the looming prospect of a no-deal Brexit, which would be detrimental for businesses already dealing with the fall out of the deepest economic recession on record. ""It is clear that there is an urgent need to dramatically improve understanding of future trading arrangements with rest of the UK and increase awareness and uptake of the Trader Support Service. ""Any business in Northern Ireland which currently moves goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, or brings goods into Northern Ireland from outside the UK should sign-up for the TSS service without delay."""
economic indicators,Covid cases 'hit half of Scots engineering firms',2024-09-15,2020-11-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-55015555,"More than half of Scottish engineering firms have reported positive Covid-19 tests among their workforces in the final quarter of the year. A survey of about 140 companies by industry body Scottish Engineering found 56% ""experienced and managed the impact"" of a positive test. More than 40% said productivity was affected by ""Covid isolation absence"". Despite this, there was ""significant"" improvement in orders, output and exports on the previous quarter. That said, most indicators remained in negative territory. Confidence overall among companies improved significantly from a net balance of -40% to -9%. There was also an improvement in staffing, with the percentage of companies planning further redundancies falling from 60% in the previous quarter to 21%. Scottish Engineering said the latest review provided ""some optimism"" for 2021, with measures to manage Covid - including a rolling vaccination programme - expected to arrive as early as the spring. However, it added there was still concern that the hardest hit sectors, such as aerospace and oil and gas, would see slower recovery in the face of weaker demand. Uncertainty around Brexit was also cited as a concern. Scottish Engineering chief executive Paul Sheerin said the survey highlighted ""positive aspects"" but caution remained, particularly ""for those areas where recovery looks further away"". He added: ""The winter economic support package from the UK government is genuinely welcomed, but come spring we need to ask whether we want to retain the strength we have in these sectors, and act to provide sector specific support to enable their survival.  ""Other countries are doing so already, so if we want to retain our current capability, a preservation plan is needed, clear and visible long before the current support ends."""
economic indicators,Travelling is a rite of passage for many Malians,2024-09-15,2018-05-28,By Alex Duval Smith,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44279504,"Mamoudou Gassama's four-storey dash to save a small boy in France is a reminder of another Malian hero who gained international prominence for a brave rescue. In January 2015, Lassana Bathily was credited with saving the lives of six hostages including a baby during an extremist attack on a Jewish supermarket in Paris. He led them to a safe hiding place, escaped, then directed gendarmes to them. Two weeks later - after six years of struggling to secure legal residency in France - Mr Bathily was given a medal and a French passport by then President François Hollande. In 2016, he wrote a book ''Je ne suis pas un heros'' (I am no hero) and created a charity whose first project was to provide irrigation for his home village in western Mali. Like Mr Bathily's selfless leadership to save the hostages, Mr Gassama's heroic climb to save the boy cements the image of Mali as a country with a culture of old-fashioned public spiritedness. Following Mr Gassama's meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mali's ambassador in France, Toumani Djimé Diallo, said: ''The courage of our young compatriot aged 22, an undocumented migrant, shows that his values are of humanity and love for his neighbour.  ""These are fundamental values in Malian society and are Republican values shared by France.'' Mr Gassama, who is understood to have been in France for only six months, is among thousands of Malians still making the journey to Europe, despite much-publicised measures to limit immigration to the continent. This is not only because of the failure, so far, of European Union attempts to stop people from crossing the Sahara and Mediterranean.  It is also because many of those of who leave Mali - including Mr Gassama, as his surname indicates - are from the Soninke ethnic group. For Soninko (the plural of Soninke), travelling has for centuries been an obligatory rite of passage to manhood. So well established is the Malian travelling tradition - and so strong are the emigrants' links with home - that when Mali's population is stated to be 12 million, the figure includes a diaspora estimated at about three million people. The Ministry for Overseas Malians says that remittances from the diaspora - estimated at more than $3bn (£2.25bn) per year - easily provide a third of the country's GDP.  But it is important to keep perspective on African emigration. Most sub-Saharan Africans who travel to seek work do so within the African continent - and because of Mali's strong emigration tradition, its statistics are a useful indicator of the broader picture. Data collected by the ministry shows that of 89,134 Malians repatriated by force or voluntarily between 2002 and 2013, more than 90% (81,755) were sent back by other African countries - in particular, Ivory Coast, Libya, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia.  As a matter of comparison, in the same period, European countries expelled 5,947 Malians. More recently, there have been large-scale expulsions of Malians from the Central African Republic, Angola and Gabon.  Many African countries have well-established Malian - chiefly Soninke - communities which are engaged in trade.  As a consequence, a Malian who travels - be it to Nouakchott or New York - has friends and solidarity wherever he or she goes. For the Malians who do travel to Europe there are two options. Those who have a relative in the EU - most often in France or Spain - might seek an invitation and a tourist visa, secured legally but on which they might decide to overstay. For them, the preferred means of travel is by air. For the past 30 years, migrants from sub-Saharan Africa without passports or visas have used four main routes to cross by boat to Europe.  The busiest, until 2012, was to the Canary Islands which belong to Spain. But this exit point was blocked after Spain's Gardia Civil, or law enforcement agency, was stationed in Mauritania. They are still there. Ceuta and Melilla are two Spanish enclaves on the northern Mediterranean shore of Morocco. In recent years, there have been occasional, spectacular storming by migrants of the fences around the enclaves. Moroccan co-operation with the EU has largely closed this route. Malta and southern Italy (Lampedusa) are reached by boat from Algeria and Tunisia.  But this route is less in favour at the moment as it requires travelling through Algeria - which has sent back 27,000 migrants since 2015 and is regularly criticised by human rights groups for treating them in a degrading way.  Also, Algeria is reached after a six-day truck journey through the desert of northern Mali, where landmines and other explosive devices are a threat. The favoured route across the desert has moved eastwards. As a result of anti-migration moves by the EU in Mauritania and Morocco, the insecurity in northern Mali and the instability in Libya, the favoured exit point from the south into the desert is now Niger.  This is where the EU is currently concentrating its efforts to reduce emigration.  About 7,000 African travellers were made to turn back in Niger last year, up from 1,400 in 2014. More than 2,000 returns in the first three months of 2018 suggest another record year. European policymakers argue that the best way to reduce immigration pressure from Africa is for rich countries to help create economic opportunities in countries like Mali for the continent's young population. This is partly true. But Soninke men - like the 22-year-old Mr Gassama - will continue to travel.  It has been like that ever since the Ouagadou Empire, which was built on the wealth from gold and salt exports, was crushed by Soundiata Keita's Mali Empire 700 years ago. When things got tough for the Soninkes, fathers began to encourage their sons to travel away in the lean season, instructing them to return only once they had enough money to get married and establish a family. So the EU will not find it easy to reverse a tradition that dates back to the year 1240 or thereabouts. Knowing that Soninkes will always be on the move, the best option would be for other, emerging African countries - perhaps with the help of European investment - to speed up their development and accommodate energetic and fearless Malians like Mr Gassama.

economic indicators,Humans 'threaten 1m species with extinction',2024-09-15,2019-05-06,By Matt McGrath,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48169783,"On land, in the seas, in the sky, the devastating impact of humans on nature is laid bare in a compelling UN report.  One million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction. Nature everywhere is declining at a speed never previously seen and our need for ever more food and energy are the main drivers. These trends can be halted, the study says, but it will take ""transformative change"" in every aspect of how humans interact with nature. From the bees that pollinate our crops, to the forests that hold back flood waters, the report reveals how humans are ravaging the very ecosystems that support their societies. Three years in the making, this global assessment of nature draws on 15,000 reference materials, and has been compiled by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). It runs to 1,800 pages.  The brief, 40-page ""summary for policymakers"", published today at a meeting in Paris, is perhaps the most powerful indictment of how humans have treated their only home. It says that while the Earth has always suffered from the actions of humans through history, over the past 50 years, these scratches have become deep scars. The world's population has doubled since 1970, the global economy has grown four-fold, while international trade has increased 10 times over.  To feed, clothe and give energy to this burgeoning world, forests have been cleared at astonishing rates, especially in tropical areas.  Between 1980 and 2000, 100 million hectares of tropical forest were lost, mainly from cattle ranching in South America and palm oil plantations in South East Asia.  Faring worse than forests are wetlands, with only 13% of those present in 1700 still in existence in the year 2000.  Our cities have expanded rapidly, with urban areas doubling since 1992.  All this human activity is killing species in greater numbers than ever before.  According to the global assessment, an average of around 25% of animals and plants are now threatened.  Global trends in insect populations are not known but rapid declines in some locations have also been well documented.  All this suggests around a million species now face extinction within decades, a rate of destruction tens to hundreds of times higher than the average over the past 10 million years.  ""We have documented a really unprecedented decline in biodiversity and nature, this is completely different than anything we've seen in human history in terms of the rate of decline and the scale of the threat,"" said Dr Kate Brauman, from the University of Minnesota and a co-ordinating lead author of the assessment.  ""When we laid it all out together I was just shocked to see how extreme the declines are in terms of species and in terms of the contributions that nature is providing to people."" The assessment also finds that soils are being degraded as never before. This has reduced the productivity of 23% of the land surface of the Earth.  Our insatiable appetites are producing a mountain of waste.  Plastic pollution has increased ten-fold since 1980.  Every year we dump 300-400 million tonnes of heavy metals, solvents, toxic sludge and other wastes into the waters of the world.  The report's authors say there are a number of direct drivers of which land use change is the primary one.  This essentially means the replacement of grassland with intensive crops, or replacing ancient woodland with a plantation forest, or the clearing of forests to grow crops. This is happening in many parts of the world, especially in the tropics.  Since 1980, more than half of the increase in agriculture has been at the expense of intact forests.  It's a similar story at sea. Only 3% of the world's oceans were described as free from human pressure in 2014.  Fish are being exploited as never before, with 33% of fish stocks harvested at unsustainable levels in 2015. Live coral cover on reefs has nearly halved over the past 150 years.  Pushing all this forward, though, are increased demands for food from a growing global population and specifically our growing appetite for meat and fish. ""Land use now appears as the major driver of the biodiversity collapse, with 70% of agriculture related to meat production,"" said Yann Laurans from IDDRI, the French policy research institute. ""It is time to reconsider the share of industrial meat and dairy in our diet."" The other key factors are the hunting and the direct exploitation of animals, climate change, pollution and invasive species.  The report finds that many of these factors work together to make matters worse. At the report's launch, Kai Chan, a co-ordinating lead author from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, said: ""No previous assessment has considered at this scale the simultaneous challenge of protecting nature, maintaining water, feeding the planet, supplying energy, while mitigating climate change... this is the most exhaustive report to have ever done that."" Species extinction risk: Approximately 25% of species are already threatened with extinction in most animal and plant groups studied. Natural ecosystems: Natural ecosystems have declined by 47% on average, relative to their earliest estimated states. Biomass and species abundance: The global biomass of wild mammals has fallen by 82%. Indicators of vertebrate abundance have declined rapidly since 1970. Nature for indigenous people: 72% of indicators developed by local communities show ongoing deterioration of elements of nature important to them. It all depends on what we do. The authors looked at a number of scenarios for the future, including business-as-usual, but also examining options that were more based on sustainable practices.  In almost all cases, the negative trends for nature will continue to 2050 and beyond.  The only ones that didn't continue towards ecological disaster involved what the scientists term ""transformative change"". The study doesn't tell governments what to do, but gives them some pretty strong hints.  One big idea is to steer the world away from the ""limited paradigm of economic growth"".  They suggest moving away from GDP as a key measure of economic wealth and instead adopting more holistic approaches that would capture quality of life and long-term effects.  They argue that our traditional notion of a ""good quality of life"" has involved increasing consumption on every level. This has to change. Similarly, there must be change when it comes to financial incentives that damage biodiversity.  ""Crucially, governments must end the destructive subsidies, including for fossil fuels and industrial fishing and agriculture,"" said Andrew Norton, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development.  ""These drive the plundering of the land and ocean at the expense of a clean, healthy and diverse environment on which billions of women, children and men depend now and in the future."" The amount of land and sea that is under protection needs to increase rapidly, with observers saying that a third of our lands need to be preserved.  ""We need to secure half of the planet by 2050 with an interim target of 30% by 2030,"" said Jonathan Baillie, from the National Geographic Society.  ""Then we must restore nature and drive innovation. Only then will we leave future generations a healthy and sustainable planet."" Climate change is a crucial underlying factor that's helping to drive destruction around the world.  Greenhouse gas emissions have doubled since 1980 and temperatures have gone up 0.7C as a result. This is having a big impact on some species, restricting their ranges and making extinction more likely. The global assessment finds that if temperatures go up by 2C, then 5% of species are at risk of climate-driven extinction, rising to 16% if the world warms by 4.3C. ""Of the prioritised list of proximate drivers of biodiversity decline, climate change is only number three,"" said Prof John Spicer from the University of Plymouth. ""Climate change is certainly one of the greatest threats that face humankind in the near future - so what does that tell us about the first and second, changes in land/sea use, and direct exploitation? The current situation is desperate and has been for some time."" The report's authors hope that their assessment becomes as critical to the argument about biodiversity loss as the IPCC report on 1.5C has done to the debate over climate change.  The idea of transformative action is not just confined to governments or local authorities. Individuals can certainly make a difference. ""We know that the way people eat today is often unhealthy for them and for the planet,"" said Dr Kate Brauman, one of the report's authors.  ""We can become healthier as individuals by eating more diverse diets, with more vegetables, and we can also make the planet healthier by growing that food in more sustainable ways."" As well as consumer and lifestyle choices, other authors believe people can make a difference through politics.  ""It might be more important for society to invest more in renewables than coal,"" said Dr Rinku Roy Chowdhury, from Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. ""So how do you that? Through individual behaviour, through the polling booth. ""Rather than just conserving energy by turning my lights off, some other less obvious means might be through political action.""

economic indicators,"Slow growth, but no recession, expected",2024-09-15,2018-10-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45734245,"The Northern Ireland economy will grow slowly over the next three years but narrowly avoid a recession, Ulster University economists have forecast. The forecast scenario is based on a ""trade friendly"" deal being reached between the UK and the EU. It predicts growth of 0.4% next year, slowing to 0.2% in 2020 and recovering to 0.4% again in 2021. Growth is then predicted to pick up in the longer term as the global economy moves into a stronger growth phase. The forecast from the university's economic policy centre said local economic indicators are showing a very mixed picture. Unemployment is at historic lows, however economic inactivity remains relatively high and productivity growth has stalled. Based on the scenario that a Brexit deal is agreed, the centre forecasts that the Northern Ireland economy will add a total of almost 21,000 jobs in the period between 2017 and 2027. A more optimistic scenario, where Northern Ireland gets close to the UK employment rate, could see 58,500 additional jobs by 2027. A worst case scenario, caused by Brexit impacting on trade and consumer spending, could see the number of jobs shrinking by almost 11,000 in that ten year period. The centre describes those best and worse case scenarios as ""low probability events"". It adds that the UK economy as a whole is facing a ""testing period"" due to a difficult international environment and national structural challenges."
economic indicators,US to enlist military allies in Gulf waters,2024-09-15,2019-07-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48932015,"The US says it wants to create an multinational military coalition to safeguard waters around Iran and Yemen.  Gen Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he wanted to ""ensure freedom of navigation"" in the region, which provides essential trade routes.  The US has blamed Iran for attacks on six oil tankers in May and June.  Gen Dunford said the US was talking to a number of countries with the ""political will"" to support the plans.  The US would provide ""command and control"" ships, leading surveillance efforts, he said. However, the aim would be for other countries to offer boats to establish patrols nearby, and escort commercial ships carrying their flags through the area. Gen Dunford said the US would ""work directly with the militaries to identify the specific capabilities"" each country has to support the initiative.  The straits of Hormuz and Bab al-Mandab are strategically important locations, providing access from the Indian Ocean to the Gulf and the Red Sea respectively.  About a fifth of oil that is consumed globally passes through the Strait of Hormuz, which connects the Indian Ocean with the Gulf, while oil tankers heading from the the Middle East to Europe via the Red Sea pass must through Bab al-Mandab. Gen Dunford said the size of the initiative depended on the number of countries which decided to take part.  ""With a small number of contributors, we can have a small mission,"" he said. ""We'll expand that as the number of nations that are willing to participate identify themselves."" The US already has a substantial naval presence in the region and participates in several multinational naval taskforces carrying out maritime security, counter-terrorism, anti-piracy operations.  The headquarters of the US Navy's 5th Fleet is in Bahrain, and it also has naval facilities in Djibouti and Kuwait. The UK, which also has a naval base in Bahrain, said it was ""continuously monitoring the security situation"" in the region and was ""committed to maintaining freedom of navigation in accordance with international law"". The Royal Navy Frigate HMS Montrose has been positioned to shadow an oil tanker sailing under an Isle of Man flag through the Strait of Hormuz.  Meanwhile, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani accused the UK of being ""the initiator of insecurity at sea"" by seizing an Iranian oil tanker that was heading to Syria off Gibraltar last week. General Dunford's comments raise many questions.  If the threat from Iran - as the Americans insist - is so pressing then why is it that any operation could still be weeks away?  The US seems willing only to provide command and control, along with surveillance. The actual patrolling and escorting of merchant vessels would be done by others. What message of US leadership does this send?  How many other countries are contributing? That's still not clear. General Dunford says the operation is ""scaleable""; its size will depend upon who participates.  And what of its scope? The US sees this as a mission that will not only include the Gulf but also waters off Yemen.  With tensions mounting in the region, many governments will be wary of getting involved but will have to balance this against the practical need to safeguard their vessels. Some may see this as a US effort to construct something that looks like a naval coalition ranged against Tehran.   Last month, the US blamed Iranian forces for attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman, just outside the Strait of Hormuz - an allegation that Iran rejected. It followed an attack on four tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates in May. Days after the June attacks, Iranian forces shot down a US surveillance drone they said had violated Iranian airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. The US insisted the drone was flying over international waters. US President Donald Trump called off strikes planned in response after being told that as many as 150 people might be killed. Iran's military has said it would close the Strait of Hormuz if, as President Trump hopes, it becomes unable to export oil due to the sanctions the US has reinstated since pulling out of a landmark nuclear deal with Iran.  However, speaking to the BBC, Iran's ambassador to the UN remained defiant. ""We have managed under different situations worse than we have today, and I am sure we can manage again,"" Majid Takht-Ravanchi said. In the past two weeks, Iran has breached two commitments on uranium enrichment in response to the sanctions. Mr Takht-Ravanchi warned that Iran was prepared to take further steps if Europe fails to compensate it for the economic losses it has suffered. Iran has also been accused of providing military support to Yemen's rebel Houthi movement, which has attacked vessels in the Red Sea belonging to a Saudi-led coalition backing the Yemeni government. On Monday, the coalition said it had foiled an attack on a commercial ship using an unmanned boat rigged with explosives in the southern Red Sea, and warned of the threat to international trade. The Houthis denied targeting commercial shipping. May 2018: US President Donald Trump withdraws unilaterally from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, and begins reinstating sanctions to force Iran to renegotiate the accord. Iran's economy slumps as they take effect.  2 May 2019: Mr Trump steps up pressure on Tehran by ending exemptions from secondary sanctions for countries still buying Iranian oil. 5 May: The US sends an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the Gulf because of ""troubling and escalatory indications"" related to Iran. 8 May: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says Iran will scale back its commitments under the nuclear deal in retaliation for the sanctions, including by allowing its stockpile of low-enriched uranium to increase. Enriched uranium is used to make reactor fuel and potentially nuclear weapons. 12 May:  Four oil tankers are damaged by explosions off the UAE coast in the Gulf of Oman. The UAE says the blasts were caused by limpet mines planted by a ""state actor"". The US blames Iran, but it denies the allegation. 13 June: Explosions hit two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The US again accuses Iran, releasing footage purportedly showing Iranian forces removing an unexploded limpet mine from a damaged vessel. Iran says the evidence is fabricated. 17 June: Iran says it will breach the limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium set under the nuclear deal on 27 June, unless Europe protects Iranian oil sales.  20 June: Iranian forces shoot down US military drone over the Strait of Hormuz. 4 July: Gibraltar, assisted by British Royal Marines, seizes Iranian oil tanker Grace 1 on suspicion of breaking EU sanctions on trade with Syria"
economic indicators,US economy adds more jobs than expected in June,2024-09-15,2022-07-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62093303,"The US economy created 372,000 jobs in June, according to official figures, with employment growing by far more than forecast. Economists had expected the country to add between 250,000 and 295,000 roles. The unemployment rate also remained close to record lows, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The strong jobs figures are being seen by some analysts as a sign that more US interest rate rises could be on the way. Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors, said: ""Today's job number should soothe fears of an imminent recession, but it does nothing to relieve fears of considerable further Fed tightening. ""The job market remains severely tight, suggesting still-intense wage pressures."" The unemployment rate stayed at 3.6% in June for the fourth month in a row.  Like other countries, the cost of living in the US is soaring due to rising food and energy prices. Inflation hit a 40-year high of 8.6% in the year to April and the US Federal Reserve has been increasing borrowing costs to try to cool the rate of  price growth. Last month, the Fed announced its biggest interest rate rise in nearly 30 years, increasing its key interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. In the first three months of the year the US economy contracted at an annual pace of 1.6%, and Fed chairman Jay Powell recently admitted to lawmakers that a recession is ""a possibility"". Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, said the ""strong jobs report contrasts with other recent economic announcements"". ""The US economy and the stock market have both struggled in the first half of 2022, in the face of risks that include a multi-decade high in inflation, aggressive monetary policy tightening, and the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, "" he said.  ""However, jobs reports are lagging economic indicators that are often strong entering a downturn."""
economic indicators,US condemns reports Russia may seize firms' assets,2024-09-15,2022-03-11,By Annabelle  Liang,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60703359,"The United States has condemned reports that Moscow may seize the assets of businesses which have stopped operating in Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. White House press secretary Jen Psaki warned that such a move will result in ""more economic pain"". Her comments come as the US Congress passed a spending bill which includes almost $14bn (£10.7bn) of emergency aid for Ukraine. President Biden is expected to announce new measures against Russia on Friday.  Russia seizing the assets of foreign companies would be a ""lawless decision,"" Ms Psaki said on Twitter. ""It will compound the clear message to the global business community that Russia is not a safe place to invest and do business,"" she added. In response to a growing number of firms suspending their operations, Moscow has warned that it may nationalise production plants or factories where work has been suspended. The ruling United Russia party proposed the move on Monday, although Andrei Turchak, secretary of its general council, acknowledged it was an ""extreme measure"". ""But we will not tolerate stabs in the back, and we will protect our people. This is a real war, and not against Russia as a whole, but against citizens,"" Mr Turchak said.  On Thursday, the party said President Vladimir Putin was finding ""legal solutions"" to put the plan in place. In light of the reports, global corporations that are cutting business ties or have halted operations in Russia told the BBC that they currently do not intend to change their plans. ""We have had no indications from Russian authorities that they intend to nationalise our assets,"" a spokesperson for Coca-Cola said. BP, which announced that it will offload its stake in Russian state-owned oil firm Rosneft, said its ""position is unchanged"".  ""We have decided to exit our shareholding in Rosneft and our businesses with Rosneft in Russia, and we are pursuing that. There isn't a change or an update on this,"" a spokesperson said. In Washington on Thursday, the US Congress passed a $1.5tn spending bill, which includes almost $14bn in emergency aid for Ukraine. The bill is expected to be signed into law by President Biden before government funding is due to run out on Friday night. Also on Friday, the US, along with the Group of Seven (G7) and the European Union, is expected to move to remove Russia's ""most favoured nation"" trading status over its invasion of Ukraine.  Revoking the preferential trading status would mean that the US and its allies would be able to impose tariffs on Russia, which would further isolate its economy. The G7 is made up of the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada. Pushan Dutt, a professor of economics and political science at the INSEAD business school, believes Russia underestimated the global response to the war. The country has been ""pushed to a corner"", he said, as it underestimated the pushback from Ukrainians, the resulting international sanctions, and the ""will of NATO and the US to carry a full-fledged economic warfare"".  ""I suspect they will go ahead and nationalise these assets, because their economy is under heavy pressure,"" Professor Dutt told the BBC.  ""If all these factories shut down and start laying off workers, then they face internal pressures at home as well. The only way to maintain support internally is to make it an 'us versus them', Russia versus the rest of the world kind of picture,"" he said."
economic indicators,Economic downturn 'may have begun' in NI,2024-09-15,2019-07-08,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-48885176,"Northern Ireland's economy may have begun a downturn, research from Ulster Bank has suggested. The bank conducts a monthly survey of private sector activity in what is considered a reliable indicator of the economy. It indicated there have been four consecutive months of falling output since March. The output decline in June was at the steepest rate since November 2012.  The bank's chief economist Richard Ramsey said a clear trend was emerging. ""After six years of growth, it appears that the economic cycle has turned,"" he said. ""The severity or otherwise of that downturn will depend on a range of factors.  ""The kind of Brexit that we see will of course be a major factor."" Mr Ramsey said data for new orders and exports was a particular concern. ""Both domestic and overseas order books are contracting at a rapid rate, which suggests that activity will be subdued in the coming months. ""Indeed, export orders fell at their fastest pace in almost eight years.  ""The manufacturing sector appears particularly weak at present, with output falling at its fastest pace in June for more than a decade."" This type of survey is known as a Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) and is used widely in developed economies. It uses an index approach where any reading above 50 is growth and below 50 is contraction. The headline business activity figure for Northern Ireland in June was 44.1 down from 46 in May. PMIs are considered a fairly reliable guide to what later official data will show. Northern Ireland was not alone in having experienced deteriorating business conditions in June. Similar surveys for the UK have suggested that the manufacturing and construction sectors contracted in June with output in the dominant services sector flat.  Mr Ramsey said US/China trade disputes had having a dampening effect across global manufacturing. The most recent official output data for Northern Ireland covers the final quarter of 2018. It indicated that the local economy had expanded by 0.2% compared to the previous quarter. The data for the first quarter of 2019 is due to be published next week."
economic indicators,"'We are battered, bruised, but wiser'",2024-09-15,2020-06-30,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53239961,"Businessman Nick Garthwaite sums up trading during the last few months thus: ""We took an absolute pasting. May was the bottom, the pits.""  It's a view that must be felt at the thousands of firms surveyed for the latest British Chamber of Commerce's Quarterly Economic Survey, published on Wednesday.  Eleven of the 14 key indicators for the service sector fell to their lowest level in the survey's 31-year history. In manufacturing, nine of the 14 indicators dropped to the lowest point. Mr Garthwaite is managing director of Bradford-based Christeyns UK, a chemicals business that straddles many of the sectors directly affected by the economic slowdown - hospitality, construction, food, manufacturing.  Greggs and Muller are major customers for Christeyns' food hygiene chemicals arm, and the commercial cleaning operation works with hotels and the NHS. The BCC's survey of 7,700 firms, representing 580,000 employees across the UK, found that economic conditions in the April-June quarter ""deteriorated at an unprecedented rate"".  And that was certainly Mr Garthwaite's experience following the lockdown on 23 March. ""We had to work quickly when it was clear things were slowing. We set up home-working and furloughing. There was no panic, just a pragmatic approach that we had to act quickly."" Christeyns' chemicals facility in Bradford, which supplies the construction sector, was the worst hit. ""This part of the business went off the edge of the cliff,"" he said. The commercial laundry arm also suffered badly. Mr Braithwaite reckons the two operations lost about 70% of trade in May. But another part of the company, which sells cleaning chemicals and sanitisers, did brisk business as demand soared. The business has been running at full capacity, he said. The BCC's survey, the largest independent barometer of UK business sentiment, found that sales, orders and cashflow hit rock bottom for many firms. And business confidence dropped to its lowest level on record among services firms, and fell to its lowest level since early 2009 for manufacturers, the BCC said. Nevertheless, Mr Garthwaite said he is positive now that lockdown is being eased. Most of his 300 staff have been been brought back from furlough, with only those facing underlying health issues staying away. Christenys' factories at Warrington and Whaley Bridge are ""almost back up to full strength"", he said. Trading across the business picked up in June, and he anticipates that July will be ""slightly better"". But Mr Garthwaite added: ""Getting back to 2019 levels of profit figures may not happen until next year, or even the year after. But I do feel we have turned a corner. It's been difficult - but then it's been difficult for millions of people.   ""We are battered, bruised, but wiser after the event,"" he said. Like Mr Garthwaite, Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC, believes the last few weeks are likely to have been the nadir for most businesses. Mr Thiru said: ""With lockdown restrictions steadily easing, the second quarter is likely to prove to be the low point for the UK economy. ""However, the collapse in forward looking indicators of activity suggests that unless action is taken, the prospect of a swift and sustained recovery may prove too optimistic.""  On Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out plans to ""build, build, build"" with promised investments in infrastructure and schools. But the BCC is more focused on Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who is due to make a keynote economic statement later this month. Ahead of this, the BCC called on Wednesday for a series of targeted measures, including: For Mr Garthwaite, the last of these is particularly important. ""I am old enough to have lived through past recessions, and we ended up doing very little for young people. Apprenticeships can be so beneficial for the young. We need to be forward-thinking and create something for them that is fit for purpose."" And he made a special plea for the government to make good on its promise to invest in the north of England. ""We want to see money for the Northern Powerhouse. Just re-organising the deckchairs is not going to be enough."" The sentiments were echoed by Dr Adam Marshall, the BCC's director general, who said the survey results showed that the whole of the UK needed ""swift and substantial action"".  He said: ""The government has one chance to jump-start the economy and business confidence over the coming weeks - and they must take it.   ""The only way to re-kindle business and consumer confidence is to demonstrate an absolute and unshakeable focus on boosting the economy over the coming months."""
economic indicators,China fights a 'war on two fronts',2024-09-15,2018-10-19,By Karishma Vaswani,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45898619,"The world's second largest economy is losing steam and with some big risks on the horizon, that slowdown is likely to continue.  Data released on Friday show China's economy grew at an annual pace of 6.5%.  That's a slight slowdown from the previous quarter when China grew by 6.7% - but this is the lowest reading since the first quarter of 2009 when China's growth tanked in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, growing by just 6.2%.  You should always have some healthy scepticism around China's official growth figures, but they remain a relatively useful indicator of the trajectory of the economy.  These figures are also the first to be released by the Chinese government since US President Donald Trump hit China with two sets of tariffs since July, encompassing $250bn (£192bn) worth of Chinese goods, which will add weight to the current narrative that China's economy is under pressure from the trade war.  But it is worth bearing in mind that China's economy was already slowing down before the trade war between Washington and Beijing kicked into high gear earlier this year. This has been a managed transition - a decision the government said it needed to take to focus on quality of growth, not quantity.  There's no denying, though, that the trade war has changed that narrative. While this set of data doesn't necessarily show that the trade war has hit China just yet, there will almost certainly be more pain to come.  ""There's been no discernible impact on end demand that we've seen yet from our industry contacts,"" Vinesh Motwani of Silk Road Research told me, after a recent trip back from Beijing and Shanghai.  He spends a lot of time on the mainland, talking to medium-sized Chinese owned businesses about their outlook. ""In fact, if anything we're seeing some companies benefit from a short term tailwind as a result of the trade war. That's because American customers were trying to buy as much as they can from China before the tariffs kicked in."" Still, this may just be a blip on the radar because longer term, as Mr Motwani points out, the outlook is grim.  ""Unanimously, what businesses there are worried about is the uncertainty of the trade war. If there was no trade war, Chinese companies would be far more optimistic about 2019."" That grim outlook on the ground is being echoed by economic forecasts too. A number of investment banks, the International Monetary Fund and the Economist Intelligence Unit have all lowered their China growth forecasts to 6.2% in 2019, on the back of the trade war.  All of this comes at a time when China's typical engines of growth - fixed asset investment, consumption and exports - are slowing down.  As one China observer told me during my trip to Beijing last month, the country wasn't expecting to fight a trade war at a time that it was also trying to manage systemic risks in the economy.  And it's not like they have a lot of options on the table. Policymakers are unlikely to pump massive stimulus into the economy the way they did after 2008. Partly that's because of that new focus on the quality of growth, rather than just growth.  The other problem is that China has racked up an extraordinary amount of debt in the economy - by some estimates close to 300% of GDP - and that's the major risk it is trying to manage.  This means that now Beijing is fighting a war on two fronts, without all of the cavalry at its disposal. And it's fighting an increasingly unpredictable and volatile enemy, in the form of an aggressive US administration. None of which bodes well for China's economic growth outlook. "
economic indicators,Why many people don't save for a rainy day,2024-09-15,2018-07-25,By Kamal Ahmed,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44953607,"There are two important statistics I regularly look at to see how people's finances are faring. They point to whether people are feeling financially comfortable, or are finding their lives financially difficult. They are both published by the Office for National Statistics, and are two of the most important economic indicators not just of the overall health of the economy but also the overall health of our finances and how we will pay, for example, for the big challenges ahead. Like paying for our healthcare as we get old, or caring for our parents, or supporting our children. The first statistic reveals whether the 27 million households in Britain are net borrowers or net lenders. That is, are they borrowing money or spending their savings to make ends meet, or are they ""lending"" money to the economy in the form of pension contributions, savings and investments? Between 1987 and 2016, households have been net lenders, even during times of recession when incomes tend to fall and unemployment rises. Since 2016 they have been net borrowers - spending more than they are receiving in income - for 18 months on the trot. It's the first time that has happened since records began. Stagnant incomes, families struggling to make ends meet, very cheap borrowing costs and ease of access to borrowed money - often just a swipe on an app away - have made taking on loans both necessary in some cases and certainly attractive. Whilst savings rates as low 0.05% from some banks - yes, you did read that right - have made ""putting money away"" a proposition with much less apparent upside. The second figure is the savings ratio. That is the proportion of our disposable income (what is left over after taxes) we save. That figure is now at 4.1%, the third lowest since records began in 1963. In the 1990s, it was as high as 14.7%. Put simply, we are losing the savings habit. If there is a rainy day ahead, we are not preparing for it because for many people the rainy day is now. This change in historic saving trends is fundamental and matters because borrowing can put people under financial pressure, particularly if interest rates are rising. The next rate rise could come as early as next week when the Bank of England announces its latest decision. Many economists believe Mark Carney and the Monetary Policy Committee will press the button on an interest rate rise of 0.25%. That will take rates up to 0.75%, still very low by historical standards. But nevertheless, borrowing rates will rise, making those loans and credit cards a bit more expensive. Don't forget, in 2017 a Financial Conduct Authority survey found that many millions of people would find it difficult to pay an unexpected bill of £50 at the end of the month. That shows how stretched many people's household finances are. The increase in interest rates will mean a slight, and welcome, improvement in savings rates for consumers. But it is likely to need a lot more than that to reverse a trend in saving - or lack of it - that has been revealed over the last few years."
economic indicators,China's economic slowdown: How bad is it?,2024-09-15,2019-09-26,By Ana Nicolaci da Costa ,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49791721,"China's economy has been slowing for the better part of the past decade, but a recent run of poor data has prompted fresh concerns. What is making investors nervous, and how China has responded? China became a key engine of world economic growth as developed countries licked their wounds after the 2008 global financial crisis.  Now, the world's second-largest economy is expanding at its slowest pace since the early 1990s. China saw industrial output grow at its slowest pace since 2002 in August.  Weeks later China's Premier Li Keqiang said it would not be easy for the country to sustain growth rates of above 6%.  Domestic issues, the US-led trade war, and swine fever are all putting a brake on China's rapid expansion. ""The slowdown in China is becoming quite significant,"" says Tommy Wu, senior Asia economist at Oxford Economics. ""Both the weakening in the domestic economy and deteriorating external environment, including both a global slowdown, and the US-China trade tensions, have a role to play in China's slowdown."" Given China's importance in the global economy, and its healthy demand for anything from commodities to machinery, any downturn is likely to have far-reaching consequences. Gary Hufbauer, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, estimates that a one percentage point drop in Chinese growth would probably take 0.2 percentage points off global growth. The official data paints an increasingly cloudy outlook. Industrial output is growing at its weakest pace since 2002, and retail sales are slowing. Chinese exports fell in August by 1% from a year earlier, and by a sharp 16% to the US - a clear sign that the dispute with the US is hurting bilateral trade. But while growth is down from double digit levels in the mid-2000's, the more recent slowdown has been relatively gradual. China's economy grew 6.2% year-on-year in the second quarter, easing from 6.4% in the first three months of the year, and from 6.6% in 2018. ""It's not as if Chinese growth has completely fallen off a cliff,"" says Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC.  ""On the contrary, there are still many pockets of growth,"" he adds, pointing to housing construction and spending in the services sector. China's government has sought to support the economy this year through tax cuts, and by taking measures to boost liquidity in the financial system. But Mr Neumann says that this time around, the government was being ""fairly restrained"" when providing credit to firms and individuals, and administering stimulus. That's because the government believes China needs to curb the risk in its financial system, and cool the rapid credit growth of recent years, he adds. ""Chinese authorities are not really showing signs of wavering from this track... so it's by design in many ways, rather than by accident, that we've seen weaker economic growth numbers,"" says Mr Neumann. Having relied heavily on infrastructure spending to stimulate the economy over the years, analysts say Beijing had limited room to do much more on that front. Instead they have opted for tax cuts, which tend to be less effective in boosting growth than infrastructure spending, says Mr Wu. Mr Wu expected Beijing to do more to stimulate the economy going forward - both through fiscal and monetary policy -  but worried this would not be enough. ""We do expect more to come to help stabilise growth by next year. But the key downside risk is that the authorities do not step up policy support enough to stabilise growth."" The US and China have been fighting a trade war for more than a year, and more tariffs are expected. The impact from the US tariffs has been offset to some extent by a weaker yuan, says Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics, while China has also sought to bypass the taxes by exporting to the US via other Asian countries. He says that China's share of global exports has actually grown over the past year, showing that the fall in Chinese exports has been less pronounced than those from other countries. Western businesses, meanwhile, are finding it increasingly hard to navigate the uncertainty. Some have been shifting production out of China, even though the numbers have not been large enough to show up in the economic data, says Mr Evans-Pritchard. ""The longer these tariffs remain in place, the longer this drags on, the higher the chance we are going to see more firms shifting out of China, and it also makes the country a less attractive place to invest in the first place,"" he says. While many firms will want to keep some production in China to cater for its important domestic market, there are signs some firms are already considering their options. According to a 2019 survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, 65% of members said trade tensions are influencing their longer-term business strategies. Nearly a fourth of all respondents are delaying China investments, it said. The deadly swine fever has placed an additional drag on the Chinese economy over the past year. China, the world's biggest producer of pork, has struggled to control the disease even after slaughtering more than one million pigs. The supply shortage has sent pork prices soaring - by 46.7% in August on a year earlier- and that is eating into household incomes. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: ""The price of pork has almost doubled,"" said the Peterson Institute's Hufbauer, adding that this was ""very painful for low income Chinese."" Pork is one of China's main food staples, and accounts for more than 60% of the country's meat consumption. While for now the surge has been partly offset by more subdued non-food inflation, analysts say this could quickly change. ""What worries me is that they just don't seem to have gotten the disease under control yet. The pig stock is still falling,"" says Mr Evans-Pritchard.  ""At this stage it's already pointing towards pork price inflation rising above 80% year-on-year within the next six months."" "
economic indicators,UK 'cannot duck' post-Covid inequalities,2024-09-15,2021-01-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55536722,"The UK ""cannot duck"" tackling inequalities of health, ethnicity, education and jobs post-Covid, a major review has warned. The report's chairman, Nobel laureate Sir Angus Deaton, says a lot of work to repair and rebuild the damage will be needed after the pandemic. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) Deaton Review of Inequalities warned the fabric of society was under threat. Launched 18 months ago, the review says Covid-19 worsened existing problems. The review says there is a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity to tackle the disadvantages faced by many that this pandemic has so devastatingly exposed"". ""We now face a set of challenges which we cannot duck."" Sir Angus said: ""As the vaccines should, at some point this year, take us into a world largely free of the pandemic, it is imperative to think about policies that will be needed to repair the damage and that focus on those who have suffered the most. ""We need to build a country in which everyone feels that they belong."" While the pandemic had highlighted the disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups and deprived communities, it also showed that the UK's best-paid and most highly educated have been ""much better able to ride out the crisis"", the report said. Children from poorer households found it harder to do schoolwork during lockdown and have been more likely to miss school since September, it noted. And while the biggest risk factor for coronavirus is age, younger people have been hit harder by the economic consequences of the crisis. The cost of the pandemic is ""just colossal"" IFS director Paul Johnson told the BBC's Today programme. ""We've seen the biggest reduction in national income, essentially in history, over the last year, we've seen the biggest public deficit in history outside of the two world wars, so there's no getting around the fact that the pandemic and the response to it has had a bigger effect on the economy than anything essentially in the whole of history."" The report highlighted the effects of the pandemic on different groups, including on education, which is ""probably more worrying"" than the overall economic effect, Mr Johnson said. ""The first lockdown lockdown saw a dreadful impact on the education particularly of poorer children... they were getting less in the way of online lessons from their schools. ""There's a huge private school/state school divide in this, but also a big divide within state schools between those children who had support at home, had the facilities at home - laptops and internet and so on - but who also had the support from school - so there's a big impact on education but also a very unequal one,"" he added. The review is calling for extra support for children who have fallen behind and help for school and university leavers to find jobs.  It says the welfare safety net must be adapted so it supports non-traditional forms of employment, including insecure and self-employed workers, and minority ethnic groups must be given greater economic opportunities. Progress in reducing poor mental and physical health could be ""one of the clearest indications of success of economic and social policy"", it adds. Mark Franks, director of welfare at the Nuffield Foundation, which funded the review, said: ""Individuals are subject to a wide range of potential vulnerabilities around dimensions including age, ethnicity, place of birth, education, income and the nature of their employment. ""Where these vulnerabilities intersect, they can amplify and reinforce one another and play a huge role in driving unequal outcomes."" However, the government said it was already spending vast sums to support people and the economy through the pandemic.  A spokesman said: ""We're doing everything we can to ensure our coronavirus support reaches those who need it the most, which is why we've invested more than £280bn to protect the incomes, livelihoods and health of millions of people across the UK."" This included an additional £9bn for the welfare system and £2bn for the Kickstart Scheme, tripling traineeships, incentives for firms hiring apprentices and doubling the number of work coaches ""so that nobody is left without hope or opportunity"", the spokesman said."
economic indicators,Afghans living under Taliban lament loss of freedoms,2024-09-15,2021-08-14,By Rhodri Davies and the BBC investigations team,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58191440,"Work days for midwife Nooria Haya regularly included meetings and discussions with male doctors. They decided on treatments for locals and the priorities for the public clinic she works in. It's in Ishkamish, a rural district with sparse amenities, in Takhar province on Afghanistan's north-eastern border with Tajikistan.  But recently, the 29-year-old found out that meetings between male and female staff were prohibited. It was the first order the Taliban gave them when the group took control of the region, she says. She could only ask herself how else her life would change.  Ishkamish sits in the Hindu Kush mountain range. It's a key border area that the Taliban, emboldened by Nato's withdrawal of nearly 10,000 troops at the start of May, has taken.   Igniting intense fighting with seemingly unprepared government forces in southern Helmand by the middle of the month, the fundamentalist Islamist group then took the northern Burka district at the mountains' foothills.  Around the same time, US forces left Kandahar airbase - one of the largest in the nation, in a province containing the country's second largest city, Kandahar. Locals were acutely aware of the Taliban's progress.  ""Every individual was frightened,"" says Jan Agha, 54, in Arghistan district, on the border with Pakistan, and a windy two-hour drive east of Kandahar city.  People locked themselves in their homes. But the Taliban took up positions in almost every village. Locals can't escape them.  Armed fighters walk through the streets. In the morning and evening, they knock on people's doors to collect food, which they're given for fear of worse consequences.  ""Each house now keeps three or four breads or dishes for them,"" Jan, a fruit seller, says, no matter how poor the residents, in a chronically poor country. If the fighters want to stay in their homes too, they do. Through June, the Taliban claimed the capture of several provinces in the north, including Takhar, Faryab and Badakhshan. They forced the army to strategically retreat, and with it democratic institutions. Most of the 2,500 US troops had left by this time, although a handful remain in the capital Kabul, as does its Air Force.  Afghans have criticised the international withdrawal as too hasty. Some argue that peace talks over the last two years between the Americans and the Taliban only enhanced the latter's perceived legitimacy, recruitment and ambition. An end to the conflict - which had been ongoing since the US-led invasion ended half a decade of Taliban rule almost 20 years ago - had never been close. As the Taliban reasserted itself in June, fighters sequestered more than food and lodging. Social and economic rights fought for with limited success over the last two decades were immediately withdrawn. Their privations on women descended on Nooria for the first time in her life.  ""There are a lot of restrictions now. When I go out, I have to wear a burka as the Taliban orders us, and a male has to accompany me,"" she says.  Travelling as a midwife across the district is especially difficult. Men are not allowed to shave their beards - the Taliban says this is against Islam. Barbers are prohibited from giving purportedly foreign-style short back and sides haircuts.  A group within the Taliban, called the Amri bil Marof (literally: order the good), particularly enforces the social rules. Its punishments brought the most terror to Afghans in the 1990s. Now, again, it's imposing a two-strike rule. First a warning, second a punishment - public humiliations, prison, beatings, lashes.  ""Suddenly most freedoms have been taken away from us,"" Nooria says. ""It is so hard. But we have no other option. They are brutal. We have to do whatever they say. They are using Islam for their own purposes. We are Muslims ourselves, but their beliefs are different."" Difference has also arrived with some increased security from criminality, and from war - where the conflict has been pushed to other areas. Locals welcome such nuanced calm, as they would if the government were in control - even if they doubt its durability. But other things have been driven away too. Afghans used to visit Takhar, famous among the country's 34 provinces for its clean, crisp mountain air that blankets snowy mountains, green and verdant fields, and clear river waters. In Farkhar district, taxi driver Asif Ahadi says he used to make 900 Afghanis ($11; £8) a day. But as the Taliban continued their march, tourists stopped their travels. ""Those visitors were my customers,"" Asif, 35, says. ""The money they paid me I used to feed my family. Now my best day will only earn me 150 Afghanis. It's not even enough to cover the cost of my fuel, which has more than doubled now."" And there's been a deadening impact on social life. ""People used to have parties every Friday night - listen to music and dance - have fun. All of these are completely banned now,"" Asif says.  ""Every business has suffered the same."" By 4 July, two days after US and Nato troops left Afghanistan's biggest airbase at Bagram, the linchpin for all US-led operations for the last two decades, the Taliban seized Panjwai district, in Kandahar province - their birthplace and former bastion.  Less than a week later, they said they controlled the country's biggest border crossing and trade route with Iran and major port, Islam Qala. By the third week of the month, the insurgency had already claimed to command 90% of Afghanistan's borders and 85% of the country. The government disputed the figures - and they are impossible to independently verify - and it still held more populated urban areas. As the Taliban solidified their control, people started to come out of hiding at home, Asif says. Some had never seen the Taliban's rapid dispensing of justice and methods of governing before. ""They make decisions very quickly on issues and matters like crime,"" Asif says. ""There's no bureaucracy, no red tape - every sort of problem can be solved in days - and nobody can challenge any decision."" They also collect ""Taliban Usher"" and Zakat, usually freely-given Islamic offerings to the poor, of about 10% of people's harvest or a fraction of income, respectively. But the Taliban distorts them into essentially taxes for their own use.  It's another financial pressure, alongside prices for ""all goods that are hiked to sky"", Asif says, as external and internal trade is restricted, and the economy is squeezed. Public works have stopped.  ""The people were already very poor, and there's no opportunity for work, and no investment,"" he adds.  Some have seen the Taliban's system before, however.  ""Their ideology and thinking are exactly as they were during their Emirate time. Nothing has changed at all,"" says Jan. ""The Taliban say they have sacrificed a lot to re-establish the Islamic Emirate, so it can't be cast aside."" He says the Taliban has shut all schools in his area. They've said any education should be according to their strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law. It's one of many worrying indicators for locals.  During their last rule from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban banned education and work for women and girls, and restricted their access to healthcare. Since they were forced from power, women retook places in public life, making up a quarter of parliament.  Numbers of girls in primary education went up to 50%, although by late secondary school the figure was around 20%. Women's life expectancy grew from 57 to 66 years. The figures are comparatively poor, but improvements have been made. Yet now there are only fears that they will regress. Progress is what the Taliban are making now. In August, they've attacked more urban centres - taking a third of the regional capitals, including Kunduz in the north and Taloqan in Takhar province. This week they took Herat in the west, and southern Kandahar and Lashkar Gah, strategically and symbolically important cities, where, together, well over one million people live.  The US Air Force has been supporting the Afghan military with strikes. But the last remaining foreign forces are expected to leave the country by 11 September. The date marks the 20th anniversary of al-Qaeda's 9/11 attacks in the US. They spurred the US-led invasion of Afghanistan to remove the Taliban from power for harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures. The struggle takes its toll on human life. A thousand civilians were killed in the month up to the first week of August, the UN says. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes.  Control of the country isn't yet certain. But where the Taliban now rules, the change is clear.  ""You have to bow your head to live your life,"" Jan says. ""You cannot dare oppose them. You cannot say things against them at all. If they say 'yes', you have to say 'yes'. If they say 'no', you must say 'no'."" Such fear prevails, Nooria says. ""Although it might seem like people looked relaxed, when you speak with them, you understand the serious worries they have. We sit together, praying for God to take them away from us.""

economic indicators,India's next government faces economic slowdown,2024-09-15,2019-05-17,By Soutik Biswas,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48268801,"As India lumbers towards the final phase of an exhausting general election and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP seeks a second term in power, there's some worrying news. The world's fastest growing major economy appears to be headed for a slowdown. The signs are everywhere. Economic growth slowed to 6.6% in the three months to December, the slowest in six quarters. Sales of cars and SUVs have slumped to a seven-year-low. Tractors and two-wheelers sales are down. Net profits for 334 companies (excluding banks and financials) are down 18% year-on-year, according to the Financial Express newspaper.  That's not all. In March, passenger growth in the world's fastest growing aviation market expanded at the slowest pace in nearly six years. Demand for bank credit has spluttered. Hindustan Unilever, India's leading maker of fast moving consumer goods, has reported March quarter revenue growth of just 7%, its weakest in 18 months.  One newspaper wondered whether India was ""losing the consumption plot"". Taken together, all this points to a fall in both urban and rural incomes, leading to demand contraction. A crop glut has seen farm incomes drop. And credit stagnation, partly triggered by the collapse of a major non-banking financial institution, or a shadow bank, has led to a fall in lending and worsened matters. Kaushik Basu, former chief economist of the World Bank and professor of economics at Cornell University, believes the slowdown is ""much more serious"" than he initially believed. ""The evidence is now mounting to the point where it can no longer be ignored,"" he told me.  One reason, he believes, is the controversial currency ban in 2016 - also called demonetisation - which adversely hit farmers. More than 80% of the currency circulating in India's sprawling cash-driven economy was taken out of circulation in what, in the words of one of Prime Minister Modi's own advisers, was a ""massive, draconian, monetary shock"".  ""This was evident to all by early 2017. What many observers did not realise then - I did not - is that the shock made the farmers take on debts which ended up causing sustained hardship to them that is continuing and slowing down the agriculture sector."" The other major disappointment, according to Prof Basu, has been exports. ""Export growth has been close to zero for the last five years. For a low-wage economy like India, a little policy professionalism - a combination of monetary policy and micro incentives - is all that is needed to grow this sector. It is regrettable that the rhetoric was not backed up with policy design.""  Others like economist Rathin Roy, a member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council, believe that India's consumption story could actually be levelling out.  Dr Roy believes India's rapid growth has been essentially powered by its top 100 million citizens. The leading indicators of economic prosperity, he says, are things that these Indians consume - cars, two wheelers, air conditioners and so on. Having had their fill of home-made goods, they have now moved to imported luxuries - foreign holidays and Italian kitchens, for example.  A majority of Indians want nutritious food, affordable clothing and housing, health and education, which really should be the leading indicators of economic growth. ""Subsidies and income support cannot pay for such consumption on a massive scale. At least half the population should earn incomes that enable them to buy these at affordable prices so that a maximum of 500 million people can be subsidised to improve their welfare,"" Dr Roy says. Unless India is able to do this in the next decade or so, Dr Roy believes, it is headed for what economists call a ""middle income trap"", when a country stops being able to achieve rapid growth easily and compete with advanced economies. Economist Ardo Hannson defines it as a situation when countries ""seem to get stuck in a trap where your costs are escalating and you lose competitiveness"".  One problem is that once you are stuck in a middle income trap, it is difficult to get out.  A World Bank study found that out of the 101 middle-income countries in 1960, some 13 had become high-income by 2008 based on per capita income relative to the US. Only three of the 13 countries have a population of more than 25 million. India is a lower-middle income economy and to get caught in a trap at this stage will be tragic. Dr Roy says the classic middle income trap means that the rich are taxed to provide minimum services to the poor, who will kept from extreme poverty and vulnerability by using such taxes to subsidise their existence, including an universal basic income in perpetuity.  ""We will be Brazil. On the other hand If India produces what all Indians want to consume efficiently, and at affordable prices, then inclusive growth will stave off the middle income trap. We will be Japan,"" says Dr Roy.  The next government has its work cut out.  Read more from Soutik Biswas Follow Soutik on Twitter at @soutikBBC"
economic indicators,Going for Growth,2024-09-15,2018-05-20,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-44189803,"Next Friday, at last, we're due to get sight of a document likely to shape Scottish politics for quite a while to come. That is at least until someone comes up with anything more interesting or provocative. The SNP's Growth Commission was announced by Nicola Sturgeon in September 2016, two years after the Scottish referendum, and three months after the Brexit vote. It has been chaired by economist and former MSP Andrew Wilson, and its membership included Finance Secretary Derek Mackay and Education Minister Shirley-Anne Somerville.  Having them on board carries a risk - it's harder for the SNP to distance itself from any tricky recommendations, though perhaps their presence there was to ensure there aren't any. The report has been ready for publication for many months. But it seems the time hasn't been right, until now. It's just a hunch, but that might be because the remit was so broad, requiring the report to head into difficult territory. It goes like this: ""The Commission will assess the projections for Scotland's economy and public finances, consider the implications for our economy and finances of different potential governance scenarios, and make recommendations for policy on: In addition, the Commission will ""take account of the recommendations of the 2013 Fiscal Commission reports, and the outcome of the EU referendum, and consider the most appropriate monetary policy arrangements to underpin a programme for sustainable growth in an independent Scotland"". Consider some of the implications, particularly when set against Alex Salmond's Indy prospectus in 2014. For one, either embrace the Government and Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (GERS) figures, or set out the basis to reject them - even though they're from the Scottish government itself. If you accept GERS, a very large deficit has to be addressed. And we already know from Andrew Wilson that he is not going to massage oil tax revenue to do so. The commission chairman has said the figures were ""baked in"" to the 2014 prospectus, yet the remit defines them as ""a windfall"". Trident makes an appearance, as you might expect, giving the opportunity to take a share of nuclear weapons costs and spend that elsewhere. But a report like this can only spend it once elsewhere. The cost of the transition to independence? A very rough guess from Alex Salmond in 2014 was that it might cost £200m. As Brexit reality bites, the cost of such transitions are being shown to be very expensive indeed. And while the benefits could be made to look huge, cost and benefit analyses ought to show when those benefits kick in. They may not yet be delivered when the bills are dropping on the doormat at St Andrew's House. A lot of attention will be focused on changes to the economic arguments for independence, when compared with Alex Salmond's White Paper. It's reported, in the Sunday Post, that the Growth Commission will back a Scottish currency. That should come as no surprise, though the detail is likely to include a mechanism for pegging it to sterling, or maybe the euro. The case for 'sharing' the pound, because ""it belongs to Scotland too,"" was arguably (and it was argued over, for sure) the weakest point in the Indy prospectus. The case made four years ago on currency was merely to achieve what was possible. None of the choices looked easy. The remit for the Growth Commission is more specific. It is a monetary system that ""underpins sustainable growth"". However, the case against keeping the pound may have become easier to make. Since the Brexit referendum, Scotland sticking with Westminster can no longer be portrayed as the status quo.  Between Brexit and independence, there would be two radical options, both carrying risks and costs, both with potential benefits - plus the third choice, of having both. The remit of the Growth Commission was also to recommend ways to boost the growth rate ahead of independence, or without it. That has become a more pressing issue since Andrew Wilson's team set to work. With the downturn in oil and gas came a downturn in growth across the country, hitting a small recession in 2015 and clearly lagging behind the UK's low growth rate. The recent surge in the oil price, hitting $80 per barrel this week, ought to spark hopes of a recovery for the energy sector, even if oil consumers - including drivers and much of industry - feel the heat of higher fuel and input costs. The past few days have given us some indicators of where the economy has stood recently. They're mixed. The latest Scottish Retail Consortium figures make grim reading for the nation's shopkeepers. Scotland is not alone in this. Earlier this week, the British figures for footfall registered an ""unprecedented"" fall.  This is partly down to weak consumer confidence, particularly in non-food sales. It is also as the shift to online sales seems to be gathering pace.  Take Macfarlane Group, as further evidence. The Glasgow packaging firm released a trading update last Tuesday, buoyed up by all the cardboard being used to wrap those parcels for home delivery. The number that most concerns politicians, unemployment - because it's the economic number that most affects voters - fell slightly in January to March, and remains at historically very low levels. Youth unemployment is at a particularly low level.  Job creation has been fairly good over the past year, but not nearly as strong as across the UK as a whole. From autumn to winter, the number of Scots in employment fell 6,000, while the UK figure leapt on upwards by 197,000. Over the year, the figures look more respectable, but still short of Scotland's population share. The other number that voters feel in their household budgets is the extent to which real buying power is shifting.  Real wages - the cash figure minus price inflation - have been negative or very weak through the past decade. A return to real wage growth, albeit by a tiny margin, is welcome, but there's a lot of catching up to do. That can best and sustainably be achieved with improved productivity, but earlier this month, we got numbers which should continue to cause concern.  It was already weak, but these figures, from the Scottish government, suggest it's getting weaker.  Output per worker increased slightly, but not as fast as hours worked. So the key measure of productivity - output per hour worked - saw it fall in 2017 by 1.1%, compared to a very low, but at least positive, 0.3% the previous year. The less disappointing news was that it was getting less bad over the year, from a fall in the first two quarters to no improvement in the third quarter and a 1% rise in October to December. More cheering was news this week that output from the private sector in Scotland, according to the monthly Purchasing Managers Index, registered a pick-up last month. That's after successive months of wavering around the standstill point, significantly behind the UK index. For the Scottish government and the SNP, the political pressure from low growth is... well, it's growing. Conservatives recently put together their reckoning of the amount by which the Scots economy is under-shooting where it might otherwise be. It was a signal of the ground on which they want to take on their rivals. That's quite a brave thing to do when fellow Conservatives are running the show at Westminster. It can take some blame for the lack of investment confidence while Brexit negotiations stagger on, though less so for the numbers on which Scotland lags the UK. The Growth Commission report will surely presented as providing a route map to faster growth, and on towards independence. Or it may provide quite a lot of further ammunition for the government's critics.  My hunch is that it will do both. Well worth a listen (and not because I was the interviewer), Prof Mariana Mazzucato is an adviser to the Scottish and Westminster governments and the European Commission, on ways in which government can shape the economy.   In a half-hour discussion on BBC Radio Scotland, she explained why the state can and should be seen as entrepreneur.  You can catch up here, 26 minutes, 23 seconds in."
economic indicators,Cambodia economy defies global trend but challenges remain,2024-09-15,2013-07-25,Puneet Pal Singh,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-23429693,"The manufacture and exports of garments has played a key role in Cambodia's growth in recent years Some of the world's leading economies are seeing a slowdown in growth - dragging down the global economy with them. But here in Asia, Cambodia  - which goes to the polls on 28 July in a general election - is one country that has been defying the trend. The South East Asian economy saw its growth pick up speed in 2012 and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has forecast ""further robust growth, with trajectory expected to steepen slightly in 2014"". According to the ADB, Cambodia's economy expanded at an annual rate of 7.2% in 2012, up from 7.1% in 2011 and 6% in 2010.  Cambodia, like many other countries in Asia, has for many years relied on its export sector to be a key driver of growth.  Low cost of labour has seen the country become a key manufacturer and exporter of garments and footwear to markets such as the US and European Union (EU).  Economic problems in those markets have dented consumer confidence, and in 2012 Cambodia saw the pace of growth of its exports decline - but , according to the ADB, domestic consumption jumped by 9.5% and is expected to rise further in the coming years.  And as conditions in the US and EU improve, exports are likely to rebound. ""European demand for Cambodian garments and footwear is expected to maintain good growth, supported by duty-free access to the EU,"" the bank said in a report, external on the Cambodian economy published in April. ""Shipments to the US will likely be subdued this year but should pick up after that,"" it added. Another key driver of Cambodia's growth has been the surge in foreign direct investment in the country, which jumped by 75% last year to $1.5bn (£1bn). Along with traditional sectors such as garment manufacturing, foreign money has also been used to help fund new industries such as auto-parts manufacturing and agricultural products processing. Protesting Cambodian workers have been demanding higher wages Low labour costs and Cambodia's proximity to key markets such as China and other emerging economies in South East Asia are attractive to foreign investors.  And with wages in countries such as Thailand and China on the rise, Cambodia is likely to become even more attractive.  ""This trend is only going to get stronger with more companies looking to set up operations in Asia,"" says Rajiv Biswas, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at IHS Global Insight. ""Given its competitiveness and the current economic environment, Cambodia is going to increasingly become a destination of choice for foreign investors."" But there have been protests in recent months with workers demanding an increase in their wages.  And critics say for the country to take the next step in its growth cycle, it needs to diversify into high-end manufacturing on a bigger scale.  But Cambodia may find it tough to do so, not least because of the skill level of the majority of its labour force. ""A key restraint to growth is the skill mismatch, or the lack of adequately skilled labour in the high-end industries,"" says Srinivas Madhur, director of research at Cambodia Development Resource Institute. ""The enrolment rate in tertiary education is only 14%, which means the pool of skilled people is very small."" Mr Biswas says that the inability of Cambodia to move into advanced manufacturing is a ""great vulnerability"". ""What is crucial now, is that they need to develop their education sector and they need to build partnerships to bring more advanced education into the country, especially vocational training,"" he says. Another key area of concern is that Cambodia remains one of the poorest countries in Asia.  Its per capita income in 2012 was $946, according to the World Bank, external. That compares with $5,474 in Thailand and $3,557 in Indonesia.   The ADB has quoted the World Health Organization as saying vitamin and mineral deficiencies alone cost Cambodia's economy $146m each year. The bank says 55% of under-fives were anaemic in 2010. And malnutrition and poor health stunt the growth of up to 40% of Cambodian children. Economic growth has seen poverty levels come down - but critics say the country needs to do much more to ensure the benefits trickle down to the poor. ""Inclusive growth"", they say, is a much better claim to fame than ""robust growth"".   Cambodia country profile Cambodia police clash with workers Police clash with workers in Cambodia.

economic indicators,"Brexit: bulls, bears and bulldogs",2024-09-15,2017-09-19,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-41327436,"There's a mis-match between Scotland's economic performance so far this year, and the gathering gloom about the potential impact of Brexit. In 2016, the economy actually contracted, according to official statistics. It wasn't technically a recession, but it was a very poor year. The start of this year shows a growth spurt, yet other UK indicators through recent months are pointing to a slowdown in confidence, related to inflation and a whole lot of uncertainty. The Fraser of Allander Institute, at Strathclyde University, has an update today on its regular analysis and forecast, which seeks to figure out how these apparently conflicting trends fit together.  The assessment of the 0.7% growth figure for the first three months of the year, when the expectation was of being at, or close to, zero, brings some health warnings about the numbers. It is notable, for instance, for being focused on only three sectors - refined chemicals and pharmaceuticals, metals and machinery and ""other manufacturing, repair and installation"". Together, they represent only 6% of the entire Scottish economy, say the Allander economists. It's not obvious why they should have grown so quickly last winter. But if the figures are to be trusted, there may have been one-off factors that won't carry through until subsequent quarters. Also worth noting is that the net growth in demand appears to have been entirely derived from the rest of the UK and not from Scotland. Looking on the bright side, ""the hope is that this bounce back will act as a catalyst for momentum to build across the wider economy through the remainder of 2017"". That includes the need to turn around a sharp decline in business investment, down nearly 8% in a year, and 3.4% in the first quarter. The Fraser of Allander forecast for an anaemic 1.2% growth this year is based on a deal being done on Brexit. But without a deal, it's in line with almost all other economists in warning that things could turn out very much worse. And there's a further warning that if the uncertainty continues, then business bosses will choose to plan on the basis of a bad outcome.   That's already happening in the finance sector. Industry sources expect decisions on more jobs being relocated into the rest of the EU during this winter.   Without the distribution of powers to Westminster and Holyrood, the opportunity to work with governments for an optimal outcome is being lost, says the Strathclyde report. The UK government had anticipated that British industry would readily sign up to a jingoistic message of national unity in backing the Brexit Bulldogs as they go into battle with Johnnie Foreigner. That's not happening. So what is happening? Well, here is an example of the way business is thinking - not economists, many of whom find the whole Brexit process an interesting laboratory to test trade theory, possibly to destruction.  This is what Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research found when it sought the outlook from a range of equity analysts, for whom this is far from theoretical. They looked at what would happen if there's no deal. ""While extreme,"" writes the research note, ""exploring this tail risk brings the challenges facing post-Brexit Britain into sharp relief. Nine things they think investors should know: The risk most often identified by analysts, according to this report, is of reversing the high levels of immigration in recent years. If foreign workers are blocked or discouraged from Britain, if earnings in sterling are less attractive and growth is slowed, the population could come in as much as one million below forecasts. If you're investing in housebuilders, banks, insurance, retail, media and leisure, that risk is not yet being priced in. If you think the Brexit talks will go well, this research note points to interest rates going up, the pound strengthening, and stronger prospects for real estate, media and retail. For those who are bearish on the outcome of Brexit talks, the advice is to invest in basic resources, oil majors, consumer staples and healthcare. There may be quite a big demand for painkillers."
economic indicators,Lockdown traffic 'at early 1970s levels',2024-09-15,2020-05-04,By Justin Parkinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52461913,"The traffic on Britain's roads has started creeping back up during the past couple of weeks, but - as you may have noticed when out shopping, exercising or going to work - they're still a lot quieter than before the lockdown. The government says road trips in motorised vehicles, recorded at 275 automated sites, are now at around 35% to 45% of the usual level. AA president Edmund King has told the BBC that - based on analysis of the official figures and his organisation's own monitoring - traffic volumes in Britain are now ""akin to those in the early 1970s"". It was a time the Morris Marina and Ford Cortina were among the UK's best-selling cars. Edward Heath was prime minister, the UK joined the European Economic Community, money went fully decimal, David Bowie rebranded himself as Ziggy Stardust and almost half of all adults smoked - many while at the wheel. The world has changed, but does this temporary situation on the roads offer a glimpse of how it was to drive back then? ""It was a very different era,"" says Giles Chapman, author of Cars We Loved in the 1970s. ""It was one when car ownership was still being encouraged and, far more than our own, was associated with freedom."" One reason was that there were so many fewer of them. As of September last year, the most recent available figures, 38.9 million vehicles were licensed for use on Britain's roads. In 1970 the number was just over a third of that, at 13.5 million. Britain's roads have expanded more slowly. In 2018 they measured 246,700 miles in total - up less than a quarter from 203,400 in 1970. Part of 1970s driving folklore is that one could pull up in any high street, get out, shop, visit the cinema or have a meal. ""There's some truth in that,"" says Mr Chapman. ""That was in many ways still the golden age of parking. Councils were better funded and didn't think of it as a way of raising cash, and there was no clamping."" This aspect of 1970s driving won't be replicated during the coronavirus crisis, however, with so many more cars on the roads today. In fact, travel restrictions mean a greater proportion will be stationary, meaning parking near home could be more difficult than usual. At least, though, if you wind the windows down (easier now, with electronics involved), the air is likely to be cleaner than in the 1970s. Today's more efficient, lower-emitting vehicles, no longer using leaded petrol, are ""cleaner, greener and much safer"", says the AA's Mr King. But perhaps the biggest change over the decades has been the improvement in safety. The number of deaths recorded on British speed bump-free and CCTV-less roads in 1970 was 7,499 - more than four times greater than in 2018. ""In 2018 the risk of fatality per motor vehicle mile was about one-tenth that during the 1970s,"" says Benjamin Heydecker, professor of transport studies at University College London. ""This is usually ascribed to the combined beneficial efforts in engineering, education and enforcement."" Since the 1970s, seatbelts have been compulsory, while cars have been redesigned to reduce the impact of crashes for those on board and for pedestrians. Nowadays drink driving is a huge taboo. ""You shudder now when you think of dads who left their kids in the car outside the pub in the 1970s with a packet of crisps and a bottle of cola, while they stayed inside and had a couple of pints, "" says Mr Chapman. MOTs - showing a vehicle's roadworthiness - started in 1960, but until 1977 did not include checks on windscreen wipers, indicators, exhaust systems, body structure and chassis. Before that they were ""pretty cursory"" and ""really just about whether the brakes worked"", Mr Chapman says. ""Some of the reduction in deaths will be due to a greater proportion of travel on motorway roads, which are less hazardous per vehicle mile of travel,"" adds Prof Heydecker. As the lockdown eases, the traffic on Britain's roads is likely to continue growing, taking us, through stages, to volumes seen in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. But, at least for a bit, it's easier to get from A to B - when we're allowed out."
economic indicators,The surprise is that more jobs haven't gone,2024-09-15,2020-08-11,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-53743154,"Unemployment up: employment down: with fewer job opportunities, fewer people making themselves available for work. So, there are no surprises in the labour market figures for April, May and June - the most severe months of lockdown, with some easing in June. However, it is a little surprising that the figures have not shifted more.  An unemployment rate of 4.5% remains low, given the extraordinary economic events since March. The UK rate, of 3.9%, is the same as last year. It seems the Labour Force Survey, which results in the normal headline employment statistics, is failing to capture those events, mainly because those on furlough are not counted as unemployed. Partly, that is because many will return to work when it is there for them to do, and partly because the scheme is delaying unemployment for others. The more significant measure of change is in UK-wide figures for the numbers on PAYE payroll tax, down by 730,000 between March and July. That only covers employed people. Self-employed workers are harder to measure, and the income support scheme has not been as effective. IPSE, the independent workers association, says the average freelance worker went 5.5 weeks out of 13 without any work, and income fell by 25% between the first and the second quarters of the year. There are clear indications that some have seen demand for their work fall away so far that they are back in the jobs market. A measure of those claiming unemployment benefits shows a rise of 102% in the past year, to 222,300 in Scotland. Across the UK, the rise is 117%, to 2.7m. There has been a significant shift, for the first time, in the number of those who were unemployed and then stopped looking for work. And the number of weekly hours worked, across the UK, has fallen by nearly 20%, with the biggest fall in the category of accommodation and food services. Those are the numbers that feel more like the reality facing people over the past few months of crisis, lockdown and stoppage for a large chunk of the economy."
economic indicators,"NI jobs market is now weakening, figures suggest",2024-09-15,2023-09-12,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-66783574,"The Northern Ireland jobs market may have peaked and is now weakening, the latest official figures suggest. Most of the official short term indicators point to a slowdown in recent months. In August, the number of people on company payrolls fell slightly, according to HMRC data. A survey of businesses also suggests the number of employee jobs fell slightly in the second quarter of 2023. The Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) surveys about 6,000 companies, covering all employers with 25 or more employees and all public sector employers. It suggests the number of employee jobs was 813,450 in June 2023; that was an increase of 13,740 jobs (+1.7%) on the same period in 2022 but a decrease of 1,370 jobs (-0.2%) compared to the first quarter of 2023. That was the first quarterly decrease in employee jobs following eight consecutive quarterly increases. Meanwhile, the number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits increased in August, up by 0.4% to 36,700. The overall unemployment rate in May to June also showed an increase, up to 2.7% from 2.4% the previous quarter. The employment rate, which measures the percentage of working age adults in a job, also weakened over the quarter, down from 72.4% to 71.1%. The statistics agency, Nisra, says the employment and unemployment figures should be interpreted carefully as the quarterly changes are not statistically significant. HMRC data also suggests that average pay rises in Northern Ireland are continuing to run behind the rate of inflation. In August, typical pay in NI increased by 0.1% (£2) over the month to 6% (£119) over the year. The UK's main rate of inflation in July was 6.8% and is likely to show a similar rate for August. Meanwhile, a major investment summit is to bring more than 100 global investors and businesses to Belfast this week. Essentially a sales pitch, the Northern Ireland Investment Summit will try to persuade companies to invest or re-invest here - while showcasing local businesses specialising in cyber security and green manufacturing.

economic indicators,Fears for democracy as buoyant Bangladesh turns 50,2024-09-15,2021-03-24,By Anbarasan Ethirajan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56433279,"Bangladesh is held up by many as a model of development, but as it marks 50 years of independence critics say it risks becoming a one-party state intolerant of dissent, threatening the democratic principles on which it was founded. When cartoonist Ahmed Kabir Kishore was brought to a court in Dhaka last month, his brother was shocked to see how weak and traumatised he looked. Mr Kishore told his brother Ahsan that he had been tortured in detention after a group of unidentified men forcibly took him from his residence at the height of the coronavirus pandemic last May. His alleged crime - posting satirical cartoons and comments on Facebook criticising the health system before the outbreak and the government's response to the pandemic.  His family had no information on the 45-year-old for several days after he was picked up. Then they heard that he had been arrested on charges of involvement in anti-state activities and spreading ""rumours"".  Mr Kishore was denied bail six times by the courts. When it was finally granted, the cartoonist had already spent 10 months in jail under a notorious law, the Digital Security Act (DSA).  His family could not visit him in jail due to coronavirus restrictions. The identity of the men who took him away is still not clear and it's also a mystery how he finally ended up at a police station in the capital. ""My brother's left ear has been severely damaged and he's struggling to walk. Doctors say he needs surgery on his right ear,"" Ahsan Kabir told the BBC.   Despite all this, Mr Kishore is thankful that he is at least alive. Mushtaq Ahmed, a writer arrested in the same case last year, was less fortunate.  He died in prison a week before Mr Kishore was granted bail.  His death triggered widespread outrage and protests. Activists have demanded the government repeal the law, which they describe as draconian. Officials insist there was nothing suspicious in Mr Ahmed's death.  There have been other abductions too.  Photojournalist Shafiqul Islam Kajol was forced into a van by a group of unidentified men in Dhaka last March. His family had no information on him for the next 53 days before he was found hundreds of kilometres away along the border with India, blindfolded and tied. Then he spent the next seven months in prison charged under the DSA with sharing objectionable, defamatory and fake information about politicians from the governing Awami League party on Facebook.  Mr Kajol was finally released on bail in late December.  The DSA, passed despite objections from editors and civil society activists in October 2018, has a wide range of provisions for various offences, including 10 years in prison for destroying communal harmony or creating unrest or disorder.  Critics say the law is being widely misused to curb dissent and criticism of the government. The UK-based media watchdog, Article 19, says 312 people were prosecuted under the DSA in 2020. Of them, 70 were journalists. ""The use of the Digital Security Act has created a chilling effect on press freedom and civil society in Bangladesh,"" said Rory Mungoven, Asia-Pacific chief at the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has added a new dimension, with many people being arrested and charged under the DSA for comments published online that are critical of the government's response,"" Mr Mungoven told the BBC by email. The Bangladeshi government insists that the Digital Security Act is ""not an instrument for curbing dissent and criticism"".  ""It is a necessary piece of legislation which was enacted as a result of the rapid digitisation… The aim is to make the digital sphere as secure as the physical world,"" Shah Ali Farhad, special assistant to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, told the BBC.   Following intense criticism, Law Minister Anisul Huq recently said steps were being taken to ensure the law was not being abused and that no one could be arrested under it before an investigation had taken place.  Ms Hasina's Awami League has been in power continuously since 2008. She is credited with bringing stability to politically volatile Bangladesh, boosting economic growth and also for clamping down on religious extremism.  Under her leadership, the country's economy has grown at an average of 6-7% a year in the last 10 years.  Bangladesh has also emerged as the world's second biggest exporter of ready-made clothes, after China. It shipped about $34bn worth of clothes in 2019 before the pandemic struck. The sector employs about four million people, most of them women. Ms Hasina's supporters say the country's economic growth has helped to lift millions out of poverty and its record in primary education, health and social development is higher than some of its neighbours.  In the last two general elections (2014 and 2018) the Awami League won landslide victories. The main opposition alliance, which boycotted the 2014 vote, took part in the last one but alleged widespread vote-rigging and fraud. The 12 years of Awami League rule have also been marred by accusations of enforced disappearances, extra-judicial killings and the jailing of numerous critics and dissidents.  According to Dhaka-based rights organisation Odhikar there have been 587 cases of enforced disappearances since 2009 -  81 people were found dead and another 149 are still missing. Amnesty International says hundreds of people have died in extrajudicial killings since 2010. Security agencies like the Rapid Action Battalion are blamed for many of the unlawful deaths. ""In the last 10 years we have observed increasingly repressive tendencies from the authorities. Human rights, especially many of the civil and political rights of the people, have been seriously undermined,"" said Sultan Mohammed Zakaria, a South Asia researcher at Amnesty International. The Bangladeshi authorities strenuously deny all accusations of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. ""The government maintains zero tolerance policy to any form of extrajudicial activities by the law enforcement agencies,"" Shah Ali Farhad from the prime minister's office said.  Mr Shah also said some ""miscreants disguise themselves as security agencies to carry out abductions and killings"". But accusations that freedoms are being eroded have come back to haunt the government as it celebrates the 50th anniversary year of the country's independence from Pakistan on 26 March.  This month Bangladesh is also celebrating the birth centenary of its founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of Sheikh Hasina. Opposition leaders and activists argue that the country should be unified in marking such historic occasions, but political divisions run deep. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and other critics of the government say there is hardly any political space for them to function. They accuse the government of using strong-arm tactics to harass, intimidate and jail their supporters.  Kamal Hossain, who served as law and foreign minister under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman after independence in 1971, said the dominance of one political party is not good for democracy.  This current situation is ""not at all what he [Sheikh Mujibur Rahman] wanted"", Mr Hossain, now an opposition leader, told the BBC. ""Many positive steps could be taken to create an environment in which opposition politics is possible."" Some analysts point out that if democratic space is shrunk, then those opposed to the government could be pushed towards religious hardliners, who have a sizeable following in the Muslim-majority nation of more than 160 million, with unforeseen political consequences. Fifty years ago, few would have predicted a poor nation like Bangladesh would survive, let alone thrive, given its enormous challenges in the aftermath of a devastating independence war. Many faced the prospect of poverty and famine. But half a century later, despite numerous political setbacks, natural disasters and military coups, Bangladesh has proved many doubters wrong.  ""That is why we are concerned when there are trends to limit or curtail that democratic and civic space, which is a critical underpinning for sustainable development,"" Rory Mungoven, the UN official, pointed out."
economic indicators,Cold War 2: The Atlantic flank,2024-09-15,2022-03-12,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-60720696,"Ahoy there. We have a new national shipbuilding strategy. It's not much further down the slipway than the last one. Shipyard skills now get their own taskforce, and there is £206m to find ways of reducing shipping's poor record on emissions. Included in the new strategy is the promise of 150 ships and smaller boats over three decades, and more than £4bn already committed. These are Royal Navy orders, plus boats for the Border Force, lighthouse supply ships, and 38 ferries for Transport Scotland, plus the post-Brexit, export-promoting national flagship. It confirms what we knew about complex Type 26 frigates being built by BAE Systems on the Clyde and less complex Type 31 ones by Babcock at Rosyth in Fife. An order for another five of the Type 26 variety is yet to be finalised, while Poland has joined Indonesia in agreeing to buy the Type 31 design. The intention is to get naval shipbuilding into the top rank of productivity within eight years, and for efficiency to match the best European civil shipyards also by 2030. It has a long way to get there. The next Cal-Mac ferries are to be built in Turkey, with the current order well over double its budget and more than four years late at Ferguson's shipyard in Inverclyde. Royal Navy support ships will have a substantial foreign input. The shipbuilding strategy is part of the ""levelling up"" agenda, a political project as well as an economic one, to emphasise to the north of England and elsewhere that the UK government is spending money to boost industry and employment. It's so important that it requires a ""shipbuilding tsar"" - a title bestowed upon the Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace.                     But seeing this as a boost to the economy and jobs misses an important point. It looks less like an elephant in the room and more like a very angry bear. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its belligerent growling at Nato are bound to give the Ministry of Defence leverage for much more spending to raise Britain's military defences and readiness for war.  Yet the shipbuilding strategy makes no mention of Russia. And in the new circumstances, calling yourself a ""tsar"" seems a tad inappropriate. The Institute for Fiscal Studies notes that current plans make the Ministry of Defence the only major spending department to see a real terms budget cut in the next three years. It is inevitable that will be reversed, observes director Paul Johnson.  That's while there are many other pressures: with the NHS backlog, and to mitigate the acute pain coming the way of household budgets as inflation picks up pace, with both National Insurance and council tax on the way up. MPs have been asking Boris Johnson about boosting expenditure on defence. He has avoided giving any clear answers. Germany set the pace for a big lift in western defence spending soon after the invasion, with a stunning reversal of both its refusal to supply arms to foreign conflicts, and its arms budget. It is increasing its 50 billion euro annual defence budget by 50%, with a one-off boost of 100 billion. Other countries bordering Ukraine and Russia are also stepping up their defences, with ministers indicating that spending will go up in Denmark, Poland, Sweden and Italy. Britain and the US, already past the target of 2% of national output, are using existing resources to boost their presence on Nato's eastern border. So Vladimir Putin has succeeded where Donald Trump failed - pushing Nato's Europeans into a big uplift in defence expenditure, wary that the return of Trump or someone like him could mean that America's reliability against the Russian threat to its Nato neighbours comes back into doubt. Constanze Stelzenmuller, a German defence expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington, says that historic break with post-war doctrine is politically much easier for the new left-Green alliance in Berlin than it would have been for Angela Merkel. Even without a hot war breaking out, the sequel to Cold War One will require more of lots of hardware, as well as software, including cyber-warfare capacity that was not a feature in the last one. Just one indicator of the prospects for that is the rise in share prices for several of the West's biggest arms manufacturers. To take just four of the international firms that manufacture in Scotland, share prices since the start of the year are up 15% for Raytheon and 49% for France-based Thales. The US giant Lockheed Martin is up 25% and BAE Systems, which has Clyde shipyards and much else besides, is up 33%. So where will extra money be required? The disparity in land forces is striking. Military pundits point to Russian tanks vastly outnumbering those defending Nato's borders. That's not to say the tanks will work, or that they have the same role in modern warfare as the one envisaged in the first Cold War. Air superiority, if it can be established, leave them vulnerable, and Ukrainians seem to be doing a lot of damage with Belfast-made anti-tank missiles among others. Britain's contribution to the eastern defences may see more army spending, and the cost of replacing those anti-tank and other weapons that have been given to the Ukrainian armed forces. The Treasury provides the Ministry of Defence with a flexible fund for that, which flexed up to £4bn per year during the Afghan conflict, but is more often in the hundreds of millions. But if we're looking to Cold War 2 or worse, there is also a need to defend Nato's Atlantic flank, which was Britain's main role after 1945. That returns several Scottish military bases into the front line. Unst in Shetland has regained its listening post at RAF Saxa Vord. After years without maritime surveillance, that has returned to Lossiemouth. Russia has been probing UK airspace with military aircraft, if only to make the unsettling point that it can. An anonymous Royal Navy assessment of its naval fighting capacity, openly available online, sees its larger northern fleet as a mixture. There are ageing Cold War relics, including its one aircraft carrier, which audaciously belched its fumes through the English Channel a few years back. It has some more modern surface ships, but the assessment focuses more concern on Russia's modernised submarine fleet. Partly, that is because it poses a threat to the UK's nuclear-armed submarines, if they can be found out there in the Atlantic. But far more vulnerable are the seabed cables that cross the Atlantic and represent vital infrastructure for Nato members' economies.  Defending those cables has become one of the key tasks of Nato naval strategy. It also has to contend with the vulnerability of hundreds of oil and gas platforms in UK and Norwegian waters, and the pipelines that link them to the land. The Royal Navy has a key role in that.  A recent speech at Rosyth by the new First Sea Lord set out the case for this being a time for the Royal Navy to return to the forefront of Britain's military thinking. ""Having spent the last five years in the operational space and seen what Russia is doing, I say to my Russian counterparts we are watching you and we will match you. ""The Russian Navy itself has gone through a major recapitalisation programme in the last decade and a half. It's upgrading its frigates, its amphibious ships and its submarine force."" The plan is not to match Russia hull for hull, or to match China, which the admiral says is growing its naval force at ""an astonishing rate"", but to ""pack more punch - more lethality"" in the Navy's ability to project force. This is the Royal Navy's moment,says its chief, arguing 11 days before the Ukraine invasion that history feels like it is at an inflection point: ""The geopolitical tectonic plates are moving, as we shift from the large land centric campaigns of the last 20 years. It feels as if we are returning to a maritime era. Our government realises that."" The First Sea Lord will surely have read carefully a scathing assessment of the Royal Navy's many weaknesses, set out by MPs on Westminster's defence committee last December; procurement that goes off course and lessons not learned, a lack of fleet support ships, weapon systems being retired and not replaced, a failure to procure the communications necessary across the fleet, a limited ability to do much without allies, reliance on shipyards that are not fit for purpose, and new, high-end ships stuck in port because their propulsion systems don't work, and which won't be fixed until 2028 at the earliest. ""When ships do get to sea they act like porcupines - well defended herbivores with limited offensive capabilities,"" the MPs concluded. ""This is a result of decisions by successive governments to limit budgets and prioritise defensive capabilities. ""Over the next five years or so, at least until the new classes of surface escorts come on stream, the Royal Navy will be asked to do even more with even less. This is a clear risk, which those beyond these shores can calculate just as readily as we can."" At the Royal United Services Institute in London, Prof Malcolm Chalmers says: ""On the balance of investment, the Ministry of Defence would be well advised to examine very carefully what can be learned from this war in Ukraine: weaknesses to be exploited, strengths where we thought they had weaknesses, and then prioritise how best we deal with Russia. ""The UK will not fight Russia by itself, and it's important to think about how the UK can contribute to Nato."" The professor adds: ""What's happening in Germany is mind-blowing"". While Berlin's military planners are best placed to play the key role in stepping up defences on Nato's eastern land borders, he expects to hear calls in Britain for reversal of the recent decisions to cut army numbers. Yet Cold War 2, and the threat of a shooting war between Nato and Russia, is much more complex still. For years, Russia has been fighting a hybrid war, in which it uses various forms of non-military tactics to undermine its adversaries' capacity to retaliate. Interference in elections, and contributing actively to mistrust of mainstream media are among the more obvious.                                                            Dr Stelzenmuller says this has already gone beyond a second Cold War. That ended with the Ukraine invasion, she says. And fighting is no longer like a war game that can be planned by moving military hardware around the landscape.  ""We are seeing a massive focus on economic power, on weaponizing economic interdependence, in the form of sanctions and export controls,"" she says. It features cyber warfare, at which all sides can, and do, play dirty, and reach into every home and the basic infrastructure of adversaries' way of life, far from the military fronts.  It involves propaganda and disinformation to shape public opinion using methods that did not apply before. She also contrasts Cold War 1 and current hostilities with the ability of Russians to leave their country if they choose, for now. For Russia, that runs the risk of losing its intelligentsia and undermining its economic capacity for innovation. Leaving Russia may soon become much more difficult. The German defence analyst also sees a future confrontation in which the West can be disoriented by its adversaries by what is known as ""forum- and domain-hopping"", moving swiftly from physical to cyber warfare, or attacking in several places at once: a cyber attack in Romania, perhaps, a swift boat naval attack in the Baltic, and a terrorist outrage in Paris, orchestrated on consecutive days. What is also lacking compared with the first Cold War, she adds, is a safety net of treaties and trust-building measures - the infrastructure of de-escalation. These are the means by which warring nations can lower the heat, relieve pressure on civilians and ultimately achieve a ceasefire. Relationships were built up between military commanders on either side of the Cold War, to improve their understanding of each other. At Edinburgh University, Prof John Erickson played a significant role in brokering talks between them. Arms control treaties, which were hard-fought in the 1960s and 1970s, are no longer fit for purpose. Like an old submarine, they're rusting and of little use in a conflict. To Constanze Stelzenmuller, the role of the UK in Nato's military defences is not in doubt. What concerns her, post-Brexit and with her twin perspectives from both Washington and Berlin, is whether Britain can be counted as a politically stable and reliable partner."
economic indicators,Tough times 'may be ending' in Aberdeen,2024-09-15,2018-11-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-46319025,"The tough economic conditions Aberdeen has seen in recent years may be coming to an end, a property law firm has said.  Aberdein Considine indicated a recovery in the property market could be attributed to an improving economy. Property sales in Aberdeen have increased for the first time in nearly two years, with a rise of 7.9%. Prices in Aberdeen also appear to have stabilised, with the average home costing £199,834.  Jacqueline Law, managing partner at Aberdein Considine, welcomed the findings.  She said: ""The upturn in Aberdeen is great news after a prolonged difficult period, and is hopefully an indicator that we are beginning to see the north east emerge from one of its most testing downturns."" The stabilisation of property prices in Aberdeen suggests demand has also steadied.  Ms Law acknowledged that uncertainty around Brexit could have adverse effects on the property market, but she also recognised the potential for Aberdeen's local economy to mitigate some of the impact. She added: ""We can't ignore the ongoing turbulence in relation to Brexit, as well as the corresponding uncertainty this is causing to both businesses and homeowners.  ""That said, the return of a stable and prosperous oil and gas industry should hopefully provide some insulation against the challenges the country might face over the next few months and years."" In October it was predicted that the Aberdeen property market was set for an ""oil industry jobs boom"". Bob Fraser, a senior property partner at Aberdein Considine, has also attributed the current improvements seen in the property market to the oil and gas industry.  Speaking to BBC Scotland, he said: ""I think that there's stabilisation in the oil and gas industry to an extent, and we're beginning to see that feed into increased confidence in property consumers. ""I think it is primarily driven by that because it is such a major factor in the local economy."" Mr Fraser believes that there will not be a dramatic change in the property market, but instead a gradual increase carrying on into next year. However, he too recognises the uncertainty around the market as Brexit approaches.  He said: ""I would say that if it were not for the uncertainty over Brexit we would probably be seeing a much clearer picture in the local economy, so to a certain extent, the improvement in the Aberdeen area is being veiled by a slight uncertainty over Brexit."" But for Aberdeen, Mr Fraser predicted that growth in the local economy would have a far greater influence on the health of the housing market than the state of the national economy.  He added: ""We have seen many instances in Aberdeen where the local economy has be diametrically opposite to the UK economy."" "
economic indicators,The wheels could come off the car industry,2024-09-15,2020-04-07,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-52197819,"It shouldn't be any surprise that new car registrations plummeted last month.   As consumers lost confidence and pulled back on commitments to buy, and then as showrooms were forced to close, the number dropped by 44% across the UK, and by 49% in Scotland. That was a drop of more than 200,000 cars compared with March 2019.  In Scotland, the total nearly halved to 18,438. If that seems a lot, it's because March should be a very busy month for sales.  It's one of two months when new plates are introduced - in this case ""20"" - and that brings a peak. It's when dealers need to be very busy. Small van sales were down by even more, dropping 53% since last year - arguably a more sensitive indicator of economic health.  And having previously estimated that the number of new registrations might almost hold steady this year, at 1.7m vehicles, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders is estimating a full-year fall of 29% in 2020. That follows on some bumper years.  March 2017 saw more than twice as many UK registrations as last month.  It's not an industry that invites sympathy, so long as it's allowed to get on with doing what it does very well. But it was already facing a set of difficult challenges.  While geared to around half the market being diesel, and with Britain a big manufacturer of diesel car engines, that segment of the market has fallen precipitously due to polluting particulates, emissions scandals and growing restrictions on big engines through tax and urban low emission zones. The drop in new diesel registrations in March 2020 compared with March 2019 was 62%. That steep downward trend has been a feature of the market for years. Less than a fifth of new cars now are diesel. The range of alternatively-fuelled cars is expanding fast, from a low base.  Hybrid petrol cars saw a mild decline last month, while plug-ins and plug-in hybrid were the only categories on the rise. At nearly 12,000 across the UK, plug-in electric was close to reaching one in every 20 new cars last month, and that is expected to rise fast.  It's welcome in providing a greener future to the industry, but making the shift is a profound challenge to the industry to adjust, to get the right models to the market, and to have the right set of workshop skills to service them. And a pandemic in the midst of that is no help at all. It has meant Europe's auto industry finding, first, a struggle with supply chain disruption from Chinese factories that had not reopened after New Year.  Then they face disruption to their staffing, due to ill-health, followed by an enforced shutdown. And with unemployment expected to rise, possibly very sharply, that will mean less money available to buy big-ticket items. Will people turn to the used car market instead? That's not easy to say.  That market has also tanked, also because forecourts are closed. And if they're not shifting, that stock is costing business a lot of money. It's hard to price used cars until a number of factors become clearer in the new car market. To help stimulate the economy and help the sector in the last big crisis 11 years ago, Alistair Darling as Chancellor of the Exchequer poured public funds into a scrappage scheme - known in the US as ""cash for clunkers"".  With lots of dirty old diesel engines on the road, this could be a way of reducing emissions and helping the industry. But if it has a wish list for helpful government measures, it's more likely the car makers would choose a delay to Brexit and then a good deal to secure the least friction to trade. No, Brexit is not the top priority at the moment, but yes, it's still there, with negotiations curtailed to video-conferencing between UK and EU negotiating teams. April 6th brought a strongly-worded document from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (EAMA), pointing out that there's not much time left to strike a Brexit deal. Supply chains require one.  And with battery technology, they are set to become more integrated. Britain does not have its own significant battery-making capacity. Its car makers need to import, and they want to do so without hindrance. EAMA director general Erik-Mark Huitema says that, in a good year, €54bn of cars are traded between the EU and UK.  Within that trade are €14bn worth of parts crossing the North Sea and English Channel. ""The clock is ticking for these complex negotiations, and we are very concerned that the time remaining under the transitional arrangement is insufficient, especially given the ongoing Covid-19 crisis,"" he warned.  ""The unintended consequence of this could be a no-deal scenario. In terms of tariffs alone, this would have a massive impact, with some €6bn being added to the cost of doing cross-Channel trade. ""Such an outcome would be catastrophic to the automotive sector, and to the European economy in general. It should be avoided at all reasonable cost."""
economic indicators,House prices slip in May in subdued market,2024-09-15,2019-05-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48470957,"House prices in May fell 0.2% from April in what Nationwide building society described as a subdued market. The lender said ""uncertainty"" was likely to weigh on the market in the coming months.  Compared with a year earlier, house prices rose 0.6% - slower than the 0.9% rise the previous month.  Annual house price growth has been below 1% for six months in a row, according to data compiled by Nationwide. ""Survey data suggests that new buyer inquiries and consumer confidence have remained subdued in recent months,"" said Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide. ""Nevertheless, indicators of housing market activity, such as the number of property transactions and the number of mortgages approved for house purchase, have remained broadly stable. ""Housing market trends are likely to continue to mirror developments in the broader economy,"" he said. The number of first time buyers has continued to recover. According to Nationwide data there were 359,000 first-time buyers in the 12 months to March, just 10% below the 2006 peak. ""Even though house prices remain high relative to average incomes, the cost of servicing the typical mortgage as a share of take-home pay has remained close to or below long-run averages in most parts of the country,"" Mr Gardner said. The Nationwide said that almost half of first-time buyers had received help from friends and family to raise a deposit to buy a home. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that Brexit uncertainty was likely to have ""instilled some caution in buyers"".  But he also expects a ""modest"" improvement later in the year, as consumer confidence has been recovering and mortgage deals have been getting better for buyers with smaller deposits. Bank of England data also published on Friday showed that mortgage approvals reached a three-month high of 66,261 in April, after slipping to a 15-month low of 62,599 in March. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club of forecasters said: ""April's marked rise in mortgage approvals suggests that housing market activity may well have got at least some temporary support from the avoidance of a disruptive Brexit at the end of March"".  However, he said Brexit uncertainty could hamper the housing market later this year."
economic indicators,Business activity falls for first time in months,2024-09-15,2023-08-14,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-66475357,"Business activity in Northern Ireland's private sector fell for the first time in six months in July, according to a survey by Ulster Bank.  Every month the bank asks firms from across different parts of the economy about things like staffing levels, order books and exports. It is considered to be a reliable indicator of economic performance. The survey found the decrease in activity was caused by weak demand and the impact of inflation. New orders fell across all four sectors of the economy, with the biggest declines in construction and retail.  Despite this, companies continued to take on new staff, albeit at the slowest rate in six months. Ulster Bank's chief economist in Northern Ireland, Richard Ramsey, said: ""Just like the summer weather, business conditions took a turn for the worse in July.  ""The near-term outlook is for a further softening in demand with new orders declining for the second month running."" However, the survey suggested there had been some easing of the inflationary pressures that firms have been facing as well as an improvement in business sentiment about the outlook for the year ahead. Mr Ramsey added: ""While price pressures have hit demand in recent months, it is encouraging to note that inflationary pressures continue to moderate.  ""Business conditions may have taken a turn for the worse in July but sentiment amongst local firms for the year ahead has actually picked up.  ""The interest rate outlook has improved slightly but the dark cloud of no Stormont Executive looks set to remain anchored over the economy for the foreseeable future."" Northern Ireland has been without a functioning executive since February 2022 as part of the Democratic Unionist Party's protest against post-Brexit trading arrangements. ""Whether the new rise in optimism is well founded or misplaced - time will tell,"" Mr Ramsey added.    "
economic indicators,Lockdown traffic 'at early 1970s levels',2024-09-15,2020-05-04,By Justin Parkinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52461913,"The traffic on Britain's roads has started creeping back up during the past couple of weeks, but - as you may have noticed when out shopping, exercising or going to work - they're still a lot quieter than before the lockdown. The government says road trips in motorised vehicles, recorded at 275 automated sites, are now at around 35% to 45% of the usual level. AA president Edmund King has told the BBC that - based on analysis of the official figures and his organisation's own monitoring - traffic volumes in Britain are now ""akin to those in the early 1970s"". It was a time the Morris Marina and Ford Cortina were among the UK's best-selling cars. Edward Heath was prime minister, the UK joined the European Economic Community, money went fully decimal, David Bowie rebranded himself as Ziggy Stardust and almost half of all adults smoked - many while at the wheel. The world has changed, but does this temporary situation on the roads offer a glimpse of how it was to drive back then? ""It was a very different era,"" says Giles Chapman, author of Cars We Loved in the 1970s. ""It was one when car ownership was still being encouraged and, far more than our own, was associated with freedom."" One reason was that there were so many fewer of them. As of September last year, the most recent available figures, 38.9 million vehicles were licensed for use on Britain's roads. In 1970 the number was just over a third of that, at 13.5 million. Britain's roads have expanded more slowly. In 2018 they measured 246,700 miles in total - up less than a quarter from 203,400 in 1970. Part of 1970s driving folklore is that one could pull up in any high street, get out, shop, visit the cinema or have a meal. ""There's some truth in that,"" says Mr Chapman. ""That was in many ways still the golden age of parking. Councils were better funded and didn't think of it as a way of raising cash, and there was no clamping."" This aspect of 1970s driving won't be replicated during the coronavirus crisis, however, with so many more cars on the roads today. In fact, travel restrictions mean a greater proportion will be stationary, meaning parking near home could be more difficult than usual. At least, though, if you wind the windows down (easier now, with electronics involved), the air is likely to be cleaner than in the 1970s. Today's more efficient, lower-emitting vehicles, no longer using leaded petrol, are ""cleaner, greener and much safer"", says the AA's Mr King. But perhaps the biggest change over the decades has been the improvement in safety. The number of deaths recorded on British speed bump-free and CCTV-less roads in 1970 was 7,499 - more than four times greater than in 2018. ""In 2018 the risk of fatality per motor vehicle mile was about one-tenth that during the 1970s,"" says Benjamin Heydecker, professor of transport studies at University College London. ""This is usually ascribed to the combined beneficial efforts in engineering, education and enforcement."" Since the 1970s, seatbelts have been compulsory, while cars have been redesigned to reduce the impact of crashes for those on board and for pedestrians. Nowadays drink driving is a huge taboo. ""You shudder now when you think of dads who left their kids in the car outside the pub in the 1970s with a packet of crisps and a bottle of cola, while they stayed inside and had a couple of pints, "" says Mr Chapman. MOTs - showing a vehicle's roadworthiness - started in 1960, but until 1977 did not include checks on windscreen wipers, indicators, exhaust systems, body structure and chassis. Before that they were ""pretty cursory"" and ""really just about whether the brakes worked"", Mr Chapman says. ""Some of the reduction in deaths will be due to a greater proportion of travel on motorway roads, which are less hazardous per vehicle mile of travel,"" adds Prof Heydecker. As the lockdown eases, the traffic on Britain's roads is likely to continue growing, taking us, through stages, to volumes seen in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. But, at least for a bit, it's easier to get from A to B - when we're allowed out."
economic indicators,Fears for democracy as buoyant Bangladesh turns 50,2024-09-15,2021-03-24,By Anbarasan Ethirajan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56433279,"Bangladesh is held up by many as a model of development, but as it marks 50 years of independence critics say it risks becoming a one-party state intolerant of dissent, threatening the democratic principles on which it was founded. When cartoonist Ahmed Kabir Kishore was brought to a court in Dhaka last month, his brother was shocked to see how weak and traumatised he looked. Mr Kishore told his brother Ahsan that he had been tortured in detention after a group of unidentified men forcibly took him from his residence at the height of the coronavirus pandemic last May. His alleged crime - posting satirical cartoons and comments on Facebook criticising the health system before the outbreak and the government's response to the pandemic.  His family had no information on the 45-year-old for several days after he was picked up. Then they heard that he had been arrested on charges of involvement in anti-state activities and spreading ""rumours"".  Mr Kishore was denied bail six times by the courts. When it was finally granted, the cartoonist had already spent 10 months in jail under a notorious law, the Digital Security Act (DSA).  His family could not visit him in jail due to coronavirus restrictions. The identity of the men who took him away is still not clear and it's also a mystery how he finally ended up at a police station in the capital. ""My brother's left ear has been severely damaged and he's struggling to walk. Doctors say he needs surgery on his right ear,"" Ahsan Kabir told the BBC.   Despite all this, Mr Kishore is thankful that he is at least alive. Mushtaq Ahmed, a writer arrested in the same case last year, was less fortunate.  He died in prison a week before Mr Kishore was granted bail.  His death triggered widespread outrage and protests. Activists have demanded the government repeal the law, which they describe as draconian. Officials insist there was nothing suspicious in Mr Ahmed's death.  There have been other abductions too.  Photojournalist Shafiqul Islam Kajol was forced into a van by a group of unidentified men in Dhaka last March. His family had no information on him for the next 53 days before he was found hundreds of kilometres away along the border with India, blindfolded and tied. Then he spent the next seven months in prison charged under the DSA with sharing objectionable, defamatory and fake information about politicians from the governing Awami League party on Facebook.  Mr Kajol was finally released on bail in late December.  The DSA, passed despite objections from editors and civil society activists in October 2018, has a wide range of provisions for various offences, including 10 years in prison for destroying communal harmony or creating unrest or disorder.  Critics say the law is being widely misused to curb dissent and criticism of the government. The UK-based media watchdog, Article 19, says 312 people were prosecuted under the DSA in 2020. Of them, 70 were journalists. ""The use of the Digital Security Act has created a chilling effect on press freedom and civil society in Bangladesh,"" said Rory Mungoven, Asia-Pacific chief at the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has added a new dimension, with many people being arrested and charged under the DSA for comments published online that are critical of the government's response,"" Mr Mungoven told the BBC by email. The Bangladeshi government insists that the Digital Security Act is ""not an instrument for curbing dissent and criticism"".  ""It is a necessary piece of legislation which was enacted as a result of the rapid digitisation… The aim is to make the digital sphere as secure as the physical world,"" Shah Ali Farhad, special assistant to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, told the BBC.   Following intense criticism, Law Minister Anisul Huq recently said steps were being taken to ensure the law was not being abused and that no one could be arrested under it before an investigation had taken place.  Ms Hasina's Awami League has been in power continuously since 2008. She is credited with bringing stability to politically volatile Bangladesh, boosting economic growth and also for clamping down on religious extremism.  Under her leadership, the country's economy has grown at an average of 6-7% a year in the last 10 years.  Bangladesh has also emerged as the world's second biggest exporter of ready-made clothes, after China. It shipped about $34bn worth of clothes in 2019 before the pandemic struck. The sector employs about four million people, most of them women. Ms Hasina's supporters say the country's economic growth has helped to lift millions out of poverty and its record in primary education, health and social development is higher than some of its neighbours.  In the last two general elections (2014 and 2018) the Awami League won landslide victories. The main opposition alliance, which boycotted the 2014 vote, took part in the last one but alleged widespread vote-rigging and fraud. The 12 years of Awami League rule have also been marred by accusations of enforced disappearances, extra-judicial killings and the jailing of numerous critics and dissidents.  According to Dhaka-based rights organisation Odhikar there have been 587 cases of enforced disappearances since 2009 -  81 people were found dead and another 149 are still missing. Amnesty International says hundreds of people have died in extrajudicial killings since 2010. Security agencies like the Rapid Action Battalion are blamed for many of the unlawful deaths. ""In the last 10 years we have observed increasingly repressive tendencies from the authorities. Human rights, especially many of the civil and political rights of the people, have been seriously undermined,"" said Sultan Mohammed Zakaria, a South Asia researcher at Amnesty International. The Bangladeshi authorities strenuously deny all accusations of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. ""The government maintains zero tolerance policy to any form of extrajudicial activities by the law enforcement agencies,"" Shah Ali Farhad from the prime minister's office said.  Mr Shah also said some ""miscreants disguise themselves as security agencies to carry out abductions and killings"". But accusations that freedoms are being eroded have come back to haunt the government as it celebrates the 50th anniversary year of the country's independence from Pakistan on 26 March.  This month Bangladesh is also celebrating the birth centenary of its founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of Sheikh Hasina. Opposition leaders and activists argue that the country should be unified in marking such historic occasions, but political divisions run deep. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and other critics of the government say there is hardly any political space for them to function. They accuse the government of using strong-arm tactics to harass, intimidate and jail their supporters.  Kamal Hossain, who served as law and foreign minister under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman after independence in 1971, said the dominance of one political party is not good for democracy.  This current situation is ""not at all what he [Sheikh Mujibur Rahman] wanted"", Mr Hossain, now an opposition leader, told the BBC. ""Many positive steps could be taken to create an environment in which opposition politics is possible."" Some analysts point out that if democratic space is shrunk, then those opposed to the government could be pushed towards religious hardliners, who have a sizeable following in the Muslim-majority nation of more than 160 million, with unforeseen political consequences. Fifty years ago, few would have predicted a poor nation like Bangladesh would survive, let alone thrive, given its enormous challenges in the aftermath of a devastating independence war. Many faced the prospect of poverty and famine. But half a century later, despite numerous political setbacks, natural disasters and military coups, Bangladesh has proved many doubters wrong.  ""That is why we are concerned when there are trends to limit or curtail that democratic and civic space, which is a critical underpinning for sustainable development,"" Rory Mungoven, the UN official, pointed out."
economic indicators,The surprise is that more jobs haven't gone,2024-09-15,2020-08-11,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-53743154,"Unemployment up: employment down: with fewer job opportunities, fewer people making themselves available for work. So, there are no surprises in the labour market figures for April, May and June - the most severe months of lockdown, with some easing in June. However, it is a little surprising that the figures have not shifted more.  An unemployment rate of 4.5% remains low, given the extraordinary economic events since March. The UK rate, of 3.9%, is the same as last year. It seems the Labour Force Survey, which results in the normal headline employment statistics, is failing to capture those events, mainly because those on furlough are not counted as unemployed. Partly, that is because many will return to work when it is there for them to do, and partly because the scheme is delaying unemployment for others. The more significant measure of change is in UK-wide figures for the numbers on PAYE payroll tax, down by 730,000 between March and July. That only covers employed people. Self-employed workers are harder to measure, and the income support scheme has not been as effective. IPSE, the independent workers association, says the average freelance worker went 5.5 weeks out of 13 without any work, and income fell by 25% between the first and the second quarters of the year. There are clear indications that some have seen demand for their work fall away so far that they are back in the jobs market. A measure of those claiming unemployment benefits shows a rise of 102% in the past year, to 222,300 in Scotland. Across the UK, the rise is 117%, to 2.7m. There has been a significant shift, for the first time, in the number of those who were unemployed and then stopped looking for work. And the number of weekly hours worked, across the UK, has fallen by nearly 20%, with the biggest fall in the category of accommodation and food services. Those are the numbers that feel more like the reality facing people over the past few months of crisis, lockdown and stoppage for a large chunk of the economy."
economic indicators,The green trade row dividing the Davos elite,2024-09-15,2023-01-16,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64296229,"There has been a change of climate in the Alps this winter, and it's not just that the snow has finally fallen after an unseasonably warm December.  Chief executives and government ministers from around the globe are gathering for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, where for the last three years the focus has very much been on how to tackle the huge series of shocks that has hit the world economy.  From the wet market of Wuhan, to the Kremlin's crazed calculations, pandemic and war have conditioned a path of record inflation and surging debts, with a third of the world expected to be in recession this year. But there is some light at the end of the tunnel. And however distant a ski resort full of global leaders may sound, WEF is the sort of place where you get a sense as to whether a three-year storm may start to subside. There are some signs that the first indicators of surging inflation in the world economy are now beginning to normalise. Supply chains for the parts and ingredients that make the products we buy have been repaired after getting gummed up during the pandemic.  For example, Elon Musk's company Tesla attributed its decision to slash the prices of its electric cars last week to this shift. Shipping costs are tumbling. And China's ""great reopening"" after the pandemic - the end of strict zero-Covid lockdowns and restrictions - should, in theory, help the world economy, although the health costs of widespread infections might be so profound that it does not. Around the world it seems that inflation, while high, has peaked. Incredibly, much of Europe has managed to end its dependence on Russian gas within the space of a year, constructing temporary terminals to process shipped liquid gas so it doesn't have to rely on pipelines from Siberia.  However, there are also newer tensions emerging, raising questions about how far inflation will eventually fall, and some concern about where Britain sits in a much changed world. The big shadow here is the threat of a transatlantic green trade war. Joe Biden's new legislation to boost America's green economy includes £300bn of subsidies for the purchase of electric cars, but only if they are mainly manufactured in North America. The Inflation Reduction Act also affects a swathe of other manufacturing and production and is persuading some European companies to relocate factories to the US. Even fertiliser companies are having their heads turned and wondering why European leaders aren't bringing in similar laws. The US suggests its new legislation is aimed at competing with China. But EU leaders are furious and about to respond, potentially with significant subsidies of their own, presumably also containing ""Buy European"" clauses.  If the three major trade blocks try to out-subsidise each other, what should ""global Britain"" do? The ""globe"" that Britain tried to ""re-engage"" with after Boris Johnson's post-Brexit break with Europe's single market is really rather different now.  Would EU ""buy European"" strictures include the UK? The government has expressed some concerns in a letter to the White House, but it is unclear what Britain's strategy is, or if there is one. It isn't just about low carbon manufacturing either. Similar dynamics - an attempted US-EU carve-up - are also apparent in the recent drive to re-shore production of microchips from east Asia. This new divided Davos backdrop to the global economy could have profound consequences for how much things cost, and where they are made. It is a precise reversal of the consensus seen at the World Economic Forum for decades. Things are very much up for grabs here. And lastly, many corporate leaders seem to have spent their Christmases being shocked by the cost-saving potential of the new artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT 3. There is a school of thought that the next iteration of this technology from OpenAI - ChatGPT 4 - could be so impactful as to cause a global economic shock. It will be a quantum leap for technology, but at the expense of making millions of existing jobs redundant.  With war in Europe, China reopening, and a long anticipated technological revolution occurring, policy and investment decisions will be made at Davos this week that could change the direction of the world economy, and so impact us all profoundly."
economic indicators,Why south India outperforms the north,2024-09-15,2022-09-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-62951951,"Data shows that southern Indian states continue to outperform the rest of the country in health, education and economic opportunities. But what are the consequences of this phenomenon? Nilakantan R, a data scientist, finds out.  Consider a child born in India.  Firstly, this child is far less likely to be born in southern India than in northern India, given the former's lower rates of population growth.  But let's assume she is. In which case, she is far less likely to die in the first year of her life given the lower infant mortality rates in south India compared with the rest of the country.  She is more likely to get vaccinated, less likely to lose her mother during childbirth, more likely to have access to child services and receive better early childhood nutrition.  She is also more likely to celebrate her fifth birthday, find a hospital or a doctor in case she falls sick and eventually live a slightly longer life.  She will go to school and stay in school longer - she will more likely go to college as well. She is less likely to be involved in agriculture for economic sustenance and more likely to find work that pays her more.  She will also go on to be a mother to fewer children, who in turn will be healthier and more educated than her. And she'll also have greater political representation and more impact on elections as a voter. In short, a median child born in southern India will live a healthier, wealthier, more secure and a more socially impactful life compared with a child born in northern India. In many of these indicators of health, education and economic opportunities, the difference between the south and the north is as stark as that between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. But that hasn't always been the case.  At the time of India's independence in 1947, the four southern states - Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh which constituted about a quarter of India's population - were mostly in the middle or bottom in terms of development. (A fifth state of Telangana was formed in 2014 - three years after the last census - by bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh.) But the southern states started to diverge positively compared with the rest of India in the 1980s - a trend which has accelerated ever since.  There is no one answer to why this happened though.  Each of the southern states has its own particular story, but in essence, the progress was achieved by the innovative policies of individual states.  Some of those worked. Some failed. And many were fiscally profligate. But the states, many believe, have acted as laboratories of democracy, as they were intended to. A prime example of this is the mid-day meal scheme - feeding students a free lunch at government schools - which began in Tamil Nadu.  The scheme ended up increasing school admissions in Tamil Nadu - the state today boasts of the highest school enrolment gains in the country.  In neighbouring Kerala, scholars such as Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen have attributed advances in health and education to a combination of political mobilisation and to the state's syncretic culture. Others such as Prerna Singh, a political scientist, have cited subnationalism - the strong regional identity of the state - as another possible reason. But the southern states' success has also led to a special problem.  The four states have a smaller population than their northern counterparts, having seen lower population growth for a generation now.  While their prosperity leads them to being taxed more - on a per-capita basis because they are less populous - they are given a relatively smaller share in the central transfer of taxes where the amount allocated is dependent on the population. Thus, they see themselves as being punished for their success. Many believe that this has been made worse by recent tax reforms.  In the past, all states would raise revenues through indirect taxes which gave them the financial freedom to make their own policies - such as the mid-day meal scheme in Tamil Nadu. But with the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), designed to unify the country into a single market, the states say they have little leeway to raise their own finances and are increasingly dependent on federal transfers.  As the Finance Minister of Tamil Nadu, P Thiaga Rajan said recently, ""If you remove all variables of taxation away from the states and put them under the GST bucket, where are states to determine their revenue policy? You've effectively turned states into municipalities."" This has made the relations between the central government and the south tense.  In 2020, for example, after a particularly prolonged political battle between Delhi and the states on the GST, the federal government agreed to pay the states what it lawfully owed them only after some state governments threatened to sue.  Earlier this year, there was a tussle between states and the central government about lowering fuel prices, with the latter demanding that the states do so - and many of the southern states pushing back.  It's a problem with no easy solutions.  On the one hand there are people in Uttar Pradesh who want to be treated just like a citizen in Tamil Nadu in terms of government services and welfare schemes. But on the other hand, there are citizens of Tamil Nadu who end up sending more money over to states such as Uttar Pradesh than spending on themselves via the complicated tax system.  That's not all - relations between the south and the central government could get more fraught in the future as the country gears up for another round of delimitation in 2026.  The exercise - which was last done in 1976 - refers to redrawing the boundaries of electoral seats to represent changes in population over time. This means that along with revenue loss and lack of freedom to make their own policies, the prosperous south may have fewer seats in parliament in the future.

economic indicators,'Little indication' of much extra funding for NI,2024-09-15,2021-10-25,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-59034367,"NI's finance minister has played down expectations of significant extra money as a result of the UK spending review. The chancellor's announcement on Wednesday will set the executive's spending limits for three years. Conor Murphy said a multiyear budget ""provides an opportunity to better plan and prioritise finances."" He said there was ""little indication"" that the government would ""provide the investment needed to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery"". The amount of money available to Stormont and the other devolved administrations is set by the Barnett formula. It is a population-based share of additional funding announced for England. On Sunday Chancellor Rishi Sunak said ""strong investment in public services"" would be at the heart of his plans for rebuilding the economy. He said: ""One of the elements of building a stronger economy is having strong public services, and you will see that next week - whether it's the NHS, which we've already taken steps to support significantly to recover from coronavirus, children, schools, skills, all of these things, policing and crime."" Asked if he would raise public sector wages in line with inflation, the chancellor said: ""That will be one of the things we talk about. ""Over the past year, we took a decision to have a more targeted approach to public sector pay,"" he continued, but added: ""Going forward we'll have to set a new pay policy and that'll be a topic for next week's spending review."" Writing in the Irish News, Conor Murphy expressed scepticism about what the chancellor would deliver and again called on the executive to prioritise health spending on Stormont's budget. He said: ""While the indications are that the spending review outcome will not be good for the executive, a collective approach can produce a budget that finally brings down waiting lists on a sustainable basis."" Mr Murphy also said that increasing domestic rates, a locally controlled property tax, would not give Stormont much extra spending power. ""I would caution that a 1% increase in domestic rates generates less than £3m,"" he said. ""To put that into context, a 22% increase in domestic rates would be needed to pay for a 1% increase in the health budget."""
economic indicators,'We realised that by joining together we could make a difference',2024-09-15,2021-04-14,By Katherine Latham,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56723182,"It is said that strength comes in numbers, and that is what award-winning food producer Angharad Underwood found during the pandemic. When Covid-19 hit last year, Ms Underwood was faced with having to temporarily close her business, The Preservation Society. Based in the Welsh town of Chepstow, right beside the English border in south east Wales, she makes jams, chutneys and other preserves. With other local food producers in the same precarious position, 25 of them decided that instead of shutting up shop, they would pool their resources and join together. So in May 2020 they formed the Wye Valley Producers cooperative. ""It's likely that many of us would have furloughed for the duration otherwise,"" says Ms Underwood. ""Instead, we had people to lean on - guidance, encouragement and ideas. We realised that by joining together we could make a difference."" With other members including a cider-producer, butcher, coffee-roaster and two breweries, they now have a website where people can order from all the firms. Customers then collect everything in one go from a weekly drive-through market. As mentioned, Wye Valley was set up as a cooperative. But what exactly is that? Put simply, it is a business that is owned by its members and democratically run.  It could be, as in the case of Wye Valley, a group of small firms that come together. Or it may be a collective of self-employed workers who run a single business, or even a larger retailer - such as the Co-Op supermarket chain - whose members include millions of its customers who have signed up.  The common factor is that there aren't any external shareholders, and profits are either reinvested, or shared among the members. It all sounds a bit old-fashioned, and the co-operative movement was indeed founded in the 19th Century. But there are today more than 7,000 co-operatives in the UK, and a whopping three million around the world. Many, both within the UK and elsewhere, say that being a co-operative has made them more resilient to the pandemic than if they had been stand-alone, standard businesses. At Wye Valley Producers, Ms Underwood says members spend many hours on Zoom calls, helping each other: ""It isn't just about the money, but sharing skills and knowledge, with people in the same boat.""  The International Co-operative Alliance (ICA), the global organisation that represents the movement, says that this increased coming together in response to Covid-19 has been replicated around the world. ""Online meetings and webinars were organised by cooperatives across the world,"" says ICA director of legislation Santosh Kumar. ""The international exchange of practices and resources has been widespread."" In Southampton, cooperative shop October Books has been trading since 1977. In addition to books it sells vegan food, vegetables and ethical cleaning products. ""At the start of the pandemic there were feelings of anxiety and uncertainty, of not being sure what to do,"" says staff member Clare Diaper. October Books says that thanks to support and advice from Cooperatives UK, the organisation that represents the movement in the UK, it had the knowledge and confidence to adapt to the new situation.  ""Being a cooperative meant we could have difficult conversations about what was best for the shop as a team,"" says Ms Diaper. October Books and its 103 members decided to keep the shop open, but temporarily furlough four of the eight permanent staff. ""The decisions to furlough workers and reduce opening hours were made collectively,"" adds Ms Diaper. Across Europe in Croatia, women-led cooperative Brlog Brewery has been making a range of beers since 2016. ""When the pandemic hit, first we were in shock because we had made a lot of beer,"" says co-founder Ana Teskera. ""Suddenly, it was all stuck at the warehouse. There was potential that we would [lose it] and wouldn't get paid for the goods already sold."" The brewery's six directors, and 90 cooperative members, who include volunteers and customers, came up with a plan - they would shift from selling to bars and shops. ""[Instead] we sold most of the beer through the coop network, distributing direct to members, and even had to produce more,"" says Ms Teskera. It was so successful that last summer the brewery, based in the coastal city of Zadar, moved to a bigger facility.  ""We learned a lot, made great changes, kept all our employees - even added a new one,"" says Ms Teskera. ""The team is more connected now, strong and happy to go forward."" New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast. In India, an organisation called the Self-Employed Women's Association (Sewa) has helped female workers form cooperatives since 1972. Now with more than 1.8 million members, Sewa offers them advice and support on everything from business finance to expansion and marketing. ""The pandemic has been a double whammy for our members,"" says Sewa senior coordinator Salonie Muralidhara Hiriyur. ""It has disrupted health and livelihoods on a massive scale. Some sectors of work, like domestic work and childcare, came to a complete halt."" To help its members find new income opportunities during the pandemic, Sewa ran training classes via WhatsApp video calls, including one on how to manufacture face masks. Rehat Rangrez, a member of a handicrafts cooperative called Abodana Mandali, took part. ""I then started training other women in the cooperative on how to make masks too - all on video calls,"" she says. She and her ""fellow cooperative sisters"" went on to make 20,000 masks in just three months.  Because of this work, Ms Rangrez had enough income to support her family. Gabriel Burdin, associate professor in economics at Leeds University, says that cooperatives generally cut jobs a lot less. ""In conventional business, layoffs are the most frequent cost-cutting strategy,"" he says. ""Cooperatives adjust along other margins, such as pay cuts or work-sharing arrangements. Cooperatives share the consequences of a crisis among their members."" However, Prof Burdin also cautions that cooperatives do come with their own risks, especially those where the members and owners are the workers. He says that such people are in the position where they invest their own money in the business that they also work for, and are paid by. So if the business fails, they lose both their wages and any money they have invested. ""By providing labour and capital to the same company, they are putting all their eggs in one basket,"" says Prof Burdin. Looking ahead, Cooperatives UK is now continuing to gather evidence for its 2021 Coop Economy Report into the sector. It says early indications show new cooperatives are still being formed and fewer have closed than in previous years. ""[And] we know that before the pandemic, new start coops were nearly twice as likely to survive their first five years than other types of businesses,"" says Cooperatives UK chief executive Rose Marley. Back in south east Wales, Ms Underwood says that Wye Valley Producers - which has members from both sides of the border - is now considering a delivery service: ""And we can't wait to do events and courses, we have some great ideas up our sleeve."""
economic indicators,India's digital sprint is leaving millions behind,2024-09-15,2019-10-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49085846,"India has more than 630 million internet subscribers. But for every Indian who has access to the internet, there is at least one who does not and that person is most likely living in a rural area. Smriti Parsheera writes on the country's continuing digital divide. There is an exuberance around India's digital story.  The country is home to the world's second-largest internet user base, consisting of more than 630 million subscribers. That is more than the total population of the US, the United Kingdom, Russia and South Africa put together.  It also has the cheapest mobile data prices, which has allowed a large population to use the internet just in the last four years. Besides the size of the pie, data consumption is also on the rise.  The average internet user now consumes more than 9GB of data per month. That translates to watching 16 hours of video a month compared to just 15 minutes in 2015.   Other positive trends include a competitive e-commerce market, a booming video streaming industry and a choice of affordable devices.  At the government's end, electronic governance, mobile health and digital finance are at the heart of many policy discussions. All of this excitement is, however, surrounded by the sobering reality of India's continuing digital divide.  This refers to the gap between those who have access to the internet and other digital technologies and those who do not.  The divide is shaped both by the availability of internet services in different regions and the ability of individuals to tap into those services. A person's location, income, gender, education, language, and age are some of the factors that define their access. As per data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, the country has an internet density of 48.4. This represents the number of internet subscribers per 100 people in the population. Even though 66% of the country's population lives in its villages, rural internet density is just 25.3. In comparison, urban areas have a significantly higher density of 97.9.  This means that for every Indian who has access to the internet, there is at least one who does not and that person is most likely living in a rural area. We see stark variations in the access levels across the country's 28 states and nine union territories. States like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in the north and Orissa in the east are known to perform poorly on human development indicators, and they also fare badly in internet use density. The availability of internet infrastructure is also affected by geographic conditions.  For instance, the remote mountainous areas of Himachal Pradesh, sparsely populated deserts of Rajasthan and dense forests in Madhya Pradesh face greater digital exclusion. It so happens that many of these remote locations are also home to India's tribal and marginalised communities. Poor connectivity can therefore unwittingly end up perpetuating existing disadvantages. Gender is another important factor that shapes digital access. Only 16% of Indian women were found to be using mobile and internet services, a 2019 report from the GSMA, a body which represents mobile operators, said. On a comparative scale, women were 56% less likely to use mobile internet than men. This situation stems from a mix of economic, social and cultural factors placed against the backdrop of a deeply patriarchal setup. On the economic front, while data access charges have gone down drastically, the cost of internet-enabled handsets is still a barrier for many households.  The financial dependence of women and their lower position in the household pecking order naturally reduces the likelihood of them owning such devices. Besides ownership, lower literacy rates and digital awareness among women are some of the other limitations. Many of these factors also contribute to reduced access among the elderly population. Digital empowerment is known to create greater awareness and independence, which may be perceived by some as a threat to the established social order.  This thinking has manifested itself in several reports about some village-level community bodies imposing restrictions on the use of mobile phones and social media by women, particularly younger women. Finally, when it comes to the educated classes, the issue shifts from that of basic access to the chronic under-representation of women in various ways. From online spaces to research labs to meeting rooms, India mirrors the global trend of digital technologies continuing to remain the primary domain of men.  The Indian government has not been immune to these problems. One of its flagship programmes, the Digital India project, identifies universal access to mobile connectivity as one of its main pillars.  The government is trying to achieve this by providing broadband connectivity to the country's 250,000 village councils. This project has been in effect from 2011 but so far a little less than half of that target has been achieved. The number of locations where the completion of the work has led to functional internet is even lower. The government's National Digital Communications Policy acknowledges that much more effort is needed on this front.  It speaks about the need to bring connectivity to all under served areas and identifies specific groups, like marginalised communities, women and persons with disabilities that merit specific attention. The policy also lays emphasis on solving last-mile connectivity issues in both urban and rural areas, through the use of public Wi-Fi infrastructure. The policy discourse is clearly moving in the right direction.  From broad claims about the need for universal access, it has evolved to recognise some specific factors, like location, gender, and marginalisation, that shape the digital divide.  What India needs next is for policymakers to undertake a rigorous data-driven exercise to measure which factors are causing what level of exclusion and the reasons behind it. Only when we fully understand the beast of India's digital divide can we design targeted solutions to tame it. Smriti Parsheera is a Delhi-based technology policy researcher"
economic indicators,Argentine leader Macri trounced in primary vote,2024-09-15,2019-08-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-49317750,"Conservative Argentine President Mauricio Macri suffered a resounding defeat in primary elections on Sunday. The primary, in which presidential candidates from all parties take part, was won by his left-wing rival, Alberto Fernández. Mr Macri, whose austerity measures have turned many voters against him, is hoping to win a second term in office in the presidential poll on 27 October. But analysts say his chances of beating Mr Fernández now look very slim. Voting in the primaries is compulsory and is not restricted to party members but open to all those eligible to cast their ballot in the presidential polls. Whoever wins is therefore seen as a favourite for the presidential polls on 27 October. The primaries were introduced in 2009 to cut down on the number of candidates running in the presidential elections with contenders having to win a minimum of 1.5% to be eligible to stand for the presidency. With more than 95% of votes counted, the coalition backing Mr Fernández had 47.7% of the votes and that supporting President Macri had 32.1%. Third was centrist former economy minister Roberto Lavagna with 8.2%. The remaining candidates all had less than 3%.  The result is seen as a rejection by voters of the harsh austerity measures introduced by President Macri in an effort to stabilise Argentina's battered economy. Argentina is in a recession and has one of the highest inflation rates in the world. The local currency, the peso, lost half of its value against the dollar last year. While inflation has come down in recent months from a high of 57.3% in May, this seems not to have translated in support for President Macri's policies.  If Mr Fernández were to get the same percentage or more of votes in the presidential election on 27 October, he would win it outright, without the need for a second round. Under Argentine election rules, if a candidate wins at least 45% of the vote or gains 40% with a 10-percentage-point lead, that candidate is declared the outright winner. If there is no outright winner, a second round will be held on 24 November pitting the top two candidates against each other.  The 60-year-old lawyer is a member of the main opposition coalition, Frente de Todos.  His candidacy for the presidency came as somewhat of a surprise as former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner - to whom he is not related - had been widely tipped to be the opposition coalition's candidate for the top office. But in May she announced in a video posted on social media that she had ""asked Alberto Fernandez to lead a team that includes both of us, him as the presidential candidate and me as candidate for the vice position"". While Mr Fernández served as cabinet chief both under Ms Fernández and her husband and predecessor in office, Néstor Kirchner, he does not have the same name recognition as his more famous running mate.  Mr Fernández's relations with his running mate have been rocky in the past. After leaving her administration in 2008. Mr Fernández became a vocal critic of his former boss but he later dismissed their disagreements as ""what happens to many Argentines, that you fight among friends because you disagree over politics"". Mr Fernández celebrated his success by stressing his commitment to change. ""We are confident that Argentina needed to end with this chapter and start another page. I am confident that today Argentines have started to write another story,"" he said after the results were announced. President Macri said that he ""recognised"" that he had had a ""bad election"" and that he would ""redouble"" his efforts to gain the support he needs to win the presidential election in October.  Argentine markets reacted with predictable dismay to the news that the country is likely to be in for a change of political direction. In early trading, Argentina's main Merval stock index fell 10%, while the peso slumped 25% against the dollar. Investors fear the return to power of Ms Fernández de Kirchner, who presided over an administration remembered for a high degree of protectionism and heavy-handed state intervention in the economy. Edward Glossop, Latin America economist at Capital Economics, said Mr Macri's government would probably pull out all the stops to try to shore up popular support. This could include easing the pace of economic austerity imposed as part of Argentina's agreement with the International Monetary Fund. ""An outright loosening of the purse strings is possible. The IMF would probably turn a blind eye to this, since it is in its interest for President Macri to secure re-election,"" he said, but added: ""We doubt that these efforts would be enough to change voter perception."""
economic indicators,Energy transition - a complex challenge,2024-09-15,2023-01-11,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-64234091,"The pace of change is daunting, from technology to ageing demographics. But there's no change more radical and fundamental to the economy and to our lives than the Great Energy Transition. It reaches into our homes, the way we keep warm and cook food, as well as the way we get around and the shape of our neighbourhood. On Wednesday, MSPs vote on a new national planning framework, which indicates how much green energy will reshape the nation. The declining use of oil and gas will, or should, reshape geopolitics, though not necessarily in predictable ways. Charting a course through all that is tricky for us as individuals: whether to buy a hybrid or electric car, how to reduce heating bills, and for many, an attempt to reduce our impact on climate change, perhaps with less flying, driving or eating meat. It is no less difficult for businesses, where energy bills can look impossibly high, and where customer, investor and regulatory pressure is requiring lower emissions, at some cost. For governments, the challenge is more complex still. And the Scottish government has now set out its strategy for getting us from here to net zero in the next 22 years. Yes, 2045 is closer than you probably realised - it's now closer than the last millennium. Much of the new strategy pulls together strands that have been developed over recent years, most notably since the COP26 gathering in Glasgow just over a year ago.  The Scottish government has pivoted from seeing the oil and gas sector as a pillar of the economy - without independence and even more so with it.  It is now arguing that the industry's inevitable decline, due to half a century of extracting more than 45 billion barrels of hydrocarbons, ought to be accelerated. The UK government was heading in the same direction back at the COP26 summit. But with instability in Downing Street, and with Russia's aggression raising the importance of securing energy sources, Whitehall seems much more positive about further exploration and development.  For now, it is the one deciding on licences. That means SNP ministers have less need to explain why jobs are disappearing. They previously told us Scotland could be the Saudi Arabia of renewable energy, with 25% of Europe's wind power potential. They trumpeted 130,000 low-carbon energy jobs. They are not saying that now. The 25% claim has been dismantled by critics. It never looked plausible anyway.  Manufacturing of wind turbines has come to nothing much. Kit is imported from lower cost fabrication yards from Spain to China, and installed by Norwegian and Belgian firms.  Unlike Saudi Arabia, the huge investment in offshore wind is being financed mainly by foreign investors, who will take the profits when they are made. Scottish Labour would like to see some stake for the state, to share the spoils. Also, with the energy strategy, there is publication of a much more modest set of projected employment figures for the 'just transition' out of oil and gas and into renewables. Economic research commissioned by the Scottish government, which is yet to be published in full, forecasts that the 19,000 Scottish green energy jobs in 2019 are on course to become 77,000 jobs by 2050.  Meanwhile, it is calculated that 58,000 Scottish jobs in oil and gas production will fall to only 6,000 by the middle of the century.  Making that transition with minimum pain is an important plank of the energy strategy, for individuals and for the politics of north-east Scotland - so much so that it has its own plan alongside the overarching strategy.  Ministers need to be able to tell those with well-paid jobs in oil and gas that they can make the transition to greener energies using a 'skills passport'.  Some companies are doing so, because they see the pressure to diversify, and they're creating opportunities for staff to be part of that process without changing employers. But there are also indications of a lack of confidence that oil and gas jobs are that easily transformed.  And it may turn out to be less difficult - much of the transition may be achieved by retirement of an ageing oil and gas workforce. The energy strategy includes big claims for wind power, both on and offshore, which are backed up by the investment appetite of companies bidding for the right to develop in Scottish waters. Wave power trials have disappointed so far, but there is hope that engineering challenges can be overcome. Tidal power is proven technology and closer to financial viability, with the bonus of being as predictable as the moon. The shiny new technology is hydrogen - green if it uses renewable wind power to derive it from water, and not at all green if it is derived from gas. A strategy for that was set out last month, with big plans to deploy offshore wind and to build an export industry.  But hopes that it might heat homes are being set aside, in favour of its use for heavy transport and industry. The strategy, which is out to consultation, rules out new nuclear ""with current technologies"", while talking up solar power, but without a suggested target. There's more light in Scotland than you might think during the darkness of January, and commercial solar farms are being developed as far north as Moray.  Michael Matheson, the cabinet secretary who carries the strategy, has a lot to say about hydro power, and particularly the pumped storage variety, which uses excess wind power during the night to pump water uphill, for its release into the turbine halls when demand for power surges.  The minister wants to see the UK government helping with incentives for more of that. He also urged Whitehall to get behind the Acorn project for carbon capture and storage, based in Aberdeenshire, but so far without the UK government funds that are needed to get it growing. There is less being said by government or opposition about demand for energy. That is where there are more awkward decisions - requiring tougher insulation standards in new and existing homes, with high upfront costs, and in ensuring that the transition to battery vehicles does not leave behind those who can't afford it.  Such challenges are acknowledged by the Scottish government, but without much of the tricky detail on how to use its powers and funds. Expect to hear more when Green co-leader Patrick Harvie sets out his ministerial plans for home insulation later this year. While Mr Matheson has advice for Whitehall, there are some stern warnings being directed towards ministers by their own advisers. The Just Transition Commission was set up by ministers to advise them and to hold them accountable. It is doing just that, and in unwelcome terms. Alongside the energy strategy on Wednesday, the Scottish government published two letters from its chair, Prof Jim Skea.  One, dated early November, reminded ministers of its recommendations that there should be a 'road map' in the transition, with targets to be met in each year to 2045. There's no sign of that in the strategy. He followed up with a letter in mid-December, with a stiff reprimand to ministers for their failure to consult fully with the commission ahead of the energy strategy consultation. Prof Skea pointed out that much is being made internationally of Scotland's leading role on combating climate change - not just its ambitious targets, but in inviting independent advice and scrutiny from the commission. It exists to build consensus, says the letter. But if it gets ignored, there's a clear threat that the commission's members will desert it in favour of the campaign, community and business groups, the trade unions and universities they were drawn from. And that would be embarrassing on the international stage. The commission letter says there was a ""high-level briefing"" that was not a consultation, and it left members ""deeply concerned about the lack of evidence of adequate policy actions to deliver a just transition for the energy sector, particularly given the urgent need to shift gear in the rest of the 2020s"". It is even more scathing in its support of comments from the UK Committee on Climate Change, which questioned the credibility of the Scottish government's policy. ""Plans and targets must be deliverable and supported by adequate funding,"" wrote Prof Skea.  ""As pointed out by the UK's Committee on Climate Change, over-ambitious targets, or plans that dodge tough questions rather than confronting them, risk a disorderly, and hence unjust, transition."" A reply to Prof Skea from Richard Lochhead, the Scottish government minister responsible for Just Transition, sought to defuse tensions with an emphasis on how highly ministers valued the commission's advice. ""We have made progress, but I am under no illusions about the amount of work that needs to be done to deliver on our collective hopes for Scotland,"" Mr Lochhead wrote.  ""The Commission's role in shaping this is absolutely crucial and I would like to establish much closer personal involvement with your work as our approach to planning develops."" This involves several encounters between government and commission members during the 12-week consultation, and a fast track to a new Memorandum of Understanding between them. Prof Skea's letter promised a further statement in the new year, with further advice on making the energy transition and on its fairness. Ministers will probably be awaiting that with some trepidation."
economic indicators,Afghans living under Taliban lament loss of freedoms,2024-09-15,2021-08-14,By Rhodri Davies and the BBC investigations team,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58191440,"Work days for midwife Nooria Haya regularly included meetings and discussions with male doctors. They decided on treatments for locals and the priorities for the public clinic she works in. It's in Ishkamish, a rural district with sparse amenities, in Takhar province on Afghanistan's north-eastern border with Tajikistan.  But recently, the 29-year-old found out that meetings between male and female staff were prohibited. It was the first order the Taliban gave them when the group took control of the region, she says. She could only ask herself how else her life would change.  Ishkamish sits in the Hindu Kush mountain range. It's a key border area that the Taliban, emboldened by Nato's withdrawal of nearly 10,000 troops at the start of May, has taken.   Igniting intense fighting with seemingly unprepared government forces in southern Helmand by the middle of the month, the fundamentalist Islamist group then took the northern Burka district at the mountains' foothills.  Around the same time, US forces left Kandahar airbase - one of the largest in the nation, in a province containing the country's second largest city, Kandahar. Locals were acutely aware of the Taliban's progress.  ""Every individual was frightened,"" says Jan Agha, 54, in Arghistan district, on the border with Pakistan, and a windy two-hour drive east of Kandahar city.  People locked themselves in their homes. But the Taliban took up positions in almost every village. Locals can't escape them.  Armed fighters walk through the streets. In the morning and evening, they knock on people's doors to collect food, which they're given for fear of worse consequences.  ""Each house now keeps three or four breads or dishes for them,"" Jan, a fruit seller, says, no matter how poor the residents, in a chronically poor country. If the fighters want to stay in their homes too, they do. Through June, the Taliban claimed the capture of several provinces in the north, including Takhar, Faryab and Badakhshan. They forced the army to strategically retreat, and with it democratic institutions. Most of the 2,500 US troops had left by this time, although a handful remain in the capital Kabul, as does its Air Force.  Afghans have criticised the international withdrawal as too hasty. Some argue that peace talks over the last two years between the Americans and the Taliban only enhanced the latter's perceived legitimacy, recruitment and ambition. An end to the conflict - which had been ongoing since the US-led invasion ended half a decade of Taliban rule almost 20 years ago - had never been close. As the Taliban reasserted itself in June, fighters sequestered more than food and lodging. Social and economic rights fought for with limited success over the last two decades were immediately withdrawn. Their privations on women descended on Nooria for the first time in her life.  ""There are a lot of restrictions now. When I go out, I have to wear a burka as the Taliban orders us, and a male has to accompany me,"" she says.  Travelling as a midwife across the district is especially difficult. Men are not allowed to shave their beards - the Taliban says this is against Islam. Barbers are prohibited from giving purportedly foreign-style short back and sides haircuts.  A group within the Taliban, called the Amri bil Marof (literally: order the good), particularly enforces the social rules. Its punishments brought the most terror to Afghans in the 1990s. Now, again, it's imposing a two-strike rule. First a warning, second a punishment - public humiliations, prison, beatings, lashes.  ""Suddenly most freedoms have been taken away from us,"" Nooria says. ""It is so hard. But we have no other option. They are brutal. We have to do whatever they say. They are using Islam for their own purposes. We are Muslims ourselves, but their beliefs are different."" Difference has also arrived with some increased security from criminality, and from war - where the conflict has been pushed to other areas. Locals welcome such nuanced calm, as they would if the government were in control - even if they doubt its durability. But other things have been driven away too. Afghans used to visit Takhar, famous among the country's 34 provinces for its clean, crisp mountain air that blankets snowy mountains, green and verdant fields, and clear river waters. In Farkhar district, taxi driver Asif Ahadi says he used to make 900 Afghanis ($11; £8) a day. But as the Taliban continued their march, tourists stopped their travels. ""Those visitors were my customers,"" Asif, 35, says. ""The money they paid me I used to feed my family. Now my best day will only earn me 150 Afghanis. It's not even enough to cover the cost of my fuel, which has more than doubled now."" And there's been a deadening impact on social life. ""People used to have parties every Friday night - listen to music and dance - have fun. All of these are completely banned now,"" Asif says.  ""Every business has suffered the same."" By 4 July, two days after US and Nato troops left Afghanistan's biggest airbase at Bagram, the linchpin for all US-led operations for the last two decades, the Taliban seized Panjwai district, in Kandahar province - their birthplace and former bastion.  Less than a week later, they said they controlled the country's biggest border crossing and trade route with Iran and major port, Islam Qala. By the third week of the month, the insurgency had already claimed to command 90% of Afghanistan's borders and 85% of the country. The government disputed the figures - and they are impossible to independently verify - and it still held more populated urban areas. As the Taliban solidified their control, people started to come out of hiding at home, Asif says. Some had never seen the Taliban's rapid dispensing of justice and methods of governing before. ""They make decisions very quickly on issues and matters like crime,"" Asif says. ""There's no bureaucracy, no red tape - every sort of problem can be solved in days - and nobody can challenge any decision."" They also collect ""Taliban Usher"" and Zakat, usually freely-given Islamic offerings to the poor, of about 10% of people's harvest or a fraction of income, respectively. But the Taliban distorts them into essentially taxes for their own use.  It's another financial pressure, alongside prices for ""all goods that are hiked to sky"", Asif says, as external and internal trade is restricted, and the economy is squeezed. Public works have stopped.  ""The people were already very poor, and there's no opportunity for work, and no investment,"" he adds.  Some have seen the Taliban's system before, however.  ""Their ideology and thinking are exactly as they were during their Emirate time. Nothing has changed at all,"" says Jan. ""The Taliban say they have sacrificed a lot to re-establish the Islamic Emirate, so it can't be cast aside."" He says the Taliban has shut all schools in his area. They've said any education should be according to their strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law. It's one of many worrying indicators for locals.  During their last rule from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban banned education and work for women and girls, and restricted their access to healthcare. Since they were forced from power, women retook places in public life, making up a quarter of parliament.  Numbers of girls in primary education went up to 50%, although by late secondary school the figure was around 20%. Women's life expectancy grew from 57 to 66 years. The figures are comparatively poor, but improvements have been made. Yet now there are only fears that they will regress. Progress is what the Taliban are making now. In August, they've attacked more urban centres - taking a third of the regional capitals, including Kunduz in the north and Taloqan in Takhar province. This week they took Herat in the west, and southern Kandahar and Lashkar Gah, strategically and symbolically important cities, where, together, well over one million people live.  The US Air Force has been supporting the Afghan military with strikes. But the last remaining foreign forces are expected to leave the country by 11 September. The date marks the 20th anniversary of al-Qaeda's 9/11 attacks in the US. They spurred the US-led invasion of Afghanistan to remove the Taliban from power for harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures. The struggle takes its toll on human life. A thousand civilians were killed in the month up to the first week of August, the UN says. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes.  Control of the country isn't yet certain. But where the Taliban now rules, the change is clear.  ""You have to bow your head to live your life,"" Jan says. ""You cannot dare oppose them. You cannot say things against them at all. If they say 'yes', you have to say 'yes'. If they say 'no', you must say 'no'."" Such fear prevails, Nooria says. ""Although it might seem like people looked relaxed, when you speak with them, you understand the serious worries they have. We sit together, praying for God to take them away from us."" The names of interviewees have been changed"
economic indicators,India's next government faces economic slowdown,2024-09-15,2019-05-17,By Soutik Biswas,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48268801,"As India lumbers towards the final phase of an exhausting general election and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP seeks a second term in power, there's some worrying news. The world's fastest growing major economy appears to be headed for a slowdown. The signs are everywhere. Economic growth slowed to 6.6% in the three months to December, the slowest in six quarters. Sales of cars and SUVs have slumped to a seven-year-low. Tractors and two-wheelers sales are down. Net profits for 334 companies (excluding banks and financials) are down 18% year-on-year, according to the Financial Express newspaper.  That's not all. In March, passenger growth in the world's fastest growing aviation market expanded at the slowest pace in nearly six years. Demand for bank credit has spluttered. Hindustan Unilever, India's leading maker of fast moving consumer goods, has reported March quarter revenue growth of just 7%, its weakest in 18 months.  One newspaper wondered whether India was ""losing the consumption plot"". Taken together, all this points to a fall in both urban and rural incomes, leading to demand contraction. A crop glut has seen farm incomes drop. And credit stagnation, partly triggered by the collapse of a major non-banking financial institution, or a shadow bank, has led to a fall in lending and worsened matters. Kaushik Basu, former chief economist of the World Bank and professor of economics at Cornell University, believes the slowdown is ""much more serious"" than he initially believed. ""The evidence is now mounting to the point where it can no longer be ignored,"" he told me.  One reason, he believes, is the controversial currency ban in 2016 - also called demonetisation - which adversely hit farmers. More than 80% of the currency circulating in India's sprawling cash-driven economy was taken out of circulation in what, in the words of one of Prime Minister Modi's own advisers, was a ""massive, draconian, monetary shock"".  ""This was evident to all by early 2017. What many observers did not realise then - I did not - is that the shock made the farmers take on debts which ended up causing sustained hardship to them that is continuing and slowing down the agriculture sector."" The other major disappointment, according to Prof Basu, has been exports. ""Export growth has been close to zero for the last five years. For a low-wage economy like India, a little policy professionalism - a combination of monetary policy and micro incentives - is all that is needed to grow this sector. It is regrettable that the rhetoric was not backed up with policy design.""  Others like economist Rathin Roy, a member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council, believe that India's consumption story could actually be levelling out.  Dr Roy believes India's rapid growth has been essentially powered by its top 100 million citizens. The leading indicators of economic prosperity, he says, are things that these Indians consume - cars, two wheelers, air conditioners and so on. Having had their fill of home-made goods, they have now moved to imported luxuries - foreign holidays and Italian kitchens, for example.  A majority of Indians want nutritious food, affordable clothing and housing, health and education, which really should be the leading indicators of economic growth. ""Subsidies and income support cannot pay for such consumption on a massive scale. At least half the population should earn incomes that enable them to buy these at affordable prices so that a maximum of 500 million people can be subsidised to improve their welfare,"" Dr Roy says. Unless India is able to do this in the next decade or so, Dr Roy believes, it is headed for what economists call a ""middle income trap"", when a country stops being able to achieve rapid growth easily and compete with advanced economies. Economist Ardo Hannson defines it as a situation when countries ""seem to get stuck in a trap where your costs are escalating and you lose competitiveness"".  One problem is that once you are stuck in a middle income trap, it is difficult to get out.  A World Bank study found that out of the 101 middle-income countries in 1960, some 13 had become high-income by 2008 based on per capita income relative to the US. Only three of the 13 countries have a population of more than 25 million. India is a lower-middle income economy and to get caught in a trap at this stage will be tragic. Dr Roy says the classic middle income trap means that the rich are taxed to provide minimum services to the poor, who will kept from extreme poverty and vulnerability by using such taxes to subsidise their existence, including an universal basic income in perpetuity.  ""We will be Brazil. On the other hand If India produces what all Indians want to consume efficiently, and at affordable prices, then inclusive growth will stave off the middle income trap. We will be Japan,"" says Dr Roy.  The next government has its work cut out.  Read more from Soutik Biswas Follow Soutik on Twitter at @soutikBBC"
economic indicators,Wales workers 'lowest paid' in UK,2024-09-15,2017-10-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-41767830,"Workers in Wales ""endure the lowest take home pay"" in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics. Wages rose by 1% in the year to April 2017, but the level of inflation (2.6%) meant a real terms fall of 1.6%. Median (middle amount) weekly earnings for full-time workers was £498.40, more than £50 less than the UK as a whole. Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives have both criticised the Welsh Labour government, but it said it was ""committed to driving up wages"". Analysis by BBC One Wales' new political debate programme The Hour The Office for National Statistics (ONS) report shows real earnings are now £1,100 per year lower than in 2009. In 2009, a year after the recession, average real earnings in Wales were £27,000.  Today's wage statistics, once adjusted for the rising cost of living, show that people are earning £25,900 per year on average. This means, on a key economic indicator, the Welsh economy still hasn't recovered from the recession. Welsh men have actually been the hardest hit - taking home £2,100 less a year in real terms than in 2009. Interestingly, real earnings had actually been improving before this year. Wales had experienced two consecutive years of rising real earnings in 2015 and 2016.  But, real earnings have fallen from 2016-2017 by £416 per year or £8 per week - largely as a result of rising inflation. Plaid Cymru's economy spokesman Adam Price said ""austerity has failed Wales"" and now was the time to invest in people and communities.  He said the figures on wages were a ""clear illustration of the Welsh and UK governments' failure in its duty to the people of Wales"". ""It's time to abandon the culture of cuts, it has led to nothing but economic decline,"" he said. The Welsh Conservatives economy spokesman Russell George said Welsh workers ""continue to endure the lowest take home pay in Britain"". He said: ""Life can be a daily struggle for people on low pay, and it can be hard to keep up with the rising cost of essentials or to scrape enough savings together to get on the housing ladder"". Mr George said the Welsh Labour government had ""done little to tackle this issue with the tools they have at their disposal"". Open Britain, a cross-party group campaigning against a hard Brexit, said a rise in inflation in the wake of the Brexit vote in June last year had ""caused a squeeze on living standards"" and pay packets. Stephen Doughty, leading Open Britain supporter and MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, said: ""People in Wales have a right to ask whether this Brexit squeeze on wages and living standards is what they voted for in the referendum."" The Welsh Government spokesman said ""a record number"" of people were in work, with unemployment at ""historically low levels and below the UK average"". He said through interventions such as Jobs Growth Wales, ReAct and ""rapid support"" for the steel industry, the Welsh Government has ""consistently supported"" communities across Wales through one of the worst global recessions. ""We are committed to further driving up wages through a range of economic measures that will help attract further inward investors to Wales, implement better fair working practices and tackle lower productivity through enhancing skills, leadership and innovation across Wales,"" he added."
economic indicators,Has India delivered on its 2022 budget promises?,2024-09-15,2023-01-31,By Shruti Menon and Shadab Nazmi,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64414587,"The Indian government will present its last full budget on Wednesday before the country holds elections in 2024. We've looked at official data to see what progress the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has made since last year's budget pledges. In her 2022 budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that India's economic growth in the current fiscal year (to the end of March 2023) was ""estimated to be 9.2%, [the] highest among all large economies"". But with fears of a global recession and energy prices rising after the war in Ukraine, that growth projection was revised down to 6.8% last December by India's central bank. Even so, the World Bank has said that India is expected to be the ""fastest growing economy"" of the seven largest emerging and developing economies globally.  International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Kristalina Georgieva said this month that India was performing ""better than the global average"".  According to government statistics, India's GDP growth was 13.5% in the first quarter of the financial year (starting in 2022), but fell to 6.3% in the second quarter as the manufacturing sector slowed due to higher raw material costs and energy prices. Dr Aurodeep Nandi, of the Nomura financial services group, says it has been up and down this past year for fiscal math.  ""There were slips along with gains in the fiscal deficit, while government expenditure is looking to slip, it should be counter-balanced by stellar tax revenues and higher GDP growth"" he says. India's fiscal deficit target - the difference between total spending and revenue which the government promised would be kept at 6.4% of GDP - has been maintained at that level so far, according to RBI figures.  The target this year was set lower than in 2020 (9.1%) and 2021 (6.7%) as Covid-related demands on government finances have eased .   However, the government's target to keep its expenditure to 39.45 trillion rupees ($4,800bn; £3,800bn) for the fiscal year will be not be met due to higher import costs, and subsidies on food, fuel and fertiliser.  ""India is expected to exceed its budgeted expenditure by 1.1% of GDP by the end of this fiscal year,"" says to Dr Nandi using estimates by Nomura.  The housing-for-all scheme, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), was launched in 2015 and is one of the flagship welfare projects of the Narendra Modi government.  In the last budget, 480bn rupees ($59bn; £47bn) was allocated for building eight million homes for eligible beneficiaries in rural and urban areas in 2022-23. The schemes for rural and urban areas are implemented by different ministries.  The ministry of housing and urban affairs  - which oversees the urban part of the scheme - said it was behind target and sought an extension of the deadline and further financial assistance from the federal government in August last year.  The deadline has been pushed back to December 2024. In the current fiscal year from 1 April 2022, there's data up to 23 January 2023. This shows 1.2 million houses were completed in urban areas, while under the rural part of the scheme, 2.6 million houses were built. That means the government is currently 4.2 million homes short of its target overall. The finance minister also allocated 600bn rupees ($74bn; £60bn) with an ""aim to cover 38 million households in 2022-23"" with piped water connections.  According to data from the ministry of water resources, so far only around 17 million households have been given piped water connections this year.  That's slightly short of 50% of the target. Since its launch in August 2019, the scheme has provided a total of 77 million households with piped water.  The finance minister also announced last year that the national highways network would be ""expanded by 25,000km (15,534 miles) in 2022-23"".  The 25,000km would include new construction as well as the development of existing roads and the declaration of state highways as national highways. Of this, the ministry of road transport and highways set itself a target to build 12,000km (7,456 miles) in this fiscal year.  But the latest data from the ministry shows that only a total of 5,774km (3,588 miles) of national highways were constructed between April and December 2022 - so less than half the target. We don't yet have data for January this year.  Going by data from previous years, the pace of daily construction has slowed this year to around an average of 21km (13 miles) a day from 29km a day in 2021-22 and 37km a day on average in 2020-21.

economic indicators,Can the city of pizza reinvent itself as a tech capital?,2024-09-15,2018-09-13,By Manuela Saragosa & Rosamund Jones,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45486674,"As tech giants Apple and Cisco set up academies in Naples, the city's tech entrepreneurs are hoping new investment will revitalise southern Italy's failing economy.  Naples is a city with a reputation: it has pizza, devil-may-care drivers, and mafia clans known as the Camorra. But in the past few years this southern Italian city has also been fostering a growing community of tech start-ups and app creators. The hope is it will change not just Naples' reputation, but also its fortunes and so reverse a brain drain that's seen many of the city's young graduates leave to find jobs in the more prosperous north of Italy, or even abroad.  Naples, and its region, Campania, is part of the Mezzogiorno (southern Italy and Sicily) which lags behind the rest of the country in terms of economic growth. Here the jobless rate was 22.2% in the first quarter of this year, almost double the national average. But that hasn't put off a growing list of Neapolitan tech firms - influencer marketing company Buzzoole and the agricultural tech start-up Evja to name but two. Evja makes sensors that are placed in fields and greenhouses to transmit real-time indicators of growing conditions. ""We want to prove it's possible to do business here,"" says Evja founder Paolo Iasevoli, pointing out that his company is now selling overseas and soon launching in south American markets.  What has really changed the game for Naples' tech scene is Apple's recent arrival in the city.  In 2015, Apple opened an academy in Naples, in conjunction with University of Naples Federico II, where students spend a year training to be developers, coders, app creators and start-up entrepreneurs. This year nearly 400 students graduated from it, about 70% of them are Italian and the majority come from the Campania region. A further 400 students are due to start the academic year later this month. Apple thought it could make a far bigger splash in a place like Naples than in some of the more established tech hubs of Europe, such as Lisbon, Dublin or Berlin. And where Apple goes, others follow.  Earlier this year, networking giant Cisco opened its own networking academy in Naples. That's helped provide a steady supply of skilled graduates.  But setting up a tech business in Naples was anything but easy for Mr Iasevoli, who founded Evja three years ago after securing investment from shareholders in Munich and Vienna.  ""We had major issues accessing credit from the banks, major issues getting funding from the government,"" he says. Despite these obstacles, Mr Iasevoli chose to stay put.  Tech sector salaries in Naples are just half of what someone in London would expect, he reckons, and the cost of living is cheaper, too. Apple's presence has also made the job of promoting the region easier for Valeria Fascione, Campania's minister for internationalisation, start-ups and innovation. She is the only regional minister in Italy with such a role, she says, proudly stating that Campania now has Italy's second-fastest growth for start-ups. ""When people say to me with a sceptical edge, 'why Naples? why invest here?' I say if Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, thinks this is an amazing place then we should agree with him."" But while Apple and Cisco's academies have been great news for young graduates and Naples' image, it hasn't prompted the inflows of private capital some had hoped for.  As a region, Campania receives some of the lowest investment in the whole of western Europe. Most of Italy's economic activity happens up north - Milan is where the venture capital firms are based. Which is where Giovanni de Caro comes in.  He's worked in venture capital for the past two decades and sits on the board of Campania NewSteel, the University of Naples' tech incubator, which occupies the site of abandoned steel mills outside the city. ""The companies are here but the money is not,"" says Mr de Caro, a Neapolitan himself.  These days, he describes himself as Campania NewSteel's ""finance man"", and says cultural barriers between the north and south are a problem when it comes to enticing Milan-based capital down south.  ""Southern Italy works very differently to the North,"" he says.  Critics often point to roads riddled with pot-holes, slow trains, poorly delivered public investment. No wonder private capital chooses to stay away, they say. But then there isn't much of a pool of venture capital funds in Italy anyway - the sector is about a tenth of the size of London's. What Italians do have though is a very large and wealthy diaspora, one which Nicola Garelli's company, Istarter in London, is tapping into. The idea is to attract Italian-born capital back home by appealing to a sense of patriotism. Participants, ""have a strong sense of giving back towards the country,"" says Mr Garelli, himself an Italian.  ""We have lived abroad, but in the back of our minds is a desire to build for the next generation.""  Istarter has invested in nearly 40 tech companies in Italy - but, again, none of these are in the south. So what's stopping them?  Britt Becking, of venture capital firm QVentures in London, says there just isn't a buzz around the Naples tech start-up scene in the same way there is around tech start-ups in, say, Berlin.  It's a chicken-and-egg situation: the private money won't come until there's an established tech scene, but start-ups can't get established without access to capital.  ""I would recommend [Neapolitan] start-ups try and go to London, Berlin, Silicon Valley,"" she says. But that's exactly what firms like Evja and Buzzoole don't want to do. Investment here goes much further with far greater potential for big returns, they say, adding that venture capital firms are missing the point.  ""If we had started in the US - somewhere like that - we would have needed $10m or $15m, but we did it with less than €3m here in Naples,"" says Fabrizio Perrone, Buzzoole chief executive and founder. And for Evja's Paolo Iasevoli it's a badge of honour to do it all from Naples.  ""I'm from Naples. If I was from Berlin, you wouldn't be talking to me, right? So, Naples is a good starting point."" Naples, whose name derives from the Greek ""neapolis"" meaning ""new city"", has had to reinvent itself many times throughout history. Over the centuries it's been the capital of duchies, kingdoms and empires.  Could it become a new capital of tech?"
economic indicators,Interest rate rise 'should be delayed',2024-09-15,2017-10-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41630943,"The Bank of England should hold off from raising interest rates next month, according to a forecasting body. Bank governor Mark Carney has said rates could go up in the ""relatively near term"", with many analysts expecting a hike in November. However, the EY Item Club said such a move risked hurting the UK's ""fragile economic outlook"". The group called on the bank to wait another year before raising the benchmark rate from 0.25% to 0.5%. It comes after the British Chambers of Commerce and ratings agency Standard & Poor's suggested economic growth was not strong enough to warrant a rate rise. The EY Item Club, which uses the Treasury's forecasting model, predicted GDP growth would slow to 1.5% this year and 1.4% in 2018.  It said expectations were high that the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would raise rates at the next meeting on 2 November, but urged it to wait for the economy to pick up. ""While it is understandable that the MPC will want to gradually normalise interest rates from their current 'emergency levels', we believe it would be better to do so once the economy is on a stronger footing,"" said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. The last time rates were raised was July 2007, before the financial crisis. Since then interest rates have been kept low to boost the economy by keeping the cost of borrowing down. The Bank cut rates further - from 0.5% to a record low of 0.25% - after the Brexit vote in a move designed to stimulate the economy.  Recent low unemployment figures and stronger inflation have made a rise in rates more likely. Mr Carney told the BBC at the end of September: ""If the economy continues on the track that it's been on, and all indications are that it is, in the relatively near term we can expect that interest rates will increase."" The Bank is tasked with using interest rates to keep inflation at 2%. It is currently at 2.9%, with the latest figures due out on Tuesday. But according to the EY Item Club's forecasts, inflation will fall back to 2% by the end of next year as the effects of the weaker pound wear off. The forecasting group said consumer spending would slow from a nine-year high in 2016 - 2.8% - to 1.5% this year due to inflation, low wage rises, welfare cuts and a slow housing market. The latest retail industry figures, released on Monday, indicate footfall fell by 1.2% in September. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: ""For the third consecutive month, most shopping destinations suffered a decline."" The British Chambers of Commerce said on Friday it was ""extraordinary"" the Bank was considering a rate rise when economic growth was muted. Earlier this month, Standard & Poor's said it was ""a bit sceptical"" the UK economy needed an interest rate rise. However, others have argued the economy is strong enough to start moving off the emergency rates."
economic indicators,NI likely to avoid recession in 2023 - economists,2024-09-15,2023-05-23,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65677135,"Northern Ireland is likely to avoid recession in 2023 as the economy has shown more resilience than expected, economists at Ulster University (UU) have forecast. The UU Economic Policy Centre (UUEPC) expects economic output to grow by 0.1% this year, upgrading an earlier forecast of a 1.2% contraction. But it has warned growth is likely to remain weak in the medium term. Annual growth rates of less than 2% are forecast out to 2027. In recent months, business surveys have shown more optimism and activity in Northern Ireland's private sector, while in contrast, the public sector is facing a squeezed budget. ""Despite the very challenging economic environment with 'stickier' inflation and increasing interest rates, the local economy has proved to be a lot more resilient than many had anticipated at the beginning of the year,"" the UUEPC's director Gareth Hetherington said. Under a different measurement from that used by the UUEPC, Northern Ireland briefly entered recession in the middle of 2022 before recovering. Meanwhile, Mr Hetherington warned that Northern Ireland's public finances will remain very challenging over the next three to five years. He said a strategic approach to public spending, similar to that seen in the Republic of Ireland after the banking crisis, was needed. ""The current crisis represents our budgetary day of reckoning and we should be taking a similar strategic approach to identifying priorities,"" he added. Earlier this month, the independent NI Fiscal Council suggested the operation of the devolution funding formula would increasingly fail to reflect Northern Ireland's needs. It estimated rate public spending per head in Northern Ireland needed to be 24% higher than in England to deliver comparable public services. It used population indicators such as age and long-term illness to assess relative need. The council calculated that spending per head in Northern Ireland is currently 23% higher than England. But it warned under the current public spending model that premium will fall to 20% by the end of this decade."
economic indicators,Trump ends business groups as CEOs quit,2024-09-15,2017-08-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40952820,"President Trump has said he is scrapping two business councils after more bosses quit over his handling of violent clashes in Virginia.  Business leaders left the White House manufacturing council after the backlash against how he reacted to the far-right rally last weekend. The clashes culminated in a woman's death and nearly 20 wounded when a car ploughed into a crowd of anti-fascists. Mr Trump's reaction has sparked outrage and generated global headlines. His announcement on Twitter came as the heads of 3M, Campbell Soup, Johnson & Johnson and United Technologies announced their resignations on Wednesday. Mr Trump said: ""Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both."" Before Mr Trump's announcement, the Strategy and Policy Forum announced it was a joint decision to disband the council.  Businesses have been under pressure to distance themselves from Mr Trump over his handling of the clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia. On Monday, Mr Trump belatedly condemned the white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups that rallied in a small Virginia town on Sunday.  But in a rancorous news conference on Tuesday he backtracked and again blamed left-wing counter-protesters for the violence too.  JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a member of the Strategy and Policy Forum, released a separate statement on Wednesday saying he strongly disagreed with Mr Trump's recent statements, adding that ""fanning divisiveness is not the answer"".  ""Constructive economic and regulatory policies are not enough and will not matter if we do not address the divisions in our country. It is a leader's role, in business or government, to bring people together, not tear them apart,"" he said.  Denise Morrison of Campbell Soup Co said she could not continue to participate in the advisory panel after Mr Trump's comments. Activists had called on Campbell Soup, among other firms, to take action. Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter The calculus for business leaders working with the Trump administration has changed quickly. After the Charlottesville violence, Ken Frazier of Merck abandoned the president's manufacturing council and quickly drew the president's Twitter ire.  At that point there was some media speculation - through unnamed ""corporate leaders"" - that the wise move would be to wait out the storm rather than pick a fight with the president. Companies like Boeing and General Motors had tangled with the president in the past, and they (and their stock prices) generally ended up the worse for it. This time was different. As more corporate chiefs headed to the exit, the riskier move - from a business as well as political perspective - became staying put. The president, despite further tweets and verbal swipes, was unable to staunch the bleeding. His rhetorical gymnastics on the Charlottesville situation only made matters worse. In the corporate world, there's always talk of ""leading indicators"" - tell-tale signs that help predict what's to come.  Is the collapse of the Trump regime's corporate entente a sign his fortunes are in a tailspin? Or is the man who ascended to the presidency without their help perfectly capable of staying there now that they've abandoned him? The president was under pressure to explicitly condemn white supremacists who were behind Saturday's far-right rally, where violent clashes left a woman dead and nearly 20 people injured. The rally, supported by neo-Nazis and white supremacists, was in protest of the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War.  But Mr Trump reversed course on Tuesday and instead appeared to defend the rally's organisers.  He condemned the driver of the car who rammed into a crowd of counter protesters and killed a woman, but said those who had marched in defence of the statue had included ""many fine people"". Mr Trump's remarks were welcomed by David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan. At a memorial service in Charlottesville for Heather Heyer, who was killed in the weekend clashes, her mother delivered a powerful message. ""They killed my child to shut her up. Well guess what, you just magnified her,"" she said before the crowd erupted into a standing ovation.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has faced accusations of racism in the past, said the government may press hate crime charges against the man accused of driving his car and killing Ms Heyer. Speaking in Miami about undocumented immigration, he said: ""In no way can we accept or apologise for racism, bigotry, hatred, violence, and those kind of things that too often arise in our county"".  Vice-President Mike Pence, who has been on a diplomatic tour of South America, said he was cutting his trip short to return to the US after a visit to Panama. He told reporters travelling with him that he stands by Mr Trump's words. Former CIA director John Brennan said in a letter to CNN that Mr Trump's words are ""despicable"", ""dangerous"" and ""a national disgrace"". He added that ""we will not allow the few to divide the many"". Two Republican ex-presidents also weighed in. In remarks implicitly critical of President Trump, George HW Bush and son George W Bush called on the US to ""reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism and hatred in all forms"". Their joint statement adds to a growing chorus of Republicans condemning Mr Trump's opinions on race. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning"
economic indicators,US jobless rate falls to 18-year low,2024-09-15,2018-06-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44330250,"US jobs growth was faster than expected in May, as employers added 223,000 positions. The unemployment rate fell further to 3.8%, having fallen to 3.9% the previous month, bringing the rate to an 18-year low. The average hourly pay of private sector workers increased 2.7% year-on-year, compared with 2.6% in April. Surveys of economists had predicted that there would be a gain of about 188,000 jobs in May. Analysts said the positive jobs data fuelled expectations that the central bank, the Federal Reserve, would raise interest rates at its next meeting later this month. The unemployment rate has not been this low since April 2000 and has already fulfilled the Fed's forecast of 3.8% by the end of 2018.  President Donald Trump previewed the strong jobs report with a Twitter post, writing that he was ""looking forward"" to seeing the numbers. The tweet raised eyebrows due to its allusion to embargoed data, which the White House has access to prior to its release.  President Trump has been rebuked previously for celebrating jobs figures within an hour of their publication, a violation of a federal rule intended to preserve the neutrality of the statistics. Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst for Bankrate.com, said the president's post ""doesn't look good"" even if he avoided an outright break of the embargo. ""This is another case where... President Trump would be wise to spend his time doing something other than tweeting,"" he said. Economist Lawrence Summers, who held top economic posts under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, wrote on Twitter that a similar statement made in those administrations ""would have been a major scandal"". However, the president's decision to draw attention to the report underscored the positive numbers, which added to other healthy economic indicators. All major sectors of the US economy registered job gains last month. Construction added 25,000 jobs in May after notching up gains of 21,000 jobs the month before.  Manufacturing created another 18,000 jobs last month in addition to the 25,000 created in April.  Revised data for March and April also showed the economy adding 15,000 more jobs than previously thought. Economists had previously said bad weather was to blame for slower job growth over those two months. Even the widest measure of unemployment - including people working part-time and discouraged workers - is hovering at its lowest rate since 2001.  While wage growth was not as strong as might be expected given the tightening labour market, economists said they expect these figures to rise in coming months."
economic indicators,Is the shopping centre ready to check out?,2024-09-15,2018-11-30,By Bill Wilson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46383807,"In the 1960s shopping centres offered a vision of the future - large shiny complexes which looked to bring the ease and glamour of US suburban malls to UK town and city centres. From the 1970s to the 1990s they were followed by out-of-town shopping centres, often built on land which had recently housed Britain's vanishing heavy industries. In the past decade there has been a 21st Century renaissance in the original concept of the city centre arcades, whether it be the new Westfield Centres in Shepherd's Bush and Stratford in London, or the rebirth of the once-derided Bull Ring in Birmingham. At the same time the growth of online shopping, and other societal changes, have left a fractured landscape, and an industry looking at an uncertain future. The latest illustration of this has been the cancellation of a £2.8bn deal to purchase shopping centre giant Intu Properties - owner of the Trafford and Arndale centres in Manchester, Metrocentre in Gateshead, and Lakeside in Essex. The potential buyers, a consortium led by Peel Group, blamed ""uncertainty around current macroeconomic conditions and the potential near-term volatility across markets"". In November, a report from analyst Nelson Blackley warned that more than 200 UK shopping centres were in danger of falling into administration. According to Richard Lim, chief executive of analysts Retail Economics, shopping centres which have an exciting future will be those that plug into the desires of consumers to be more than mere ""shoppers"". He says there should also be a future for those outlets which offer a more nuts-and-bolts service, but are in good locations. ""In my view we are seeing, in terms of physical properties, the polarisation in the shopping market, between those retail centres which are thriving because they are flagship destinations, and the rest,"" says Mr Lim. ""These flagship shopping centres - the likes of Westfield, Leeds Trinity, Birmingham's Bullring - are the ones that are tapping into consumers' desire for experiences;  offering bars, restaurants, cinemas, bowling alleys, opportunities to try things like cooking, and so on. ""Looking at these centres, the retail experience is important but it is not necessarily the sole driver of footfall."" He adds: ""It is by having a blended proposition, that includes other activities, that will allow a centre to thrive.   ""Experiences are more important than ever before - Western households have an abundance of material possessions and want something more."" As well as these landmark ""experience"" destinations, Mr Lim says that there is a strata of secondary and tertiary shopping centres that are doing well. ""These are the sites close to where people live, work, or have transport hubs nearby.  These outlets will have seen their retail pull diminish over the past 10 years. But their locations enable them to have a sustainable level of footfall to survive. ""But those shopping centres which do not have one of the benefits of these location factors are the most susceptible to the growing lure of online."" Mr Lim says not only is consumer behaviour changing - but that it is changing very quickly.  It is being brought about not only by online the growth of the experience economy, but also by the development of smartphones making it easier to make purchases on the go. ""At the same time there has been a diminishing of the value attached to possessions.  Millennials are one of the groups driving this retail change, what they want are experiences they can share with their friends on social media, something very different to what older people want,"" he adds. After the Intu deal fell through, shares in it and in rival chain Hammerson fell sharply.  Intu, while saying it would continue to invest in the long term of its shopping centres, pointed to what it said was was a ""challenging market."" ""There is the uncertainty of Brexit, which is likely to inform a lot of shopping centre decisions in the near future,"" says Mr Lim. ""But there also has to be an acknowledgement that the bigger picture for shopping centres is one of fast-changing consumer behaviour."" Graham Parker is editor of industry magazine Retail Destination (formerly Shopping Centres). ""The story is that shoppers are migrating to the top of the range shopping centres, such as the Trafford Centre or Bluewater in Kent,"" he says. He says that footfall across shopping centres generally is down 2.5% to 3%, but only by 1% at the prime locations.  ""Physical retail is suffering not only from online shopping, but increasing business rate bills, the national minimum wage and Brexit hitting the pound and making imports more expensive,"" he adds. ""This may have to get worse before they get better. That is why this Christmas is going to be absolutely crucial for shopping centres and the brands and chains that have outlets in them."""
economic indicators,The economic forecast turns dreich,2024-09-15,2023-10-25,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-67221829,"If you're after good news about the Scottish economy, look away now. It's not unrelentingly grim, in that there are underlying strengths there, and opportunities to be seized, and many businesses are getting along just fine. But momentum is in short supply. It may even be ""apathy"", according to the director of the Fraser of Allander Institute. The economists there have just published their regular updated forecast, and given Scotland's economy a further downgrade for this year.   The weight of negative findings from business surveys and other data points to growth of only 0.2% this year. That is down on the June figure forecasting 0.5%. Growth forecasts for next year and the year after have not been downgraded. At 0.7% and 1.2%, they look stronger than this year, but they're a long way short of a healthy recovery. The good news is that it could have been worse. Nearly a year ago, the Bank of England forecast that we'd be in a prolonged though shallow recession by now, lasting all of this year and well into 2024. The winter months weren't so bad. The economy weathered the surge in energy prices. It has been the summer that has slowed things up. The higher cost of borrowing money is one obvious reason. This should hardly come as a surprise. The whole point of the Bank of England raising the cost of borrowing is to choke demand out of the economy, and any inflation that comes with it, in the hope that can be achieved without causing a recession. It hasn't cut inflation as fast as hoped. Decline has stalled - that is, prices in the year to September rose at the same pace as the year to August, and that was only one notch down on the year to July.  It has been helped downwards by food price inflation coming off a high of more than 19% towards a mere 10% inflation over the year. Some items have actually fallen in price month-on-month, including dairy and eggs.  But the decline in the Consumer Price Index measure of inflation has had the brakes applied by fuel costs going up. This impacts any part of the economy that relies on road and air transport of goods and people. Prices are affected by the global cost of crude oil and a renewed weakening of the pound against the US dollar, in which the black stuff is bought and sold. The Fraser of Allander economists, at Strathclyde University, explain their gloomy prediction with their recent survey evidence from across Scottish private sector firms.  It shows firms struggling to absorb higher input costs for much longer. Those who don't wish to lose custom or market share have been seeking to manage costs, with a squeeze on profits, but say they can only do so for so long. Today's report says some are responding with shrinkflation, getting less for the same price, and hospitality firms throwing in extra charges with your bill. But this evidence suggests something that the Bank of England fears when it looks at the outlook for inflation - pent-up pressures, notably in wage costs, are continuing to push consumer prices up. Some firms aren't making it through. Figures published on Wednesday point to a rise in the number of company insolvencies in Scotland, up nearly 5% in July to September when compared with the same period last year, at 283 firms.  They're down by a small number on the second quarter of this year, but up nearly 20% on pre-pandemic levels. ""The year-on-year rise in corporate insolvencies has been driven by an almost 35% rise in compulsory liquidations,"" according to Iain Fraser of R3, which represents the insolvency trade. ""This increase suggests that, faced with financial challenges of their own, more and more creditors are now increasing their efforts to pursue debts they are owed to meet their own financial obligations. ""Times remain tough for Scottish businesses,"" he continues. ""Inflation is still a big worry for many. Prices are going up, and businesses are struggling to reasonably pass on these extra costs to customers.  ""As we head into the colder months and energy bills rise, these increased costs are only set to exacerbate current challenges, particularly for higher risk sectors like hospitality and retail."" Further evidence from the Allander survey, and another this week from Scottish Chambers of Commerce, show Scottish firms are reluctant to invest. Their plans are being delayed or cancelled because of rising interest rates and costs. Without investment, and without the productivity gains it can provide, it is hard to see where more economic growth will come from.  There are public funds to help them, with the British Business Bank recently adding a big new fund to the efforts of the Scottish National Investment Bank, both trying to identify the areas where their involvement can leverage investment from others. That sluggish investment has knock-on effects for the public sector. The added pay bill for the Scottish public sector is put at around £1.7bn. Tax revenues and the block grant from Westminster don't look likely to close the resulting gap between spending and revenue. The Treasury in London and the Scottish government are both preparing to set out tax and spending plans next month and December, and with the cost of servicing debt sharply up in the expectation of sustained high interest rates, the Institute of Fiscal Studies says the UK is in a ""horrible fiscal bind, as low growth and high debt interest payments mean no room for manoeuvre. ""The UK economy remains stuck between weak growth on the one hand and the risk of persistently high inflation on the other.  ""Fiscal and monetary policy must strike a delicate balance - an ill-timed fiscal loosening, such as an unfunded package of pre-election tax cuts, might give a short-term economic sugar rush, but could prove unsustainable and ultimately mean a protracted recession as interest rates rise even further to bring inflation back under control."" Tax cuts are being pushed by Conservative MPs at Westminster, while tax raises seem a more likely response at Holyrood. Audit Scotland warns that infrastructure projects are outstripping the funds available, and some will have to be delayed or cancelled. They are also part of the plan to improve productivity and economic performance. The first minister's new commitment to a council tax freeze has made it even more difficult to make the budgets balance without an income tax raid by Holyrood on higher earners, and that too could be expected to weigh on the economic growth rate. For one of the most recent takes on the private sector in Scotland, the Purchasing Managers Index for September identified a contraction in output, the first since January. It is only slight, and not as clear as the figure for the UK as a whole.  Inflow of new work has weakened as well, which is often an indicator of further problems down the line. But being in business is no place for the terminally gloomy.  There are signs of optimism rising in the PMI survey, for Royal Bank of Scotland, in the belief that customer demand will return.  There is also a positive outlook about employment. The weak level of demand is not seeing workers laid off, and many are still struggling to find the skilled staff they want to hire. This week's job figures for the UK, from the Office for National Statistics, suggest the June-to-August number of those seeking work remained at 4.3% of working age adults. That's higher than it was, but still low by historic standards, and rising much less steeply than you might expect from the less happy data. How about Scotland's unemployment? There's a problem there. The PMI figures show Scottish recruitment running at a stronger rate than the UK as a whole, much of that in the service sector. The ONS figure for May-to-July rose quite steeply to match the UK rate. But the official counter of things has not published figures for Scotland, or other nations or regions of the UK. There isn't even a breakdown between male and female. The problem is one of data quality. The Labour Force Survey is failing to reach a representative sample of workers. Eight years ago, it reached more than 90,000 people across the UK over three months. This year, it was only just over 50,000, with too few home renters and young people responding to ONS questionnaires.  The survey is being re-launched for online responses as well (how modern!), and should be back to health by March. But for the winter ahead, even those who measure tough times are having a tough time."
economic indicators,Output growth 'eases to eight-month low',2024-09-15,2017-12-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-42280590,"Scottish private sector output rose last month but is at its weakest pace since March, according to a report. The latest Bank of Scotland PMI suggested there was a ""mild"" contraction in service sector activity in November, while manufacturing output expanded ""solidly"".  Weak activity growth also coincided with ""a softer rise"" in new business.  However, the report indicated that firms increased employment in line with greater confidence over future output. The Scottish government highlighted the latter point as showing ""the resilience of Scotland's private sector"". The PMI - which measures changes in combined manufacturing and services output each month - declined in November to 50.2, from 52.7 the previous month. Any figure above 50 suggests expansion. The report said companies in the service sector indicated there had been no change to incoming new orders in November.  On the other hand, manufacturing firms recorded higher demand following two successive periods of contraction. Meanwhile, businesses remained upbeat about their future growth prospects, despite sluggish growth in output and demand.  Optimism edged higher across the private sector, with planned business expansions and new product launches cited as reasons to be positive. Fraser Sime, regional director of Bank of Scotland Commercial Banking, said: ""Output growth momentum appeared to wane across the Scottish private sector in November, as signalled by the headline PMI figure falling to an eight-month low.  ""The service sector was a key contributor to this, with business activity declining for the first time since April.  ""Weaker output growth coincided with broadly flat new business.  ""That said, firms added to their payrolls for a sixth consecutive month in preparation of a further expansion in order-book volume."" Scottish Economy Secretary Keith Brown said the report was evidence of a resilient private sector, but issued a warning about the potential impact of Brexit. He said: ""Although indicators for output and new business in the service sector eased in November, the report showed strong growth in employment with Scotland's manufacturers turning a corner on new order intake. ""While this is encouraging, Brexit uncertainty continues to cast a shadow over the future economic outlook, threatening jobs, investment and living standards."""
economic indicators,The ill economic winds of coronavirus,2024-09-15,2020-04-06,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-52180789,"The economic crisis has moved from the stress indicators of global stock markets, which can often seem unreal and irrational, to the real world. Market indices have stopped falling so fast (""too late to sell, too early to buy"" was one investor's observation) and we are now beginning to get a sense of the scale of job losses. The tourist industry was hit very hard with the denial of two big earners as far away as August in the Edinburgh festivals (cancelled) and the COP26 environment conference in Glasgow in November (postponed). That underlined the heightened level of exposure for hospitality and tourism, and was a signal of how long this is going to affect the economy.  The prospect, of spectator sport potentially not returning until 2021, adds to that sense that it won't be over by Easter, or summer, or long after that. The most startling numbers were from the USA. One way of measuring unemployment in the States is by the number of people who register each week. In Britain, we don't have data that responds that fast. The US figure the week before last was up by 3.3m, more than four times the previous one-week record. This week, that was up to 6.6m. The closest indicator in the UK is the number of people registering for Universal Credit, up nearly a million in only nine days. A lot of worklessness - that is, having nothing to do - is mitigated by the UK government pouring money into job retention schemes, both for the employed and the self-employed.   That may be a much bigger number than the government thought it would be. A lot of employers are turning to that as a means to keep people on their books, and to handle the sudden drying up of cash flow. Can we be sure those put on furlough will return to work? Not if employers are seeing it as a stepping stone to redundancy.  A downturn like this is an opportunity for companies to shake out inefficiencies. The jobs market has been very tight, putting workers in a strong position. But it's suddenly switched to giving bosses more leverage to cut their payroll costs. Football clubs show that happening. Putting workers on furlough for three months does not guarantee they'll be taking all those people back.  Trade unions are alert to the risk that this furlough could lead to redundancy, so they're pushing for furlough deals that will not lead to redundancy, such as the one announced for more than 30,000 employees of British Airways. One forecaster, the Bank of America, has estimated a drop in UK output of 7.4%, with most of that lost ground being made up next year.  But recovery, it said, depends on the UK Government and the Bank of England taking ever more unconventional measures.  That looks like a hint of much more money-printing (in reality, the buying of bonds using money created by the central bank, as only it can).  And to spark spending, it could push interest rates into negative territory, meaning we would have to pay the banks to look after our savings. A huge amount of government money has been committed to business grants, business rates holidays, loans and loan guarantees. That's borrowed money, of course, with the Debt Management Office saying that it's about to auction £45bn of bonds. The scale of the commitment is staggering. But for companies, borrowing money to get through this, however cheap that debt is, does not look that attractive to many in business, and less so when their banks add tough conditions when the government lending is put out into the market.  The government will back 80% of a loan with its guarantee, and banks have been looking to protect their position with demands of personal guarantees - on company directors' homes, for instance. One of the interesting things to watch in recent days is the way the banks have been prodded, pushed and then forced into relaxing the discipline they usually require of their customers. The financial regulator also stepped in to tell banks to ease up on individual customers, reducing the cost of overdrafts. Holidays are being required on loan repayments and credit card bills, without harming credit ratings. What banks fear is their loan books going badly sour.  Any shock or shakeout in the economy is going to push the weaker companies over the edge.  So we began to see the collapse of some that were already a bit shaky, for various reasons - Brighthouse, the rent-to-ownership retailer was one. Carluccio's restaurant chain was already closing outlets, including two in Scotland.  Debenhams was already working through a programme of closing 50 stores. On Friday, it set about protecting itself against creditors who are not being paid for supply of stock. Others will inevitably follow. The money being thrown at this crisis is intended to ensure it doesn't spread to those in fundamentally good financial health, with the potential to return to business as the economic lockdown is relaxed."
economic indicators,NI employment levels continue to fall,2024-09-15,2020-08-10,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-53685656,"Business activity in NI picked up last month, signalling economic recovery, but employment levels are continuing to fall, an Ulster Bank survey suggests.  Every month, the bank conducts a survey of a representative sample of firms. It is considered a reliable indicator of economic performance. Private sector firms are asked about output, staffing levels and exports.  Output and new orders picked up after sharp falls earlier in the year but employment levels continued to decline. Retail, manufacturing and construction have reported a strong rebound in growth coming from very low levels.  However services, the biggest sector in the Northern Ireland economy, is continuing to contract.  While some firms benefited from reopening, others are reporting that new work has not been as quick to return as expected. This survey links the speed of recovery to the pace of easing lockdown.  In comparison to other UK regions, Northern Ireland's rebound is lagging behind England, but outperforming Wales and Scotland. But challenges remain around profitability - rising costs including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) mean the squeeze on profit margins has intensified. Ulster Bank chief economist Richard Ramsey said a rise in demand in the domestic market boosted new orders. ""A further easing of lockdown restrictions in July helped secure growth in private sector activity for the first time in 17 months,"" he said. But he warned there will be further job losses ahead. ""The phasing out of the furlough scheme is anticipated to lead to further redundancies in the months ahead,"" he said. ""While the return to growth is welcome news it merely marks the start of a long road to recovery. There remains a huge gap relative to pre-pandemic levels of output/activity.  ""Bridging this gap will take years not months and the twin challenges of Covid-19 and Brexit will have to be navigated along the way."""
economic indicators,"Work-life balance in crisis, say Greens",2024-09-15,2018-10-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45750920,"People's free time should be recorded as a way to measure the UK's ""well-being"", the Green Party says. The party is calling for a ""Free Time Index"" and says that time spent outside work and commuting is a better measure of how well the UK is doing than GDP. Co-leader Sian Berry told the BBC work-life balance was ""in crisis"" and more people were working while commuting. The party also said it wanted paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.  Calling for new free time indicators to be included in the next Budget, Ms Berry told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Work-life balance is an incredibly important indicator of people's well-being and it is in crisis at the moment. ""People are constantly 'on', even when they are commuting. There's an enormous amount of unpaid caring going on which doesn't get measured, which doesn't leave people with very much free time either. We have got a mental health crisis and we think we should be measuring this.""  She added that other indicators of a healthy society should be measured, like ""resource use, housing affordability and health"". ""It should be used as a more important indicator than GDP of how our country is doing,"" Ms Berry said, arguing it could then be used to inform policy. Pressed on whether Green policies, which include a four-day working week, would mean less money to invest in infrastructure and public services, she said people with more fulfilling work and more free time could be more productive. The Green Party failed to make its hoped-for breakthrough in the 2017 general election, as its vote was squeezed by Labour. But it made headway in May's council elections, adding eight seats. Last year the party announced a four-day working week policy, amounting to a maximum of 35 hours, and there have been reports suggesting Labour is considering a similar policy, as a way of sharing technological advances with staff. In Friday's speech to the Greens' autumn conference in Bristol, Ms Berry promised ""radical common sense for the common good"" and said her party was a real alternative to Labour as ""we go further and we do it better"". She said the momentum behind calls for a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations ""feels absolutely unstoppable"" while her co-leader Jonathan Bartley described Brexit as a ""pitiful charade"".  Mr Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" in response to the threat from climate change, adding: ""We won't debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".  In response to the Greens' free time proposals, Len Shackleton, research fellow at the free market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ""GDP is not the only measure of how well the country is doing, but it is the most useful for comparisons with other countries and with the UK over time."" He said life satisfaction, happiness and anxiety indicators were already published by the Office for National Statistics, adding: ""We have regular time-use surveys which could be used to create something like what the Greens want. But what would it show, really?  ""People might have more time to spend with their families if unemployment rose dramatically. There are different perspectives within the family. ""Using GDP as our prime indicator cannot deal with these concerns, but nor can any other simple measure."" The ONS carried out a survey of leisure time in the UK in 2015, which suggested that UK men spent an average of six hours nine minutes a day on leisure activities - while women spent five hours 29 minutes. Most of that time was spent watching TV, listening to music or reading. There has been some research which suggests that using money to free up time is linked to increased happiness.  The coalition government attempted to measure the happiness of UK citizens and the first national well-being survey was published in 2012.  The ONS recently published its latest ""personal well-being"" statistics, which suggested that, compared with both the UK and the other countries, people in Northern Ireland had ""better average ratings across all personal well-being measures""."
economic indicators,Can pregnancy rates predict a recession?,2024-09-15,2018-02-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43195765,"The rate of women becoming pregnant begins to fall several months before the start of a recession, research from US academics suggests. Its authors said fertility rates might help predict economic downturns. They were more accurate than some traditional indicators, they said. The research shows the rate of conceptions stopped increasing and began to fall several quarters before the start of the last three recessions in the United States. Economists are frequently criticised for failing to accurately predict the direction of economic growth. Increasingly they are looking beyond traditional measures such as manufacturing output, retail spending and house prices to help build a more complex and accurate picture. ""We think that the factors behind the last three recessions also had a profound and rapid effect on fertility decisions,"" the report's authors said, summarising their findings. ""In fact, these factors seem to have impacted fertility decisions before large parts of the economy.""  The authors of Is Fertility a Leading Economic Indicator? tracked more than 100 million births in the United States between 1989 and 2016. They incorporated data on miscarriages and abortions. It was already accepted that birth rates fall in a downturn, but Daniel Hungerman, Kasey Buckles and Steven Lugauer found that conception rates drop several months before other signs of a recession become visible. ""We were surprised when we saw [the correlation] and then we were surprised no one had noticed it before,"" said Mr Hungerman. The paper found rates of conceptions grew more slowly, followed by rapid falls in the rate of conception starting several quarters before recessions begin. ""The nature of each recession has differed and so what conversation goes on at the kitchen table might be different, but I do think that people talk about the future when they try to have a baby and in aggregate they seem to do a good job thinking about it,"" says Mr Hungerman. The paper says for example that in December 2007 a poll of business leaders found they were optimistic about the future, although it later transpired that by then the recession had begun.  At that point the growth in conception rates had already been falling for several months, with the decline starting several quarters before the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.  There is also a correlation with the scale of the downturn.  Fertility sank more rapidly (by four percentage points) before the deeper 2007 recession than in the run up to the two previous dips in the early 90s and the early 2000s. Increasingly the collection of vast amounts of detailed data on everything from online searches to shopping and eating patterns is allowing economists to explore new sources of information on the economy. ""The huge amount of data is important,"" said Mr Hungerman. ""Even more important is the frequency. Most studies use annual level data but with ours we look within the year. ""For a lot of the anticipatory patterns we see they're measured in quarters or months. If you use annual level data you might miss that."" While it may not be simple to track conceptions in real time, the report's authors suggested proxy data such as the sale of fertility and pregnancy-related goods could be monitored. In a much discussed case several years ago, US retailer Target reportedly issued money-off coupons on baby items to a teenager after mining its sales data and identifying she was pregnant.  The academics also looked at what happened to conceptions at the end of the last three recessions. But they found the data was less clear cut.  The end of the 2007-08 recession was dubbed a ""jobless recovery"". Hungerman, Buckley and Lugauer found it was also a ""baby-less recovery."""
economic indicators,China's annual growth slowest in decades,2024-09-15,2019-01-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46941932,"China's economy grew at its slowest rate since 1990, stoking fears about the impact on the global economy. China expanded at 6.6% in 2018, official figures out Monday showed.  In the three months to December, the economy grew 6.4% from a year earlier, down from 6.5% in the previous quarter.  The data was in line with forecasts but underlines recent concern about weakening growth in the world's second-biggest economy.  China's rate of expansion has raised worries about the potential knock-on effect on the global economy. The trade war with the US has added to the gloomy outlook.  The official figures out Monday showed the weakest quarterly growth rate since the global financial crisis.  While China watchers advise caution with Beijing's official GDP numbers, the data is seen as a useful indicator of the country's growth trajectory. By Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia business correspondent China's economic slowdown is not news in itself. Beijing has broadcast this for several years, that it's going to focus on the quality not quantity of growth.  But still, we should be worried.  Slower growth in China means slower growth for the rest of the world.  It accounts for one-third of global growth. Jobs, exports, commodity producing nations - we all depend on China to buy stuff from us. Slower growth in China also means it is harder for China to address its mountain of debt, even with the Communist Party's undoubted ability to be able to support the economy.  Growth has been easing for years, but concern over the pace of the slowdown in China has risen in recent months as companies sound the alarm over the crucial market.  Earlier this month Apple warned weakness in China would hit its sales.  Carmakers and other firms have spoken out on the impact of the trade war with the US. China's government has been pushing to shift away from export-led growth to depend more on domestic consumption.  Policymakers in China have stepped up efforts in recent months to support the economy.  Those measures to boost demand include speeding-up construction projects, cutting some taxes, and reducing the level of reserves banks need to hold.  Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said the Chinese economy remained weak at the end of 2018 ""but held up better than many feared"".  ""Still, with the headwinds from cooling global growth and the lagged impact of slower credit growth set to intensify... China's economy is likely to weaken further before growth stabilises in the second half of the year."""
economic indicators,Half of Scots graduates 'underemployed',2024-09-15,2017-08-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-41075040,"Half of Scots who graduated from university and some college courses in the past five years are working in ""non-graduate"" jobs, according to the Office for National Statistics. A survey by the ONS suggested 52% are in jobs which do not require further or higher education qualifications. These include those with qualifications like HNDs and HNCs and higher levels of SVQs through to degree-level and up. But university leaders say the ONS definition of graduate is too broad. They cite different studies showing that up to 72% of full-time first degree leavers were in posts classified as professional employment six months after graduating from university. BBC Scotland is examining the lives of Generation Y, the ""millennials"" born between 1980 and 2000. There has been a steady increase in the number of people in this age bracket going into further education, with the number of students in Scotland on the rise. However, it has been suggested that many might not ultimately go into careers related to their studies - or even those considered graduate professions. The Office for National Statistics gathered information on graduate destinations as part of its annual population survey. It found that 51.8% of recent graduates - defined as those leaving full-time education within five years of the survey date with a level of higher education above A-level equivalent standard - were in a job which did not require this level of training.  The figure for the UK was a whole was 46.4%.  The data also suggest that many of this group may not go on to graduate-level jobs in future, with only about 40% of non-recent graduates - those who graduated more than five years ago - being in graduate jobs in 2016. The ONS defines non-graduate jobs as those which do not normally require the knowledge and skills devolved through higher education, listing examples including receptionists, sales assistants, many types of factory workers, care workers and home carers. They cite a report from the University of Warwick which notes concerns about the ""growing mismatch between skills and the knowledge developed on degree programmes and the requirements of employers"". However their definitions were challenged by Universities Scotland, who said the ONS figures ""define a graduate far more broadly than usual"", due to the inclusion of various HND and HNC level courses. Oliver Newton, policy and research director at the Edge Foundation, said there was ""a challenge on both sides of the equation"". He said: ""On the one hand we're bringing out more graduates than we need in some areas, and on the other some of those graduates don't necessarily have the skills and work experience that employers are looking for. ""The UK has one of the highest rates of graduate underemployment, people who have got a degree but aren't necessarily using it for a job that requires one."" Cat Taylor studied history at undergraduate level, and then did a postgraduate degree in 18th century cultures. She said she didn't think of having any other options when leaving school but said she realised she was ""not very employable"" at the end of the academic process. The 29-year-old now works front-of-house in a museum, something she ""never"" thought she would be doing while she was studying. She said: ""I'm glad I did my degree, because I loved it. But if I could look back in time I don't think I would make the same choices again. ""The whole thing makes me feel kind of like I wasted a lot of time. I don't really think I did, because I do love what I did, I love learning - but I didn't need to do any of it to be where I am now.  ""I never thought that this would be what I'm doing, but admittedly I'm not entirely certain what I thought I was going to; I thought I would do my degree and then that would open up opportunities to me. I don't think that happened. ""I would tell 16-year-old me that 'you're going to have to go to university because you don't have any clue about what else you could do. But study IT, study something which is useful, study nursing'."" Others who didn't go to university have highlighted how other paths can work out. One 27-year-old woman became an overhead lines apprentice for Scottish and Southern Energy after applying for the role after seeing it advertised online. She said: ""I was speaking to a lot of friends and family, a lot of whom had their own trades - very few of my family had went to university. ""I saw them with good career prospects and good money coming in, so I thought, why not? Why go to university when I could be earning money doing this? ""I chose an apprenticeship because I love being outside and I love hands-on learning. The idea of getting a good qualification as well as earning a wage really appealed to me. You're guaranteed a job at the end of this. ""I think the best idea would be to really think it through, speak to as many people as possible, your family and friends. Do your research about where you could go, what sort of jobs you might like, and above all pick something you're passionate about and that excites you."" On the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Robert Wright, a professor of economics at Strathclyde University, said many graduates enjoy much better prospects than those who do not go in to further education - but added that some do find themselves ""underemployed"". He said: ""If we look at the data, even through the recession graduates of higher education institutions do much better on average than non-graduates in terms of employment and earnings. We can say with some confidence that they still have much better prospects than those without that education. ""But that's a general statement, on average. There are certainly graduates who do not do so well, find themselves underemployed in jobs which do not require their skills, and they remain in these jobs for long periods of time. ""To me it's clearly the case that underemployment is an indicator that what's being supplied by the higher education sector is not clearly a match for what's being demanded. ""There is this mismatch. But then again we have to think about what the role of further and higher education is; is it only to get people into the job market for work? Some people say that should be the main priority and I don't disagree with that. ""But the other issue that is important here is whether or not the taxpayers should be paying for underemployment, Should there be free tuition fees for people who end up with a university degree, working in non-graduate jobs?"" Luke Humberstone, president of the National Union of Students, said students can pick up skills at university which can transfer into other areas, without necessarily staying in the professions they studied for. He said: ""We've got to consider what's best for the individual. Yes, some students may want to use their skills that they gained at university, but some others might simply be able to get a job that suits them. ""It's not just about getting graduate employment, it might be that they start their own businesses and contribute to society that way. Education in our society is a public good, and I think that increasingly society believes that."" Universities Scotland said the ONS had taken an unusual approach to how graduates are defined, pointing instead to figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency which show a ""very different"" picture. Director Alastair Sim said the figures ""define a graduate far more broadly than usual as they include anyone holding a qualification above A-level. The picture is very different for university graduates. ""72% of graduates with first degrees, who go into the labour market, are working in professional occupations within just six months. By then, the average university graduate is earning £22,500. The percentage of graduates working in graduate-level careers continues to grow in the years that follow and three and a half years after university almost 9 of every 10 are happy with their careers to date. ""Universities work really hard to support graduate employability. This is reflected in very positive employability figures and high employer satisfaction. We also value the minority of graduates who choose to continue their studies or combine more study with part-time employment."" Scottish government education minister Jamie Hepburn pointed to statistics which showed very low unemployment among young people, and also highlighted the HESA figures. He said: ""I do recognise there is an issue with underemployment, but I'd urge people to look at the evidence before us.  ""What [HESA] found here in Scotland was some three and a half years after graduation, graduates from Scottish universities will earn on average £500 more a year than their English graduate counterparts and £2,500 more a year than those who've gone to Welsh and Northern Irish universities. That seems to me to be a positive outcome. ""I do recognise that underemployment is a genuine issue. I'm not suggesting that everything is absolutely correct here in Scotland, and that's why for example we're taking forward the developing young workforce agenda, which is now in place across the entirety of Scotland, bringing employers and the educational environment closer together to make sure people coming out of their school experience are better equipped for the world of work."" Colleges Scotland said students graduated with ""work-ready skills"", and said they worked closely with schools, universities and employers to ""support the economic and social needs of their regions"". Chief Executive Shona Struthers said: ""Colleges are increasingly becoming the route of choice for young people progressing on to university, with the Scottish government's agenda on widening access to higher education increasingly being delivered by colleges supporting over 90% of the growth in entry to university by disadvantaged students since 2006. ""Scotland's colleges remain committed to further development of relationships with employers, to ensure closer alignment to make the best use of talented graduates who are keen to gain meaningful employment and contribute to society, and meet the needs of the labour market.""

economic indicators,"Scottish unemployment falls by 1,000",2024-09-15,2018-01-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-42802344,"Scotland's jobless total fell by 1,000 in the autumn, according to official figures. Data from the Office for National Statistics showed that unemployment had dropped to 112,000 between September and November. UK unemployment fell by 3,000 to 1.44 million. Scotland's jobless rate stands at 4% - below the UK figure of 4.3%. Meanwhile, Scotland's employment rate for those of working age fell by 0.2%, to 75%.  The total number in work north of the border now stands at just under 2.56 million. Scotland's Employability Minister Jamie Hepburn said: ""These latest figures show 97,000 more people in employment compared to the pre-recession peak in Scotland's economy and labour market, with rises in the numbers of people in work over the quarter and the year. ""It is also encouraging to see youth unemployment and female employment rates continuing to outperform the rest of the UK."" In commenting on the latest export figures for Scotland, the UK government's Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: ""I cautiously welcome today's labour market statistics.  ""But we know the Scottish economy continues to lag behind the rest of the UK, reinforcing the need to maintain our trade with the rest of the UK."" Meanwhile, wages in the UK rose at their fastest rate in almost a year, according to the latest ONS figures.  But the 2.4% growth in wages remained below inflation, which stood at 3.1% in November - leaving real wages lower than they were a year earlier. The Fraser of Allander economic institute said the labour market data showed that headline indicators ""remained robust"" over the period. Stuart McIntyre, from the institute, said: ""Scotland's unemployment rate is around its record low rate, and the employment rate is similarly around its record high.  ""Nevertheless, economic growth remains fragile in Scotland. This is one reason why wage growth is muted.  ""Wages are growing more slowly than inflation, meaning that while a near record percentage of the labour market are in employment, households budgets are feeling squeezed."""
economic indicators,What next in Scotland's housing market?,2024-09-15,2022-10-19,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-63320045,"As soaring price inflation, the prospect of recession and of a prolonged European war have closed in on the economy, the housing market appears to have bounced along merrily, as if oblivious. It's not as if they're linked to the price of oil, gas or food, which have driven inflation to 10.1% in the year to August.  The latest house price index, published on Wednesday, shows the average price paid for a Scottish home in August was 9.7% up on the same month last year.  That's down from the 11% rise in the year to July, and down from the 15.1% published a year ago. The English market has seen more volatility in price inflation, partly through the distorting effect of transaction tax holidays - used by the Treasury to stimulate the market as the country came out of recession. Prices in the year to August in England were up 14.3% - down from July's inflation rate of 16.8% - with the average price reaching £315,000. That figure is pulled up by London and the south-east, which have seen more subdued increases in recent years. Price inflation across the UK, with Wales also seeing some lively numbers, means that the average home has gained £36,000 in value over the past year - ahead of average pre-tax full-time earnings. Much of this has to do with the pandemic. The enforced shutdown of the market for parts of 2020 was followed by a burst of pent-up demand, driven by people who had realised during lockdown that they could do with more space. Many saved quite a lot during the pandemic, which they could put into a house purchase. Many also found they could live and work further from the office. So the price of a des res detached home with a bit of space in the country, especially near the coast, has risen fastest of all. The latest figures from Registers of Scotland show the price of a detached home is up by 13% to £349,000 on average, while flats were up 6.7% to £134,000. Aberdeen registered barely any increase, while other bigger cities were close to the national average. The council areas with the biggest increases were Argyll, Highland and the islands. East Lothian and the Borders have been hot spots for rising prices recently, but both saw more modest price increases in these latest figures.  There's a health warning with these figures, though, as they can be skewed by small numbers of transactions, and August can be a quiet month. The big driver of home price inflation in recent years has been the mismatch of supply and demand. Estate agents and surveyors note that there aren't enough homes coming on to the market while demand has remained higher.  When they are put up for sale, the blind bidding system usually used in Scotland is competitive.  To illustrate the point, I'll declare a personal interest: I recently sold my terraced house in Glasgow. There were 13 bidders, and it went for more than 30% above the home report valuation. That, incidentally, puzzles me as to the point or the meaning of a home report valuation. Last year saw the highest number of transactions since 2007, partly to catch up on the lower number in the first year of the pandemic. Registers of Scotland tells us that transaction numbers were down by more than a fifth in the year to June. And according to a specialist in the economics of the housing market, John Boyle at Rettie estate agents, that is at least as important a number to watch if we are to understand the market.  His preferred indicator of market health is the number of sales multiplied by the average price, and since the financial crash of 2008, that has been much lower than it was. Looking ahead, Mr Boyle is one of the market watchers who expects to see the broader economy closing in on house price inflation and dampening it, though not necessarily by driving prices down. That only happens where people are forced to sell - for instance due to divorce or a need to move home for work. What we've seen in recent years is that those who have to move, but cannot sell at the price they want, will often rent out and become tenants elsewhere.   And there's repossession due to mortgage default, which was a feature of past recessions. That is less likely now because affordability checks ahead of agreeing to lend have been much more stringent since 2008. Banks, or at least their regulator, are wary of the destabilising effect it can have on the economy. If homes don't have to be sold, that squeezes supply even further, and holds up prices. Mr Boyle says the mid-to-upper level market has continued to fare quite well, depending on cash buyers and those on secure, higher salaries.  Cash buyers have grown as a share of the market, to around a third. They have an advantage in bidding contests over those who have yet to secure a mortgage or have other houses to sell first. The lower-to-middle market is more exposed and dependent on mortgages. With monthly payments at exceptionally low levels since 2009, home prices adjusted upwards to affordability based on those low mortgage costs.  But as they rise - which they were bound to do eventually, but with the recent budget bùrach in Downing Street turbocharging them - they are making it more difficult to make that second or third step up.  The Registers of Scotland figures are accurate about transactions that have to be registered with that office, but they are backward looking. Deals closed in August were typically struck in spring, before it became clear that the economy was heading downhill. More up-to-date assessments of the market come from Halifax, part of the same group as Bank of Scotland. It says UK prices in the year to August were up 9.9% with inflation on a falling trend. Scotland's prices rose, but by 8.5%, falling from 9.3% inflation over the year. Rightmove, which has a strong grip on the property advertising market, reported that Scotland has seen 6.6% growth in prices in the past year, and it is taking an average 24 days to secure a sale. The UK increase for Rightmove is 7.8% and falling. It notes the recent political and interest rate turmoil has hit the first-time buyer market. Its report this week showed a drop in the number of such people engaged with buying, while those who have a mortgage offer are rushing to complete the purchase before interest rates rise further. The monthly market review by RICS, the surveyors organisation, is the best measure of what lies ahead. It reported buyer enquiries in Scotland have recently fallen for third consecutive month. While limited supply is still supporting a modest price rise, this looks set to end as the pace of house price inflation slows. Looking to the remaining weeks of this year, price and sales expectations are now slightly negative. That does not tell you how much prices or sales might fall - only that the number of upbeat surveyors is smaller than the downbeat ones. If this is a turning point in the market, what is a potential buyer to do? Wait to see if prices fall, or jump into the market in case mortgage costs rise further?  There's no simple answer. It depends on circumstances, of where you are, how long you can stay there, where you want to be, and how you intend to finance it."
economic indicators,What jobs are available post-lockdown?,2024-09-15,2020-07-21,By Bill Wilson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53414413,"Covid-19 has had an impact on nearly all aspects of life, including people's work. The world of work is changing - and some sectors appear to be in a much stronger position than others. According to the latest jobs market report from employment website CV-Library, the number of job vacancies in the UK fell by 62.7% in the second quarter of 2020.  And for those jobs that are being advertised, competition is stiff, with the average application-to-job ratio rising by 84%. The report is the latest in a series of snapshots trying to predict - by looking at online job vacancies - where workplace opportunities might be increasing or shrinking. So, with more people battling it out for jobs, which industries are actually hiring staff? And which face a more uncertain future? From software engineers to web developers, to online security specialists, this sector is expanding. Digital skills are required in all industries, from e-commerce to automating processes in factories. ""It is encouraging that we are seeing indications of growth for roles like IT professionals and designers, which will be critical for many firms as they adapt to meet the challenges of a changed market,"" says Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), which monitors the number of active job postings in the UK. But a word of caution, there is also lots of competition in the sector as Alison's story here demonstrates. Since the start of lockdown in March, we have all been shopping a lot more online, and that has seen an increase in people being hired in the sector. Online giant Amazon has created 15,000 new full and part-time warehouse and delivery driver jobs across the UK in goods fulfilment centres, where orders are processed, and in its logistics network.  Verity Stephens is a member of the Team GB judo squad and an instructor in the sport but saw her job evaporate in  lockdown. ""I run extra-curricular judo programmes in schools across Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire - teaching about 250 children a week,"" she says. ""I literally went from having a full schedule to nothing in 24 hours."" She now helps process goods entering Amazon's warehouse and order centre at Coalville, Leicestershire. Meanwhile, delivery company Hermes is creating 10,500 jobs, as it looks to hire 1,500 full-time staff across its delivery network and head office, and 9,000 freelance couriers. With pubs and restaurants having been closed during lockdown we have all been eating at home an awful lot more. And increased demand for groceries has seen ""a knock-on in jobs demand"", says Richard Lim, chief executive of analysts Retail Economics.    Between them, supermarkets have taken on more than 50,000 workers during the coronavirus outbreak, and while many have been temporary posts, full-time jobs have been created too. ""The increase in food retail jobs has been in three different areas: in-store - doing things like replenishing shelves, in online order processing in the huge new warehouses that have sprung up, and in logistics taking food deliveries to customers' doors,"" says Mr Lim. Large goods vehicle (LGV) drivers are in demand, according to the latest REC survey, and this work sector dovetails with many of those mentioned above. (Under UK and European law, the LGV driving licence and HGV licence are the same licence.) Whether it is taking stock to an Amazon warehouse to be shelved and then put into customer orders, or taking extra deliveries to individual supermarkets, goods are being moved by road. According to the REC, those who can build vehicles and repair them are also being sought by employers. The demand comes against a backdrop of warnings in the industry during the past few years that there is an acute shortage of drivers. Last winter, trade body the FTA warned there was a shortage of 59,000 drivers in the country. Domestic cleaners were hit hard with the imposition of lockdown in March, being prevented from visiting clients' homes. That caused problems for small firms such as this one run by Louise and Liam Parkinson. But with restrictions easing, the last month has been ""a bit of a whirlwind"", says Liam. ""The phone's not stopped ringing. The one thing we've seen is people ringing up wanting to book us because we're a small family-run business and they want to support local businesses. We've had quite a few new customers and have had to employ someone."" As well as a rise in demand for domestic cleaners, businesses are also hiring again, with recruitment website Indeed now showing more than 10,000 cleaning roles. Recent vacancies listed have included jobs for supermarkets Aldi, Lidl and Iceland, businesses such as Wetherspoons and Ladbrokes, and for places such as holiday cottages and schools. According to trade body the British Cleaning Council there has been an increase in demand for cleaners in all sectors of the economy, but particularly in the healthcare and hospital sector as the public wants to see visible signs of cleaning. Anyone paying attention to the news in recent months could not have failed to notice the deluge of High Street retailers announcing job cuts since March.   Boots, Burberry, Cath Kidston, Clark's, Dixons Carphone, Harrods, John Lewis Partnership, Monsoon, Oasis, Quiz, River Island, TM Lewin, Topshop, Very, Wickes and Zara have all said jobs were to be lost or at risk. This week Ted Baker and Marks & Spencer joined that list with hundreds more jobs at risk. ""The general picture around retail jobs is the difference between food and non-food jobs,"" says Richard Lim of Retail Economics. ""While food retailing has flourished, the non-food sector is in crisis mode as sales and jobs have been obliterated."" According to the REC, one of the sectors that saw job advertisements contract in mid-July was that of ""publicans and managers of licensed premises"". One London publican who spoke to the BBC, but asked not to be named, said: ""Coronavirus is a big issue. A lot of pubs are still shut and a lot of publicans are in limbo because of the furlough scheme, so there is no need to advertise for vacancies as there actually won't be many."" He added: ""Even in normal times it is very hard to make money in this job, and the hours are very long too, so it might not appear very enticing to those looking for a less-demanding type of work."" Meanwhile, independent eating and drinking outlets, such as this one in the north west of England, say they have been forced to scale back their businesses due to the coronavirus outbreak. One sector hit hard by coronavirus has been the UK events sector, that is those firms who put on trade shows, exhibitions and conferences. Such gatherings are still not allowed. Companies such as this one have seen their existence, and staff jobs, threatened by the coronavirus shutdown. Some 70% of 1,100 trade shows and exhibitions due to run this year have been cancelled, says trade body the Events Industry Alliance. And it warns that could put at risk a quarter of jobs in the sector, some 30,000 posts. Large gatherings such as the Southampton International Boat Show, originally scheduled for September, have been cancelled, as the organisers still don't know whether the event would even be allowed by then. Beauty salons are to fully reopen on 1 August, but the British Beauty Council has warned lockdown has been a struggle for the sector, which employs about 200,000 people. Council boss Millie Kendall told the BBC: ""Starting with the beginning of lockdown, and the applications for grants and loans, and furlough, it has been very challenging for the industry. ""We are probably looking at 11% redundancies across the board in our industry. This is going to affect microbusinesses more than some of the bigger corporations."" The travel industry has been brought to its knees during the pandemic, with much international travel banned. Even with flying restrictions easing, some countries including the UK have introduced quarantine measures for people returning from certain destinations. Back in April, British Airways announced 12,000 possible job cuts from its 42,000-strong workforce, with both cabin crew and pilots affected. Easyjet is also cutting 1,300 cabin crew and 727 pilots, while Virgin Atlantic is cutting 3,500 staff. Meanwhile, Ryanair staff have agreed to take temporary pay cuts in order to keep their jobs. The future for the industry remains unclear, with IAG, the parent company of British Airways, warning it could take ""several years"" for air travel to return to 2019 levels."
economic indicators,Private sector output declines for fourth month,2024-09-15,2022-09-12,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62873215,"Northern Ireland's private sector output declined for a fourth consecutive month in August as inflation hit consumer demand, an Ulster Bank survey suggests. The monthly survey of about 200 firms is considered a reliable indicator of the private sector economy. In August, the retail sector showed the steepest decline in business activity. However, the manufacturing sector showed an improved performance with output increasing slightly. The bank's chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said ""positives were thin on the ground"" in the latest survey. He added that although employment growth continued, it was at the weakest pace in 18 months and many firms continued to struggle to find suitable candidates to fill vacancies.  Mr Ramsey said the ""one silver lining"" with the downturn in demand is that it appears to be easing the pressures on overstretched supply chains. The UK as a whole is being hit by an energy price shock which is threatening to tip the economy into recession. Last week the government announced a multi-billion pound package of measures intended to temporarily protect households and businesses from further price rises. It is not yet clear how those measures will be implemented in Northern Ireland which has a different energy system from the rest of the UK. Later this week, a range of official statistics will give some insight into how the Northern Ireland economy performed during the second quarter of this year."
economic indicators,Inequality driving 'deaths of despair',2024-09-15,2019-05-14,By Sean Coughlan and David Brown,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-48229037,"Widening inequalities in pay, health and opportunities in the UK are undermining trust in democracy, says an Institute for Fiscal Studies report. The think tank warns of runaway incomes for high earners but rises in ""deaths of despair"", such as from addiction and suicide, among the poorest. It warns of risks to ""centre-ground"" politics from stagnating pay and divides in health and education. The report says such widening gaps are ""making a mockery of democracy"". The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), one of the country's leading research institutes, is launching what it says is the UK's biggest analysis of inequality. That will be chaired by Nobel Prize-winning economist Prof Sir Angus Deaton. He said ""people were troubled by inequality"" more than at any time since the 1940s - and the impact was so serious that it suggested ""democratic capitalism is broken"". He warned of the dangers of disillusionment if people did not feel fairly rewarded for their work - and that extreme wealth seemed to be gained by ""taking rather than making"". Sir Angus said ""people getting rich is a good thing"" but not if it meant ""enriching the few at the expense of the many"". At the outset of this review, the IFS has published indicators of inequality - such as the average chief executive of a FTSE 100 company now earning 145 times the average salary, up from 47 times in 1998. It suggests pay inequality in the UK is high by international standards - with the share of household income going to the richest 1% having tripled in the past three decades. The middle classes are also under pressure, particularly younger generations, with stagnant pay and unaffordable house prices. The long-term decline in trade union membership is identified as another factor in wages not increasing. As well as inequality in income, the think tank highlights divergence in health. It says there is almost a 10-year gap in male life expectancy between the richest and poorest areas - and the IFS warns of ""deaths of despair"", with a rise in early deaths from drug and alcohol abuse and suicide being linked to factors such as poverty, social isolation and mental health problems. Patterns of relationship are also affected by inequality, the study suggests. Over recent decades, wealthier people have become more likely to be living in a couple, either married or co-habiting, the IFS says. But among the poor, declining numbers are living with a partner, a pattern attributed to increasing job insecurity, a lack of financial independence and more ""chaotic lives"". The big picture, says the IFS, is the UK is becoming more like the US, with a concentration of wealth at the top and pressure on working families lower down the pay scale. It says that in the US, increases in life expectancy have stalled and that for non-graduate male workers, pay has not risen in real terms for five decades. ""The risk is that the UK may follow a similar path,"" says the IFS study. The IFS warns of the social tensions that will come with an economic landscape built on widening inequality. As economic think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported recently, this is likely to put pressure on the middle classes as well as those on low incomes. University science researcher James Hutchinson, in his 30s, feels he has kept his side of the bargain - gaining a degree from Cambridge - and now working as an academic as well as raising a family with his partner. But he feels a sense of ""powerlessness"" about the cost of housing and that his work has no job security, with a series of short-term contracts. ""It's not a sob story,"" says Dr Hutchinson, ""But if people feel they can't improve their lot, then they feel disconnected."" ""We were sold the idea that academic success is the way to be better off,"" he says. His partner Bethany has decided not to work because she can't afford childcare. She says ""for me as a parent, I didn't feel comfortable with us being separated... and then working all hours."" They live in Bristol and struggled to get somewhere they could afford to live - currently the family all sleep in one room while they patch up their home. Dr Hutchinson recognises that he's ""more privileged than many"" - earning the average for UK graduates of £35,000 per year - but he voices a frustration at a lack of progress and fears that things could get even worse for his children. The ""disconnect"" comes, he says, from his generation becoming ""increasingly aware of your own expendability"" and a work culture haunted by a ""constant lack of security"". Dr Hutchinson is sceptical that any of the political rhetoric will translate into real improvements.   ""How do we build a functional society out of dysfunctional lives?"" he asks. The consumer society is afraid of becoming the consumed."
economic indicators,Car production slumps to lowest level since 1984,2024-09-15,2021-01-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55817920,"The number of new cars built in the UK last year fell by a third to just under 921,000, the lowest total since 1984, latest industry figures reveal. Output was 920,928 vehicles, a 29.3% fall on 2019, rounding off a ""dreadful year"", Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders chief Mike Hawes said. Pandemic-enforced plant closures and falling consumer demand meant the worst output ""in a generation"", he said. But he said the vaccine roll out and EU trade deal inspired optimism for 2021  Production for UK and export markets fell 30.4% and 29.1% respectively last year. Eight in ten UK-built cars still head overseas, which Mr Hawes said reinforced the importance of tariff-free trade with the EU. The EU remained the UK's biggest export destination, taking a 53.5% share, despite volumes falling 30.8% to 400,460 units.  In December, output was down 2.3% to 71,403 vehicles, with some manufacturers, including Honda, affected by border closures and subsequent component supply issues.  Shipments to the US, Japan and Australia last year all fell, down 33.7%, 21.6% and 21.8% respectively. Exports to China, however, ended the year up 2.3%, and those to South Korea and Taiwan also rose 3.6% and 16.7% respectively as these nations travelled on different trajectories in dealing with the pandemic.  Despite the gloom, the UK continued to roll out battery electric, plug-hybrid and hybrid vehicles to buyers at home and around the world. Combined production of these models rose to 18.8% of all cars made in Britain, up from 14.8% a year before. Mr Hawes said: ""These figures, the worst in a generation, reflect the devastating impact of the pandemic... The industry faces 2021 with more optimism, however, with a vaccine being rolled out and clarity on how we trade with Europe, which remains by far our biggest market.  ""The immediate challenge is to adapt to the new conditions, to overcome the additional customs burdens and regain our global competitiveness while delivering zero emission transport."" Independent forecasts say UK car production will partly recover in 2021 to one million, but Mr Hawes said much will depend on the continued impact of the virus, the speed with which showrooms can reopen, and how quickly manufacturers can come to terms with new trading arrangements with the EU, which he described as ""much more complicated"". He hoped the latest figures reflected the ""lowest ebb"" for the industry, but added that significant investment would be needed to return to the figure of 1.7 million reported in 2016.  This is terrible news for car makers and workers, and in the old days when economic growth was the overriding indicator of a nation's success, it would be 100% bad. But now climate change is also a priority, and some argue that requires a new perspective. If fewer cars are bought, it's likely to mean fewer miles driven - and that's exactly what the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says we need to combat climate change and air pollution (which is still produced even from electric car tyres and brakes). The young are already shunning driving in favour of Uber in a trend that will swell if driverless taxis ever hit the road. Many city councils want green, calm streets with people walking and cycling on space taken back from cars.  Suppose a two-car family sells one and buys a bike: is this a fear, or an aspiration - or both?"
economic indicators,"More workers than pre-pandemic, payroll data shows",2024-09-15,2021-07-15,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-57846904,"The number of workers on company payrolls in Northern Ireland surpassed pre-pandemic levels in June, official data suggests. HMRC payroll data is the most timely and best single overall indicator of the labour market. The figures showed an estimated 757,200 employees in June, above the level in February 2020. It includes furloughed employees, who numbered around 59,000 at the end of May. The furlough scheme is due to end in October and it has already begun to taper off.  That may be contributing to an increase in redundancies: 150 were proposed in May, 490 in June and a further 850 in the first two weeks of July. Recent redundancies have been announced in the aerospace sector, which is expected to face the slowest recovery from the pandemic. The introduction of the furlough scheme helped to stabilise the job market near the start of the pandemic crisis. Nonetheless the number of people on payrolls fell sharply to below 740,000. It has recovered strongly as lockdown restrictions have been eased, up by a further 1.4% in June. Other statistics also point to a generally improving jobs market. The total number of weekly hours worked (26.6 million) increased by 5% over the quarter (March-May) and 13% over the year, but remains 7% below the pre-pandemic value (December-February 2020). Households reported, via the Labour Force Survey, some improvements over the quarter to March-May with an increase in the employment rate, no change in the unemployment rate, and a decrease in the economic inactivity rate. One area where recovery has not happened is self-employment. An estimated 96,000 people were self employed in the quarter March-May compared to 103,000 in the previous quarter and 131,000 in the same quarter in 2020."
economic indicators,Will the US target Venezuelan oil?,2024-09-15,2019-01-27,By Daniel Gallas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47023002,"In its battle against the rule of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, the United States has been trying to cripple the government's ability to secure funds and run the country - with sanctions that target officials, some sectors of the economy and its official cryptocurrency. But so far it has not yet used what many call ""the nuclear option"" - a full oil embargo, targeting the industry that is responsible for 90% of the government's revenues. Despite the rhetoric between Nicolás Maduro and President Donald Trump, refineries in the US are still buying Venezuelan petroleum. Venezuela's state company PDVSA even owns refineries in Texas through a subsidiary called CITGO. But with the crisis escalating after Washington backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó's claim to the presidency last week, a new round of sanctions is expected in the coming days. On Saturday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo failed to secure backing from the United Nations Security Council against Venezuela, as China and Russia are close Maduro allies. President Maduro backed down from his demand that US diplomats leave the country and said both countries now have a 30-day window to negotiate the new terms of their relationship. Markets are watching now for what the US will do next. Despite its failure in the Security Council, the Trump administration has support from big regional players such as Brazil, Argentina and Colombia. If it does finally move against Venezuelan oil, could that be the nail in the coffin of the country's oil industry, which has been in a crisis of its own for years? And what effect could that have for the rest of the world? A boom in US shale production has helped slash crude prices over the past four years, although they have recovered slightly. But 2019 is shaping up to be a very challenging year for the commodity, and there is no clear indication on which way prices will move. Oil is never a predictable affair, however, and there are many situations that could cause prices to spike. Production is very volatile in Nigeria and Libya. Iran is under a heavy US embargo. Russia and Saudi Arabia are cutting production. Finally there are fears of a global slowdown in the economy which could see prices fall due to a drop in demand. The crisis in Venezuela is another scenario watched closely by oil analysts. There is a general sense in markets that Nicolás Maduro will not be removed from power in the near future and that tensions will keep on rising. Also most analysts discard the full ""nuclear option"", as that would have a devastating impact on the people of Venezuela, instead of just hitting the government. One of the most likely scenarios discussed is a partial restriction of how much oil the US can buy from Venezuela. That would hurt consumers in America and in the rest of the world. Prices would rise as refineries would have to buy their share of oil from more expensive sources. American refineries that buy from Venezuela would also be negatively affected. But US restrictions would benefit Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Iraq - countries that also produce the same variety of heavy crude oil (Canada also produces heavy crude but it does not have logistic capability to increase its exports). These countries have been eating into Venezuela's market share for years. Venezuela would be the biggest loser of all, of course. The country has the world's largest proven oil reserves - even bigger than Saudi Arabia - but it is rapidly running out of money to prospect for crude and pump it out of the ground. In the late 1990s, Venezuela was producing more than three million barrels of oil per day. Output today is hovering above the one million mark, according to experts. Even without any international sanctions Venezuela's oil production will decline dramatically this year because of the lack of investment. The rate of decline in production has been more intense in recent months. Helima Croft, from RBC Capital Markets, forecasts that output this year will drop by 300,000 to 500,000 barrels per day without any sanctions. Restrictions from Washington would accelerate the decline. Venezuela would be able to re-route part of its production to other buying nations, like China, but it wouldn't be able to pass on all of its excess oil to markets not aligned with the US. Venezuela is still seen as an oil powerhouse, especially because it is a producer of heavy crude, which is a variety not widely available in the world. But the severity of its economic crisis may be changing that. ""It will require billions in investment to repair the infrastructure and kick start a recovery. The talented technocrats that once made PDVSA one of the premier national oil companies continue to flee in droves,"" she told the BBC. ""Even if a reformist government comes to power, the international community will have to launch a major reconstruction and rehabilitation effort to get the country back up on its feet."" The IMF now publishes separate indicators for Venezuela in its Latin American analysis. The economy there has become such an outlier that it makes no sense to compare it to other countries. This year Venezuela's GDP is expected to reach a new low: the economy will be half the size of what it was in 2013. Last year the government tried again to use oil to solve its economic woes. It ended subsidies, raised the price of fuel domestically and ramped up its campaign to use a cryptocurrency allegedly pegged to barrels of oil. Still it failed to contain inflation, which is thought to have crossed the million per cent mark, and did not end its shortages of food and medicine. It's hard to imagine life getting any harder for people in Venezuela. Now with fresh sanctions on the cards, it just may."
economic indicators,'Hunt takes charge' in 'astounding' U-turn on tax,2024-09-15,2022-10-17,By BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-63294249,"All of the papers focus on Liz Truss and her government's efforts to restore its economic credibility. The Sun says the prime minister sat silent in the Commons as the new chancellor ripped up the mini-Budget. It describes her as being ""the ghost PM"".  The Financial Times says she was ""pale and motionless"" as she listened to Jeremy Hunt ""read the last rites"" on her economic plan.  In his sketch in the Times, Quentin Letts calls her ""a wraith in a state of shock"".  The Daily Mail says watching Ms Truss put on a ""brave face"" was ""excruciating"".  ""Humiliated"" is the Daily Mirror's take.  The Guardian says Mr Hunt ""shredded"" the prime minister's economic policies in one of the most astonishing U-turns in modern political history. Offering an assessment on the chancellor's performance, the i says he took charge.  Christopher Hope writes in the Daily Telegraph that Mr Hunt ""disembowelled his boss with the calmness of an HR manager firing someone over Zoom"".  The Daily Express says he ""showed signs of being someone who just might have the mettle to navigate the government through the choppy waters that lie ahead"".  There's plenty of speculation about the prime minister's future.  The Telegraph reports that Conservative rebels have sped up plots to oust her from office. The paper also says Ms Truss is expected to have a second meeting this week with the Tory MP and chairman of the influential 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady - a move that is ""likely to be seen as an indicator that her position is now hanging by a thread"". The Daily Mail's editorial says the time has come for the ""wise men and women"" of the Conservative party to decide whether the loss of confidence in the prime minister is ""terminal"". And if it is ""they must come to a solution - and fast - that can command the support of MPs and the ""millions of Tory voters looking on in horror"".  The Sun's comment piece says if Ms Truss can't ""quickly sort herself out"", then the ""grown-ups"" will need to agree a ""peaceful transition to a sensible figure"". It also says the thought of her having to appear at Prime Minister's Questions this week is ""almost tragic"". The i reports that opponents of Liz Truss are still seeking a unity candidate to replace her, if she is forced out. Leading contenders, such as Rishi Sunak, are seen as too divisive to rally the Tory party and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has insisted he does not want to take over.  An anonymous former minister has told the paper that if a unity candidate can be found then Ms Truss would be ""gone in a heartbeat"".  A government insider has told the Express that the prime minister will survive because a replacement cannot be agreed on and there will be a ""protracted death"".  Some of the papers report on Sir Rod Stewart supporting a Ukrainian family of seven that has moved to the UK. He has rented a house for them in Berkshire.  The Express says he found the home, furnished it and pledged to cover their bills for at least a year.   He is quoted in the Mirror as saying he usually prefers to keep his charitable efforts ""nice and quiet""  - but hoped that by making his actions public others might be inspired to help too."
economic indicators,China exports miss expectations,2024-09-15,2015-04-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-32281957,"China's economy grew by 7.4% in 2014, its weakest for almost 25 years China's monthly trade data shows exports fell in March from a year ago by 14.6% in yuan terms, compared to expectations for a rise of more than 8%. Imports meanwhile fell 12.3% in yuan terms compared to forecasts for a fall of more than 11%. The numbers mean the country's monthly trade surplus has shrunk to its smallest in 13 months.  China's economy grew by 7.4% in 2014, its weakest for almost 25 years. Analysts said recent indicators showed further signs the slowdown is continuing. In US dollar terms, China's exports for the month fell 15%, while imports fell 12.7%. Currency conversion factors based on US dollar and Chinese yuan movements over the last year mean some official numbers from the mainland are now reported in both currencies.  The official March data leaves the country with a monthly trade surplus of 18.16bn Chinese yuan ($2.92bn; £1.99bn). In February, China's monthly trade surplus hit a record $60.6bn, as exports grew and imports slid back. In US dollar terms, China's exports for the month fell 15% while imports fell 12.7% Analysts said the export numbers for March were a surprise.  ""We can understand the imports fell because of falling imports of commodities, but exports fell so much, it was very much unexpected,"" said Shanghai-based analyst Nie Wen from Hwabao Trust.  However, he said one major reason for the falling exports was yuan appreciation. Tony Nash, global vice president of Delta Economics, said the numbers took in the lunar new year period which was typically a bit volatile. ""We usually average February and March to get a true picture of what's actually happening,"" he told the BBC. ""If we look at February's 48% rise in exports and March's 15% fall in exports, we get a moving average of 16.7%, which is closer to where we've seen exports over the past two months."" But Mr Nash said Delta Economics was expecting a further slowdown going forward.  ""In the second quarter, we'll look for an average of 9.9% year-on-year export growth and 11.7% import growth,"" he said.  ""Trade will fall towards the back half of the year and we will look for average export growth in 2015 at 8.7% year-on-year, and import growth at 10.3% year-on-year.

economic indicators,Iran suspends parts of nuclear deal,2024-09-15,2019-05-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48197628,"Iran has suspended commitments under the 2015 international nuclear deal, a year after it was abandoned by the US. President Hassan Rouhani said he would keep enriched uranium stocks in the country rather than sell them abroad. He also threatened to resume production of more-highly-enriched uranium in 60 days if other signatories did not act to protect Iran from US sanctions. The 2015 accord was aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions in return for relief from sanctions. But since the US left the deal it has imposed new sanctions, hitting Iran's economy and raising Iran-US tensions. Iran informed the remaining parties to the deal - France, Germany, Russia, China and the UK - of its decision on Wednesday morning. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran was acting within its rights under the deal and it was up to the three European powers to act. Under the deal Iran is required to sell its surplus enriched uranium abroad, rather than keep it. This is important as the material, which is a by-product of Iran's civilian nuclear power generation, can be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. By selling it abroad, Iran can continue to generate nuclear power and the parties to the agreement can be sure it is not building nuclear weapons. Iran's announcement comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an unscheduled visit to Iraq, and a US aircraft carrier was deployed to the Gulf region.  US officials have reported threats to US forces and their allies from Iran, but have given few details about the exact nature of the threat. Mr Rouhani said he was suspending two parts of the deal, which is known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), that Iran was adhering to - the sale of surplus enriched uranium and heavy water. He then gave the European powers, Russia and China 60 days to meet their financial and oil commitments to the deal. If they did so, Iran would resume the sales. If, however, those commitments were not met and the powers chose to follow US sanctions, he said Iran would begin higher enrichment of uranium, which is currently capped, and begin developing its Arak heavy water reactor based on plans made prior to the deal. But Iran's president added: ""We do not want to leave the agreement. All the people of the world should know that today is not the end of the JCPOA; it is a new step within the framework of the JCPOA."" However, he said the five powers would face a ""very decisive reaction"" if Iran's nuclear case was referred to the UN Security Council. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov quickly urged all of the remaining parties to the deal to fulfil their obligations. Both Russia and China have blamed Washington's withdrawal from the deal for the current situation. A spokesman for UK PM Theresa May said the deal was ""crucial"" and that Britain would ensure it remained in place as long as Iran upheld its commitments. Foreign Office minister Mark Field told parliament Iran's move was an ""unwelcome step"". French Defence Minister Florence Parly told French media that the European powers were doing everything they could to keep the deal alive but there would be consequences and possibly sanctions if the deal was not adhered to. Germany remained ""fully committed"" to its pledges on the deal if Iran reciprocated, a German foreign ministry spokesman said. Iran is seeking to strike a difficult balance: pushing back against some of the restrictions imposed by the JCPOA, while not doing so much as to withdraw from it altogether. This is an alarm signal but also a warning. Iran is facing growing pain from re-imposed US sanctions.  It wants the Europeans to take urgent practical steps to provide some relief. And if relief does not come, then Iran may well have to re-consider its overall adherence to the JCPOA - which the US abandoned a year ago.  This presents the Europeans with a huge dilemma. They are caught between the Iranians and the Trump administration. Can they continue to back the agreement if Iran is not fully complying with its terms? The US is likely to insist that there can be no middle way. Iran is either honouring the terms of the JCPOA or it is not.  In January, the UK, Germany and France set up a new payments mechanism to allow businesses to trade with Iran without being subject to sanctions. The three countries opposed last year's decision by President Donald Trump to abandon the deal. The system, known as Instex, is supposed to focus on ""legitimate trade"" in goods ""where the immediate need of the Iranian people is greatest"", for example food, pharmaceutical products and consumer goods not subject to sanctions. Oil, Iran's main source of foreign exchange, is at the moment not covered, and it is thought so far that the payment system has done little to soften the impact of sanctions. Iran now wants the Europeans to give the system more bite. The landmark nuclear deal was thrown into flux when President Trump announced the US withdrawal one year ago. The value of Iran's currency has since been pushed to record lows, its annual inflation rate quadrupled and foreign investment driven away. Despite this, Iran has upheld its commitments to the deal, according to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Tensions between the US and Iran can be traced back to Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979, which overthrew the pro-Western Shah and established a radical anti-US regime in its place. President Trump has taken a particularly hard line towards Iran since he took office in 2016.  His administration wants to renegotiate the nuclear deal and widen its scope so that it also curbs Iran's ballistic missile programme and ""malign"" activities in the Middle East. The US has recently raised the pressure on Iran, with two significant moves in April:  And earlier this week, National Security Adviser John Bolton said the US was deploying an aircraft carrier to the Middle East following a number of ""troubling and escalatory indications and warnings"" from Iran."
economic indicators,US jobs growth jumps in November,2024-09-15,2019-12-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50690745,"The US economy added the largest number of jobs for 10 months in November, confounding economists' expectations of a slowdown. Official data showed employers added 266,000 jobs last month, while the jobless rate dipped to 3.5% from 3.6%. The growth was helped by striking GM workers returning to work and a big rise in healthcare posts. The US economy has continued to expand, despite concerns that trade wars had hit business confidence and investment. Richard Flynn, UK managing director at Charles Schwab, said the latest jobs data had ""surpassed expectations"". ""The upbeat data reinforces the strength of both the labour market and consumer confidence, despite slowing global growth and continued trade uncertainty."" Friday's report from the US Labor Department showed wide-ranging gains, even in indicators that were slow to revive after the financial crisis. For example, the number of people working part-time, despite wanting full-time positions, dropped to 4.32 million - well below the 30-year average.  Wage growth, while still modest, also ticked up, rising 3.1% year-on-year. The White House welcomed the gains, which officials said proved President Donald Trump's economic policies were working. ""Great jobs report!"" Mr Trump tweeted.  Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the jobs numbers were ""astonishing"", but could be revised down at some point. The 266,000 rise was ""well above"" the analyst consensus of 180,000, and considering returning GM workers were part of a net gain of 41,000 in the motor industry, the numbers were ""hugely strong"", he said. ""This is wild,"" he said. ""That [jump is] hard to square with leading indicators, all of which tanked in the late summer and early fall, so it seems like a candidate for a big downward revision."" The US economy, which is powered largely by consumer spending, grew at an annualised rate of 2.1% in the three months to 30 September, according to the latest government estimate. But business investment and confidence have slumped, amid concerns about trade fights and global growth. The rate of hiring has also retreated, dipping from an average of 223,000 per month in 2018 to 180,000 per month this year. To address fears of a slowdown, the US central bank has lowered interest rates three times since July. The strength of the latest hiring report suggests the Federal Reserve will leave rates untouched for now, analysts said."
economic indicators,High cost of housing prompts move to France,2024-09-15,2023-01-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-64212864,"Single people in Guernsey have little chance of buying a home in the island, one islander has said. Self-employed teacher Aeva Love has moved to France citing the ""high cost and quality of housing in Guernsey"" as one reason she looked elsewhere. A new report found more than 1,500 new homes were needed in the next five years to meet the ""housing crisis"". Chief Minister Peter Ferbrache said he would like to see land bought by the States and used by private developers. Miss Love said: ""It's completely pointless thinking about buying in Guernsey. ""The banks would laugh at me if I walked in looking for the smallest mortgage possible. ""I love Guernsey for what it looks like, but it doesn't feel like my home. It feels very unwelcoming. ""There's a lot said about encouraging entrepreneurs and I run an independent business that is now doing quite well. I don't feel supported by the States. ""Ultimately I see Guernsey being a playground of the rich, which makes me angry."" The latest proposals from the States is asking for politicians to agree to aim to build 1,565 new ""units of accommodation"" between 2023 and 2027. The breakdown of those homes is 844 properties in the private market and 721 affordable houses, made up of 473 social houses and 248 partial ownership properties.  Guernsey's Committee for the Environment and Infrastructure wants to get the Development and Planning Authority to work on policies ""to actively encourage housing developments to use land as efficiently as possible"". Committee President Lindsay De Sausmarez said: ""This is the level of housing we think will be needed to meet the needs of the population over the next five years."" ""This will help inform all the decision makers, like developers and the States committees."" ""It helps us track how close we are for meeting this need. It isn't set in stone though, but now this is done in-house we can be far more flexible."" Ellie Jones and her partner are currently living apart to help them save for deposit for a house.  Miss Jones said: ""We would like to buy locally but sadly with huge rates of inflation and the current spiralling cost of living the amount we need to save for a deposit has gone up £10,000 in the last 12 months alone."" She said the situation had left her feeling like leaving the island. She said: ""It makes me feel depressed, anxious and hopeless. ""The only real way for us to get on the housing market is to apply for the part-rent part-buy scheme. We've put our names down for this but believe the current waiting time is two to three years for properties. ""I love Guernsey, I love my job, I love my friends and family and the life I've made here but we are likely to have to look at leaving if the situation doesn't change in some way."" Policy and Resources President Peter Ferbrache believes the biggest priority for the States this year besides tax reform is resolving the ""housing crisis"". He has suggested the States buys land, before being sold on to people.  Last year the States spent more than £30m purchasing sites for affordable housing, like the Data Park and Kenilworth Vinery.  Deputy Ferbrache said on top of that some kind of lending scheme to help people to buy would also be worth looking at.  Analysis by John Fernandez, BBC Guernsey Political Reporter The States is very good at setting things that aren't targets, which look suspiciously like targets. Maybe it's because last decade it set a target for 300 new houses a year - it didn't meet it once - so the word aim is better.  We've had the ""aim"" for 300+ net migration and now an aim to build 1,565 new ""units of accommodation"". Not calling it a target gives the States wiggle room so that it can't be held to account if it doesn't meet them. Because on housing it's not going to be a quick win. The States can buy swathes of land for affordable housing, but with the construction industry already at capacity getting them built is another thing altogether. This new indicator will give States members more evidence to encourage more housebuilding. But ultimately, when these aims and ideals meet the cold light of day things like Open Planning Meetings, age-old considerations like finite and inflexible infrastructure, traffic concerns and the like could prove to be a stumbling block for the States ""aim"".

economic indicators,"Drone downing by Iran 'accidental' , says Trump",2024-09-15,2019-06-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48711229,"Iran ""made a very big mistake"" in shooting down a US military surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz, President Donald Trump says. However, he told reporters it could have been the result of human error, saying: ""I find it hard to believe it was intentional."" Iran said the drone had violated Iranian airspace, but the US military denied this. The incident comes amid escalating tension between the two countries. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran would take its complaint that the US ""encroaches on our territory"" to the UN. Iran's UN ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi said the drone was engaged in a clear spying operation in what he called a blatant violation of international law.  In a letter to the UN secretary-general and the Security Council, Mr Ravanchi said that while Iran was not seeking war, it reserved the right to to defend its territory against hostile acts. Speaking at the White House, he called the drone's downing a ""new fly in the ointment"". Mr Trump said it was ""documented"" that the unmanned drone had been over international waters and not in Iranian airspace. ""I think probably Iran made a mistake - I would imagine it was a general or somebody that made a mistake in shooting that drone down,"" he said. ""It could have been somebody who was loose and stupid,"" he added. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has warned that war between the US and Iran would be a ""catastrophe with unpredictable consequences"". UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint. In the US, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the US had no appetite for war with Iran, while the leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden, called Mr Trump's Iran strategy a ""self-inflicted disaster"". The top Democrat in the US Senate, Chuck Schumer, said:  ""The president may not intend to go to war here, but we're worried that he and the administration may bumble into a war."" The Republicans' leader in the House, Kevin McCarthy, called for a ""measured response"" to the incident. Meanwhile Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told the BBC his country was trying to send a message to Iran that its behaviour was ""not acceptable"". ""Nobody wants to start a war. But we can't let Iran go on a rampage like this. The evidence of Iranian involvement is very compelling. They said they would do it, and now they are doing it,"" he said. Oil prices have jumped by about 5% following the incident. United Airlines has suspended its Newark to Mumbai flights, which pass through Iranian airspace, after ""a thorough safety and security review"". Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said its air force had shot down a US ""spy"" drone in the early hours after the unmanned aircraft violated Iranian airspace near Kuhmobarak in the southern province of Hormozgan. In a speech on Iranian state TV, IRGC commander-in-chief Maj-Gen Hossein Salami said the drone's downing was a ""clear message"" to the US that Iran's borders were ""our red line"". Foreign minister Javad Zarif later said Iran had retrieved sections of the US military drone ""in our territorial waters where it was shot down"". He added that the aircraft had taken off from the UAE in ""stealth mode"".  Iran released unverified footage of what it said was the US drone being destroyed. The US military's Central Command confirmed that a US Navy Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS-D) aircraft was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile system while operating in what it said was international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz at approximately 23:35 GMT on Wednesday (04:05 Iran time on Thursday). ""Iranian reports that the aircraft was over Iran are false,"" spokesman Navy Capt Bill Urban said. ""This was an unprovoked attack on a US surveillance asset in international airspace."" Lt Gen Joseph Guastella, Commander of US Air Forces Central Command, later said the drone had been operating at high altitude and was about 34km from the nearest point on the Iranian coast when it was shot down. US naval assets have been dispatched to the drone debris field in international waters, a US source told Reuters. The BAMS-D is a RQ-4A Global Hawk High-Altitude, Long, Endurance (HALE) drone that can carry out surveillance and reconnaissance missions over vast ocean and coastal regions, according to the US military. President Trump's comments suggesting that the Iranians' shooting down of an unmanned US aircraft over the Gulf was possibly a mistake tends to confirm earlier reports from Washington that the White House was eager to dial down tensions.  The Iranians had already attempted to shoot down a smaller US drone earlier in the week, and the two episodes are a powerful reminder of the dangers of escalation, with US and Iranian forces operating in close proximity. The head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps had earlier characterised the incident as a clear warning to Washington.  Mr Trump appears to be holding out the possibility that not everyone in Tehran is following the same playbook, perhaps leaving space for more moderate voices there similarly to reduce the tension.  On Monday, the US defence department said it was deploying 1,000 extra troops to the region in response to ""hostile behaviour"" by Iranian forces. It has already sent an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers. The US has also accused Iran of attacking two oil tankers with mines last Thursday just outside the Strait of Hormuz, in the Gulf of Oman. Iran rejects the allegation. It was the second time in a month tankers had been attacked close in the region, through which a fifth of the world's oil passes each day. On Monday Iran also announced its stockpile of low-enriched uranium would next week exceed limits it agreed with world powers under a landmark nuclear deal in 2015. Iran stepped up its production in response to tightening economic sanctions from the US, which unilaterally withdrew from the deal last year.  Last week, the US military accused Iran of attempting to shoot down a US MQ-9 Reaper armed drone with a surface-to-air missile in an attempt to disrupt surveillance of one of the tankers that was attacked, the Kokuka Courageous. The drone had earlier observed a fire on board the other tanker, the Front Altair. The previous week, another US MQ-9 Reaper was shot down over Yemen by a surface-to-air missile fired by the Iran-backed rebel Houthi movement.  The US military said the altitude of the engagement ""indicated an improvement over previous Houthi capability, which we assess was enabled by Iranian assistance"". Iran denies providing weapons to the Houthis. In 2011, Iran said it had captured a US RQ-170 Sentinel reconnaissance drone that had been reported lost by US forces in neighbouring Afghanistan. It developed its own version of the drone, one of which was shot down by Israel last year. May 2018: US President Donald Trump withdraws unilaterally from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, and begins reinstating sanctions to force Iran to renegotiate the accord. Iran's economy slumps as they take effect.  2 May 2019: Mr Trump steps up pressure on Tehran by ending exemptions from secondary sanctions for countries still buying Iranian oil. 5 May: The US sends an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the Gulf because of ""troubling and escalatory indications"" related to Iran. 8 May: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says Iran will scale back its commitments under the nuclear deal in retaliation for the sanctions, including by allowing its stockpile of low-enriched uranium to increase. Enriched uranium is used to make reactor fuel and potentially nuclear weapons. 12 May:  Four oil tankers are damaged by explosions off the UAE coast in the Gulf of Oman. The UAE says the blasts were caused by limpet mines planted by a ""state actor"". The US blames Iran, but it denies the allegation. 13 June: Explosions hit two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The US again accuses Iran, releasing footage purportedly showing Iranian forces removing an unexploded limpet mine from a damaged vessel. Iran says the evidence is fabricated. 17 June: Iran says it will breach the limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium set under the nuclear deal on 27 June, unless Europe protects Iranian oil sales.  20 June: Iranian forces shoot down US military drone over the Strait of Hormuz."
economic indicators,Patients at risk as NHS and care 'gridlocked',2024-09-15,2022-10-20,By Nick Triggle,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-63336928,"The health and care system in England is gridlocked with patients at risk because they cannot access the support they need, regulators say.  The Care Quality Commission's annual report warned the problem was creating long waits for ambulances and in A&E.  A major factor is most patients cannot leave hospital when they are ready, it said, because of a lack of support in the community.  The system could no longer operate effectively, the CQC said. ""People are stuck - stuck in hospital because there isn't the social care support in place for them to leave, stuck in emergency departments waiting for a hospital bed to get the treatment they need and stuck waiting for ambulances that don't arrive because those same ambulances are stuck outside hospitals waiting to transfer patients,"" chief executive Ian Trenholm said.    This winter would be particularly tough, he warned, and he was worried about how the health and care systems would cope.  Alongside delays in accident-and-emergency departments and with 999 services, 500,000 people are waiting for council-funded care - an increase from just under 300,000 in a year.  The CQC report blamed staffing shortages, with one-in-10 posts in both the NHS and social-care sector vacant.  The regulator was also heavily critical of maternity care, pointing out two out of five services were rated not good enough.  The signs were services were becoming worse, it added. ""It's unacceptable,"" Mr Trenholm said. It comes after an inquiry into maternity care at East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust found evidence of significant harm to babies, due to a ""clear pattern of suboptimal care"" during an 11-year period from 2009.  The review, published on Wednesday, said up to 45 babies may have survived with better care.  Mr Trenholm said maternity services, like the rest of the system, suffered from a lack of staff but there also seemed to be a cultural problem where the concerns were not being listened to as they should or prompting the necessary response.  The East Kent report comes just months after similar failings were identified at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust.  The numbers in the CQC report paint a picture of a health and care system where the indicators are flashing red. Inevitably that only tells part of the story. Far harder to measure is the human cost in terms of families and care staff. Over the months I've heard from many families confronted by a care system that they believe has failed them. A daughter who described the fight she faced to find enough care to allow her mother to leave hospital so she could spend her last days in her own home. The family called it a totally broken system. Another daughter who found the only way to provide her mother with the care she needed was by giving up paid work. Others who weep as they talk about their exhaustion, up through the night caring for a person they love who has dementia - the respite care which could make a difference hard to find. And then there are the care workers who worry about having to tell desperate families they just don't have enough staff to help them. It perhaps adds to the emotional burn-out many feel in the wake of the pandemic. Combine such stories with the CQC statistics and even at a time of political and economic turmoil, it underlines the urgency of fixing a problem that many governments have ducked.  The wider issues across health and care, Mr Trenholm said, were undoubtedly linked to ""historic under-investment"" - and without action, would only worsen.   This would be especially visible in poorer areas, where access to care outside hospitals was most under pressure, he said.   In addition to the increased risk of harm, more people would be driven out of the labour market through ill-health or because they were supporting family members who needed care, Mr Trenholm added.    Louise Ansari, from the patient group Healthwatch England, said the findings echoed what many patients had been telling her.  The problems would be putting ""lives at risk"" and widening health inequalities, she said.  ""It's starting to affect the public's confidence that the NHS will be there for them when they need it,"" Ms Ansari added.  NHS England medical director Prof Sir Stephen Powis accepted that it was going to be an ""incredibly challenging"" few months.  Extra support was being provided to keep patients out of hospital, he said, including the rollout of rapid-response teams to treat patients at home after incidents such as falls. ""NHS staff are working hard to keep patients safe despite the record demand and pressures,"" Sir Stephen added. Have you been affected by NHS delays?

economic indicators,Unexpected improvement in Northern Ireland economy,2024-09-15,2023-03-13,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-64917831,"The Northern Ireland economy showed unexpected signs of improved performance in February, an Ulster Bank survey suggests. Every month the bank surveys about 200 firms, asking about things like employment, new orders and exports. In February, firms reported their first rise in output and new orders in 10 months. Ulster Bank's Richard Ramsey said the survey could be summed up in one word - ""improvement"". ""All 10 indicators of local business conditions improved in February relative to the previous month,"" he added. The survey also showed business confidence reached its highest level since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Mr Ramsey, who is the bank's chief economist, said the improvement was recorded ahead of the unveiling of the Windsor Framework, so ""we may see further rises in sentiment in the coming months if it is accepted more universally than the Northern Ireland Protocol was"". In the UK as a whole, recent economic performance has been a little better than forecast, helped by a fall in some energy prices. On Friday, official figures suggested the UK economy expanded by 0.3% in January, rebounding from a sharp fall in December.  Higher school attendance and the return of Premier League football after the World Cup helped boost the figure. However, economic output was no higher than it had been in January 2022. Official figures suggest that Northern Ireland entered a recession in the third quarter of 2022. The figures for the fourth quarter of 2022 are due to be released at the end of this month."
economic indicators,Amazon's Bezos on economy: 'Batten down hatches',2024-09-15,2022-10-19,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63319010,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has added his voice to the chorus of voices warning of hardship ahead for the US economy. On social media, the billionaire wrote that the economy was sending a signal to ""batten down the hatches"". Growth in the US has already contracted for two quarters in a row, a milestone that in many countries - though not the US - is considered a recession. As the US central bank raises interest rates to fight rising prices, many economists expect further slowdown. The drumbeat of concern recently forced US President Joe Biden to address the issue. In an interview last week, he said ""I don't think there will be a recession. If it is, it'll be a very slight recession"". In the US, a panel of economists is charged with declaring the formal start and end of recessions. They use a number of indicators, in addition to gross domestic product in making the determination. With midterm elections looming in November, Mr Biden has tried to make the case that the slowdown in economic activity is a healthy shift from the growth surge that followed the pandemic lockdowns. Job creation remains robust, unemployment rates low, and households finances relatively healthy. But as inflation has remained much higher than the 2% goal - hitting 8.2% last month - hopes that authorities will be able to get the issue under control without triggering a potentially severe slowdown have waned. ""We have got to get inflation behind us. I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn't,"" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last month. The US housing sector - which accounts for about 15% of the economy by some estimates - has already slowed sharply, as borrowing costs approach 7% - the highest rate since 2002, prompting job cuts at banks and other property firms. In updates to investors in recent days, bosses at the biggest US banks warned of darker days ahead. ""In my conversations with CEOs, they tell me they are rethinking business opportunities and would like to see more certainty before committing to longer term plans,"" Goldman Sachs boss David Solomon said.  ""We're tightening economic conditions very, very quickly. And when you tighten economic conditions it has an impact on these things"" Jamie Dimon at JP Morgan, who has previously warned of a ""hurricane"" ahead, said consumers would likely run through the cushion in their bank accounts by the middle of next year. Amazon, which will update investors later this month, has also been grappling with a slowdown in its e-commerce business. It has slowed hiring and said it is working to cut expenses.  Mr Bezos stepped down as Amazon chief executive last year but remains chairman of its board. He has been critical of the president's economic policies in the past, faulting Mr Biden for being disingenuous about the forces driving prices higher. He shared a video of Mr Solomon discussing the need to be cautious, given the economic uncertainties. ""Yep the probabilities in this economy tell you to batten down the hatches,"" Mr Bezos wrote."
economic indicators,Theresa May: Syria statement in full,2024-09-15,2018-04-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43766966,"Last night British, French and American armed forces conducted co-ordinated and targeted strikes to degrade the Syrian regime's chemical weapons capability and deter their use.  For the UK's part, four RAF Tornado GR4s launched Storm Shadow missiles at a military facility some 15 miles west of Homs, where the regime is assessed to keep chemical weapons in breach of Syria's obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention. While the full assessment of the strike is ongoing, we are confident of its success. Let me set out why we have taken this action. Last Saturday, up to 75 people, including young children, were killed in a despicable and barbaric attack in Douma, with as many as 500 further casualties.  We have worked with our allies to establish what happened. And all the indications are that this was a chemical weapons attack.      We have seen the harrowing images of men, women and children lying dead with foam in their mouths. These were innocent families who, at the time this chemical weapon was unleashed, were seeking shelter underground in basements. First-hand accounts from NGOs and aid workers have detailed the most horrific suffering, including burns to the eyes, suffocation and skin discolouration, with a chlorine-like odour surrounding the victims. And the World Health Organisation has received reports that hundreds of patients arrived at Syrian heath facilities on Saturday night with ""signs and symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic chemicals"". We are also clear about who was responsible for this atrocity.  A significant body of information, including intelligence, indicates the Syrian regime is responsible for this latest attack. I cannot tell you everything. But let me give an example of some of the evidence that leads us to this conclusion.  Open source accounts allege that a barrel bomb was used to deliver the chemicals.  Multiple open source reports claim that a regime helicopter was observed above the city of Douma on the evening of 7th April.  The opposition does not operate helicopters or use barrel bombs. And reliable intelligence indicates that Syrian military officials co-ordinated what appears to be the use of chlorine in Douma on 7th April. No other group could have carried out this attack. Indeed, Daesh for example does not even have a presence in Douma.  And the fact of this attack should surprise no-one. We know that the Syrian regime has an utterly abhorrent record of using chemical weapons against its own people.  On 21st August 2013, over 800 people were killed and thousands more injured in a chemical attack also in Ghouta. There were 14 further smaller scale chemical attacks prior to that summer.  At Khan Shaykhun on 4th April last year, the Syrian regime used Sarin against its people, killing around 100 with a further 500 casualties. And based on the regime's persistent pattern of behaviour and the cumulative analysis of specific incidents, we judge it highly likely both that the Syrian regime has continued to use chemical weapons since then, and will continue to do so. This must be stopped.  We have sought to do so using every possible diplomatic channel.  But our efforts have been repeatedly thwarted both on the ground and in the United Nations. Following the Sarin attack in eastern Damascus back in August 2013, the Syrian regime committed to dismantle its chemical weapon programme - and Russia promised to ensure that Syria did this, overseen by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.  But these commitments have not been met.  A recent report from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has said that Syria's declaration of its former chemical weapons programme is incomplete.  This indicates that it continues to retain undeclared stocks of nerve agent or precursor chemicals - and is likely to be continuing with some chemical weapons production.  The OPCW inspectors have investigated previous attacks and on four occasions decided that the regime was indeed responsible. And on each occasion when we have seen every sign of chemical weapons being used, any attempt to hold the perpetrators to account has been blocked by Russia at the UN Security Council, with six such vetoes since the start of 2017. Just this week, the Russians vetoed a draft resolution that would have established an independent investigation into this latest attack - even making the grotesque and absurd claim that it was ""staged"" by Britain. So we have no choice but to conclude that diplomatic action on its own will not be any more effective in the future than it has been in the past.  Over the last week, the UK government has been working intensively with our international partners to build the evidence picture, and to consider what action we need to take to prevent and deter future humanitarian catastrophes caused by chemical weapons attacks.  When the cabinet met on Thursday we considered the advice of the attorney general, the national security adviser and the chief of the defence staff - and we were updated on the latest assessment and intelligence picture.  And based on this advice we agreed that it was both right and legal to take military action, together with our closest allies, to alleviate further humanitarian suffering by degrading the Syrian regime's chemical weapons capability and deterring their use. This was not about interfering in a civil war.  And it was not about regime change.  As I discussed with (US) President Trump and (French) President Macron, it was a limited, targeted and effective strike with clear boundaries that expressly sought to avoid escalation and did everything possible to prevent civilian casualties. Together we have hit a specific and limited set of targets. They were a chemical weapons storage and production facility, a key chemical weapons research centre and a military bunker involved in chemical weapons attacks.  Hitting these targets with the force that we have deployed will significantly degrade the Syrian regime's ability to research, develop and deploy chemical weapons. A year ago, after the atrocity at Khan Shaykhun, the US conducted a strike on the airfield from which the attack took place. But Assad and his regime haven't stopped their use of chemical weapons.  So last night's strikes by the US, UK and France were significantly larger than the US action a year ago, and specifically designed to have a greater impact on the regime's capability and willingness to use chemical weapons.   And this collective action sends a clear message that the international community will not stand by and tolerate the use of chemical weapons.  I also want to be clear that this military action to deter the use of chemical weapons does not stand alone.  We must remain committed to resolving the conflict at large.  The best hope for the Syrian people remains a political solution.  We need all partners - especially the regime and its backers - to enable humanitarian access to those in desperate need.  And the UK will continue to strive for both. But these strikes are about deterring the barbaric use of chemical weapons in Syria and beyond.  And so to achieve this there must also be a wider diplomatic effort - including the full range of political and economic levers - to strengthen the global norms prohibiting the use of chemical weapons which have stood for nearly a century.  Although of a much lower order of magnitude, the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the UK in recent weeks is part of a pattern of disregard for these norms.  So while this action is specifically about deterring the Syrian regime, it will also send a clear signal to anyone else who believes they can use chemical weapons with impunity. There is no graver decision for a Prime Minister than to commit our forces to combat - and this is the first time that I have had to do so.  As always, they have served our country with the greatest professionalism and bravery - and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude.  We would have preferred an alternative path.  But on this occasion there is none. We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised - either within Syria, on the streets of the UK or elsewhere. We must reinstate the global consensus that chemical weapons cannot be used.  This action is absolutely in Britain's national interest.  The lesson of history is that when the global rules and standards that keep us safe come under threat, we must take a stand and defend them. That is what our country has always done.  And that is what we will continue to do. "
economic indicators,'Optimism reminiscent of last crisis',2024-09-15,2018-01-23,By Joe Miller,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42791869,"The newfound optimism about the state of the global economy is eerily reminiscent of the lead-up to the last financial crisis, the head of Barclays has warned. ""I do feel like that it is a little bit like 2006,"" Jes Staley told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos. ""When we were all talking about whether we had solved the riddle of economic crises.""   But he said big banks were now in a better position to deal with shocks. Mr Staley's comments were delivered at the opening of an upbeat forum in the Swiss resort, at which the IMF upgraded its global growth forecast for 2018 to 3.9%. Additionally, a survey of more than 1,200 chief executives by PwC found that most believed the world economy would ""improve"" over the next 12 months. Speaking on a panel ominously entitled ""The Next Financial Crisis"", Mr Staley said that despite an encouraging recovery, ""there is something out there in the capital markets"". ""Equity markets are at an all time high and volatility is at an all time low - that is not a sustainable proposition,"" he cautioned. He hinted that if the stress tests that Barclays was subjected to by the Bank of England were applied to other sectors of the economy, they would not be found to be in rude health, primarily because of high levels of debt. Mr Staley also argued that the next financial shock would not be the fault of banks like Barclays and reiterated his faith in financial regulators. ""On one level, pre-2008, the regulators were there just to bear witness,"" he told Davos attendees. ""Today, the political body have told the regulators, I want you to regulate the system… so you avoid the next financial crisis."" Fellow banking heavyweight Michael Corbat, the chief executive of Citigroup, shared Mr Staley's view that lenders were less exposed to risk, and emphasised that they had reverted to their core mission. ""We are not an insurance company, we are not an asset manager, we are not a hedge fund,"" Mr Corbat said. ""We are simply a bank."" Harvard economist Ken Rogoff, while sanguine about the prospect of a downturn in the near future, warned that there would be few tools left to deal with one if it occurred. ""There really isn't even a Plan A for central banks,"" he said, adding that although there would be probably be further fiscal stimulus and quantitative easing, ""I don't think either would work as well as they did last time"". The risk of political upheaval, which was front and centre at last year's WEF, seems to have faded, and Donald Trump, who will bring his protectionist message to Davos on Friday, was hardly mentioned by executives. Of more concern, according to Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit, were ""low-level threats"" that could end up ruining the recovery. ""The most worrisome are policy mistakes either in the United States - a fiscal shock or a trade war - or in China,"" he said, referring to overzealous interest rate rises in the former, and a rapidly reduction of debt in the latter. But Mr Behravesh added that while the risk trade friction was ""uncomfortably high"", the chances of an out-and-out trade war were still low.  Ray Nolte, managing partner at ‎investment firm SkyBridge Capital, also downplayed the prospects of another crisis, but said the harmonious nature of current economic growth was of concern. ""This really is a global recovery. Europe has really pulled out of it, the US is doing well, Asia is doing pretty well - much more coordinated than in past cycles where you have always had one country lagging, or one region lagging."" However, the very fact that the recovery was happening pretty much everywhere could spell bad news, he explained. ""What will tend to happen is countries will get out of step at the same time. This can have a cascading effect."" ""You had the US able to bail out Europe in 2011… you don't have that if everyone is in sync."" Yet Mr Nolte noted that while the global economy was motoring ahead at a steady pace - it was not yet at breakneck speed. ""It's not like we are at 4% growth and the breaks are going to have to be jammed on,"" he said. ""This party can go on for an extended period of time"". According to Prof Rogoff, anticipating precisely how the party will eventually end is no less tricky than it was 12 years ago. ""It will happen,"" he predicted, ""somewhere none of us are looking"". Citigroup, CEO Michael Corbat struck a more sombre note:  ""There is a numbness out there, there is an ambivalence out there that's concerning. ""When the next turn comes - and it will come - it's likely to be more violent than it would otherwise be."""
economic indicators,The economy: Going south,2024-09-15,2018-04-16,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-43780526,"We've seen plenty plant closures, but Pinneys feels different - like a throwback to the era of company towns.  The seafood processor hasn't been the only employer in Annan. There's the boilerworks, now much diminished. The ""shrimpie"" goes on, also under the ownership of Young's Seafood and taking on workers. And there was Chapelcross, the nuclear power plant, now only employing those in the long-term business of dismantling it. So with 450 employees in a rural town of 10,000 souls, the announcement of Pinney's closure was both a shock and an unusually big blow.  The usual formulaic union secretary's quotes about ""devastation"", ""a community betrayed"" and, from September onwards ""a bleak Christmas for local families"" have lost their force through repetition. It is also because workforces are dispersed, and so is the impact. However, the few large plants in rural areas are different. There are fewer alternative nearby jobs. It's another way of telling young people leaving school that their future lies elsewhere. The legal requirement to hold a consultation with the workforce is often a cruel hoax. They're not trying to find out if people have any better ideas. By the time the bosses at Young's Seafood (or the 2 Sisters Food Group in Cambuslang) are consulting, the decision is already made. Local politicians and government ministers can meet management and talk up hopes of a rescue plan, or of new contracts to get things going again. But it's been made very clear that Young's has absolutely no intention of seeking new contracts for Pinneys.  The statement agreed with Business Minister Paul Wheelhouse was craftily worded to give the impression of co-operation but with sufficient wiggle room not to give any. Young's will sell the plant to another owner, and possibly at a knock-down rate. But that's it.  Its corporate mind has already moved on from Pinney's. Next stop: recruitment in Grimsby, its headquarters town, where much of the Pinneys work to supply M&S Food is being transferred (some of the other work is going to plants at Carlisle, Uddingston and Arbroath). The closure is a reminder of the precarious nature of the rural economy, and particularly one with a big old plant doing easily transferred work. Pinneys is not in Annan because that's where the farmed salmon are. I'm told it's there because the late Mr Pinney liked living in the area. It's also a reminder that the south of Scotland has lacked much co-ordination down the years to do anything about it. Monday could mark a turning point.   At 7pm, in the Auld Cross Keys Inn, in Denholm, Professor Russel Griggs gets to his feet and begins a series of 28 meetings across southern Scotland. These are to make and to hear the case for getting the south of Scotland's economic act together. At 8.30am on Tuesday, he'll be at the Heart of Hawick. Eight of the meetings are for early birds. The seasoned businessman is chairman of the board that is paving the way for a new enterprise body for the south of Scotland.  You may recall that Economy Secretary Keith Brown set about streamlining the enterprise agencies to strip out duplication and waste, and ended up with an extra national board plus one more for the south.  It may not have been the minister's finest hour, but Russel Griggs and the numerous people on his board want to seize the opportunity to do for the south what Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) and its predecessor, the Highlands and Islands Development Board (HIDB) have done for the north and west. They've got a lot of catching up to do. HIDB started work 52 years ago. It's worth pausing for a moment to reflect on Prof Griggs' portfolio of roles. He seems to be the go-to man for digging others out of holes.  That includes the opencast coal mines. With inadequate funds to restore them when the operators folded, the professor was asked to step in. He is nearly finished the job. When small businesses felt they were being unfairly treated by overbearing, risk-averse, post-crash banks, the government called Griggs to mediate. He did so, with a new appeal system against loan refusals, which even the banks now prefer. Whitehall went back to him to find a way for bank branch closures to provoke less hostility. Banks duly signed up to his code of conduct, requiring them to take their time and explain themselves. When Lloyds Banking Group had to compensate dozens of business customers for having their companies collapsed by a criminally rogue office in Reading, it also got on the phone to Professor Griggs. With that track record, the Sanquhar-based professor was the very guy to sort out the south. With a new enterprise company, and eight weeks left of a Scottish government consultation, he has a nearly blank sheet.  So what could it do? The experience of HIE is that a rural economic development agency needs a social role, supporting communities. By contrast, that role doesn't trouble Scottish Enterprise, which currently has the south within its turf. That means community facilities and institutions. It means addressing the questions of population decline and particularly of young people leaving for education, then not finding jobs back home which match their skills. South of Scotland Enterprise could and should build in some of the resilience necessary to handle a closure such as Pinneys. The question with big plants should always be: how can they be sustained, and what if they depart? It could co-ordinate the limited remains of the once-great textiles industry of the Borders.  It could market the area better for tourism. There is a already a big presence for hiking and mountain-biking. What, then, of the Southwest Coastal 300 road route, to match the huge marketing success of the North 500. If you haven't heard of it, that might be because of its marketing budget. There are two plans for national parks - one for the Borders, one for Dumfries and Galloway. The latter already has its dark sky-gazing niche. Prof Griggs talks of the distinctive economy of small and family owned businesses, including farms. They need a different type of business support, including help with the question of family or leadership succession.  The board has been discussing whether the south economy is weak or just different. It may be a bit of both. There's certainly statistical evidence of weakness.  Here are some figures compiled late last year about Dumfries and Galloway, and which you might have heard quoted on Radio Scotland by my colleague Willie Johnson (Annan-raised and covering the south-west for the BBC for more than 30 years). The area has lots going for it, from Eyemouth scuba to Wigtown's books. There's a new Borders railway, and the possibility of an extension. The Glasgow-Kilmarnock-Dumfries line is also being considered for an upgrade. But it has weaknesses too: notably in road transport. East to west links are one of the reasons this region does not feel a coherent one. Borderers look to Edinburgh or Newcastle: south-westerners to Glasgow, Belfast or Carlisle. And that is where the challenge starts - trying to persuade southern Scots that they've got a common cause. I'm told it's hard enough to get some Borderers to think of their neighbouring town as having common interests with their own.  If this is to work, there's a need to look beyond the incompatible ball shapes kicked at goal in the Borders and at Queen of the South."
economic indicators,Private sector growth hits six-month high,2024-09-15,2018-08-13,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-45157848,"The private sector in Northern Ireland saw its fastest growth in six months during July, data from Ulster Bank has suggested. The bank surveys private sector activity monthly, in what is considered a reliable indicator of the economy. The pick-up in business activity in July was broad-based with all sectors, except manufacturing, reporting faster rates of output growth. The good weather was cited as a factor supporting demand across all sectors. Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank's chief economist, said: ""Northern Ireland's private sector started the third quarter where it left off in June with output and new orders growth accelerating in July. ""This was the fourth month in a row that the pace of activity picked-up, with both these indicators hitting six-month highs."" However, he said that the ongoing weakness of sterling was continuing to stoke inflation. ""Inflationary pressures also remain a key cause of concern amongst businesses.  ""With sterling depreciating further since the survey was conducted, we can expect inflationary pressures to continue to feature prominently as an issue in the coming months."" Mr Ramsey also suggested that the strong growth in the local jobs market is beginning to level off. ""Local firms have been increasing their headcount for the last three-and-a-half years. However, the pace of job creation eased to a twelve-month low in July due to reduced hiring within manufacturing and services."""
economic indicators,Business activity falls for first time in months,2024-09-15,2023-08-14,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-66475357,"Business activity in Northern Ireland's private sector fell for the first time in six months in July, according to a survey by Ulster Bank.  Every month the bank asks firms from across different parts of the economy about things like staffing levels, order books and exports. It is considered to be a reliable indicator of economic performance. The survey found the decrease in activity was caused by weak demand and the impact of inflation. New orders fell across all four sectors of the economy, with the biggest declines in construction and retail.  Despite this, companies continued to take on new staff, albeit at the slowest rate in six months. Ulster Bank's chief economist in Northern Ireland, Richard Ramsey, said: ""Just like the summer weather, business conditions took a turn for the worse in July.  ""The near-term outlook is for a further softening in demand with new orders declining for the second month running."" However, the survey suggested there had been some easing of the inflationary pressures that firms have been facing as well as an improvement in business sentiment about the outlook for the year ahead. Mr Ramsey added: ""While price pressures have hit demand in recent months, it is encouraging to note that inflationary pressures continue to moderate.  ""Business conditions may have taken a turn for the worse in July but sentiment amongst local firms for the year ahead has actually picked up.  ""The interest rate outlook has improved slightly but the dark cloud of no Stormont Executive looks set to remain anchored over the economy for the foreseeable future."" Northern Ireland has been without a functioning executive since February 2022 as part of the Democratic Unionist Party's protest against post-Brexit trading arrangements. ""Whether the new rise in optimism is well founded or misplaced - time will tell,"" Mr Ramsey added.    "
economic indicators,House prices slip in May in subdued market,2024-09-15,2019-05-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48470957,"House prices in May fell 0.2% from April in what Nationwide building society described as a subdued market. The lender said ""uncertainty"" was likely to weigh on the market in the coming months.  Compared with a year earlier, house prices rose 0.6% - slower than the 0.9% rise the previous month.  Annual house price growth has been below 1% for six months in a row, according to data compiled by Nationwide. ""Survey data suggests that new buyer inquiries and consumer confidence have remained subdued in recent months,"" said Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide. ""Nevertheless, indicators of housing market activity, such as the number of property transactions and the number of mortgages approved for house purchase, have remained broadly stable. ""Housing market trends are likely to continue to mirror developments in the broader economy,"" he said. The number of first time buyers has continued to recover. According to Nationwide data there were 359,000 first-time buyers in the 12 months to March, just 10% below the 2006 peak. ""Even though house prices remain high relative to average incomes, the cost of servicing the typical mortgage as a share of take-home pay has remained close to or below long-run averages in most parts of the country,"" Mr Gardner said. The Nationwide said that almost half of first-time buyers had received help from friends and family to raise a deposit to buy a home. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that Brexit uncertainty was likely to have ""instilled some caution in buyers"".  But he also expects a ""modest"" improvement later in the year, as consumer confidence has been recovering and mortgage deals have been getting better for buyers with smaller deposits. Bank of England data also published on Friday showed that mortgage approvals reached a three-month high of 66,261 in April, after slipping to a 15-month low of 62,599 in March. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club of forecasters said: ""April's marked rise in mortgage approvals suggests that housing market activity may well have got at least some temporary support from the avoidance of a disruptive Brexit at the end of March"".  However, he said Brexit uncertainty could hamper the housing market later this year."
economic indicators,Police 'tear gas protesters' in Tunisia,2024-09-15,2018-01-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42683794,"Police in Tunisia are reported to have fired tear gas to disperse a crowd of youths protesting against new austerity measures.  A Reuters witness said young people aged around 20 were throwing stones at police vehicles and setting fire to tyres. The clash happened in Ettadamen, a poor district of the capital, Tunis. President Beji Caid Essebsi had given a speech there earlier on Sunday promising to increase youth employment. Joblessness among the young is considered a key indicator of a country's economic prospects, and Tunisia's stands at around 35%. The president's comments came as Tunisians marked the seventh anniversary of the country's revolution. The 2011 uprising that launched the Arab Spring led to the toppling of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali after 23 years.  Ben Ali, now in exile in Saudi Arabia, was convicted in absentia of embezzlement and misuse of public funds, and sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment.  Several hundred people joined rallies in Tunis on Sunday at the urging of political parties and the UGTT, a prominent trade union. Protests are a common feature each January in Tunisia, as people commemorate the 2011 rallies. A increase in value-added tax and social security contributions brought in at the start of January has led to heightened emotions this year. Protesters are calling for a review of the 2018 budget, and a push to combat corruption. Tunisia is the only country to dislodge its long-standing leader in the Arab Spring without descending into serious violence. But nine successive governments have failed to revive its flagging economy. Both peaceful protests and nocturnal unrest have been seen across the country over the past week. More than 800 people have been arrested, according to the interior ministry, which accuses them of theft, vandalism and violence. In 2011 the slogan ""Work, Freedom, Dignity"" rang out in the streets, and protesters have revived it in recent days. On Sunday, many gathered on Habib Bourguiba Avenue, a major site in the 2011 demonstrations. Hundreds of riot police were deployed there. An interior ministry spokesman said on Saturday that around 97 members of the security forces and civil protection units had been injured during the protests. The number of protesters injured was not given. The government has tried to quell protests by unveiling a welfare package that includes better healthcare and an increase in aid for the needy. Officials say the 70m dinar ($28.5m) plan will help more than 120,000 Tunisians. But it's unclear how it will be funded.  The government's tax and price increases were imposed as it seeks to placate international donors by reducing its budget deficit. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave Tunisia a $2.9bn (£2.2bn) loan on the promise it would enact financial reforms. The tourism sector, once a vital source of revenue, was damaged in 2015 by a wave of jihadist attacks and is yet to bounce back. As 2018 begins, inflation is at a three-and-a-half-year high and food prices are rising by 10% annually. Taxes on items like mobile phones, cars and the internet have also increased. Ordinary people are suffering financially. The BBC's Mark Lowen, in Tunis, says the president's visit to the flashpoint district of Ettadamen was a bid to quell further unrest. He says the protesters are not only frustrated about the immediate tax increases, but more deeply by a loss of hope."
economic indicators,The rising stars of China's Communist Party,2024-09-15,2017-10-07,By Pratik Jakhar,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-41322178,"China's Communist Party will unveil its next generation of elite leaders when it meets starting on 18 October for a congress that is held every five years. Except for President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, five of the seven members of the party's top body, the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), are expected to retire later this year. Given the opaque nature of Chinese politics, it is tricky to say who will fill the vacancies - though it is certain that they will likely be those close to Mr Xi. The BBC takes a look at the men widely expected to take over the reins of China's ruling party. Chen Min'er, 56, was appointed Chongqing municipality party chief on 15 July, replacing Sun Zhengcai who is being investigated for corruption.  He spent his early political life working in his native Zhejiang province, where he developed close ties with Mr Xi while working under him from 2002 to 2007 in his tenure at the province's propaganda department.  Describing him as Mr Xi's ""trusted confidant"", Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post noted that his promotion ""cemented his credentials as a contender to join the upper echelon of the party"" at the congress. Before becoming the head of Guangdong, an economically strong province in southern China, Hu Chunhua worked in Tibet, Hebei and Inner Mongolia in various capacities. He also became the first secretary of the Communist Youth League, the party's youth wing, in 2006.  Mr Hu, 54, was elevated to the Politburo in 2012, becoming one of the youngest members of the 25-member grouping which ranks just below the PSC. Known as ""little Hu"", the Guangdong boss is reportedly backed by former Chinese leader, Hu Jintao. He is part of the so-called ""sixth generation"" of leaders born in the 1960s and, along with Chen Min'er, is regarded as a potential successor to Mr Xi, independent Hong Kong media report.  Li Zhanshu is the director of the General Office of the Communist Party's Central Committee and, as the top presidential aide, handles Mr Xi's daily activities.  The 67-year-old often accompanies Mr Xi on domestic and foreign tours, the latest being the Chinese leader's state visit to Russia in July.  Mr Li is said to be a skilled administrator, having held regional posts in Hebei and Shaanxi province. He was elevated to the Politburo in 2012.  He is also said to be Mr Xi's most powerful ally after anti-corruption chief Wang Qishan, and has been a close friend of the president since the early 1980s. Wang Huning is the Director of the Central Policy Research Office and, like Li Zhanshu, is part of Mr Xi's entourage during overseas visits.  The 61-year-old former Fudan University scholar has extensive policymaking experience, having advised former presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao.  Said to be Mr Xi's top foreign policy aide, he has been labelled ""China's Kissinger"" by South Korean daily The Hankyoreh. Independent Hong Kong daily Ming Pao says that Mr Wang has a good chance of joining the PSC as he is close to Xi, although it adds: ""He is a low-key person and it is said that he is not interested in getting promoted."" Wang Yang is currently one of four vice-premiers in the existing government and is a two-term Politburo member.  The veteran politician was previously the party chief of Guangdong province from 2007 to 2012, and is a key figure behind Mr Xi's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. Like Hu Chunhua, Mr Wang comes from the ""Youth League faction"" of the party, and is seen as one of the top contestants for a PSC seat, Hong Kong media note. There are also growing indications that Mr Wang could replace Li Keqiang as the premier, in what would be a break from the two-term tradition for China's top leaders. Mr Han is currently a member of the political bureau of the party's high-ranking Central Committee, and served as the mayor and deputy party secretary of Shanghai previously. Some believe he may replace Wang Qishan as the head of the powerful anti-corruption body the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. If he is promoted, it would ""prove that persistence pays off, with the 63-year-old not even counted among potential dark horses a decade ago when political analysts were compiling lists of rising political stars on the mainland"", the South China Morning Post says.  Shanghai has been the launch pad for several former leaders, including Mr Xi, who served as the city's party chief before joining the PSC in 2007.  All these men may be jostling for limited spaces - a number of media sources report that Mr Xi may cut down the size of the PSC from the current seven members to five.

economic indicators,US jobless claims hit new record as virus spreads,2024-09-15,2020-04-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52137727,"The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits has hit a record high for the second week in a row as the economic toll tied to the coronavirus intensifies. More than 6.6 million people filed jobless claims in the week ended 28 March, the Department of Labor said. That is nearly double the week earlier, which was also a new record. The deepening economic crisis comes as the number of cases in the US soars to more than 236,000. With the death toll rising to more than 5,600, the White House recently said it would retain restrictions on activity to try to curb the outbreak. Analysts at Bank of America warned that the US could see ""the deepest recession on record"" amid forecasts that the unemployment rate could hit more than 15%. The outlook is a stark reversal for the world's biggest economy where the unemployment rate had been hovering around 3.5%.  However, more than 80% of Americans are now under some form of lockdown, which has forced the closure of most businesses. By Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent This is the highest number of new unemployment claims in US history.  But what is so terrifying is not just the magnitude but also the speed with which American firms have shed workers.  Roughly 10 million Americans lost their jobs in just the last two weeks.  To put that in context, 9 million jobs were lost in the 2008 financial crisis. There were several reasons for this  week's historic increase. More states ordered non-essential businesses to close to contain the virus. According to economists, a fifth of the US workforce is now in some form of lockdown. And a government relief package signed last week expanded unemployment benefits to help more people, such as the self-employed and independent contractors. Some fear the true number could be even higher since many people couldn't even get through to file a claim. Given these are weekly figures, this data is the closest we have to real-time information showing just how catastrophic the pandemic is for the American economy. And it points to a bruising couple of months ahead. More than 3.3 million people filed claims two weeks ago, eclipsing the previous record of 695,000, set in 1982 and bringing the two-week total to about 10 million. The most recent figure was worse than many economists had feared. ""I don't usually look at data releases and just start shaking,"" said Heidi Shierholz, former chief economist at the US Department of Labor and now policy director at the Economic Policy Institute. ""This is a portrait of disaster ... It's like nothing we've ever seen before. It represents just incredible amounts of grief and suffering."" Workers in accommodation and food services were hit hard again this week, the Department of Labor said. But it added that states are reporting ""a wider impact across industries"". ""With this report there should be little doubt that ... US is already in deep recession and the global economy will be too"", tweeted Mohamed A El-Erian, chief economic adviser to financial services firm Allianz. The US recently passed a more than $2tn rescue bill, which funds direct payment for households, assistance for businesses and increased unemployment benefits. It also made more people eligible to receive benefits, including workers whose jobs are suspended rather than cut. There is speculation the government may provide further relief. Unlike other countries such as the UK, the US has not implemented a programme that pays firms to keep workers on the payroll - one reason the numbers are so stark, Ms Shierholz says.  ""There's an attempt at it,"" Ms Shierholz said, pointing to the expanded eligibility. ""But this concept of keeping workers on payroll through a downturn is not well socialised in the US. It's just not how we've done things in the past."""
economic indicators,US economy adds more jobs than expected in June,2024-09-15,2022-07-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62093303,"The US economy created 372,000 jobs in June, according to official figures, with employment growing by far more than forecast. Economists had expected the country to add between 250,000 and 295,000 roles. The unemployment rate also remained close to record lows, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The strong jobs figures are being seen by some analysts as a sign that more US interest rate rises could be on the way. Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors, said: ""Today's job number should soothe fears of an imminent recession, but it does nothing to relieve fears of considerable further Fed tightening. ""The job market remains severely tight, suggesting still-intense wage pressures."" The unemployment rate stayed at 3.6% in June for the fourth month in a row.  Like other countries, the cost of living in the US is soaring due to rising food and energy prices. Inflation hit a 40-year high of 8.6% in the year to April and the US Federal Reserve has been increasing borrowing costs to try to cool the rate of  price growth. Last month, the Fed announced its biggest interest rate rise in nearly 30 years, increasing its key interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. In the first three months of the year the US economy contracted at an annual pace of 1.6%, and Fed chairman Jay Powell recently admitted to lawmakers that a recession is ""a possibility"". Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, said the ""strong jobs report contrasts with other recent economic announcements"". ""The US economy and the stock market have both struggled in the first half of 2022, in the face of risks that include a multi-decade high in inflation, aggressive monetary policy tightening, and the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, "" he said.  ""However, jobs reports are lagging economic indicators that are often strong entering a downturn."""
economic indicators,Bad local transport linked to failing schools,2024-09-15,2020-03-04,By Sean Coughlan,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-51707148,"There is a striking overlap between places in England with slow public transport and places with struggling secondary schools, say researchers. Instead of only looking at education data, researchers compared schools using journey times from the Department for Transport. They found clusters of bad transport and underachieving schools in places such as Norfolk and north-east England. Even in richer areas, poor transport seemed linked to lower school results. In reports on academic underachievement the same coldspots repeatedly recur - such as the ""left behind"" towns in the north west and north east, declining seaside towns in the south, or along the Norfolk coast. The study from education analysts, SchoolDash, has examined this pattern not in terms of exam results or Ofsted grades, but from the perspective of transport connections. This is not how long it takes pupils to get to school - but how well their local communities are served by buses and trains. This found that badly connected places were more likely to have low-achieving secondary schools.  Even in places without much deprivation, researcher Timo Hannay said ""more isolated schools are substantially more likely to under-perform and less likely to be judged outstanding"". Where poor public transport is combined with high levels of deprivation, there is a ""double whammy"", say researchers. The measurements used are journey-time statistics from the Department for Transport, which show how long it takes by public transport to reach a major centre for employment. The average travel time is 33 minutes - and the researcher's analysis shows how school results seem to worsen as journey times stretch beyond this. The slow connections are not just the end-of-the line towns on the coast, it can affect the edges of big cities, such as Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol and Newcastle, and pockets of Kent and the south west. There are places where deprivation and slow transport overlap, such as:  In contrast, London has high levels of connectivity in transport - and despite deep pockets of deprivation, some of the best school results in the country. There is a political dimension to this too. Boris Johnson's government has promised to invest in transport as a form of economic regeneration, particularly in the north of England. In the geography of the last general election, this study from SchoolDash shows the places with poor transport and under-performing schools were the seats where voters swung to the Conservatives. These are areas where social mobility is held up by a lack of physical mobility. But why should transport have any link to schools? How could trains mean brains? Or is this just a pattern of multiple, overlapping forms of neglect, without any causal connections?  And is funding of transport part of a bigger picture including inequalities in funding of schools? Anna Vignoles, a professor in education at Cambridge University, highlights a double impact - with pupils from communities with low horizons and schools where the cut-off location makes it hard to recruit teachers. ""Staffing is key,"" she says. A school needs to be in commuting distance to attract teachers, she says - and the location has to be practical for their partners to get to work too. Prof Vignoles says in a highly-connected city, pupils are ""surrounded by clear evidence of good jobs and the value of education"". ""By contrast in peripheral and rural locations with little connection to industries and good jobs, it may be harder to see the benefit of education."" Dame Rachel de Souza, chief executive of the Inspiration Trust with schools in Norfolk and Suffolk, says: ""Poor transport infrastructure obviously limits the extent to which people are physically mobile, but it can also in some cases be an indicator of poverty of aspirations.  ""And of course, added into the mix are the challenges around attracting and retaining staff. ""Coastal areas have their own unique set of challenges, but these need not determine a young person's future,"" she says. Simon Burgess, a professor in the economics of education from the University of Bristol, says there is never going to be any ""one-cause"" explanation for the pattern of schools doing well or badly. But he says poor local transport can mean there is in effect ""zero competition"" between schools, with parents unable to choose an alternative. Timo Hannnay, founder of SchoolDash, says the research supports an ""intuitive"" sense about places that are ""cut off and disadvantaged"". But he says there are more unexpected findings. It affects secondary but not particularly primary schools, which he thinks reflects the difficulty in recruiting specialist teachers. He was also surprised to see how soon the isolation factor is felt, including in the outskirts of big cities. ""You don't have to be very far away for it to make a difference""."
economic indicators,December 'worst for NI private sector in a decade',2024-09-15,2023-01-16,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-64287819,"December was the worst month for Northern Ireland's private sector in a decade, outside of lockdowns, an Ulster Bank survey has suggested. The monthly survey of about 200 firms is considered a reliable indicator of the private sector economy. Firms reported that the cost-of-living crisis was a key factor behind the drop in activity. Last week, official figures suggested that Northern Ireland entered a recession in the third quarter of 2022. Ulster Bank's chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said the four sectors covered by the survey - retail, services, manufacturing and construction - all posted a decline in output, with orders in construction affected most. Mr Ramsey said the main positive indicator in the survey was more evidence that inflation may have peaked. He said: ""Inflationary pressures moderated with firms reporting the weakest rise in input costs in 22 months. ""As a result, firms raised their prices at their slowest pace in almost two years.  ""But these price rises still exceed anything that occurred in the pre-pandemic era."" Official inflation data for December is due to be published on Wednesday."
economic indicators,Covid cases 'hit half of Scots engineering firms',2024-09-15,2020-11-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-55015555,"More than half of Scottish engineering firms have reported positive Covid-19 tests among their workforces in the final quarter of the year. A survey of about 140 companies by industry body Scottish Engineering found 56% ""experienced and managed the impact"" of a positive test. More than 40% said productivity was affected by ""Covid isolation absence"". Despite this, there was ""significant"" improvement in orders, output and exports on the previous quarter. That said, most indicators remained in negative territory. Confidence overall among companies improved significantly from a net balance of -40% to -9%. There was also an improvement in staffing, with the percentage of companies planning further redundancies falling from 60% in the previous quarter to 21%. Scottish Engineering said the latest review provided ""some optimism"" for 2021, with measures to manage Covid - including a rolling vaccination programme - expected to arrive as early as the spring. However, it added there was still concern that the hardest hit sectors, such as aerospace and oil and gas, would see slower recovery in the face of weaker demand. Uncertainty around Brexit was also cited as a concern. Scottish Engineering chief executive Paul Sheerin said the survey highlighted ""positive aspects"" but caution remained, particularly ""for those areas where recovery looks further away"". He added: ""The winter economic support package from the UK government is genuinely welcomed, but come spring we need to ask whether we want to retain the strength we have in these sectors, and act to provide sector specific support to enable their survival.  ""Other countries are doing so already, so if we want to retain our current capability, a preservation plan is needed, clear and visible long before the current support ends."""
economic indicators,Wales remains bottom of economy table,2024-09-15,2018-12-12,By Sarah Dickins,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-46522457,"Wales is once again least productive of the UK nations and regions, according to the latest figures on the economy. Regional gross value added (GVA) tables show that on average workers in Wales generated £19,899 per head.  GVA calculates the value of what we produce in terms of services we give and the things we make at work. The GVA in Wales grew by 2.7% in 2017 - slower than in Scotland, Northern Ireland and England.  Average growth across the UK was 3%. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes the figures for Wales annually. They help tell us more about how people in different areas are fairing in terms of their opportunities and living standards.  In Scotland, the GVA per head is £25,485, in Northern Ireland it is £21,172, and £28,096 in England.  Anglesey still has the lowest GVA per head of local areas in Wales at £13,957 but is no longer bottom of the UK table.  The island has now moved ahead of five areas in Northern Ireland, with Ards and North Down now at the bottom on £9,862 per head.  As the figures calculate the value of the work that people do at their place of work - it does not tell us where the wealthiest people live.  Although Anglesey has the lowest GVA for Wales there are many people living there with high household incomes. So, if they work in Bangor or Manchester, the value of their work will be calculated there.   The island also has a higher proportion of retired people, so will see its average GVA fall as those people may not be generating value directly on Anglesey.   The Gwent valleys are still also in the UK bottom 10 for local areas at £15,062 per head. But when we look at employment figures for Blaenau Gwent - 71.5% of its working population have a job - it suggests that a high proportion of these are relatively low skilled and that this is reflected in what people take home.  Average wages in Blaenau Gwent in 2018 were £483 a week compared with £517 a week for Wales as a whole.  The findings also include: HOW NEIGHBOURING BUSINESSES BOOST THE ECONOMY   Two businesses in Denbighshire are very different, but less than five miles (7km) apart and both are important to the Welsh economy and their community.  US-owned optical engineering company Qioptiq - which started as Pilkington's 50 years ago -  makes specialist night-sights and thermal imaging equipment for people and equipment for the military and space industries. It employs 650 people at Bodelwyddan and St Asaph and is worth up to £40m for the local economy. It too is growing and the GVA rise in this sector in Wales shows a 14% increase.  ""We have PhDs, master degrees, crafts people in optical engineering, a whole range,"" said managing director Peter White. ""We're world class engineers and reflect that in our pay packets.""  ""We've created wealth for Denbighshire by being here. Once people come to work here, it's a good work-life balance,  the rural environment, Snowdonia and Manchester not far away, it's a good blend."" Llaeth y Llan based near the village of Llannefydd on the Conwy-Denbighshire border makes yoghurt for supermarkets, a very competitive market. It was founded in 1985 and built a processing plant in 2016 on the family farm. Workers are paid more than the average wage for Wales - around £26,000 - and skills range from production, research and innovation to management.  It has grown  by 60% in the last two years Conwy and Denbighshire have a GVA per head of £16,916.   Managing director Owain Roberts said all its ethos and brand was around its Welshness and he believes small businesses contribute locally - and also to the whole economy.  ""We employ 50 people, the majority form the local community. For the plant, all the steel came from a local company and we used a local contractor."" ""We constantly strive to make things slicker and faster, it's finding a niche and developing our staff."" The food  and drink manufacturing sector is dominated by a host of smaller firms and accounts for £4.8 bn of GVA in the Welsh economy every year.   "
economic indicators,China sets growth target of 7.5%,2024-09-15,2014-03-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-26429663,"This is Li Keqiang's first appearance as premier at China's annual parliamentary session China has set its economic growth target for the year at 7.5%, as it looks to continue its efforts to stabilise the economy. The country also set its inflation goal at 3.5%, aimed at keeping prices in check. After years of blistering growth rates, China has seen its rate of expansion slide after a slowdown domestically and in key markets. In 2013, the country grew at a pace of 7.7%, about the same as in 2012. Recent manufacturing data has also indicated a slowdown in activity in the world's second largest economy. The latest targets were announced by Premier Li Keqiang in his first appearance at China's annual parliamentary session, the National People's Congress (NPC). China describes the NPC as the country's ""supreme organ of state power"".  But in practice, it is generally considered a rubber stamping body for the ruling Communist Party. The growth and inflation targets were widely expected. ""Officially, they are conservative and the figures are basically in line with our expectation,"" said Paul Tang, chief economist with the Bank of East Asia in Hong Kong. ""Slower economic growth is already expected for this year. Tightening of fixed-asset investment and lending are seen to remain as the major focuses."" Premier Li said the government would work towards increasing personal incomes, and also promised to address the property market. Property purchases have been a popular investment choice in China - a trend that kept prices rising in 2013 and raised fears of a property bubble. China's central bank acted late last year by tightening monetary conditions and reining in excessive lending growth.

economic indicators,NI private sector growth rate 'slowing',2024-09-15,2018-04-16,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-43759081,"The Northern Ireland private sector continued to grow in March, but the rate of growth is continuing to slow, Ulster Bank data has suggested. The bank surveys private sector activity monthly, in what is considered a reliable indicator of the economy. March's survey saw overall business activity expanding. However, it was at the weakest rate in eight months. The bank's chief economist said the ""Beast from the East"" weather event had ""clearly had an impact"" on activity in construction and manufacturing.  Richard Ramsey added that ""the one-off weather factor makes it difficult to ascertain to what extent this is a blip that will be reversed in April or something more fundamental"". He said that among exporting firms there is still growth in new orders, particularly from the Republic of Ireland. Last week, official economic data suggested that recovery in the Northern Ireland economy may be slowing. The NI Composite Economic Index showed that the output of the NI economy shrank slightly in the last quarter of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. However, that figure was likely distorted on the downside by the closure of the JTI cigarette factory in Ballymena."
economic indicators,How a baffling census delay is hurting Indians,2024-09-15,2023-01-18,By Sharanya Hrishikesh,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64282374,"In 1881, more than 250 million people answered a list of sometimes puzzling questions put to them by hundreds of enumerators, and were counted in British India's first synchronised census. For the next 130 years, after independence and through wars and other crises, India kept its date with the census - once a decade, hundreds of thousands of enumerators visited every household in the country to gather information about people's jobs, families, economic conditions, migration status and socio-cultural characteristics, among other parameters. It's an ambitious exercise which generates a trove of crucial data for administrators, policymakers, economists, demographers and anyone interested in knowing where the world's second-most populous country (set to overtake China this year) is headed. It's used to make decisions on everything from allocating federal funds to states and building schools to drawing constituency boundaries for elections. But for the first time, India's decennial census - which was set to be held in 2021 - has been delayed, with no clarity on when it will be held. Experts say they are worried about the consequences of this, which range from people being excluded from welfare schemes to incorrect resource allocation. ""The census is not simply a count of the number of people in a country. It provides invaluable data needed to make decisions at a micro level,"" says Professor KP Kannan, a development economist who has worked extensively on poverty and inequality. India's census is conducted under the provisions of the Census Act, 1948, which doesn't specify a time period for the government to conduct the exercise or release its results. In 2020, India was set to begin the first phase of the census - in which housing data is collected - when the pandemic hit. The exercise was postponed while travel and movement were restricted and administrators dealt with more pressing issues. Almost three years since then, most eligible Indians have got their Covid vaccinations, several states have held assembly elections and life has almost returned to normal.  But in December, the Narendra Modi government told parliament that ""due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Census 2021 and the related field activities have been postponed until further orders"".  Weeks later, the Registrar General of India said that the deadline for freezing administrative boundaries had been extended to 30 June this year (states and union territories cannot make any changes to the boundaries of districts, towns and villages while the census is being conducted). The latest directive will push the survey to at least September.  Even then, observers don't expect the exercise to take place before late 2024, as India is scheduled to hold its general election in the first part of next year. Economist Dipa Sinha, who teaches at Delhi's Ambedkar University, says an immediate consequence of this delay is on the public distribution system (PDS), through which the government supplies food grain and other essentials to the poor. Since the government still depends on population figures from the 2011 census to determine who is eligible for aid, more than 100 million people are estimated to be excluded from the PDS, says Ms Sinha, quoting from research by economists Jean Dreze, Reetika Khera and Meghana Mungikar.  Their work used birth and death rates released by states and the home ministry's population estimates to arrive at the number. ""The bigger the state, like Uttar Pradesh, the more people may have lost out on welfare schemes,"" Ms Sinha says.  Even before the pandemic and the delay, the 2021 census was bound to be a controversial exercise.  The government had said that it would conduct a population survey to update the National Population Register (NPR) along with the census. But critics had alleged that the NPR would be a list from which ""doubtful citizens"" would be asked to prove they are Indian. The criticism came against the backdrop of a controversial 2019 citizenship law - which opponents say targets India's 200 million-plus Muslims -  that sparked months of protests across the country. Several opposition and regional leaders had also demanded that the federal government conduct a caste census. Analysts believe this may cause fissures in the Hindu vote, which could hurt the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and spark demands for quotas from several groups. Apart from the direct impact on welfare schemes, the census also provides the data set from which other crucial studies -  such as the National Sample Survey (a series of surveys that collect information on all aspects of the economic life of citizens) and National Family Health Survey (a comprehensive household survey of health and social indicators) - draw their samples. While states and some ministries could bridge part of the data gap by conducting their own surveys - Bihar, for instance, is currently doing a caste census which will throw light on several other indicators - these can only be stopgap measures, experts say. ""There is no alternative to a credible national survey like the census, which undertakes complete enumeration of everyone in the country,"" says Prof Kannan, pointing out that states are not watertight compartments where the population stays constant. The uncertainty over the census also comes amid the federal government facing questions over quality of data and delay in the release of several surveys.  In 2019, for instance, the government said it wouldn't release a key survey result for 2017-18 due to ""data quality issues"" after a media report said the study showed a fall in consumer spending for the first time in more than four decades. More than 200 economists, academics and journalists - including Nobel prize-winning economist Angus Deaton - issued a statement asking the government to release the data and raised larger concerns. ""It is of fundamental importance for the nation that statistical institutions are kept independent of political interference, and are allowed to release all data independently,"" the statement said. In August last year, a parliamentary panel questioned the government over an ""undue delay"" in the release of India's seventh economic census, which counts all economic enterprises in the country. ""There is an overall data issue in the country,"" Ms Sinha says. Prof Kannan points out that in the past, India helped other developing countries set up their own censuses, a matter of national pride.  ""India's reputation could suffer internationally as a result of declining data integrity,"" he says."
economic indicators,Nearly one in six Scottish shops lying empty,2024-09-15,2021-04-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-56935627,"The number of empty shops in Scotland has hit a six-year high amid the pandemic, according to industry data.  The Scottish Retail Consortium said the vacancy rate rose to 15.3% in the first quarter of the year, well above the UK-wide average of 14.1%. That means nearly one in six Scottish shop units is lying empty.  Vacancies were highest in shopping centres at 20.1%, compared with just under 14% for the high street and nearly 13% for retail parks.  Experts suggested shopping centres had been particularly exposed to the effects of the pandemic. The Local Data Company (LDC), which compiled the figures, said centres had a lower proportion of ""essential"" retailing, and were more exposed to categories which were in decline, such as fashion, department stores and casual dining. The Scottish Retail Consortium said a longer-term recovery plan for the whole sector was needed. Director David Lonsdale said: ""The maelstrom wrought by the pandemic and the forced closure of stores over the past year is laid bare in these figures. ""It's a vivid reminder of the economic toll of the pandemic and of repeated lockdowns and restrictions.  ""This has been the most bruising period for many of Scotland's retailers, and even with shops now permitted to reopen the fact is large swathes of the sector face an uncertain future.  ""The next devolved government needs to respond to this reality with a recovery plan that pauses any new non-Covid related red tape to allow the industry to recover, by reducing the costs of doing business and supporting consumer spending by keeping down the cost of living."" LDC director Lucy Stainton said that although the true impact of lockdowns had yet to be seen, indications from the first few days of ""unlocking"" had shown there was still significant demand for physical retail and eating out. She added: ""Hopefully, as consumer confidence continues to build momentum with reduced Covid-19 cases, more of the population vaccinated and warmer weather, further fall-out from the pandemic might be mitigated somewhat.""

The BBC's James Cook went to Los Angeles to hear the hopes of six residents.  Theo Henderson lives in the shadows. For seven years straight he has been sleeping on the streets of Los Angeles. A decent education and a good teaching job weren't enough to save him from a series of personal disasters: the deaths of his parents at an early age, ill health, unemployment and finally homelessness. When the economic earthquake of 2007 fractured the American economy, Mr Henderson fell through the cracks. The effects of capitalism have spread through the United States ""like the coronavirus"", he argues, infecting the poorest Americans and leeching compassion from those above them. ""We're a blaming and shaming society,"" he says. Despite his plight Mr Henderson produces a regular podcast about life on the streets of Los Angeles. He would like to see capitalism dismantled entirely but accepts that is not going to happen. Instead he is supporting Bernie Sanders, the left-wing senator from Vermont and current favourite to win the Democratic nomination to run for president. A President Sanders, he believes, would tackle homelessness, improve access to healthcare and restructure the economy to benefit the many not the few.

Donald Trump harnessed those statistics to win the White House for the Republicans in 2016 and has since slowed the flow of immigrants with tighter border controls, harsher treatment of migrants and their families, and intensely hostile rhetoric. Ms Oliveira, who supported former mayor Pete Buttigieg in the primaries, wants a more compassionate approach, including a road to citizenship for undocumented migrants if they contribute to the community and pay their taxes. ""Once we can be more inclusive of the immigrant voice, we'll be able to have more long-lasting solutions to all of our issues,"" she says. The issue of immigration is important for voters in California but homelessness and the provision of affordable housing rank even higher, according to a study by the Public Policy Institute of California. When the Los Angeles Times asked Californians to pick the number one priority for the next president from four key issues, nearly half chose something else entirely - climate change. Al Huck agrees with that. He works in high-tech medical care and lives in Simi Valley, a leafy city to the north-west of LA best known as the final resting place of Republican President Ronald Reagan. ""Climate change is huge,"" he says. ""We have all these wildfires out here in California... huge fires."" According to records dating back to 1932, California has experienced the vast majority of its deadliest, largest and most destructive wildfires in the past 20 years. The factors behind the increase are complex but scientists say human activity has ""significantly enhanced wildﬁre activity in California"". ""I don't think we're going to be able to exist much longer if if we keep going on this route,"" says Mr Huck. He thinks Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York and billionaire founder of the media and financial data company which bears his name, is best placed to tackle this existential challenge, and to beat Mr Trump, whom Mr Huck regards as ""a criminal"". Mr Bloomberg ""knows how to get things done and he also knows how to lead,"" he says. The second priority for voters in the LA Times poll was healthcare reform, which for Ebony Lamkin is a matter of life and death. She suffers from severe Crohn's disease, which requires repeated hospital stays and expensive medication - one treatment alone costs $20,000 a month, she says - leaving her dependent on Medicare, a health insurance programme administered by the federal government. ""Without it, I won't survive,"" she says, bluntly. In the past few years Ms Lamkin has been resuscitated three times and has needed three blood transfusions. She says that changes made under the Trump administration meant she had to stop chemotherapy for six months when the government withdrew her funding, leaving her unable to afford the drug alone. ""My health deteriorated,"" she says. ""It just went down, down, down."" She is back on the medication now but remains worried about the future and is uncertain about which presidential candidate would best protect her. Ms Lamkin sings in the Voices of Destiny Choir, which rehearses at the Greater Zion Church in the LA suburb of Compton, a predominantly African-American district. For her fellow performer, postal worker James Moore Jr, the biggest issue in this election is ""social justice"" and specifically the treatment of black Americans at the hands of the police. ""They'd rather just shoot us down and kill us,"" than try to defuse a situation, he says. For Mr Moore, 31, turnout among the young will be critical in determining his country's future. ""I believe that if we allow our voices to be heard, especially in my generation as a millennial, then I believe that we can get Bernie Sanders in, or anybody else other than Donald Trump,"" he says. Worryingly for Joe Biden, who breathed life into his ailing campaign with a handsome showing among African-American voters in Saturday's South Carolina primary, not one member of the gospel choir says they are intending to vote for him. Polling suggests Barack Obama's former vice president is trailing in the Golden State behind Mr Sanders, with Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, scourge of Wall Street and a former law professor in third place. For Jasmin Tuffaha Gutierrez, who works for a non-profit organisation advocating for workplace rights, ""any thinking, responsible adult in the White House would be wonderful but I'm trying to shoot a little bit further than that - and I love Elizabeth Warren."" For Ms Tuffaha Gutierrez the economy is the biggest issue in the campaign, ""neck and neck with getting Trump out of the White House"". Many Republicans also think the economy will be the biggest issue of 2020, and consider it their trump card thanks to steady growth, unemployment at a 50-year low and record stock market highs. Ms Tuffaha Gutierrez is not convinced.  ""The only reason that the economy is doing well is because of policies enacted by the previous Democratic administration,"" she says, adding ""all of those statistics started when Obama was president."" She is worried about Republican tax policies which, she says, benefit the richest people in the country at the expense of everyone else. And there are indications that the underlying economic picture may be more complex than the White House makes out. Even before coronavirus posed a threat to growth and triggered a sharp fall in share prices, data suggested a sharp slowdown in the growth of median household income, adjusted for inflation during the Trump presidency. That is the sort of statistic which Mr Sanders will surely highlight if he secures the nomination. But even if he does, can a 78-year-old who wants to build a democratic socialist America actually be elected to the highest office in a nation whose power and wealth is often seen as synonymous with capitalism? ""I would like to believe so,"" says Theo Henderson as he prepares for another podcast episode about life on the streets, ""but I'm an African American man and I know the hatred runs deep in this country."""
economic indicators,The mounting cost of Brexit,2024-09-15,2019-09-20,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-49774561,"The price being paid for Brexit is already eye-watering. The latest wheeze is to spend up to £140m telling us to be prepared. For what? Stocking up on olive oil? Buying a German or French car while you can still afford one? The UK government's advertising campaign doesn't say. The message seems to be more relevant to businesses. Well, three points about that: That's just part of the government cost of preparations. Far more significant for the economy is the cost in lost potential. We've got an update today from the Scottish government's chief economist, Gary Gillespie, reckoning that the latter is getting substantially higher.  His team has updated an analysis carried out at the start of last year, looking at the impact on business investment of uncertainty around Brexit.   The findings suggest that continuing uncertainty is adding a further half billion pound shortfall in the business investment than could otherwise be expected. The reckoning early last year was that the impact of a Brexit shock was a drop of £1.3bn in business investment in the quarter we're now in, gradually reducing as trading conditions become clearer. But that reduction in the Brexit shock-induced shortfall is nothing like as clear as it should have been by now. The half billion pound shortfall, added in the latest re-working of the numbers, takes the reduced business investment close to £1.4bn next quarter and the one after that, reducing to £1.2bn in the second quarter of 2020, and still £500m down in the first quarter of 2021. What does that mean? Well, it doesn't seem to be such a problem with foreign investors. Funds from them have been flowing into real estate, thanks to the weakness of sterling making assets look cheap. More significant for the economy is that less is being spent on the supply chain of capital goods. There's a consequent loss of capital stock, down 1% already, and pushing towards 2% by the end of next financial year.  Through that, there is a shortfall in the productivity improvements that new investment ought to bring. And to remind you: productivity - output per hour worked - may not be everything, but if we're to get better off, it's nearly everything. Dr Gillespie is among those to be relaxed about the prospect of the next quarter of gross domestic product figures meaning we're in recession. The contraction in total economic output of 0.3% for the April to June quarter, announced on Wednesday, was slightly sharper than the UK as a whole (0.2%).  But it seemed to follow a similar pattern - stockpiling in the first quarter of the year, in preparation for Theresa May's March deadline, pre-postponement, then unwinding the stockpile in Q2.  The distillers and pharma firms that were biggest into stockpiling in Q1 seemed to be the fastest to cut production in Q2. The indications for the UK economy suggest things have picked up in Q3. That's possibly because stockpiling is under way again, in anticipation of 31 October (this, in case you were wondering, is no way to run a business or an economy). There's another observation from Dr Gillespie's State of the Economy report that points to the real cost of Brexit. If you earn in sterling, you're worse off when you go abroad on holiday, and when you buy imports - not just that German or French car, but a lot of your food and consumer goods, while your fuel is priced in US dollars. Against the euro, we're 15% worse off. Against the US dollar, it's 17%. Now, that should be good news in boosting exports.  British firms, and their workers, benefit from being more competitive when they sell overseas. That's one of the simpler concepts in Higher Economics. Yet it isn't working that way. The International Monetary Fund has looked at this, and found that a weakening of a currency has only a modest impact on boosting exports. A country's trade balance sees more of an impact from fewer imports. That's what we're now seeing in Scotland, according to Dr Gillespie: export growth, already weak, has barely changed, while the rate of growth of imports fell around the time of the 2016 EU referendum, to below that of exports. There's a way of measuring the impact of currency depreciation, by comparing the outcome with what might have been otherwise. Scottish government economists conclude that the trade deficit would have been about £4.4bn by the start of this year, whereas it appears to have been nearer £2.3bn. Almost all of that is explained by lower imports rather than higher exports. Consumer sentiment, meanwhile, remains under water, which is where it took the plunge at the time of the Brexit referendum and where it has remained since. This relatively new indicator of Scottish economic activity tells us that Scots are particularly negative about the prospects for the Scottish economy. Comparing the upbeat with the downbeat, the pessimists have it by a 19 point margin. But ask people about the security of their own household finances, and the optimists come out ahead, by four percentage points. Businesses tend to say something similar: they are more positive about their own prospects than about those of the economy generally. But even the positivity about a company's own prospects reached a zero balance in the most recent business survey. Brexit is not the only cloud on the horizon. Tariff skirmishes, trade hostilities and slowdown in growth across Europe and the USA are also causing concern and slowing up investment. But with Brexit, the UK - Scotland included - is paying a particularly high economic price for its political choices."
economic indicators,Trade war infects Asia as exports plunge,2024-09-15,2019-07-17,By Karishma Vaswani,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49013571,"If you were in any doubt that the US-China trade war is having an impact on Asia, look no further than Singapore's latest export figures. Singapore saw exports fall for a second month in a row, this time by 17.3% in the month of June compared to a year ago.  This dramatic fall comes as Singapore's growth figures released last week showed a 3.4% decline in growth in comparison to the last quarter.  So why should you care if Singapore is selling less of its stuff to the world than it used to?  The city state is one of the most trade-dependent economies in the world, and is often seen as a global indicator for trade.  Analysts are calling Singapore's data the ""canary in the coal mine"", a reference to a well-worn expression to indicate there is danger ahead.  The phrase comes from when miners used to carry caged canaries into mine shafts, to let them know if it was dangerous. The canaries would die if there was even a hint of poisonous gas in the mines, providing a warning signal for the miners to get out.  The worry among Asia-watchers is that Singapore's numbers are just a sign of more bad news to come from the rest of the region.  There is increasing evidence to show that Asia's economies are being hit by the US-China trade war.  ""Around the region it is a similar story,"" says Song Seng Wun, South East Asia economist for CIMB Private Bank.  ""This trade war is coming at a time when global growth is slowing down after ten years of relatively stable times. Even if by some miracle a fairy taps her magic wand and the trade war disappears, all that would happen is that things would just be less bad - rather than really bad."" Data from India, Indonesia and South Korea reads like a list of bad news. June was a particularly gloomy month for the three countries.  India saw exports fall by 9.7%, the first time in nine months.   Indonesia, which counts China as its biggest trading partner, also saw exports fall by 8.98% in comparison with the same period last year.  And South Korea also saw exports fall by 13.5%.   All of these countries sell products ranging from palm oil and chemicals to semiconductor chips to China.  This week China posted the lowest quarterly growth it has seen in close to three decades, partly on trade war worries. US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods now cover more than half of what China sells to the US.  Which means that Chinese companies either have to cut their costs for their buyers, or sell less to the US.  And that means the countries supplying Chinese factories with products are also getting hit.  It doesn't look like it's going to get any better anytime soon.  A report from the Japanese research house Nomura released this week on Asian exports shows that exports ""should remain in the doldrums in the coming month"". Nomura blames this on the ""lack of progress on US-China trade negotiations"", heightened global uncertainty weighing on corporate investment decisions and signs that trade protectionism is being used as a ""weapon of foreign policy"" around the region.  It isn't entirely clear yet when or if the US-China trade war will come to a resolution - or whether this is the start of a ""broader shift in US policy away from free trade"", as think tank Capital Economics points out.  Mr Trump has already indicated that Vietnam - which up to now has been a beneficiary of the US-China trade war - could be next on his tariff list, and economists say Taiwan and South Korea could also be next in line.  Asia is home to the world's next generation of companies and consumers.  By 2050 it could see its share of the global economy grow to 52%, according to the Asian Development Bank - which means the region would also be the main driver of global growth.   But analysts say if the US's anti-free trade trend continues and hits more of Asia's economies, that could hurt the region's long term potential growth rate - in turn hurting the rest of us."
economic indicators,UK jobless total falls to 2.46m,2024-09-15,2011-05-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13436252,"This video can not be played Watch: Chris Grayling says drop in unemployment levels is 'step in the right direction' UK unemployment fell by 36,000 in the three months to the end of March to 2.46 million, the second quarterly drop in a row, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of unemployment in the UK was now 7.7%. Unemployment among 16 to 24-year-olds stood at 935,000, with the jobless rate for young people now at 20%. The number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance rose by 12,400 in April to 1.47 million, the ONS said. It added that the number of people in employment rose by 118,000 to 29.24 million, compared with a pre-recession peak of 29.56 million recorded in the three months to the end of May 2008. Some observers said the rise in employment was a sign the economic recovery was strengthening. ""The strong growth in full-time jobs is especially encouraging, as this is one of the key indicators of a sustainable recovery,"" said Ian Brinkley at the Work Foundation. ""It now looks likely that the economy expanded more strongly than last month's provisional estimates for output growth suggested,"" he added. Official figures showed that the UK economy grew by 0.5% in the first three months of the year. The latest ONS figures show that the number of unemployed men fell by 31,000 to 1.43 million, while the number of unemployed women fell by 5,000 to 1.03 million. But of the 12,400 extra people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance, 9,300 were women, the highest figure since October 1996. The number of male claimants rose for the first time since January. The number of people unemployed for more than 12 months increased by 20,000 to 850,000, the highest number since January 1997. Within the overall unemployment figures there were wide regional variations, with unemployment rising 6,000 by in London and by 4,000 in the North East. The South East, however, saw unemployment fall by 17,000. In Wales, the jobless number fell by 10,000, it Scotland it dropped by 8,000 and in Northern Ireland it declined by 6,000. Average earnings, including bonuses, rose by 2.3% in the the three months to March, compared with 2.1% for the quarter to February. Despite the rise, analysts said the figure showed that wage demands were unlikely to affect inflation in the short term. ""Wage pressures have remained modest, reinforcing the case against an early increase in interest rates,"" said David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce. The ONS also said that the number of working days lost through labour disputes in the year to March was the joint lowest total since records began in 1930. Employment Minister Chris Grayling said the figures represented a ""step in the right direction"", but he warned that the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance was likely to continue to rise. He said this was in part due to changes in benefits rules, which meant people were moving off other benefits and on to Jobseeker's Allowance. Some single parents, for example, were moving off income support and on to unemployment benefits, he said. John Philpott, chief economic adviser to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said this was a reasonable explanation. ""The labour market is not deteriorating enough [to explain the rise in claimants],"" he told the BBC. Shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said the government had to do more to get people back to work and questioned why unemployment was falling ""much faster"" in other developed economies, particularly Germany and the US. The government must ""stop dithering and start delivering"", he said. Some analysts warned that despite the fall in unemployment, the number of people out of work was likely to rise again in the coming months, largely due to government spending cuts. ""We suspect that likely below-trend growth will mean that the private sector will be unable to fully compensate for the increasing job losses in the public sector that will result from the fiscal squeeze that is now really kicking in,"" said Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight. He said he expected 2.67 million people to be out of work by the end of this year, with the unemployment rate rising to 8.4%. The British Chambers of Commerce said the government must do more to help the private sector make up for the jobs being lost in the public sector.  ""The burden of regulation on businesses, particularly small- and medium-sized firms still weighs too heavily and in many cases prevents companies from creating jobs,"" Mr Kern said. The government has started implementing extensive spending cuts that are designed to reduce the budget deficit, which is the amount it spends each year over and above its income. It says that the cuts are necessary to restore international investors' confidence in the UK economy, but critics argue that the cuts could jeopardise the UK's fragile recovery. ONS"
economic indicators,"Hard times ahead, economist warns",2024-09-15,2011-05-27,Hugh Pym,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13578420,"This video can not be played Spencer Dale: ""The next year or two will be a relatively bleak time, we have relatively hard times ahead"" The Bank of England's chief economist has told the BBC there are ""relatively hard times ahead"".   Spencer Dale said the possibilities of growth remaining feeble and inflation high were ""very significant risks"". Mr Dale, who sits on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), has voted for interest rates to rise in recent months. Mr Dale was on a two-and-a-half day visit to the Scottish Borders and Edinburgh.   He visited a textile factory and a timber processing plant, as well as speaking at meetings of the CBI and Chambers of Commerce.   It was part of the MPC's regular programme of trips around the UK to gauge the state of the economy.  During the visit, he took time out to speak to the BBC. I first asked Mr Dale about why he had voted at four successive meetings for a 0.25% increase in the Bank's official interest rate.    He has been in a minority on the committee, with the decisions coming down in favour of holding rates at the record low of 0.5%. He acknowledged that economic growth was subdued.   ""I am not confident about the strength of the recovery, particularly in terms of the weakness we see in the household sector and the implications that may have for consumption,"" he said. But the Bank's top economist added: ""I am even more worried about inflation and the risk that we may see price pressures from the rest of the world continue to push up and the high levels of inflation we have seen in the UK persist for longer than we otherwise expect."" So should households expect an increase in the cost of borrowing sometime this year? ""I think the level of interest rates at the moment is at an extraordinary low level - the Bank rate is at the lowest level it's ever been,"" he said. ""At some point, I do expect interest rates to rise, but how quickly and how much, I really can't say."" Mr Dale made it clear that he was open-minded and could change his vote at future meetings of the MPC. ""I could change my view at any point in either direction - that's the only way you can behave as a policymaker,"" he told me. ""You have got to approach this job with a big dose of pragmatism and humility. We don't know precisely what's going on in the economy at the moment and we know even less about how the economy is going to evolve going forward. ""So all you can do I think is remain open-minded, keep challenging yourself and then vote in terms of the interest rate you think is most appropriate to get inflation back down to target."" Households are facing an intense squeeze with average pay rises about half the annual rate of inflation.  Mr Dale argued that this was part of the rebalancing of the economy away from consumption and borrowing towards investment and export growth.   He pointed out that monetary policy could not offset this process.  But he added: ""I understand exactly the pain that many households are feeling and have huge sympathy for them."" I asked him whether there was light at the end of the tunnel with some indicators still looking bleak. ""I think the next year or two will be a relatively bleak time. I think we have relatively hard times ahead,"" he replied.  ""But I think we are starting towards a path of sustainable recovery.  ""The lower level of sterling should help to support this rebalancing of the economy and, moreover, I do expect inflation to start to fall in a year or two's time and that will also help to reduce some of the pressures."" But is he worried about growth remaining pretty weak? ""I am worried about growth remaining feeble and I am also worried about inflation remaining high - and if you like that's the dilemma facing the MPC at the moment - trying to balance these two very significant risks."" Mr Dale left the impression that the Bank of England was well aware of the conflicting pressures in the economy and that there would be challenging times ahead as policymakers decided when to make the first move on interest rates.

economic indicators,Saudi women drive social media campaign,2024-09-15,2011-06-27,Katy Watson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13928215,"This video can not be played WATCH: Saudi Arabia's women are forced to rely on men to do the driving - which puts many jobs off-limits, and makes running a business almost impossible The video shows a young woman getting into her car for a spin around town with a friend. Giggling away, they sound excited yet nervous. And all the while, they comment on the reactions of passers-by.  So far, the story sounds uneventful. After all, millions of women across the world drive every day without a second thought.  Only the difference is, this video was shot by 28-year old Solafa from Saudi Arabia, the only country in the world that bans women from driving. On June 17, dozens of videos similar to Solafa's surfaced on the internet, all showing women behind the wheel in defiance of a ban that is not enforced by law but is a religious fatwa imposed by Muslim clerics.  It was a protest of a different kind - unlike the mass demonstrations that have been seen throughout the region this year, this was a campaign of just 50 women.  But one thing it has in common with the Arab protests is the role social media played.  Through Twitter and Facebook, the 'Women2Drive' campaign gave women a voice for other people to hear. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton openly supported their cause. Even some of the Saudi royals have backed what the women are doing.  Solafa Kurdi uploaded a video of herself driving in Saudi Arabia to YouTube.com Solafa and her friends joined the campaign to prove a point. ""Being a photographer needs me to be in different places and at different times,"" says Solafa. ""I have to pay around $500 every month just for a driver, when I could do what he's doing myself.""  Although Solafa says she can afford that extra cost, it is more of a burden for families where women are paid lower salaries. ""The minimum wage for a Saudi worker is around 3,000 riyals ($800; £500),"" Solafa says. ""If you're going to put half of that on a driver, there goes half of your salary, it's almost like paying taxes."" The likes of Twitter, Facebook and Youtube have enabled the women to challenge the status quo more easily.  A recent report published by the Dubai School of Government examined the role social media has played in the Arab uprising. It found that the percentage of women who used Facebook rose from 32% to 33.5% in the first three months of this year.  A small percentage increase maybe, especially when you consider that on average, women globally constitute 61% of Facebook users. Nevertheless, while the percentage of women users in the Arab world creeps up, the proportion of male Facebook users in the region is falling.  The social media campaign gained a huge international following Looking at the effect of social media on the region's economy is still in its infancy, according to Fadi Salem, Director of Governance and Innovation at the Dubai School of Government and the co-author of the report. Nevertheless, it does have potential. ""If compared to the emergence of the internet over the last decade and how it contributed to economic development, there are many indicators suggesting that this could be the case as well for social media,"" says Salem.  ""In theory it has this personal characteristic, it has the anonymity, if that's a barrier for some women to participate or start businesses or join a political discussion."" And taking part is crucial for the Gulf's biggest economy.  More than half of Saudi's university graduates are women.  Last month saw the opening of the world's largest women-only university in Riyadh. But when it comes to the world of work, it is a different story. According to the International Labour Organisation, in 2009 just 17% of women of working age were in employment in Saudi Arabia.  That compares with neighbouring United Arab Emirates where 42% of women work and Qatar, where half the women work. The proportion of working Saudi women is very low compared to other Gulf countries Mohammad Al-Qahtani is the head of Saudi Arabia's Civil and Political Rights Association.  He accompanied his wife in the passenger seat on June 17 and says he will make sure his 13-year-old daughter learns to drive too.  ""Women's driving is part of it but it's not the whole thing. You have other social restrictions, religious restrictions for women not to work in certain professions,"" Mohammad says.  ""You add all these together and you get this bleak picture of 17% participation, which is one of the lowest in the world.""  Even without the full participation of women in the labour market, Saudi Arabia has huge unemployment problems.  One in three people under the age of 25 is jobless in Saudi Arabia. Foreign workers - and that includes the thousands of drivers working for Saudi women - outnumber the Saudi nationals working in the Kingdom. So what is the solution?  ""We should accommodate small and medium sized enterprises, we should create more jobs in the private sectors,"" says Mohammad.  ""If you ask any typical Saudi female businesswoman you get this sense of resentment that she's forced out of her business. She has to hire a male guardian to take care of her business.  ""All these restrictions tend to force women to quit their business altogether. It's a big loss not only for them but the economy as a whole."" And so many women in Saudi choose to work abroad.  Dr Hibah Shata is a Saudi dentist who has lived in the United Arab Emirates for 10 years.  Business is easier for her in Dubai. The system is set up to encourage women, she says. Nevertheless, she thinks the culture in the region, that emphasises the protection of women, can hold them back. Dr Hibah Shata has worked in the UAE for 10 years. She says it's much easier to do business there as a woman. ""The woman is with her father and her brother, then her husband and her children, so there is somebody to take care of her all the time, and that's the shelter that the woman has had for so long,"" Dr Shata says.  ""I think that's one of the challenges that women who are trying to be in business and be equal to men face, because men don't take them as seriously.  ""They don't see them very independent as they grow up."" Social media seems to be changing that.  Twitter and Facebook accounts are giving more women a voice outside their own home. But they still face opposition from some quarters in giving women the same rights as men.  Turning online campaigns into meaningful political and economic participation is still a way off.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy has said France and Germany will never let the euro fail. He acknowledged concerns about the future of the euro following bail-outs of Greece and the Irish Republic, as he addressed the World Economic Forum. ""Whether it be [German] Chancellor Merkel or myself, never will we turn our backs on the euro. Never will we abandon the euro,"" he said. He added that those who bet against the euro should watch out for their money. ""The euro spells Europe. The euro is Europe and Europe has spelled 60 years of peace on our continent, therefore we will never let the euro go or be destroyed,"" he insisted. France currently holds the presidency of the G20 and Mr Sarkozy was speaking about his vision for the group. He is keen to negotiate a deal on currency reform during his tenure. But his call for a new international monetary system has received a cool response from the US, which sees it as an attempt to undermine the dollar.  The French president said he was not trying to weaken the US currency, adding that France was ""deeply attached"" to its friendship with the US. ""The dollar will continue to be the world's number one currency,"" he said. He also called for the mandate of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be expanded to measure and enforce new rules on global economic imbalances.  He said the G20 should develop a set of indicators to define and measure imbalances on issues including currencies, trade and current accounts. ""I think it's worthwhile rethinking the IMF statutes to make it the organisation in charge of economic, financial and monetary policy co-ordination, and of enforcing the indicators."" French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde echoed these comments in a BBC World TV debate on global leadership. ""We want on the agenda of G20 the topic of global governance,"" she said, saying the roles of bodies like the World Trade Organization, the International Labour Organization and the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization - as well as the IMF - need to be looked at.

Today, that delicate signal - first given in a BBC interview the Governor of the Bank of England gave last month - became a lot stronger. Global growth is continuing at a rate not seen since 2011. All the vital economic engines - America, China, continental Europe and Japan - are, if not exactly purring, exuding a level of confidence which has put the Bank in a more positive mood. The European Commission's Economic Sentiment Indicator is close to a 17 year high. Growth in China was faster in 2017 compared with 2016. The US is seeing a jobs boom. We are an exporting nation - more than 25% of everything we make we sell abroad. If ""abroad"" is doing well, we do well. The Bank has upgraded growth for the UK for this year and next. Employment rates are at record levels and wage growth is slowly returning. Business investment is up. Now, this benign environment does contain risks. As demand increases globally, inflationary pressures rise. Oil prices are up. Commodity prices for things like metals are up. Rising wages in the UK increases the risk of domestic inflation taking hold. The Bank is wary. Inflation is still 1% above the 2% target set by the Government. It was willing to ""look through"" that issue whilst the economy still needed the support of hyper-low interest rates. That willingness has waned. Today the Bank warned that interest rates are likely to increase earlier this year than expected and then more often after that than previously anticipated. The chances of the next interest rate rise happening in May have risen considerably. The chances of another rate rise in 2019 and 2020 have also increased. Let's not forget - the present very low rates are unconventional and allowing inflation to float above target is also against the norm. Today the Bank signalled that the old conventions of increasing interest rates when inflation is above target would return. The cost of mortgages is likely to rise. And savers at last will see returns improve. The economy is stronger, the Bank has made clear today.  But not everything in the garden is rosy. It points out that the UK economic engine still ""remains restrained by Brexit-related uncertainty"" which is ""the most significant influence on the economic outlook"". We are driving along with the hand brake half on. Growth is modest by historic standards and the UK has gone from the fastest growing economy among the G7 largest global economies to the slowest. Consumer confidence is also soft, affected by the incomes squeeze which has seen earnings not rising as fast as inflation. There are two big points from today's Inflation Report, the Bank's three monthly health check on the UK economy. Growth is better. And the risk of interest rate rises has risen."
economic indicators,Is UK inflation going to keep falling?,2024-09-15,2022-12-14,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63974337,"The dip in the overall rate of inflation in the year to November should be the start of a few months of falls. October's four-decade high now looks to have been the peak. But inflation will remain very high for months to come. Even talk of a moderation in the rate of price rises seems out of kilter with everyday experience. On our visits around the country, everybody is feeling the sharpest of pinches, and most people seem to be willing to talk about it.  I was at the Winter Wonderland fair and ice rink in Reading testing the rather cold ground. They think they have benefitted from offering free entrance, but the owner Billy tells me there are signs of a profound squeeze everywhere.  People paying for the rides with credit cards and looking for cheaper options on food and drink. Meanwhile, Billy's family are stepping in to help staff the fair as other costs sky rocket.  ""Fuel has doubled over the past 12 months, but that's slowly creeping down. Gas prices have nearly tripled, and there's no sign that's coming down. The food is staying staying sky high... The drinks from the breweries that's going up,"" he tells me.  Apart from for car fuel, none of the punters say they can feel much of a change. Even in the latest inflation figures, food price rises reached new 45-year highs of 16.5%, as is evident in the shops. But it's not just petrol prices contributing to a slowing of the inflation rate. Other commodity prices and transport costs are on their way down.  The fall in the price of used cars - one of the first indicators of the inflationary pressures last summer - is now accelerating. Globally, there are signs of a peak, especially in the US. The UK's inflation rate is now lower than Italy and Germany's, but higher than in France. While consumers still face an historic squeeze from the cost of living, the Bank of England may feel able to slow up on rises in interest rates, especially given expectations a recession has already started.  In the absence of further shocks to the world economy, the very worst may well be behind us in the charts at least. It will be many months more before that is felt in ordinary households.  "
economic indicators,The pound's fall: A tale of two cities,2024-09-15,2019-07-12,By Russell Hotten & Dan Ascher,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48954323,"Rob and Chloe are sharing a small Starbucks while admiring the bright lights of New York's Times Square. Coffee cost? Almost $5. They've also had a cake and a sandwich. $16-plus.  Based on the exchange rate they got back in Kent, nurse Chloe estimates the total cost was around £17. ""Given where we are I suppose it wasn't too excessive,"" she says. ""But I think it's the most expensive coffee I've ever bought."" Lunch, in the heart of Little Italy, was also an eye-opener. Two margherita pizzas, two glasses of wine, and tip (obligatory everywhere): $96.  Chloe said: ""We are watching the pennies. It's not spoiling our trip... but there are things we thought we'd do that we won't now."" They'd come to Times Square for discounted tickets for Broadway shows. Even these were too pricey. ""We'll give it a miss this time,"" says Rob, who, like Chloe, did not want his surname used. Like tens of thousands of UK tourists, the couple picked an expensive time to visit America.  This week sterling hit a more than two-year low against the dollar, trading below $1.25, a rate not seen since April 2017. But these are commercial rates. Tourists get a worse deal when exchanging currency. And yet, sterling's recent weakness has failed to dent visitor numbers. According to the US Department of Commerce, 1.8 million Britons visited the US in the five months to 31 May, 8.2% up on the period in 2018. The overwhelming majority were tourists and people visiting friends and family. For 2018 as a whole, 4.7 million visited, up 4% on 2017. This, though, is below the peak year of 2015 when 4.9 million people visited. But analysts doubt the numbers will hold up for the rest of 2019. Indeed, Adam Sacks, president of Philadelphia-based Tourism Economics, thinks the official data over-estimates the picture.  For a start, airline passenger growth from the UK to the US is up only 4%, he said. ""Right now, the market [from the UK] is defying gravity."" It helps that the US is a bucket-list attraction. ""That will always underpin tourism,"" he said. But with sterling facing more headwinds because of Brexit, economic slowdown, and trade wars, ""I'm expecting inbound total traffic for the year to end about 2.5% up on 2018,"" he said. It's not the first time the Strattons, from Hatfield, Hertfordshire, have visited New York, but it's probably the most expensive.  They booked their hotel and flight last year, so think they got a better deal than now. ""And we're aware of all the free and discounted attractions that are available,"" says Annette. She advises visitors to do their research and seek these out to save money.  But, Richard says: ""Eating out for the four of us is very expensive - $100 a time at least. Sales taxes and tips mean costs soon increase. Even the hotel charges for wifi use."" They've split some breakfasts and drinks between them to help cut costs. And they had hoped to take in one of Broadway's blockbuster shows - hopefully Hamilton. ""But not at $1,200 for the family,"" said Richard. Annette says that when you're on holiday there's a certain ""pay what it takes"" attitude. And daughters Georgia and Kerensa say they are loving their trip - which as parents know, is what matters most. The girls are especially looking forward to next week, when they visit Florida's amusement parks. Mum, though, thinks it could be even more expensive than New York. Chris Heywood, an executive at New York's tourist board, NYC & Company, says it would take a sustained and prolonged sterling depression to hit hard the number of UK visitors to his city. Britons make up the single biggest group of overseas visitors, with 1.26 million seeing the sites in 2018. The number has grown steadily since 2012, when one million visited. ""People are planning their visits better. More come in the first three months of the year, when hotel rates drop,"" he said. His single biggest piece of advice: ""Check our website. There is so much free stuff to do.""  In London, however, Americans are getting slightly more bang for their buck. Joy Smith, from Colorado, was in London to meet her daughter, Reilly, who was on the final stop of a six-week European tour with husband Seth before the couple return to Texas. Joy said she was expecting prices to be higher but, in fact, the cost of food was ""very comparable"" to prices back home.  But the Baycroft family had a different London culinary experience. Johanna, had just bought her son, Cougar, a meal at McDonald's, which she said would have been almost half the price at home in Washington state. Nevertheless, prices overall were lower than she had budgeted for, although she had prepared for the worst and saved money by staying with her sister. Bob and Priya were leaving Hamley's with their two daughters, who had bought two teddy bears. The couple were used to New York prices so London ""wasn't a shocker"", Bob said. The EU referendum in June 2016 knocked the value of the pound, making things cheaper for US tourists. Before the vote, $1 was worth around 68 pence. It's now worth about 80p. And that spurred a big increase in the number of people crossing the Atlantic. The Office for National Statistics recorded a 13% jump in the number of Americans arriving in London in 2017, with 2.6 million visitors spending about £2.2bn - when $1 was worth an average of 81 pence. That helped to offset a slowdown in domestic spending, according to Henry Gregg, from the New West End Company, which represents Central London businesses. ""For domestic shoppers, it's bad because they see prices increase,"" he said. But it's good for international shoppers who can take advantage of the ""big pricing differential"" in the short term, he said. Luxury brands have been the biggest beneficiaries of the increase in spending by US tourists, Mr Gregg said. Budget retailers like Primark have also benefitted. It's been ""middle of the road"" clothes stores like Topshop that have missed out, he said. While the number of Americans visiting London increased slightly in 2018, they cut back on spending, forking out £2bn, 8% less than the previous year. Mr Gregg puts the tightening of purse strings down to a normalisation as retailers increase prices to reflect an increase in costs as a result of an unfavourable exchange rate for importers. But that's not deterring Americans from bringing their tourist dollars to London, according to the New West End Company, which also tracks room bookings - an early indicator of visitor numbers. It said projected visitor numbers would rise 4.8% for June-to-August. London, like New York, is on the must-see list of most tourists. Exchange rates may fluctuate, but the lure of the bright lights remains."
economic indicators,Severn Bridge tolls cut for first time,2024-09-15,2017-09-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-41271239,"Tolls on the Severn Bridges will be cut in January for the first time, as VAT is removed from the fees. Cars heading for Wales will be charged £5.60 instead of £6.70, with vans paying £11.20 - down from £13.40 - and coaches £16.70, currently £20. UK ministers confirmed it was a step towards abolishing tolls altogether at the end of 2018, as revealed in July. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said tolls had been ""an economic and symbolic barrier to Wales' future prosperity"". It will be the first time since the first Severn Bridge opened in 1966 that the toll has been cut. The reduction takes effect on 8 January, the date the two crossings return to public ownership.  Motorists will also not face the usual inflation-related increase on New Year's Day. Mr Cairns will give the news to business leaders at a meeting of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Wales regional council in Newport on Friday. ""For so many years, the tolls on both Severn Crossings have been seen as an economic and symbolic barrier to Wales' future prosperity,"" he said.  ""Our decision to reduce the tolls - before abolishing them altogether - will cut costs for businesses, for commuters and tourists alike - helping boost jobs and trade in Wales and across the South-West [of England]. ""This is yet another strong indicator that Wales is open for business and of the UK government's commitment to making the right decisions for Wales' future as part of a strong United Kingdom."" The UK government said estimates showed abolition of the tolls could boost the south Wales economy by £100m a year and save regular motorists more than £1,400 a year. Michael Gough, co-owner of a haulage company in Llandrindod Wells, Powys, told BBC Radio Wales: ""Every reduction is a benefit to Wales. ""However you look at it, the Severn Bridge toll is a tax on every business that is based here. ""[The cut in the toll] is a start, and we as a company are looking forward to the abolition of it at the end of the year. ""That's a large saving - even as a relatively small company based in mid Wales we spend about £1,500 a week on the tolls, so as you can imagine that would be of great benefit to us."""
economic indicators,Iran suspends parts of nuclear deal,2024-09-15,2019-05-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48197628,"Iran has suspended commitments under the 2015 international nuclear deal, a year after it was abandoned by the US. President Hassan Rouhani said he would keep enriched uranium stocks in the country rather than sell them abroad. He also threatened to resume production of more-highly-enriched uranium in 60 days if other signatories did not act to protect Iran from US sanctions. The 2015 accord was aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions in return for relief from sanctions. But since the US left the deal it has imposed new sanctions, hitting Iran's economy and raising Iran-US tensions. Iran informed the remaining parties to the deal - France, Germany, Russia, China and the UK - of its decision on Wednesday morning. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran was acting within its rights under the deal and it was up to the three European powers to act. Under the deal Iran is required to sell its surplus enriched uranium abroad, rather than keep it. This is important as the material, which is a by-product of Iran's civilian nuclear power generation, can be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. By selling it abroad, Iran can continue to generate nuclear power and the parties to the agreement can be sure it is not building nuclear weapons. Iran's announcement comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an unscheduled visit to Iraq, and a US aircraft carrier was deployed to the Gulf region.  US officials have reported threats to US forces and their allies from Iran, but have given few details about the exact nature of the threat. Mr Rouhani said he was suspending two parts of the deal, which is known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), that Iran was adhering to - the sale of surplus enriched uranium and heavy water. He then gave the European powers, Russia and China 60 days to meet their financial and oil commitments to the deal. If they did so, Iran would resume the sales. If, however, those commitments were not met and the powers chose to follow US sanctions, he said Iran would begin higher enrichment of uranium, which is currently capped, and begin developing its Arak heavy water reactor based on plans made prior to the deal. But Iran's president added: ""We do not want to leave the agreement. All the people of the world should know that today is not the end of the JCPOA; it is a new step within the framework of the JCPOA."" However, he said the five powers would face a ""very decisive reaction"" if Iran's nuclear case was referred to the UN Security Council. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov quickly urged all of the remaining parties to the deal to fulfil their obligations. Both Russia and China have blamed Washington's withdrawal from the deal for the current situation. A spokesman for UK PM Theresa May said the deal was ""crucial"" and that Britain would ensure it remained in place as long as Iran upheld its commitments. Foreign Office minister Mark Field told parliament Iran's move was an ""unwelcome step"". French Defence Minister Florence Parly told French media that the European powers were doing everything they could to keep the deal alive but there would be consequences and possibly sanctions if the deal was not adhered to. Germany remained ""fully committed"" to its pledges on the deal if Iran reciprocated, a German foreign ministry spokesman said. Iran is seeking to strike a difficult balance: pushing back against some of the restrictions imposed by the JCPOA, while not doing so much as to withdraw from it altogether. This is an alarm signal but also a warning. Iran is facing growing pain from re-imposed US sanctions.  It wants the Europeans to take urgent practical steps to provide some relief. And if relief does not come, then Iran may well have to re-consider its overall adherence to the JCPOA - which the US abandoned a year ago.  This presents the Europeans with a huge dilemma. They are caught between the Iranians and the Trump administration. Can they continue to back the agreement if Iran is not fully complying with its terms? The US is likely to insist that there can be no middle way. Iran is either honouring the terms of the JCPOA or it is not.  In January, the UK, Germany and France set up a new payments mechanism to allow businesses to trade with Iran without being subject to sanctions. The three countries opposed last year's decision by President Donald Trump to abandon the deal. The system, known as Instex, is supposed to focus on ""legitimate trade"" in goods ""where the immediate need of the Iranian people is greatest"", for example food, pharmaceutical products and consumer goods not subject to sanctions. Oil, Iran's main source of foreign exchange, is at the moment not covered, and it is thought so far that the payment system has done little to soften the impact of sanctions. Iran now wants the Europeans to give the system more bite. The landmark nuclear deal was thrown into flux when President Trump announced the US withdrawal one year ago. The value of Iran's currency has since been pushed to record lows, its annual inflation rate quadrupled and foreign investment driven away. Despite this, Iran has upheld its commitments to the deal, according to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Tensions between the US and Iran can be traced back to Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979, which overthrew the pro-Western Shah and established a radical anti-US regime in its place. President Trump has taken a particularly hard line towards Iran since he took office in 2016.  His administration wants to renegotiate the nuclear deal and widen its scope so that it also curbs Iran's ballistic missile programme and ""malign"" activities in the Middle East. The US has recently raised the pressure on Iran, with two significant moves in April:  And earlier this week, National Security Adviser John Bolton said the US was deploying an aircraft carrier to the Middle East following a number of ""troubling and escalatory indications and warnings"" from Iran."
economic indicators,US jobs growth jumps in November,2024-09-15,2019-12-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50690745,"The US economy added the largest number of jobs for 10 months in November, confounding economists' expectations of a slowdown. Official data showed employers added 266,000 jobs last month, while the jobless rate dipped to 3.5% from 3.6%. The growth was helped by striking GM workers returning to work and a big rise in healthcare posts. The US economy has continued to expand, despite concerns that trade wars had hit business confidence and investment. Richard Flynn, UK managing director at Charles Schwab, said the latest jobs data had ""surpassed expectations"". ""The upbeat data reinforces the strength of both the labour market and consumer confidence, despite slowing global growth and continued trade uncertainty."" Friday's report from the US Labor Department showed wide-ranging gains, even in indicators that were slow to revive after the financial crisis. For example, the number of people working part-time, despite wanting full-time positions, dropped to 4.32 million - well below the 30-year average.  Wage growth, while still modest, also ticked up, rising 3.1% year-on-year. The White House welcomed the gains, which officials said proved President Donald Trump's economic policies were working. ""Great jobs report!"" Mr Trump tweeted.  Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the jobs numbers were ""astonishing"", but could be revised down at some point. The 266,000 rise was ""well above"" the analyst consensus of 180,000, and considering returning GM workers were part of a net gain of 41,000 in the motor industry, the numbers were ""hugely strong"", he said. ""This is wild,"" he said. ""That [jump is] hard to square with leading indicators, all of which tanked in the late summer and early fall, so it seems like a candidate for a big downward revision."" The US economy, which is powered largely by consumer spending, grew at an annualised rate of 2.1% in the three months to 30 September, according to the latest government estimate. But business investment and confidence have slumped, amid concerns about trade fights and global growth. The rate of hiring has also retreated, dipping from an average of 223,000 per month in 2018 to 180,000 per month this year. To address fears of a slowdown, the US central bank has lowered interest rates three times since July. The strength of the latest hiring report suggests the Federal Reserve will leave rates untouched for now, analysts said."
economic indicators,Week ahead in Parliament,2024-09-15,2019-06-28,By Mark D'Arcy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-48798163,"After long weeks becalmed in the parliamentary doldrums, Westminster will be moving again next week - with a couple of significant moments expected.  On Brexit there's an innovative backbench attempt to block a no-deal exit, and the long awaited publication of Gemma White QC's independent inquiry into bullying and harassment within the parliamentary community is expected early in the week.  Both could generate considerable aftershocks. First the Brexit manoeuvre. The Labour former Foreign Secretary, Dame Margaret Beckett, and the Conservative former Attorney General, Dominic Grieve, have come up with a new line of attack.  They're proposing amendments in next week's Estimates Day debates which would block the funding of key government departments: international development, education, work and pensions and housing, unless MPs agree a Brexit outcome. In other words they aim to make it impossible for the government to bypass Parliament and impose a no-deal exit from the EU, because if ministers did, the flow of cash to government services would stop.  To succeed, this will need Labour to whip in support and deliver most, if not all, its troops, as well as the support of independents and the smaller parties; and after talking to both pro-Brexit and Remain Labour MPs, I doubt they will fancy the idea of switching off large chunks of government spending on top of a no-deal exit. The estimates are the formal process by which MPs approve the spending of taxpayers' money, and despite recent attempts to make them a more meaningful exercise, they remain something of an empty ritual.  But if these amendments were passed (there's one for each department) there would be real impact; the amendments must then be written into the otherwise unamendable Supply and Estimates Main Appropriations Bill that goes before MPs on Wednesday.   This is one of the relatively few opportunities for opponents of a no-deal exit to seek to block it in the Commons, and the number of Conservative votes for the amendments will be an interesting barometer of the mood of Tory Remainers, and an important indicator of the scale of the parliamentary challenge which will confront the incoming prime minister.  At the moment Mr Grieve's name is joined by that of ex-minister Phillip Lee; will more rebels join them? There are also hints the cross-party alliance behind this manoeuvre may have further tricks up its collective sleeve. Suddenly everyone seems to be on a three-line whip for Wednesday, which suggests more action to come - perhaps another Letwin-style amendment to the Business of the House Motion, to set aside another Commons day for some anti-Brexit legislation?  There is also some Brexit action in the Lords, where peers will debate a motion calling for the creation of a joint Commons Lords Committee, to report on the impact of a no-deal Brexit.  On the abuse of staff, the Gemma White report has been in the pipeline for a while - its focus is on bullying and mistreatment of staff working directly with MPs - and the parliamentary authorities are braced for another hammer blow to their institution.  It should lead to more action to protect staff, but the key thing to watch is whether generalised statements of support from the bewildering number of players in the administration of the Commons are matched by a concrete action plan.  Will they, for example, launch inquiries into historic allegations against a number of prominent figures? The point about this is staff have to have confidence in any complaints system - and maybe the only way to achieve that if for a well-known figure to publicly named and shamed.  And finally there's significant movement in the campaign to allow medical use of cannabis. Here's my rundown of the week ahead: The Commons week begins (14:30 BST) with Work and Pensions Questions, after which the normal crop of post weekend ministerial statements and urgent questions will doubtless appear. The day's main event is a Estimates Day debate on government spending estimates for the Department for International Development and the Department for Education, complete with Beckett-Grieve amendments (see above).  There are also a more conventional amendment from the Labour front bench, calling for a government report on the impact of the spending plans on issue like child poverty and social justice. The day ends with an adjournment debate on children's palliative care - with the Conservative, Dr Caroline Johnson, pointing to the patchy provision of an essential service.  In Westminster Hall (16:30), Daniel Zeichner will lead a debate on e-petition 239444 which calls for homophobia to be made a specific criminal offence. It attracted 152,458 signatures.  The government responded to the petition in March recognising the ""harm that homophobic online messages can cause"". They say they are ""working cross-government to challenge inequality and make the UK's online environment a safer place"".  On the Committee Corridor, the Public Accounts Committee (16:00) has a session on penalty charge notices in healthcare. They will be examining whether the system is failing - with millions in fines uncollected and millions having to be repaid.  In the Lords (14:30) questions include Labour's Lord Haskel asking about the motion by the House of Commons declaring an environment and climate emergency. The main debates are on two select committee reports the Chairman of the Economic Affairs Committee Lord Forsyth of Drumlean will raise their recommendations of their report on measuring inflation which found that the UK Statistics Authority is at risk of being in breach of its statutory duties on the publication of statistics, by refusing to correct an error that it openly admits exists in the Retail Prices Index (RPI).  The report calls for the authority to follow the procedure for correcting the error and resume a programme of regular methodological improvements. It also recommends a single measure of general inflation for use by the government. Next, Lord Bassam of Brighton will lead a debate on the report from his Select Committee on Regenerating Seaside Towns and Communities: The future of seaside towns. This warned of a long-term decline in domestic tourism, fishing, shipbuilding and port activities, with seaside towns facing neglect.  It recommends that the Local Enterprise Partnerships should support seaside regeneration through Local Industrial Strategies. Will this be the Chancellor Philip Hammond's final question time? He's been increasingly outspoken in recent weeks, and Treasury Questions (11:30) could provide him with the chance for another jeremiad about the promises for tax cuts and extra spending emanating from the Conservative leadership contenders.  Conservative MP Andrew Griffiths has a Ten Minute Rule Bill to entitle women aged under 40 and with a family history of breast cancer to breast screening services, and then it's back to Estimates Day debates, this time covering the Department for Work and Pensions and the Ministry of Housing. Communities and Local Government. In Westminster Hall Labour's Chris Bryant leads a debate (9:30)  on Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).  He is the chair of the All-Party Group on ABI, and he wants to highlight the extent of the injury and the need to improve the support and services. Former Defra minister George Eustice leads a debate on the religious slaughter of farm animals (11:00). There are concerns that the failure to stun animals before killing them under some methods of slaughter is cruel, and that Halal and Kosher meat should be labelled by method of slaughter.  In 2014, the All Party Group for Beef and Lamb conducted an inquiry into non-stun slaughter in accordance with religious rites and whether the right of Freedom of Religious Expression outweighs animal welfare considerations. On the Committee Corridor, following the government's recent change in the law to commit the UK to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050, the Treasury Committee (9:30) takes evidence on decarbonisation and green finance. And there's a session on drugs policy at the Health and Social Care Committee (14:30) with witnesses including senior police officer and pressure groups. In the Lords (14:30) proceedings open with the introduction of the new Bishop of Derby the Rt Rev Libby Lane. She was the first woman ever to be appointed a bishop in the Church of England, in 2015.  But because she was appointed initially as a suffragan (junior) bishop, she had to wait a while because it is only the more senior diocesans who enter the Lords. After four years as Bishop of Stockport in the Chester diocese, she was made Bishop of Derby earlier this year.  Her arrival brings the total of female bishops in the Lords up to five (of the 26). The others are, in order of entry, Gloucester, Newcastle, London and Bristol. The introduction will itself be a bit of a rarity, because it will be conducted by both Archbishops, Canterbury and York. Then peers will approve the third reading of the Courts and Tribunals (Online Procedure) Bill before debating the Augar Review of post-18 education and funding. The Commons day begins (11:30) with half an hour of Northern Ireland questions - will this be the swansong for Secretary of State Karen Bradley? And then it's Prime Minister's Question Time, which has become a rather diminished occasion, with most Conservative MPs not bothering to turn up (one count had just 99 Tories present on the green benches during this week's PMQs).  Maybe the player to watch is the SNP's Ian Blackford, who for the last two weeks has been pushing the boundaries of permitted parliamentary language, in his attacks on Tory Leadership frontrunner Boris Johnson; will he double down this week, and add to the accusations he has already made of lying and racism.  So far the Speaker has not risen to the bait and ordered him to withdraw the offending words, perhaps suspecting that the SNP leader rather hopes to be ordered out of the chamber - something his predecessor Alex Salmond never minded. But Mr Blackford may be reaching the limits of the Chair's tolerance. The day's Ten Minute Rule Motion from the Lib Dem ex-Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael calls for the government to set targets for the reduction of plastic pollution - and for the government to produce an annual report on progress.  Next there's the Supply and Appropriation (Main Estimates) (No. 3) Bill, which may or may not include amendments from the previous day's estimates debates. This is normally a brief rubber stamping exercise, with all the Commons stages taken in a single gulp.  MPs will also be asked to approve the statutory instruments on Capital Allowances (Structures and Buildings Allowances) Regulations and on the Misuse of Drugs Act.  That last one is highly significant, because it amends the definition of a range of synthetic cannabinoids currently classified as Class B drugs under the Act  to remove the ban on compounds now known to have legitimate medical uses  This follows the long parliamentary campaign in around the case of Alfie Dingley whose seizures can only be controlled with cannabis-based medicines.   The Backbench Business Committee have scheduled a debate on whistleblowing with former Health Minister Norman Lamb and the Conservative Stephen Kerr calling for a review of whistleblowing regulation.  The key issue is whether the 1998 Public Interest Disclosure Act provides sufficient protection for a broader range of people. Mr Kerr (chair) and Mr Lamb (vice-chair) head up the All-Party Parliamentary Group on whistleblowing and its importance in a transparent society.  MPs will debate the effectiveness of the 1998 Public Interest Disclosure Act which was introduced to protect employees who speak out. The APPG believes the act needs to be reformed to stop unfair practice of whistleblowers losing their jobs.  Norman Lamb, the former health minister has urged the government to look into the treatment of whistleblowers in the NHS in light of the treatment of the nurses who tried to ""blow the whistle"" in the 1991. 456 people lost their lives as a result of the prescribing of opioids. Mr Lamb set up the Gosport inquiry when he was health minister and attempted to transform the NHS care programme in 2012. In Westminster Hall (9:30)  the Conservative Trudy Harrison will lead the debate in Westminster Hall on the red squirrel - the Wildlife Trust has predicted that red squirrels could become extinct in England in 10 years, because of competition from grey squirrels.  Then at 14:30, there will be a debate over investment in the provision of English for speakers of other languages, particularly for refugees. It's led by Labour's Preet Kaur Gill who has been lobbying the government to improve access to ESOL provision for refugee women who have childcare and caring responsibilities.  She is also a big supporter of speech, language and communication support for children. Last year she told the Commons that in 1978, as an eleven-year-old immigrant, she had the opportunity to move to England and learn English within six months. On the Committee Corridor, the International Trade Committee hears from Secretary of State Dr Liam Fox (10:00). I daresay the implications of a no-deal Brexit might come up.  In the Lords (15:00) the main event is the Labour-led motion calling for a joint committee of Lords and Commons be appointed to report, by 30 September, on the costs and implications for the UK of exiting the EU without a withdrawal agreement on 31 October 2019.  The motion has been tabled by shadow leader of the Lords, Labour's Baroness Angela Smith with support from the Liberal Democrat leader Dick Newby, security and intelligence expert David Anderson from the Crossbenches, and the Conservative Lord Patrick Cormack.  Given the overwhelmingly pro-EU composition of the Lords, this will probably be approved, but it would also need the backing of the Commons, and it may not even be discussed there. Finally, there's a short debate on ""Mitigating the risks posed by the wreck of SS Richard Montgomery"" - this is an American cargo ship which sank in the Thames Estuary in 1944, carrying 1400 tons of munitions.  Labour's Lord Harris of Haringey would like the government to take responsibility for the surveillance of the wreck. It is generally agreed that the bombs are relatively safe as long as they aren't exposed to sudden shock, friction or heat. But recent surveys confirm the wreck is gradually disintegrating, and if it collapsed that could cause the sympathetic detonation of the remaining explosives, with potentially devastating consequences. The Commons day begins (9:30 am) with Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Questions, followed by questions to the Attorney General and the weekly Business Questions to the Leader of the House, Mel Stride. The two main debates are on motions chosen by the Backbench Business Committee - the first is another offshoot of the plan to move Britain to a zero-carbon economy, a call to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans. Under current plans, the government's goal is for all new cars and vans to be ""effectively zero-emission"" by 2040.  But there are calls to bring the target forward to 2032, including from the Business Select Committee Chair, Labour's Rachel Reeves, who wants the ban to be brought forward to 2032. She is calling for an ""effectively zero-emission target"".  That is followed by a general debate on the law on assisted dying. Following the defeat of the last attempt at legalisation, the Assisted Dying (No.2) Bill, which would have allowed a terminally ill person to be given assistance to end their life, in September 2015. This debate will focus on the circumstances in which it should be possible for people to be assisted to die.  Its main sponsors are the Independent Conservative, Nick Boles who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Choice at the End of Life, the former Health Minister Norman Lamb and Labour's Sarah Champion. In Westminster Hall (13:30) the Chair of the International Development Committee, Labour's Stephen Twigg, leads a debate on their report on ""Forced Displacement in Africa: Anchors not walls"".  The report found that there are 68.5 million forcibly displaced people worldwide - 20 million of which live in Sub-Saharan Africa, including 13 million internally displaced people (IDPs), 5.6 million refugees and over 700,000 stateless individuals. It urges the government to 'practice what it preaches' when it comes to its policies on migration and forced displacement and to look to adopt a cross-government approach and national strategy. That is followed by a debate over the changes to immigration rules for religious workers (15:00). Concerns over the working of so-called Tier 5 of the Religious Worker Visas will be raised by David Linden (SNP), Paul Masterton (Conservative) and Ged Killen (Labour).  The issue is a new 'cooling-off period' which prevents Tier 5 Religious and Charity Worker visa holders from returning to the UK for 12 months after their visa expires.  In the Lords (11:00) the main debates are on protecting the NHS in future trade deals entered into by the UK; the apprenticeship levy and the case for the effective delivery of workplace opportunities for young people and the role of reducing inequality and job insecurity in tackling the prevalence of mental illness - that last is led by the Crossbencher and Big Issue founder, Lord Bird. Neither the Commons nor the Lords will be sitting - but the UK Youth Parliament's select committee on knife crime will be in action, taking evidence from four panels of witnesses, including the Home Office Minister, Victoria Atkins.

economic indicators,High cost of housing prompts move to France,2024-09-15,2023-01-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-64212864,"Single people in Guernsey have little chance of buying a home in the island, one islander has said. Self-employed teacher Aeva Love has moved to France citing the ""high cost and quality of housing in Guernsey"" as one reason she looked elsewhere. A new report found more than 1,500 new homes were needed in the next five years to meet the ""housing crisis"". Chief Minister Peter Ferbrache said he would like to see land bought by the States and used by private developers. Miss Love said: ""It's completely pointless thinking about buying in Guernsey. ""The banks would laugh at me if I walked in looking for the smallest mortgage possible. ""I love Guernsey for what it looks like, but it doesn't feel like my home. It feels very unwelcoming. ""There's a lot said about encouraging entrepreneurs and I run an independent business that is now doing quite well. I don't feel supported by the States. ""Ultimately I see Guernsey being a playground of the rich, which makes me angry."" The latest proposals from the States is asking for politicians to agree to aim to build 1,565 new ""units of accommodation"" between 2023 and 2027. The breakdown of those homes is 844 properties in the private market and 721 affordable houses, made up of 473 social houses and 248 partial ownership properties.  Guernsey's Committee for the Environment and Infrastructure wants to get the Development and Planning Authority to work on policies ""to actively encourage housing developments to use land as efficiently as possible"". Committee President Lindsay De Sausmarez said: ""This is the level of housing we think will be needed to meet the needs of the population over the next five years."" ""This will help inform all the decision makers, like developers and the States committees."" ""It helps us track how close we are for meeting this need. It isn't set in stone though, but now this is done in-house we can be far more flexible."" Ellie Jones and her partner are currently living apart to help them save for deposit for a house.  Miss Jones said: ""We would like to buy locally but sadly with huge rates of inflation and the current spiralling cost of living the amount we need to save for a deposit has gone up £10,000 in the last 12 months alone."" She said the situation had left her feeling like leaving the island. She said: ""It makes me feel depressed, anxious and hopeless. ""The only real way for us to get on the housing market is to apply for the part-rent part-buy scheme. We've put our names down for this but believe the current waiting time is two to three years for properties. ""I love Guernsey, I love my job, I love my friends and family and the life I've made here but we are likely to have to look at leaving if the situation doesn't change in some way."" Policy and Resources President Peter Ferbrache believes the biggest priority for the States this year besides tax reform is resolving the ""housing crisis"". He has suggested the States buys land, before being sold on to people.  Last year the States spent more than £30m purchasing sites for affordable housing, like the Data Park and Kenilworth Vinery.  Deputy Ferbrache said on top of that some kind of lending scheme to help people to buy would also be worth looking at.  Analysis by John Fernandez, BBC Guernsey Political Reporter The States is very good at setting things that aren't targets, which look suspiciously like targets. Maybe it's because last decade it set a target for 300 new houses a year - it didn't meet it once - so the word aim is better.  We've had the ""aim"" for 300+ net migration and now an aim to build 1,565 new ""units of accommodation"". Not calling it a target gives the States wiggle room so that it can't be held to account if it doesn't meet them. Because on housing it's not going to be a quick win. The States can buy swathes of land for affordable housing, but with the construction industry already at capacity getting them built is another thing altogether. This new indicator will give States members more evidence to encourage more housebuilding. But ultimately, when these aims and ideals meet the cold light of day things like Open Planning Meetings, age-old considerations like finite and inflexible infrastructure, traffic concerns and the like could prove to be a stumbling block for the States ""aim"".

economic indicators,Apple and Amazon sales up despite rising prices,2024-09-15,2022-07-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62336340,"Amazon and Apple posted better than expected sales, reassuring investors that the tech giants will be able to weather slowdowns in global economies. Amazon forecast in a trading update that higher fees for its Prime membership would boost its bottom line, while Apple said demand for its all important iPhone remained strong. Both firms said they were making progress controlling running costs, despite prices rising at rapid rates. The updates sent shares soaring. The quarterly updates from Apple and Amazon are closely watched as indicators of how customers are reacting to the economic climate. On Thursday, official figures revealed the US economy shrank for the second quarter in a row, a milestone that in many countries would be considered an economic recession, but not in the US, which uses additional data to make that call. ""Our June quarter results continued to demonstrate our ability to manage our business effectively despite the challenging operating environment,"" said Apple's chief operating officer Luca Maestri, adding the company expected growth to pick up again in the months ahead. However, both companies have seen sales growth slow sharply from last year and profits fall.  Apple's profits dropped almost 11% from a year ago to $19.4bn (£15.9bn), as it wrestled with Covid-19 lockdowns in China, while Amazon lost $2bn, hit by changes to the value of its investment in electric carmaker Rivian Automotive. Apple boss Tim Cook said the company was seeing a ""mixed bag"" of economic signals, with iPhone demand holding steady but areas like digital advertising slipping. ""When you think about the number of challenges in the quarter, we feel really good about the growth that we put up,"" he said. Overall, sales of Apple products and services rose 2% year-on-year between April and June to $83bn. Sales of iPhones continued to power the company's gains, as supply constraints held back sales of other products. Its services business, which includes Apple Pay and its streaming music and television services, also grew 12%. Meanwhile, Amazon said its revenues were up 7% to $121.2bn, despite its e-commerce business being hit in recent months. Online sales shrank 4%, the second quarter in a row of decline. But the company continues to be shielded by the strength of its clouding computing division, AWS, which saw sales soar by 33%.  In spring Amazon spooked investors, as its online sales softened and it warned it had spent too heavily to hire and add warehouses in a bet that pandemic-era shopping patterns would continue. But it provided a more optimistic outlook this time.  ""Despite continued inflationary pressures in fuel, energy, and transportation costs, we're making progress on the more controllable costs we referenced last quarter, particularly improving the productivity of our fulfilment network,"" said chief executive Andy Jassy. Amazon said its e-commerce sales were poised to look especially weak because Prime Day, when discounts typically drive a surge of buying, was moved from June to July. ""Big tech's been a mixed bag this earnings season, but Amazon proved that the strong can survive even the toughest environments,"" said Laura Hoy, equity analyst from Hargreaves Lansdown. Apple and Amazon are too big not to be affected by signs of slowdown in the global economy, said Scott Kessler, global sector lead at Third Bridge. But their size gives them somewhat unique power to navigate those challenges, particularly when it comes to negotiating prices. ""Apple's done an excellent job of managing those costs - it doesn't hurt that they're typically one of the biggest purchasers,"" he said. However, Christie Pitts, a general partner at tech fund Backstage Capital, told the BBC that Amazon saw some pressure on its results, in part due to the impact of inflation, ""as consumers have less discretionary money to spend on impulsive purchases"". "
economic indicators,Iran 'has increased enriched uranium production',2024-09-15,2019-06-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48587347,"The head of the global nuclear watchdog has confirmed Iran is increasing its production of enriched uranium. But International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Yukiya Amano said it was not clear when they will reach a limit set under a 2015 international deal. Iran announced last month that it would suspend some commitments in retaliation for sanctions reinstated by the US. Mr Amano also said he was worried about the current tensions over the Iranian nuclear issue and called for dialogue. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif later said reducing tensions was only possible by stopping what he called the ""economic war by America"". ""Those who wage such wars cannot expect to remain safe,"" he told a news conference during a visit to Tehran by his German counterpart, Heiko Maas. Mr Maas warned that the situation in the region was ""highly explosive and extremely serious"" and could lead to a military escalation between the US and Iran. US President Donald Trump abandoned the nuclear deal last year and reinstated sanctions that had been lifted in return for Iran limiting its nuclear activities. Then last month, he ended exemptions from US secondary sanctions for countries that continued buying oil from Iran. This decision was intended to bring Iranian oil exports to zero, denying their government its main source of revenue. Days later, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said his country was rolling back some restrictions under the deal. This included no longer complying with caps on its stockpiles of enriched uranium and heavy water - set at 300kg and 130 tonnes respectively - and halting sales of surplus supplies overseas. Enriched uranium is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons, while spent fuel from a heavy-water reactor contains plutonium that would be suitable for a bomb. Mr Rouhani also gave the other five states still party to the nuclear deal - Germany, the UK, France, China and Russia - until 7 July to protect Iranian oil sales from US sanctions. Otherwise Iran will suspend its restrictions on the purity of enriched uranium. At the same time, the White House sent an aircraft carrier strike group, B-52 bombers, and a Patriot missile defence battery to the Gulf because of ""troubling and escalatory indications"" related to Iran. Iran was subsequently accused by the US of being behind attacks on four oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates; two oil pumping stations in Saudi Arabia; and the Green Zone in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, where many foreign embassies are located. Iran denied the allegations. Then, on 20 May, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran announced that it would quadruple its production of low-enriched uranium and had informed the IAEA, which is tasked with monitoring Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal. On Monday, the nuclear watchdog's chief confirmed that Iran had increased its production rate. But Mr Amano declined to specify by how much and said it was not clear when the stockpile limit would be exceeded. He told the IAEA's Board of Governors it was essential that Iran fully implemented its commitments under the nuclear deal. ""As I have constantly emphasised, the nuclear-related commitments entered into by Iran under the [deal] represent a significant gain for nuclear verification,"" he said. ""I therefore hope that ways can be found to reduce current tensions through dialogue."" Germany's Foreign Minister stressed that European powers wanted to fulfil their obligations under the deal and were attempting to provide Iran with alternative ways to trade.  ""We cannot work miracles, but we will try to avert a failure,"" Mr Maas said. The Europeans have set up a ""special purpose vehicle"" that would essentially allow goods to be bartered between Iranian and foreign companies without direct financial transactions. But the mechanism - known as Instex - is not yet operational."
economic indicators,Dow sheds more than 4% twice in week,2024-09-15,2018-02-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42991310,"Wall Street shares slid sharply again on Thursday, compounding losses on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 which started last week.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,000 points for the second time this week, plunging 4.15% to 23,860. The S&P 500 dropped 100.6 points or 3.75% to 2,581, while the Nasdaq slid 274.8 points or 3.9% to 6,777.1. The moves follow a day of losses on all key European exchanges. The 100 share index in London closed down 1.49% at 7,170.69 points. Germany and France fell 2.6% and 2% respectively. The dive extends a sell-off that started last week, as investors started to worry that inflation might rise more quickly than expected, leading policymakers to raise interest rates. On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for that view. The bank left interest rates where they were at 0.5% at its meeting, but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting. Also worrying markets was a government budget proposal US lawmakers in Congress have announced, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation.  Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates. Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity. The uptick in volatility comes as investors react to the shifting conditions. Thursday's declines mean the Dow and S&P 500 have now fallen by more than 10% from the record highs set in January, a threshold analysts call a correction. Shares in financial, technology and consumer companies led the declines on Thursday, which infected every sector. American Express and Intel were the two biggest losers on the Dow. Analysts, who have said for months that the financial markets were due a correction after a long period of rising prices, urged calm. ""The latest decline takes us back to where we were 17 November,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, which tracks interest rates. ""We've just given back some recent gains, not wiped out anyone's life savings.""  But the declines have led to questions for President Donald Trump, who had repeatedly boasted of the market's rapid rise in value last year. The White House said on Thursday markets were reacting to data that is good news for the broader economy, including low unemployment and signs of wage growth. ""The president like the rest of the White House is concerned about long term economic indicators and factors,"" a White House spokesman said. ""The fundamentals in terms of the long term are very strong."""
economic indicators,Teachers to report 'improper pressure' over grades,2024-09-15,2021-03-06,By Robbie Meredith,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-56266971,"Teachers must report any ""improper pressure"" from parents or pupils seeking to influence GCSE, AS or A-level grades. They have also been told to make a ""conscious effort"" to avoid bias in awarding pupils their grades. That is according to guidance to school and college principals from the Northern Ireland Exams Board, CCEA. As summer exams were cancelled for a second year, schools will calculate exam grades to be awarded to pupils. Schools will be expected to use a range of evidence and also moderate and compare pupils' grades. CCEA will then review how schools have awarded results to ""ensure fairness and consistency"". But there will not be a return to the kind of statistical process used by CCEA which proved controversial in 2020. CCEA has now given more details to school and college principals about how their staff should award pupils results. ""There may be instances where schools and colleges or teachers are put under improper pressure from a student or their parent/guardian to influence the decision-making on a grade,"" the guidance said. ""Any improper pressure must be reported to CCEA, and we may investigate this as potential malpractice."" Schools and colleges have also been told that a pupil's grade ""must be an objective decision based on evidence of a student's knowledge, understanding and skills in relation to the subject"". ""A conscious effort must be made to avoid bias,"" CCEA said. Schools are told to base grades on a pupil's ""individual academic performance rather than positive or challenging personal circumstances, character, behaviour, appearance, socio-economic background, or performance of their siblings"". The CCEA guidance also sets out the evidence a school or college can use to decide results. That evidence can include mock exams, results of class tests, class work or performance in past exam papers. But CCEA is also going to send schools exam papers in each subject which pupils can sit when they return to school. ""These will be quality assured question papers and mark schemes,"" CCEA said. ""They will contain new questions and tasks not previously released to centres and must therefore be stored securely."" CCEA said the exams were optional and were intended to help schools get more evidence to award results. But they have ""advised"" schools to use at least one of the exams in each subject. ""When taken under high control conditions, where the public health situation allows, these assessments will be a good indicator of the standard of student performance as they are fully aligned to specification content and the level of demand of past papers,"" CCEA's guidance said. Schools and colleges have to provide AS and A-level grades to CCEA by 21 May and GCSE grades no later than 4 June. Pupils will then receive their AS and A-level results on 10 August and GCSE results on 12 August. However, exactly how pupils can appeal their results if they are unhappy with them is yet to be decided."
economic indicators,Wage growth slows despite unemployment fall,2024-09-15,2018-06-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44453071,"Wage growth unexpectedly slipped to 2.8% from 2.9% in the three months to April, despite unemployment falling by 38,000 to 1.42 million, official figures show. Economists had expected wage growth to remain steady at 2.9%. The slowdown is likely to dampen expectations of an interest rate rise in August.  Wage growth is one of the key figures the Bank of England monitors to assess the health of the UK economy. Although it is above the current level of inflation of 2.4%, it remains well below inflation's five-year high of 3.1% seen in November.  This consumer spending squeeze is one of the reasons many shops are currently struggling. Wage growth slows despite unemployment fall Economists said the latest figures reduce the chances of a near-term increase in interest rates. HSBC's UK economist, Elizabeth Martins, said: ""The market is pricing in just a 4% chance of a rate rise at the Bank of England's 21 June meeting, so any change to policy would be a big surprise... at this point, the market sees around a 50% chance of an August hike."" The Bank of England, however, is expecting wage growth to pick up.  Last month it said it expected to see pay growth of 2.75% a year by the end of 2018, rising to 3.5% by the end of 2020. Analysis by BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed Why aren't wages rising more quickly? There could be many reasons.  Since the financial crisis, lack of investment in new machinery and technology to help firms perform better punched a hole in economic performance. The public sector pay freeze followed by the 1% pay cap has also weighed on the overall numbers. Some economists also argue that a lack of bargaining power - union membership has been in long term decline - is leading to fewer widespread agreements on earnings increases. Read more from Kamal here ""Employment has continued to rise, while the unemployment rate remained at its lowest for over 40 years.  ""Wages, both including and excluding bonuses, are continuing to increase, and slightly faster than inflation,"" the ONS's statistician, David Freeman, said. The ONS also said the number of people in work reached a record high of 32.3 million. The ONS's latest figures received a mixed reception. The TUC's General Secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: ""Wage growth is stuck in the slow lane. At this rate pay packets won't recover to their pre-recession levels for years. ""We need to speed things up. Extending collective bargaining would boost living standards and help workers get a fairer share of the wealth they create."" And the British Chambers of Commerce's head of economics, Suren Thiru also took a dimmer view. He said the slowdown in earnings growth was ""a concern"" and was likely to make a rate rise this year less likely: ""The slowdown in earnings growth, together with the recent weakness in a raft of other economic indicators, undermines the case for tightening monetary policy."" But Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""Another strong set of labour market figures in April suggests that firms remain positive about the outlook for demand despite the economy going through a soft patch at the start of the year."""
economic indicators,Business failures 'at eight-year low',2024-09-15,2018-01-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-42774787,"The number of Scottish businesses failures has fallen to an eight-year low, according to new figures. Professional services firm KPMG found there were 832 corporate insolvencies in 2017 - a 15% drop on the previous year and the lowest since 2008. Insolvencies, however, climbed by 14% in the last three months of the year, compared with the same period in 2016. Over the whole of 2017, administrations - which tend to affect larger organisations - fell by 14%, to 83. Meanwhile, liquidations - which typically involve smaller firms - fell by 16%, to 749. Blair Nimmo, global head of restructuring at KPMG, said: ""Annually it is encouraging to see the number of business failures falling to an eight-year low, representing what are relatively normal attrition rates. ""Nevertheless, other economic indicators are not so positive in a UK context, and the general direction of travel in the Scottish economy remains uncertain. ""Coupled with comparatively poor GDP forecasts and a low rate of business birth rates, there are some causes for concern."" He added: ""A continuing uncertain political and economic climate, whether in Scotland, or anywhere else in the UK, means businesses remain cautious, and I do not see this changing in the immediate future."""
economic indicators,UK borrowing in 'colossal increase' to fight virus,2024-09-15,2020-04-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52393472,"The UK's budget deficit is set to see ""an absolutely colossal increase to a level not seen in peacetime"", the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said. The economic impact of coronavirus was likely to push the deficit to as high as £260bn, Paul Johnson told the BBC. He was speaking after latest figures showed that the deficit hit £48.7bn in the 2019-20 financial year. But Mr Johnson said those figures were ""the numbers before the storm"". And, separately, one of the Bank of England's top policymakers has warned that the UK faces its worst economic shock in several hundred years. Jan Vlieghe, a member of the BoE's interest-rate setting committee, said that ""early indicators"" suggest the UK was ""experiencing an economic contraction that is faster and deeper than anything we have seen in the past century, or possibly several centuries"". He did, though, say there was ""in principle"" a good chance that the UK would return to its ""pre-virus trajectory once the pandemic is over"". The UK's deficit last year - the gap between the government's income and its expenditure - was £9.3bn higher than in the 2018-19 financial year and equivalent to 2.2% of GDP. The Office for National Statistics, which released those figures, said they did not capture the big spending announced by the government to cope with the virus. ""The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic is expected to have a significant impact on the UK public sector finances,"" it added. ""These effects will arise from both the introduction of public health measures and from new government policies to support businesses and individuals."" The ONS said the full effects of coronavirus on the public finances would become clearer in the coming months. Mr Johnson told the BBC's Today programme that there was still ""a huge amount of uncertainty"" surrounding the economic impact of the virus. However, the government had announced tax cuts and spending increases worth £100bn, so the effect was ""likely to dwarf the record that we saw during the financial crisis"". Mr Johnson said the economy was unlikely to recover quickly afterwards and would remain ""smaller than it otherwise would have been"". He added that tax rises and a growing deficit were the likely outcome.  ""I would be astonished if in a couple of years the economy was back where it would have been if it [the virus] had never happened,"" he said.  Meanwhile, a closely watched survey of UK businesses has indicated that the economic impact has been even worse than feared. The IHS Markit/CIPS flash UK composite purchasing managers' index (PMI), which measures activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to a new record low of 12.9 in April, down from 36 in March. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a figure of 31.4. ""The dire survey readings will inevitably raise questions about the cost of the lockdown and how long current containment measures will last,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, adding that the figures pointed to a quarter-on-quarter economic contraction of at least 7%. In another development, the Treasury has announced that it is speeding up its plans to raise money in order to cover the cost of its coronavirus measures. It will now be issuing £180bn worth of government bonds, known as gilts, in the May-to-July period, more than originally intended in those months. We already knew the government was likely to have to borrow huge sums of money to support the economy. But now it's not a ""scenario"" from the Office of Budget Responsibility, but concrete reality.  This morning, the Debt Management Office, the arm of the Treasury that borrows on international money markets on behalf of the government, announced how much the government is actually planning to borrow. That's £45bn in April alone and a further £180bn from the start of May to the end of July - a total of £225bn in just four months.  One reason is the huge cost of programmes such as furloughing, now expected to cost well north of £50bn. The other reason is that the government's revenues - the tax it collects through income tax, VAT and national insurance - are collapsing. If you shut down much of the economy, you also turn off the tap on much of the government's tax income.   The OBR's scenario was that the government might need to borrow £382bn for the year - about seven times what was expected pre-Covid.  That depends, though, on the shutdown being lifted sooner rather than later.  The Resolution Foundation estimates that if the shutdown continues for six months, borrowing will be even higher for the year - a truly mind-boggling £500bn. That's about a quarter of the size of the entire economy.  ""The temporary and immediate nature of the unprecedented support announced for people and businesses means the government expects that a significantly higher proportion of total gilt sales in 2020-21 will take place in the first four months of the financial year, in order to meet the immediate financing needs resulting from Covid-19,"" the Treasury said.

Here, in charts, we explain some of the things on the minds of voters as they cast their ballots. The next president may have to come up with a way to help people afford some essential goods. Kenyans, like others around the world, have been finding that their money is not going as far as it used to when it comes to buying the basics. In June, annual inflation was 7.9%, but the increase in the price of some key food items, including maize flour and cooking oil, was much higher. To ease the problems the outgoing government of President Uhuru Kenyatta subsidised the cost of maize flour in July, but it is not clear if this policy will be continued.  And with an ongoing drought affecting three million Kenyans, many are struggling to afford any food at all. The government has also been subsidising the price of petrol to keep that more affordable. But this policy comes at a big cost - $141m (£120m) in July - potentially adding to the huge debt the country owes. This has been skyrocketing under the presidency of Mr Kenyatta, and now amounts to some 68% of GDP. The government borrowed to pay for big infrastructure projects like the Chinese-built railway linking the capital, Nairobi, to the coast.  Investment in infrastructure can aid long-term economic growth but the sums involved are huge - the railway cost $3.2bn. A large amount of the money is owed to Chinese banks. The government spends about half its revenue paying back the debt and the interest it has accrued.  More than three-quarters of Kenya's population are under 35 and a big chunk of those are of voting age. Addressing the concerns of young people could be a significant vote winner. The lack of formal employment is a big issue. Many between 18 and 35 have no job at all despite having degrees or other suitable qualifications.  The large number of under-18s suggests that boosting investment in education needs to be a priority. In recent years, Kenya has been successful in improving performance in education. The government introduced free primary school education in 2003, which led to many more children going to school.  An increasing proportion have gone on to secondary school, which, since 2008, has been subsidised. Nevertheless, one in five secondary pupils in Kenya do not graduate. Many parents still prefer to pay for their children to go to what they see as better-quality, privately-run schools. Another key factor in how people will vote is likely to be ethnicity. It is assumed that the two main candidates, Raila Odinga (a Luo) and William Ruto (a Kalenjin), will get many of the votes of their respective ethnic groups. But this is the first Kenyan election in the multiparty era where none of the front-runners are from the biggest group, the Kikuyu. Both main candidates are aware of the need to attract this key constituency and have chosen Kikuyu running mates. The violence that followed the 2007 election was driven by ethnicity but 15 years on there is an argument that it is becoming less significant in determining how people vote. Kenya is a regional economic giant and what happens there affects the rest of East Africa. In recent years it has lost ground to Ethiopia, but if you look at the average income per person in Kenya then, at just over $2,000 a year, it is more than double its northern neighbour. However, this crude figure, estimated last year, masks the huge inequalities in the country and may not include the full impact of the shutdowns introduced in response to the Covid pandemic. Kenya's regional dominance is also reflected in the proportion of people who have access to electricity and the internet. The figures however show that nearly three out of every 10 Kenyans do not have power and the large majority do not have internet access. Improving these indicators will be a measure of success for whoever wins the presidency."
economic indicators,August interest rate rise moves step closer,2024-09-15,2018-06-21,By Kamal Ahmed,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44562162,"The Bank of England has held interest rates but signalled an August rate rise is more likely than previously thought.  In a decisive move, Andrew Haldane, the Bank's chief economist, joined two other Monetary Policy Committee members in voting to raise rates to 0.75%. The nine-member MPC was split 6-3, with Bank governor Mark Carney leading the group who voted to hold rates at 0.5%. The last time three people ""dissented"" from the overall view, in June 2017, rates rose the following November. But economists believe that if the economy does show signs of picking up, an August rise is in play. Government borrowing figures published on Thursday boosted hopes among some economists that the economy may be gaining momentum.  The pound jumped by about a cent against the dollar following the Bank's decision, climbing back above the $1.32 level, as the possibility of an August rate rise appeared to increase. The MPC said that the poor economic growth figures of the first three months of a year was likely to prove ""temporary"" and that the speed of growth would pick up. As economic momentum improves, fears over rising inflation grow and pressure increases for interest rates to rise. The level of interest rates is the Bank's main tool for controlling any increase in prices. ""A key assumption in the MPC's May projections was that the dip in output growth in the first quarter would prove temporary, with momentum recovering in the second quarter,"" the committee said. ""This judgement appears broadly on track. ""A number of indicators of household spending and sentiment have bounced back strongly from what appeared to be erratic weakness in Q1 [January to March], in part related to the adverse weather. ""Employment growth has remained solid."" The MPC said prospects for global growth also remained strong, despite some weakness across Europe. It is the first time Mr Haldane has ""dissented"" from the majority view on the MPC since he joined the Bank in 2014 and is significant given his role as the leading economic expert at the institution. Before today's decision the markets were split 50/50 on whether there would be a rate rise at the MPC's next meeting in August. After the news that Mr Haldane has joined those pressing for a rise - MPC members Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders - it is likely the market expectation for a rate rise will strengthen."
economic indicators,Scots economy 'needs post-Brexit clarity',2024-09-15,2017-09-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-41319651,"Uncertainty over Brexit continues to loom over Scotland's economic recovery, according to a leading forecaster. The Fraser of Allander Institute (FAI) said indicators suggested the economy was improving following ""an exceptionally weak last two years"".  But it warned that the Brexit negotiations remained the ""greatest cloud on the immediate horizon"". It said the economy faced severe risks if the UK government could not reach a deal with the EU. The report also called for UK ministers to clarify which powers they envisage will be transferred to Holyrood after Brexit. It said this would help enable ""preparatory discussions"" to take place between business and the devolved administrations. The UK government and the devolved administrations are currently locked in a dispute over what should happen to powers in areas such as fishing and farming which are not currently reserved to Westminster, but which are exercised in Brussels. In its latest quarterly economic commentary, the institute said its forecasts for Scottish growth remained broadly the same as its previous report in June. It now predicts growth of 1.2% this year, 1.4% next year and 1.7% in 2019.  But it warned: ""On balance, our forecasts are based upon the assumption that a constructive deal between the UK and the EU is reached.  ""Should this not occur, outcomes toward the lower end of our forecast range are more likely."" The report argued that the immediate concern facing many businesses was the potential for the exit process ""to go awry"".  It said: ""We are now 15 months on from the referendum with a deal likely to be needed in just over a year's time.  ""But very little progress - if any - seems to have been made on the key elements of the UK's terms of exit. ""'No deal' would clearly not be in the interests of either the UK or the EU. The potential risks from such a 'cliff-edge' scenario, with companies finding themselves outside the single market and customs union, would be severe indeed."" The report added: ""Whilst a detailed agreement will not be reached until the end of the process, the longer we wait for evidence that serious progress is being made, the greater the likelihood that companies and investors will start to plan for the worst."" Meanwhile, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has called for measures to ""cushion"" the impact of Brexit on Scottish firms, It follows an FSB survey that showed a sharp fall in business confidence across the UK in the last quarter, amid rising costs. FSB Scottish policy convener Andy Willox said: ""It is critical that agreement with the EU27 is now reached on issues such as the length and nature of a transitional deal. ""We would argue that a three-year interim period would be sensible, alongside a comprehensive free trade agreement. Further, EU citizens working in or running businesses in Scotland must have the right to remain in the country."" SNP MSP Mairi Gougeon, who sits on Holyrood's Europe Committee, said the Fraser of Allander and FSB reports underlined ""just how damaging the Tories' Brexit plans were to Scotland's economy"". She added: ""With both the FSB and Fraser of Allander Institute telling us that businesses are losing confidence and being harmed by rising prices and a weak pound, and with Brexit uncertainty continuing to loom over our economy, it is clear that the Tories must take action now to change course and end their obsession with a hard Brexit. ""There is nothing at all to be gained from tearing us out of the single market and customs union, but everything to lose. ""The Tories must wake up to the reality of their disastrous Brexit policies."" A UK government spokesman said: ""Scotland's economy is improving but still lags behind the UK as a whole. We want the Scottish government to make full use of their powers to support the economy. ""We are also determined to make the most of opportunities presented by Brexit, trading with new partners and reaching new markets, and we will negotiate as one UK to reach the best possible deal as we forge a new partnership with the EU.""

economic indicators,What to expect from Biden's big speech,2024-09-15,2023-02-06,By Anthony Zurcher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64377363,"Joe Biden's State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday comes at a pivotal time in his presidency.  By most indications, he is poised to announce a bid for re-election next year, and the speech provides a high-profile platform from which he can make his case to the American people, the media and key figures within the Democratic Party. Before the president gets to that, however, he will be under intense pressure to address the issue that has been hovering over his administration since Friday. The Chinese spy balloon, and the US reaction to it, has dominated headlines, captivated the attention of the American public and prompted sharp criticism of the Biden administration from Republicans. With the Republican-controlled House of Representatives considering holding a vote of disapproval for how the president handled the balloon incursion - on the day of the speech no less - and aggressive hearings into the situation already being planned, Mr Biden will be expected to offer the reasoning behind his decision to shoot the vessel down only after it had traversed the US.  And all eyes will be on how Congress reacts.  While Mr Biden and his advisers may have a strategy devised for how they want to craft his re-election bid, a foreign crisis with China, which could have significant economic and military consequences, could derail even the best-laid plans. His speech is likely to dwell extensively on accomplishments in the first two years of his presidency, when his party controlled both chambers of Congress and was able to pass a variety of substantive legislation.  Those achievements included a $1.9tn (£1.5tn) coronavirus relief package that featured a programme that halved the US child poverty rate and $1tn in climate and healthcare legislation. He is also sure to tout bipartisan legislative achievements on gun control, infrastructure spending and technology investment. The president will make the case that the economy is improving under his watch, citing the latest job-growth figures and inflation and energy numbers that have been tapering off from high levels not seen since the early 1980s. When he's done patting himself on the back, however, Mr Biden will have to cast his eyes forward and make the case for what he hopes to accomplish in the remainder of his first term and what he could offer if he does seek four more years in office after that.  Successful political campaigns, as the established wisdom goes, are about the future, not the past. To that end, Mr Biden is planning on making the phrase ""finish the job"" a recurring theme during his speech. It's a call for Congress to do more, but it also gives the president the opportunity to declare some measure of victory if he successfully implements the programmes launched by the Democratic Congress over the past two years. With the recent spate of mass shootings, Mr Biden may talk about new gun control legislation, including the kind of ban on assault weapons he helped enact as a senator in the 1990s. He may also call for federal law protecting abortion rights, an issue that helped turn out Democratic voters in last year's midterm elections.  Government-supported childcare and pre-kindergarten education are also long-desired but yet-to-be tackled components of the Democratic agenda. And, in the wake of the death of Tyre Nichols at the hands of Memphis police, he might endorse renewed efforts to enact federal policing reform. Mr Biden could also address issues of perceived weakness during his presidency, including rising crime rates in US cities, the rise in undocumented migrants crossing the US-Mexico border and an attempt to forgive some student-loan debt that has faced multiple lawsuits.  While US-China relations are sure to dominate any foreign policy portion of Mr Biden's address, he is also certain to discuss the need for continued American military aid to Ukraine and the effect the tens of billions in aid already approved has had in turning back the Russian invasion. Whatever Biden proposes on any of these issues will crash headfirst into the reality of Republican control of the House of Representatives. Although the conservative margin in that chamber is narrow, it is enough to ensure that none of Mr Biden's ideas will pass, or even receive an up-or-down vote, without tacit Republican approval. While there is always the possibility of bipartisan agreement - and Mr Biden will do his best to present himself as a voice of reason and co-operation - the coming year is more likely to centre on acrimonious fights over avoiding a US default on its national debt this summer and passing legislation that will fund the US government in the autumn.  Mr Biden may use his address on Tuesday night as a means to gain the upper hand in negotiations that are only just beginning. The president's speech could provide a blueprint for how he will handle these fraught confrontations with Republicans and address the growing US-China rift. It will also shed light on the terrain upon which he may want to build his re-election campaign, including which issues to prioritise and which accomplishments to trumpet the loudest. While the delivery of a State of the Union address is always scrutinised, the style of Mr Biden's speech will be almost as important as the substance.  The 80-year-old politician is already the oldest president in US history. If he wins re-election, his second term will expire after he turns 86. Questions about Mr Biden's competence will be unavoidable in the days ahead, and high-profile speeches like this are an opportunity to silence critics - or give them more ammunition. Although public opinion surveys 21 months removed from an election are of limited value, the latest numbers show that if Mr Biden takes the plunge he is in for a closely contested campaign, with Republicans - including his former adversary Donald Trump - more than capable of wresting the White House from his grasp. His overall approval has improved but is still net-negative. Polling indicates that Democrats would be more resigned to a Biden re-election campaign than energised by it. Following his address, the president will travel to Wisconsin and Florida - states that are traditional presidential-election battlegrounds and the latter being the home of two possible Republican presidential opponents. Although 21 months may seem like a long time, and the timing of an official campaign announcement has not even been hinted at, Tuesday night's speech is a prominent waypoint on Mr Biden's road to re-election."
economic indicators,Wage growth slows despite jobless fall,2024-09-15,2018-07-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44857055,"UK wages rose more slowly in the three months to May, despite a further fall in unemployment, official figures show. Wage growth slipped to 2.7% from 2.8% in the three months to May, while unemployment fell by 12,000 to 1.41 million, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The unemployment rate remained at its joint lowest since 1975 at 4.2%.  Some analysts said the slowdown in wage growth could dampen expectations of an interest rate rise next month.  Wage growth is one of the key figures that the Bank of England monitors to assess the health of the UK economy. Including bonuses, wage growth fell to 2.5% from 2.6% over the same period, the ONS said. The proportion of people in work rose to a record high of 75.7%. ""We've had yet another record employment rate, while the number of job vacancies is also a new record,"" said ONS statistician Matt Hughes.   ""From this, it's clear that the labour market is still growing strongly."" The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee meets on 2 August to decide whether to raise interest rates from their current level of 0.5%. At their last meeting in June, the nine-member MPC was split 6-3, with dissenters calling for a quarter-point rise to 0.75%. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, called the latest figures on wages and jobs ""mildly disappointing"". ""All in all, these numbers don't alter the economic picture of anaemic growth, a relatively tight labour market and under-control inflation,"" he said.  ""Markets are still expecting the Bank of England to raise interest rates in August. But given the increasingly uncertain climate, I think there's a real chance policymakers will sit on their hands and wait for firmer signals the economy is on the right track before risking raising borrowing costs."" However, Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said he did not think the latest data would deter the Bank from raising rates. ""The recent easing in wage growth looks unlikely to be sustained,"" he said. ""Leading indicators of pay suggest that it is on track to at least meet the Bank of England's forecast for underlying wage growth of 2.75% y/y in Q4. As such, we continue to expect the MPC to vote to raise interest rates next month."" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said the latest slowdown in pay growth was ""disappointing"". ""This means that earnings growth in real terms remains in positive territory by just a small margin and so is unlikely to provide much of a boost to consumer spending power,"" he said. ""While we expect that interest rates will rise sooner rather than later, with earnings growth underwhelming, there remains sufficient scope for the MPC to keep a rates hike on hold for longer, particularly given the current economic and political uncertainty."" Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""Clamour for an August interest rate rise has been building, but the sluggish pay growth should give pause for thought. The Bank should pay heed to the array of obstacles standing in the way of firms, from the burden of business rates to Brexit uncertainty, when it comes to making its decision."""
economic indicators,Recruitment problems 'driving up wages',2024-09-15,2018-07-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-44877960,"Businesses across the Scottish economy are being driven to increase staff pay in the face of rising recruitment difficulties, according to a survey. The latest Scottish Chambers of Commerce's quarterly economic indicator found companies in every sector were struggling to find the right skills. However, it suggested 2018 had seen a ""strong and positive start"". Confidence and investment were found to be rising, with firms seeking to increase productivity. Only 15% of firms surveyed reported declining optimism, while 48% of firms reporting increased overall revenue. Only 18% reported a decrease. Almost 90% of firms said they had increased or maintained levels of investment from the previous quarter. However, the survey - produced in collaboration with the University of Strathclyde's Fraser of Allander Institute - also suggested investment levels had softened in sectors which had a ""challenging"" first quarter, such as retail and tourism. Meanwhile, about a fifth of firms reported declines in both cash flow and profitability, with the vast majority of businesses ""observing stability"" in these areas. Neil Amner, chairman of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce economic advisory group, said: ""Recruitment difficulties have also returned to the fore once again, as the labour market continues to tighten.   ""With every sector in this report anticipating increasing pay levels, it is clear the challenging labour market is creating heightened competition for those with the right skills. ""The survey results continue to demonstrate that finding skilled workers is undoubtedly going to act as one of the key challenges for the rest of the trading year."" Mr Amner said the survey suggested business optimism among Scottish firms remained ""strong"". He added: ""However, we recognise the UK's exit from the European Union will create a mix of opportunities and challenges.  ""For the minority of surveyed firms that reported lower optimism, the UK's future relationship with the European Union continues to be cited as one of the key drivers of concern.""    Prof Graeme Roy, from the Fraser of Allander Institute, said the outlook for the Scottish economy for 2018 was ""still one of cautious optimism"".  He added: ""We expect, reinforced by the findings of this survey, that the Scottish economy will pick up through 2018 and record faster growth than 2017.  ""However, uncertainty about the terms of the UK exit from the EU continue to make business planning and investment decisions difficult, and acts as a general headwind on growth."""
economic indicators,Business and community leaders react to exit plan,2024-09-15,2021-03-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-56252635,"The NI Executive has set out its plan for exiting lockdown. The blueprint does not include a timetable, but there are five steps covering nine separate pathways, ranging from retail, hospitality, worship and sport and leisure. Progression through the plan depends on key health criteria being met. Business and community leaders have been reacting to Moving Forward: The Executive's Pathway Out of Restrictions. Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster ""We welcome the activity undertaken by the executive so far in bringing forward this roadmap.  ""However, it has been some time in coming and disappointing to see that parts of hospitality have been earmarked to reopen after non-essential retail and with no mention of an additional support package.  ""There is a genuine fear amongst many in our sector that businesses are going to fail and jobs will be lost at the eleventh hour.  ""We are really frustrated that this pathway shows no dates whatsoever and once again singles out our traditional (wet) pubs for extended closure. How are our pubs supposed to survive, and the industry plan for the re-emergence of the entire sector?"" Dr David Bruce, moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland Dr Bruce told BBC Radio Ulster that he welcomed the ""direction of travel"" outlined in the document. He said he hoped there could be a return to services in places of worship - with a risk assessment - from 2 April (Good Friday). He told Evening Extra that combined with the vaccine rollout, there was a clear ""rationale"" behind the plan.  Michael Henderson, director of Northern Ireland Takeaway Association ""The announcement today by NI Executive will be welcoming news to all our members.  ""But with the restrictions still in place for at least another four weeks we fear some of our takeaways won't last until April unless they are provided with financial support. ""Many of our members rely on the after 11pm trade with some members losing up to 60% of regular income.  ""We call on the Northern Ireland Executive to include these takeaways into the Covid Restriction Business Support Scheme Part B, this would ensure our takeaway owners who are financially struggling with current restrictions can stay open for business and secure jobs across Northern Ireland until restrictions are lifted."" Jacqui Pope, head of service at GLL which runs gyms for Belfast City Council ""A timely return to outdoor sports facilities for training and group activities is to be welcomed as a positive boost for the leisure sector, however it does not go far enough. ""GLL has been calling for the reopening of gyms and swimming pools to be prioritised in the recovery plans. These services are vital to public health and wellbeing and it is disappointing no dates have been specified. ""People have a right to look after their health and get back on track with regular training and gym classes, which are widely accepted as having a positive impact on mental health. ""Gyms are ready to open safely, have low rates of Covid-19 transmission and well-rehearsed safety measures in place."" Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium ""These pathways are welcomed by the whole of the NI business community, and particularly the retail industry, who have been one of the most affected parts of our economy.  ""While there is a clear pathway for leaving lockdown and reopening fully, there are still no dates in place.  ""We understand that the executive will follow the science, however it is vital that there is clarity about the criteria for reopening and that government ensures affected businesses continue to be supported in the coming weeks."" Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI  ""Sadly, this falls far short of what is needed for a viable roadmap.  ""It lacks detail, contains vague criteria for moving between the steps/phases and gives no certainty for retailers to plan ahead for reopening. ""Accepting that exact dates were not going to be in the document, the very least that could have been included should have been broad timelines to give retailers some idea of the next steps."" Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber of Commerce ""The executive may have agreed their route to reopening the economy, but the truth is none of us know when this journey will actually start or how long it will take. ""Each step will, no doubt, be subject to executive wrangling with businesses unable to plan properly.  ""It is not too harsh to say that as far as offering both hope and certainty, this falls far short. ""Not only are there no dates, but there is no clarity about where certain health indicators need to be to move us through each of the steps, there is potential for confusing communications as different sectors and sub sectors within the pathways are at different stages, and there is the real risk that no timetable will see many businesses calling it a day."" Dawn McLaughlin, Londonderry Chamber president ""While it is encouraging to see the publication of the Pathway to Recovery... the document does little to give businesses cause for optimism or certainty for the coming weeks and months ahead. ""They need to be given time to prepare and get ready for opening their doors to customers again, especially as we move into the busy summer period to allow badly-hit businesses the opportunity to fully maximise this important trading period.  ""They need to be given specific guidance on what vaccine or Covid case targets Northern Ireland needs to meet to reopen, under what circumstances they can reopen, and what safeguards and safety measures they need to put in place."" William Miller, national director of Funeral Directors  ""I think we're basically back to where we were before December, in terms of, we risk assess the venue - both externally and internally - and then advise on the numbers to families of how many mourners that can be at the funeral.  ""It is a bit easier, certainly better than online services.  ""It's hard for the health authorities to pinpoint a date, ideally a date would have been great for everybody.  ""We'll just have to work with it. We've worked with it since last March and we'll keep on working with it and looking after the bereaved and after the people who mean the most at the time of the death."" Ken Webb, chair of the Further Education Colleges Principal's Group ""The recovery plan is welcome and attention now must turn to the safe return of our students and staff to campus and the resumption of face-to-face learning. ""College life has been disrupted now for one year with lengthy periods being spent in online, remote learning.  ""This learning format cannot replace practical skills development that takes place in college campuses and coupled with remaining uncertainty over arrangements to replace examinations, there is real anxiety being felt amongst our college communities, between both students and staff."" Sandra Corkin, owner of Oasis Travel and Northern Ireland's ABTA representative ""We sort of new that foreign travel was going to be one of the last steps to happen and we already knew there wasn't going to be any specific dates given. ""There is confidence out there. Given what the UK government has said, that travel will start sometime this summer, we think Northern Ireland may follow suit.  ""We are feeling a bit more confident. Certainly our customers are feeling a bit more confident that they might get a holiday sometime this year."""

economic indicators,What will Trump do about the Iran nuclear deal?,2024-09-15,2017-10-12,By Jonathan Marcus,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41571984,"All the indications are that President Trump will refuse to recertify the present Iran nuclear deal some time before the due date of 15 October. This would light a fuse that could potentially explode the agreement. It raises questions about how Iran will respond. And it creates huge diplomatic difficulties between the US and many of its key European allies who wholeheartedly back the deal. The agreement, negotiated with Iran by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council together with Germany and the European Union, was reached in July 2015. Its aim was to ensure that Iran's nuclear programme was entirely peaceful.  The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), began to be implemented in January 2016. In return for the progressive lifting of a range of economic sanctions, Iran halted some of its activities and reduced others within strict limits, all open to verification by international inspectors. There are four crucial things to remember about the deal.  It was not perfect.  Forcing Iran to halt its nuclear activities altogether was not feasible. Many of the restrictions imposed by the JCPOA contain ""sunset clauses"", which run out after a number of years. What happens then is a valid question, but it was felt by all the parties that constraining Iran's nuclear programme for the immediate future was a deal worth taking. It is easy to forget that there was a real concern at the time the deal was being negotiated that without an agreement there could be a military conflict.  Israel was pressing for military action. Many of Iran's Arab enemies in the Gulf quietly backed such a step and there were questions as to whether the US itself might have to use force to prevent Iran developing the capability to manufacture and deliver a nuclear weapon.  Sound familiar? It is much like the position that the US is in today with North Korea. The JCPOA was intended to manage Iran's nuclear activities, avoiding a recourse to war. The JCPOA was about Iran's nuclear programme and nothing else. Iran does many things that the US, and its European and Middle Eastern allies, believe are damaging to security in the region.  That is an important but a different matter, one that I will come back to in a moment. The JCPOA was and is a nuclear deal, pure and simple.  And that brings me to perhaps the most fundamental point of all.  Everyone - and that includes the UN's nuclear watchdog and all of the signatories (including senior figures in the Trump administration) - believes that Iran is abiding by the agreement to the letter. Enter the US Congress.  It wanted to have some oversight over the application of the JCPOA and brought in legislation, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA), which requires the US president to certify every 90 days not just that Iran is complying with the deal, but that the continued suspension of nuclear-related US economic sanctions remains vital to the national security interests of the United States.  So far - despite criticising the Iran nuclear deal at every opportunity - President Trump has grudgingly recertified the JCPOA under this legislation. But now he looks set to change his mind.  Assuming he does now refuse to recertify the deal, insisting that it is no longer in US interests to do so, what then? What does it mean? And what happens next? The crucial point to grasp is that the Iran deal (JCPOA) and the US legislation (INARA) are two totally different things.  By decertifying the Iran deal, Mr Trump would not be withdrawing from it. He would certainly be making a fundamental point about his view of its utility. He would be opening up a path under which Congress could effectively cease US compliance with the deal.  But in practical terms, this is a multinational agreement that is being adhered to and thus it would remain active with or without a certification from Mr Trump. Of course, having decertified the deal, the president could simply reimpose some or all of the economic sanctions that have been waived under the JCPOA, and this would certainly mean that the US was no longer complying with its terms of the deal.  But the more likely scenario would be that - under the US INARA legislation - the whole issue would go to Capitol Hill for the US Congress to decide.  Opinion there is divided. There is clearly no warmth felt towards Tehran, but at this stage it is not clear what Congress might do.  Would it reimpose some or all sanctions - thus pulling the US out of the deal - or decide to bide its time? There are indications that some of those on Capitol Hill most critical of the deal at the time are now reluctant to tear it up. Now we come to another crucial aspect of this whole business: the ostensible reason why Mr Trump may decertify the agreement in the first place.  Iran is seen by the West and its allies as a major problem in the region. Paradoxically, the US itself helped to facilitate Iran's rise as a regional player through its destruction of the Saddam Hussein government in Iraq. Iran has an important say with the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad. It - along with its proxy militias - is a major player in Syria. And it has a hand in the conflict in Yemen, though there is debate about the scale of its activities there.  Add in worries about its missile programmes and its alleged support for terrorism, and there are good reasons for concern about its growing regional influence. The JCPOA agreement has not changed Iran's wider behaviour. The activities of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and its missile-research effort have continued. The JCPOA was never intended to tackle these wider issues. But in some basic sense, Mr Trump looks set to contend that Iran is not living up to the ""spirit"" of the deal - it's not playing nice - and that is why he will choose to decertify it. The Trump administration wants to get tough with Tehran. The president is likely to set his decertification of the JCPOA as part of a wider set of policies intended to punish Iran, as he would see it, for its bad behaviour.   All sorts of new sanctions could be on the table. Remember, there is still a whole battery of sanctions in place both from the US and the EU for a variety of other things - separate from the nuclear programme - such as terrorism or human rights violations.  One suggestion is that the Trump administration might decide to brand the whole of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist entity.  This body - part security force, part military, part ideological vanguard - also controls a significant part of the Iranian economy. More sanctions here could cause problems not just for Iran, but between the US and those of its allies who want to open up trade with Tehran. So if, as expected, Mr Trump does decertify the Iran nuclear deal, it is not necessarily the end of the agreement.  America's allies are lining up to encourage both the White House and Congress to stick with the deal.  Even if Congress chooses not to reapply sanctions for now, the next problem becomes the scope and impact of the Trump administration's wider policy towards Tehran. Iran for now is likely to do nothing. It will see decertification as an internal legal US matter, and is likely to continue to adhere to the agreement. Indeed, it may well relish the widening split between Washington and its key European allies.  But the way Tehran responds to any other US steps may well decide the fate of the nuclear deal.  Remember, this is a US administration dominated by military figures, many of whom have been up against Iranian-backed forces in the field.  They may back the nuclear deal, but also want to see Tehran held to account for its actions.  Insulating the JCPOA from team Trump's wider Iran policy is not going to be easy, and over time, it may well influence thinking towards the utility of the agreement in Iran itself."
economic indicators,US jobs growth beats forecasts despite GM strike,2024-09-15,2019-11-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50263429,"US employment was more resilient than expected in October despite the impact of strike action at General Motors. Companies added 128,000 new jobs, ahead of a forecast 85,000 rise, during a month when thousands of workers walked out at the carmaker.  The unemployment rate edged up slightly to 3.6% from 3.5% in September, which had been the lowest rate since 1969. Analysts said the data supported the Federal Reserve's comments earlier this week that the economy is in good shape. President Trump immediately praised ""blowout"" jobs data, stating that adjusted employment figures showed growth of 303,000 roles. However, this includes upgrades to figures from previous months and other adjustments. The jobs data for August and September was revised upwards. In August, 51,000 more roles than originally thought were added to the US economy and 44,000 more jobs were created in September. The data from the Labor Department showed that the manufacturing sector shed 36,000 positions last month, the biggest fall for a decade. However, within manufacturing, employment in the motor vehicles and parts sector declined by 42,000 because of the strike at GM. Striking employees are treated as unemployed in the US statistics. The White House said that 60,000 jobs were affected by the GM strikes. And public sector payrolls fell in October because 20,000 temporary workers who had been preparing for the 2020 Census completed their work. Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Asset Management, said employment data ""appears to back up the Fed's comments on Wednesday night about the economy being in decent shape and its shift in policy stance"".  On Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve cut the country's key interest rate, but signalled that there would not be further reductions in the near term. By Andrew Walker, economics correspondent Does the US ""rock"", as President Trump says?  The labour market does seem pretty resilient, and the new figures do support that view. By international standards, the country's unemployment rate is very low. Not the lowest among the developed economies, but well towards the right end of the range. But in terms of the percentage of the adult population who do have jobs, the US is near the middle.  So why the apparent discrepancy between what the employment and unemployment figures tell us? It is because people who don't work are only counted as unemployed if they have actively tried to find work.  Some people don't for family reasons. Some are full-time students. Some are retired.  But some are discouraged by the lack of opportunity, which may be a factor in some areas in the US. And some don't seek work because of health problems. In the US, opioid drug misuse is sometimes cited as a factor that inhibits some people from seeking work.   There is no question that since the financial crisis the US has created a lot of jobs. But there are some troublesome features of the country's labour market.  The world's largest economy grew at an annual rate of 1.9% in the third quarter, which was the slowest rate this year but was above some analysts' expectations for expansion of 1.6%. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the number of new roles added over the last three months average at around 170,000. ""That said, forward-looking surveys continue to point to the trend in payroll growth slowing to only 50,000 or so by the turn of next year,"" he said. ""They might be wrong - shifts in sentiment don't always translate into shifts in action - but we aren't willing to assume that job gains will continue to trend at anything like 170,000."" "
economic indicators,Omicron spread led shoppers to desert High Street,2024-09-15,2022-01-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60066434,"UK retail sales sank 3.7% in December from the month before as the spread of Omicron deterred shoppers from visiting the High Street. Data from the Office for National Statistics also showed a 7.1% fall in clothing and other non-food sales. However, last month's figures followed a strong November amid reports there would be some shortages in the run-up to Christmas. And while food sales fell by 1%, volumes were above pre-pandemic levels. ""After strong pre-Christmas trading in November, retail sales fell across the board in December, with feedback from retailers suggesting Omicron impacted on footfall,"" said Office for National Statistics (ONS) deputy director for surveys and economic indicators Heather Bovill. ""As Plan B restrictions in England meant more people working from home, there was a notable fall for fuel sales. ""However, despite the fall in December, retail sales are still stronger than before the pandemic, with over a quarter of sales now made online.""  Fuel volumes fell by 4.7% in December on the previous month as more people worked from home, and were 6.6% below their pre-pandemic levels in February 2020. Gavin Peck, chief executive of retailer The Works, told the BBC there were definite signs that consumers did their Christmas shopping earlier than usual last year. Mr Peck, whose firm on Friday reported a strong rise in sales, said it was noticeable that some shoppers were starting festive purchases as early as September.  As the UK economy emerged from lockdown last year retail sales recovered quickly from their 2020 pandemic slump. But analysts say that a combination of fast-rising inflation led by surging energy prices, the prospect of higher interest rates, and planned tax rises in April may dent the appetite of consumers to keep on spending in 2022. Bethany Beckett, economist at Capital Economics, said December's fall was much bigger than expected and could drag UK growth figures lower. However, she said: ""With encouraging signs that the Omicron outbreak may have turned a corner and the government's Plan B restrictions due to be lifted next week, retail sales may recoup a bit of this fall in January and probably all of it in February and March. ""That said, with the UK's cost of living crisis looming, we expect a weakening in the consumer recovery to dampen retail sales further ahead.""  Ms Beckett said that, despite weaker economic data, the Bank of England will remain focused on accelerating inflation, and she still expects interest rates to be raised to 0.50% in early February. On Friday, The Restaurant Group, whose operations include Wagamama, Frankie & Benny's, and food kiosks, said that despite the lifting of Plan B restrictions ""consumer confidence may take longer to recover"". The company's sales figures underlined the impact of December's Covid restrictions on trading. At Wagamama, sales in October and November were up 11% and 8% respectively on the same months in 2019, before the pandemic hit, as people returned to eating out in larger numbers. But in December, Wagamama sales were just 1% up on 2019, and there were even sharper falls at Restaurant Group's other divisions."
economic indicators,Job market recovery continues as furlough nears end,2024-09-15,2021-09-14,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-58555657,"The Northern Ireland jobs market continued to recover in August, official figures suggest. HMRC payroll data is the most timely and best single overall indicator of the labour market. It showed an estimated 764,300 employees in August, up 0.5% on July and 1.5% above the pre-pandemic level in March 2020. There are still thousands of people on furlough who count as employed, though that scheme ends soon. Latest figures suggest there were 36,000 people on furlough at the end of July; around half were on flexible furlough meaning they were able to work some of the time. The furlough scheme finishes at the end of September with concerns that could lead to a spike in job losses. However there is little sign of large scale job losses so far. The official data shows that 80 redundancies were proposed in August which was much lower than redundancy proposals in the previous three months (150, 490, and 850). Other figures show the impact of people coming off furlough. The Labour Force Survey shows the total number of hours worked in the most recent quarter (May-July 2021) increased by 14% over the year. However that is still 6% below the the pre-pandemic levels measured in November-January 2020. Another jobs market measurement, the Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) also points to an improving picture. The QES surveys about 6,000 companies, covering all employers with 25 or more employees and all public sector employers. It suggested that in the second quarter of this year the number of employee jobs was still lower than the same time last year but had increased slightly compared to the previous quarter. Total employee jobs were estimated at 771,680 June 2021, an increase of 1,190 compared to March. The increase was almost all in the services sector."
economic indicators,The invisible patterns in street names,2024-09-15,2021-07-13,Richard Fisher,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210712-streetonomics-what-our-addresses-say-about-us,"From unseen gender bias to hidden historical patterns, you can tell a lot about where you live by looking at the names of the streets. One day, the writer and lawyer Deirdre Mask was lost somewhere in West Virginia. She had borrowed her father's car to drive to the home of an acquaintance, equipped with complicated directions. What made it particularly difficult was that the man she intended to visit had no address. His street lacked a name, and his house had no number.   As Mask would discover, many residents in that West Virginia county were in a similar situation. They'd pick up their mail at the post office. And if directions were required, they'd talk of landmarks instead: turn at the stone church, go past the factory, left at the drive-in restaurant, and so on.   So over many years, West Virginia has been making a state-wide effort to name its unmarked roads. Often the titles have been chosen by officials: reflecting local history, for instance. But as Mask discovered, in a few places residents have proposed eclectic titles such as Booger Hollow, Crunchy Granola Lane or even Stupid Way. Some have been happy to take on names, but many have not, feeling they reflect a form of governmental oversight they don't want or need. (The resident who suggested Stupid Way did so ""because this whole street name stuff is stupid"".) Stories like West Virginia's inspired Mask to take a closer look at street names all over the world. How and why have people chosen the ones they have? It's easy to take for granted that roads have titles, but look a little closer and they can reveal a great deal about the nature and character of a place, as well as its history. ""We think of street addresses as purely functional and administrative tools, but they tell a grander narrative of how power has shifted and stretched over the centuries,"" she writes in The Address Book: What Street Addresses Reveal about Identity, Race, Wealth, and Power.   In recent years, Mask and others have converged on the idea that if you want to gain a deeper understanding of a place – its defining culture and underlying attitudes – you should look at the titles it has chosen for its roads, alleys and boulevards. It's an approach that one group of researchers is now calling ""streetonomics"" – and it promises to uncover previously hidden insights about the societies we live within.   How does a street get its name? Perhaps it's based on its location or a landmark: Main Street, Market Lane, Orchard Road. It could be called after a place: Oxford, Massachusetts, Atlantic. It might be a person: Victoria or Jefferson. Or simply a utilitarian number, from Fifth Avenue to 42nd Street. (The most common street name in the US is not a founding father or other historical icon: it's actually ""Second"".)   In the long view of human history, though, street names are a relatively recent invention. What tends to be forgotten today is that the practice of street titling emerged for more complex reasons than exchanging post or visiting people. ""When we think of addresses, it's that they're useful to get our packages delivered, or to navigate around, but they actually weren't designed for us. They were designed for the state,"" explains Mask.   Centuries ago, governments realised that naming the streets allowed centralised oversight of their citizens, be it for drafting into the military, taxation, or to verify who somebody was. That hasn't changed much. As the world has become complex, your home address remains a key part of your identity in the eyes of governments, banks and other officialdom. It's required on almost every form you fill out, and every job, document or loan you apply for – which is why it's such a struggle for those who don't have one.    But that's not the only way that the state has leveraged street names as an extension of their power and influence. ""Since the beginning of time, rulers have used spatial engineering as a form of social engineering,"" write Melanie Bancilhon of Washington University in St Louis and colleagues at Nokia Bell Labs in Cambridge UK in a paper published in June. ""As a result, street names mirror a city’s social, cultural, political, and even religious values.""   You may also like:     A few hundred years ago, political leaders began to realise that they could use street naming to preserve memories of their military victories, societal legacies, venerated figures, and political ideologies. But these values differ by location. In London, some streets are linked to the Royal Family, avenues of Washington DC are named after the member states of the Union, while streets in once-socialist Bucharest celebrate the working class. In some cases, street-naming serves as a deliberate attempt to rewrite history. For example, in South Africa during the apartheid period, place names originated by the fusion of European and Afrikaans names, which served the interests of colonial powers.   Bancilhon and colleagues were curious about whether it might be possible to quantify some of these societal values, by comparing the naming approach in different places. The inspiration came from some of their previous work, which BBC Future first covered back in 2013, where they attempted to measure aspects of a city not captured by the usual economic indicators, such as how people attach emotions and memories to certain places. They were also inspired by the study of ""culturomics"", which attempts to study previously unquantifiable facets of human culture. So, they pioneered a new approach that they called ""streetonomics"". To demonstrate how it works, they studied the patterns within 4,932 streets in Paris, Vienna, London and New York, cities chosen for their cultural influence in the Western world (as well as accessible data).   The first thing they were able to see was when street naming had accelerated in each of the four cities. For example, London named a lot of its streets during the decades following the Great Fire of 1666, while Paris went on a spree between 1850-1870 as the city centre was redesigned.   For New York, however, naming has been much more recent. It may be famous for its numbered streets, such as Fifth Avenue, but in recent decades, many have been co-named with honorific titles, especially after 9/11. Mask has observed this pattern too, pointing out that in recent years some 40% of all local laws passed by New York City Council have been street name changes. In 2018 alone, it co-named 164 streets.   Gender biases   Once the streetonomics team had built their database, they were able to see other patterns too. Street names, they found, can have a gender bias – and this differed between the four cities. In Paris, only 32% of the streets named after people were female, while in New York City, its recent naming spree has done little to skew a bias towards men, with only 26% of its person-titled streets honouring women.   ""Despite Paris and New York being centres of progressive culture, they still fail to commemorate men and women in equal measure. Sadly, what is a historical legacy will stay with us in the future, if these two cities do not change their course,"" the researchers write.     Paris, to its credit, has taken some steps towards reversing its gender inbalance. Following political campaigns from groups such as OsezLeFeminisme, in 2015, Paris Mayor Anne Hildalgo decided to rename several streets after women such as Nina Simone, Assia Djabar, Simone de Beauvoir, and Rosa Parks.   London fares a little better, with women making up 40% of streets carrying people's names. But Vienna offers the model of how to evolve with the times. In the 1880s, the percentage of Viennese person-titled streets named after women was below 5%, but since the 1980s, many streets have been renamed, bringing the total to 54%. Other trends that the streetonomics team observed included changes in the types of professions venerated. Certain jobs have been consistently celebrated over the centuries, such as artists and writers – particularly so in Paris and Vienna – but others have gone out of fashion, such as military leaders. In recent decades, London has begun to name more streets after people in the creative sector than one its previous favourite sources: the Royal Family. And in New York, most of the named streets come from the ""business and community"" sector, such as civil servants, or emergency responders involved in the 2001 attacks.   The researchers also found that some city leaders have been more willing than others to name their streets after foreigners. Among the four they studied, Vienna has shown the greatest willingness to celebrate nations other than its own, with 45% of streets named after non-Austrians. Contrast that with New York, which only has 3%, clustered mainly in the Bronx.   ""New York is the very model of a global city, but it is more so financially than culturally,"" write the researchers. ""That might be partly because the city is quite young compared to Vienna or Paris, and partly because it tends to focus on itself.""  For Mask, street names also speak to aspects of a place and people that are harder to quantify with data: in particular, attitudes about race – and how that has changed (or not) over time.   To illustrate what she means, she tells a story about a controversial street she came across while house-hunting in Tottenham, London. With a small budget, she and her husband had been pleased to find a potential place with wooden floors and bay windows that had just come on to the market – but when they visited, they discovered a problem that was impossible to ignore.   ""The street was tidy, and I saw potential neighbours clipping hedges and planting flowers in their front yards,"" she writes. ""At one end of the road was a friendly looking pub; on the other end, a grand-looking state school with a garden classroom and swimming pool… The house sat squarely in the most diverse postcode in the United Kingdom, and probably all of Europe.""   On the surface, it had everything going for it. ""I did really like it. But I had a nagging problem: could I really live on Black Boy Lane?""   Mask, a black American, couldn't get past the idea that this would be her address. While it's unclear how the street got its name, the words ""Black Boy"" reminded of a condescending slur used in her home country, as well as the UK's colonial history in the slave trade. She and her husband decided to pass.   The local council has since opened a consultation with residents about renaming the street, but for now, it's still there. The discussion has followed much of the same patterns as recent debate over controversial statues. For some, the street name is history and so should stay, while for others, it's outdated and offensive. Debates over street names can be a bellwether for a culture's underlying attitudes, says Mask. In her book, she explores the politics and perceptions surrounding a common street title in her home country: Martin Luther King, whose name can be found on nearly 900 addresses in the US. ""It can actually tell you a lot about race in America"", she says. Road signs carrying the name of the civil rights activist are often vandalised. And there remain negative perceptions about the communities living and working on these streets.   ""The comedian Chris Rock once joked that if you find yourself on Martin Luther King street, then run, because these are dangerous places,"" says Mask. ""Now that's not always true, and in fact, some studies have found that MLK streets aren't necessarily poorer than other ones – Main streets or JFK streets – but they're different. They have more churches and more schools, for example.""   Sadly, Martin Luther King's name on an address influences how some people see the commerce and community there, no matter how safe and liveable the neighbourhood is. ""Because they're so connected with blackness, people see them as bad, even if they aren't really bad,"" says Mask.   Whether you like it or not, the name of the street you live on matters. In 2015, research by the real estate company Zillow found that houses on named streets in the US are often worth more than numbered streets – and in the case of Los Angeles or San Francisco, by more than 20%. Properties on streets with less common names also tend to be more valuable: one of the lowest value addresses to live on is Main Street.   Naming alternatives   So, in the 21st Century, might it be time to reconsider street names? Given all the controversy they attract and the unequal historical power dynamics they reflect, might we look to other approaches? After all, digital technology allows for it.   Mask points out that there are already alternatives – what3words, for instance, a proprietary system that assigns a random string of words to a location. For example, to find the entrance to BBC's Broadcasting House in London, you don't need its street name, you could just plot a route to ""daring.begins.these"" (or the less glamorously-named adjacent spots, ""jumps.slugs.bulbs"" or ""fried.dairy.worker"").   But while Mask acknowledges that digital addresses would bypass the controversies, she wouldn't replace the conventions we have. ""People don’t always unite around street names… But I like the arguments. Arguments are what divide communities, but they are also what constitutes them as communities.”   So, the next time you walk around your neighbourhood or city, take a closer look at the street signs you see – they might tell you a lot more about where you live than you might realise.   * Richard Fisher is a senior journalist for BBC Future.

economic indicators,How China's fertility affects the world,2024-09-15,2023-01-18,Zaria Gorvett,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230118-is-chinas-population-decline-surprising,"BBC Future answers five key questions about China's recent population decline and what it might mean for global demographic trends. At midnight on 1 July 1982, China began a mammoth undertaking. The goal: to find out how many people there were in the country at that exact moment in time. No one had checked since 1964, so it was anyone's guess what they would find. After years of preparations, armed with 29 computers purchased for the task – including at least 21 imported from the US under a special exemption – and five million trained personnel, they would spend the coming months diligently counting the members of every household in the country. By October that same year, the results were in: the New York Times ran the headline ""CHINA, POP. 1,008,175,288: ONE-FOURTH OF THE WORLD"". Decades of growth had raised the country's population to the staggering new threshold of a billion people. A baby was born there every two seconds. China's one-child policy was introduced in 1980, with the explicit objective of reducing population growth to zero. But though it ran for another 36 years until 2016, it is only now that China has entered ""negative growth"" – its numbers have started shrinking for the first time in 60 years. According to data released by China's National Bureau of Statistics, the nation was home to 1.4118 billion people in 2022, which is 850,000 fewer than there were in 2021. It reflects a decline in the country's birth rate, which has been falling over the past six years to reach a record low of 6.77 births per 1,000 people. The change has been met with both alarm and optimism – including concerns about what this means for the global economy, and the hope that continued prosperity might not be as dependent on having a growing population as has historically been assumed. The charity Population Matters has suggested that China's stabilising numbers should be celebrated for their potential environmental benefits and the welfare of the country's citizens. But such a stark demographic shift in the world's most populous country raises many uncertainties and implications for the future. Is China's newly declining population really a surprise? And how will it affect the planet? BBC Future looks at five of the big questions to get to grips with this story. Why has it taken so long for China's population to shrink? In 1991, within just a few years of the one-child policy kicking in, China's birth rate had fallen to below replacement level. Each woman was having fewer children than the number required to maintain the population size from one generation to the next. In most countries, this is usually around 2.1 – one for each woman, one for her partner, and an extra 0.1 to counteract those that die as infants. In the years that followed, China's continued growth wasn't because the controversial initiative had failed – it was down to a counterintuitive effect known as ""demographic momentum"". This explains how a population with constant levels of mortality and zero migration can continue to increase for decades, even when women are having fewer than 2.1 children. It's all down to the time delay between births and deaths. Until recently, China's population was relatively youthful, with an average age of 35 in 2010, compared to 44.3 in Germany (now it's 38.4). At the same time, people have been living longer – in 2021, the country's life expectancy overtook that of the US. So, though the number of babies born per woman declined drastically, there were still more babies being born than there were people dying. This has now changed, however. It's thought that the drop in fertility rates and slight increase in reported deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic may have played a role in accelerating a decline in China's absolute numbers, though it has been long anticipated.  Burning Questions In this series, BBC Future takes a look at topical stories through the lens of the most pressing questions - the kind you'd need to ask to put a new development in context, or explain it to a friend. Will China's drop in numbers affect predictions for the total global population? According to the UN's World Population Prospects report for 2022, China's population was predicted to decline in 2023 – the reduction recently revealed by the country's census had been expected for some time. In fact, the shift has only come slightly early. This milestone in China's demographics has already been factored into many projections for global population growth. Based on the expectation that the country's population would start to shrink in 2023, along with its predictions for other countries, the UN expects that the total number of humans on the planet will continue to expand, to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, and peak at 10.4 billion by 2086. This is the ""medium"" scenario, in which the birth rates of nations with high fertility will mellow, while those with low fertility rates will see marginal increases. ""This is happening in China now but it's not happening in the rest of the world, it won't happen on a global level for another 63 years,"" says Alistair Currie, head of campaigns and communications at Population Matters. Most of the growth will happen in sub-Saharan Africa, which is projected to contribute to more than half of the population increase between now and 2050. The headcount in the region is projected to double in that time, with Nigeria taking the slot as the fourth most populated country on the planet. According to Shuang Chen, assistant professor in the department of social policy at the London School of Economics, focusing on China's sheer numbers would be missing the point – though she acknowledges that from this perspective, the decline might be beneficial for climate change. China was responsible for 27% of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere in 2022, and the country is currently building over half of the new coal-fired power plants on the planet. ""But what's really causing concerns socially is what that means in terms of the structure. Because things are changing really fast… societies may not have time to adapt,"" says Chen.  You might also like: Which country is on track to overtake China as the most populous? In the UN's 2022 report, it also forecast that 2023 will be the year that India eclipses its neighbour and becomes the most populated country in the world. In light of the census results, some commentators have even speculated that this may have already have happened. India's population is expected to keep going up, rising from 1.417 billion in 2022 to 1.515 billion by 2030. This is mostly down to two factors: fertility rates have remained high, while mortality rates have gone down due to improvements in medicine. Then there's the population's age structure. India's population is around a decade younger than China's on average, so there are more people of childbearing age in total. How does China's fertility rate compare with those of other countries? China's fertility rate has been steadily declining since the 1990s to an all-time low of 1.28 in 2020. For comparison, there were 2.05 births per woman in India the same year, and 1.64 in the US. Even Japan, with its notoriously low birth rate and ageing population, had a fertility rate of 1.34. The steep downwards trajectory of China's reproductive power is thought to be down to a number of factors. For one thing, there is an imbalance between men and women in China. The one-child policy left the country with a skewed sex ratio: there was a traditional preference for boys, with many girls being aborted, abandoned or even killed. In some age groups, there are now more than 11 men for every 10 women. – indicating that one in every 11 men will struggle to find a partner the same age.  Other factors are thought to include the rising cost of living, and a trend towards getting married later in life. But there are also shifting values. Survey after survey has revealed that Chinese women now view the ideal number of children as one, two, or zero, despite the introduction of a two-child policy in 2015. These issues were compounded during the Covid-19 pandemic, when resentment about lockdowns and other restrictions led to the hashtag #wearethelastgeneration trending on social media.   Will China's population continue shrinking? Over the past 200 years or so, many industrialised countries have undergone a ""demographic transition"" – after first growing at a rapid pace, their population eventually transitions from having high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates. China is considered to be a ""post-transitional"" society, which has already completed this cycle. However, it's less clear what will happen next. China's fertility rates are expected to continue to decline, particularly as the population ages and there are fewer women of child-bearing age overall. But there are two big unknowns. One is migration. China's levels of immigration are currently extremely low, but Currie explains that this could change as the country attempts to grow its economy. Then there's the possible impact of measures the government is taking to encourage citizens to reproduce. At the moment, they are not proving particularly effective, but some experts are concerned that they may adopt more coercive tactics. ""For policies to reverse the fertility decline itself is very challenging,"" says Chen. ""In recent years China has already been coming up with lots of new measures, including getting rid of the one-child policy, some kinds of subsidies at different levels. But they haven't really been working well, fertility has not reversed. I do think this decline will continue.""   -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

economic indicators,Why wood stoves have had their day,2024-09-15,2021-11-12,Justice Nwafor,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211103-nigeria-how-clean-cooking-helps-the-climate,"Wood-fired stoves have powered Nigerian cooking for time immemorial. But cleaner cooking could go a long way to saving lives, and carbon emissions, in Africa's most populous nation. Catherine Chinenye's morning routine is one of early morning prayers and breakfast, before visiting her family's nearby cassava and yam farms in Umuekpe village, in south-east Nigeria. At the farms, she begins to tend the twisted tendrils of yam and blooming cassava stems. From time to time, she adds bits of firewood to the heap in a corner of her farm. The firewood, she says, will serve for the sunset meal. Soon the fireplace will be lit, with a black pot resting on a hearth of three stones filled with smouldering charcoal and smoke. Catherine shares this routine with 175 million Nigerians – more than the number of people living in the UK, France, Portugal and Belgium combined – who rely on wood, charcoal and other polluting varieties of biomass for fuel. Overall, nine in every 10 Nigerians lack access to clean cooking. On a global scale, the country comes only behind China and India in terms of the numbers of people living without access to clean cooking. Charcoal cooking is an age-long practise in rural communities in Nigeria, fed by the constant cutting of trees. In 2020, Nigeria lost 97,800 hectares (377 square miles) of natural forest, equivalent to 59.5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. The situation is also grim for health in the country. In 2016, more than 218,000 people died in Nigeria from household air pollution, including from inhaling smoke from open woodfires in the kitchen. But more recently, the practice has also taken root in urban centres, says Adeola Ijeoma Eleri, chief scientific officer at the Energy Commission of Nigeria. She links this trend to a complex supply chain that starts with the ""rampant and indiscriminate"" cutting down of trees and the production of the charcoal in kilns close to cities. Nigeria is a relatively small climate polluter on a global scale, due to its limited industrial activity. Despite having Africa's largest economy and its largest population, equivalent to 2.7% of the world total, it contributes 0.36% of global CO2 emissions. However, the country's CO2 emissions almost quadrupled between 1990 and 2019, from 28 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year to 92 million. Its emissions are expected to soar further with the ongoing population surge and economic growth. This means Nigeria's path will be crucial in the drive towards global net-zero emissions in the next three decades – a goal the world needs to meet to limit global temperatures to 1.5C, according to the International Panel on Climate Change. At the UN's global climate talks in Glasgow, COP26, Nigeria made a pledge to reach net zero emissions by 2060. The country's leaders have also promised to cut emissions 20% by 2030 compared with business-as-usual levels, increasing to a 47% cut below business-as-usual by 2030, depending on whether the country receives international financial support. The country's commitments on climate have earned it an ""almost sufficient"" score from analysts Climate Action Tracker (CAT), which notes that Nigeria faces one of the dilemmas of climate action. Despite its limited contribution to climate change in the past, it says, Nigeria will have to abstain from exploiting fossil fuel resources if the global 1.5C limit is to be kept. But Nigeria will also have to look closely at its usage of charcoal and firewood, and find ways to cut it. Biofuels accounted for 86% of CO2 emissions from energy use in 2017 in the country. It could exploit less polluting cooking sources such as electricity, gas, ethanol, solar and high performing biomass stoves. But a long-held cultural preference for charcoal and firewood, and high costs of alternative fuels could hamstring progress. Sharon Ikeazor, Nigeria's minister of state for environment, has said that 60% or more of all households in Nigeria will still be cooking with traditional biomass by 2030 if current policies continue. Such new actions are clearly needed. But fixing the situation will come at a cost. With four in 10 Nigerians living below $2 (£1.5) a day, families often do not have the financial resources to pay for a clean stove and for the fuel or power to run it. Precious Ede, a professor of climatology at the Rivers State University in the Niger Delta region, says the income level of households in the country must be factored into any plan private investors and the government are bringing in to drive the net-zero target. Some international actors are taking frontline roles. The Clean Cooking Alliance, a non-profit operating with the support of the United Nations Foundation to promote clean cooking technologies in low- and middle-income countries, is one of them. The alliance has initiated a series of programmes to improve access to clean energy in Nigeria, including research, funding for small- to medium-scale clean cooking businesses and behaviour change campaigns. It's no easy hack, and the clean cooking industry has not yet achieved the scale required to make significant impacts, according to the Clean Cooking Alliance. On the global scale, progress is clearer. The share of the global population with access to clean cooking fuels and technologies grew from 47% in 2000 to 59% in 2016. Investment in the sector has increased as well, reaching $70m (£50m) in 2019, up from $43m (£30m) in 2018. Increasing access to clean cooking is also a gender issue, says Ikeazor. Women, more than men, are likely to suffer significantly from the adverse effect of using polluting charcoal and firewood due to social-cultural practices that primarily restrict them to roles in the kitchen, especially in Africa. So focusing on a women-centred approach to clean energy solutions can both accelerate access and save lives. This means ensuring that the solutions being rolled out actually work for the women using them. In one project last year, a group of non-profit organisations distributed clean cooking solutions to women in 50 households in Mararaba-Burum village in the federal capital Abuja. As well as supporting these women, the project aimed to collect data on how effective different stoves were at reducing air pollution inside their homes. It tested five types of clean stoves, all based on either liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), fuel-efficient biomass or ethanol, by attaching wireless sensors onto the cookstoves to track how long and how often women cook. The data, downloaded via mobile devices or tablets, was used to quantify emissions reductions as well as get data on how cookstoves were actually being used. It found that the more efficient biomass stoves were used the most. The liquid fuel stoves showed the lowest use over the long term, due to the expense of buying LPG and difficulty in sourcing ethanol in the region. However, households said they would be more willing to take out a loan to buy an LPG stove than a biomass one. Encouraging such a switch from biomass to LPG could reduce cooking's CO2 emissions in Nigeria substantially. But in the longer run, an overreliance on fossil fuels – including LPG – brings its own problems. The Nigerian government is holding tight to natural gas as part of its decarbonisation drive, arguing that its abundant reserves should be explored to end energy poverty by 2030. The country has more than 187 trillion cubic feet (5.3 trillion cubic metres) of proven gas reserves, ranking ninth in the world and accounting for about 3% of the world's reserves. But poor investment in refining, transport and storage infrastructure has stymied mass usage. The government argues that investment in this gas would help it provide stable electricity. For instance, it argues that an ongoing $2.8bn (£2bn) gas pipeline project that aims to transport gas from fields in southern states to northern states will increase power generation by 3.6 gigawatts (billions of Watts). In 2020, the government began a national gas expansion programme to drive domestic commercial use of compressed natural gas as the fuel of choice for transport and LPG as the clean source for domestic and industrial energy. The Central Bank of Nigeria, meanwhile, introduced an intervention fund worth 250 billion Nigerian naira ($610m/£450m) to drive investment in the natural gas value chain by providing loans to players in the sector. Ikeazor, the minister for environment, has said replacing firewood and charcoal with LPG would cut Nigeria's CO2 emissions. Those who favour limiting investment in natural gas have raised concerns about the negative climate impacts, and the inherent health and climate trade-offs of using LPG for cooking. The Clean Cooking Alliance says it understands this and is prioritising further research on the impacts of LPG. Perrine Toledano, head of mining and energy at the Columbia Centre on Sustainable Investment in New York, says there are better long-term opportunities for a developing country like Nigeria to solve its energy crisis with renewables such as solar than with natural gas. She says the country should not fall prey to locking huge investments in gas infrastructures that are now ""less cost-effective than investment in renewables"". But there is another big concern about the use of LPG: its rising cost. The cost of 12kg of LPG spiked by 50% from 4,515 Nigerian Naira ($11/£8) in September 2020 to 6,165 Nigerian Naira ($16/£12) in September 2021, the National Bureau of Statistics says. In a report Eleri published this year on the growing clean cooking market, she recommended that the government bring in policies to keep the price low. But since she published the report in May, the price of LPG has continued to increase, largely due to the reintroduction of tax on LPG importation. She is now concerned that if the price surge is allowed to continue, people who had recently started using LPG may go back to firewood and charcoal. ""Without a stable price regime, then all our efforts in pushing for a transition in the cooking energy sector will be in vain,"" she says. ""The current cost of LPG is already a deterrent to households interested in making a switch. The most concerning part is some households that have made the switch are reverting to fuelwood and charcoal."" The rising cost is partly a reflection of the rising cost of natural gas in the international market.  With the concern around natural gas's environmental impact, electric cooking is another way to clean up cooking. But in Nigeria, and many other developing countries, electrification is not always simple. Nigeria has made significant progress on increasing electricity access over the past few decades. But close to half of Nigeria's population still lack access to any kind of electricity. Even for those who do have a connection, grid access is often sporadic and unreliable. These setbacks feed a culture of heavy reliance on smoke-belching petrol and diesel generators. More than 11 million Nigerian homes, a little more than one third of the total, depend on generators, partly or wholly, for energy supply. All this limits the chances of electric cooking, according to Colm Fay, a senior director at the Clean Cooking Alliance. However, the rise of off-grid electrification efforts through mini-grids offers ""a very clear link"" to electric cooking, he adds. Experts attribute Nigeria's progress in electricity access to increased government investment in off-grid electrification through its Rural Electrification Agency. The agency's Solar Power Naija programme, whose name includes the Nigerian word which embodies the enterprising and boisterous spirit of Nigerians, aims to connect five million homes across Nigeria to solar home systems or to a solar mini-grid by 2022. The agency says it has made some 5,400 connections through mini-grids and connected 290,700 houses to solar home systems since 2019. These projects have helped Nigeria's installed solar capacity increase almost double from 15 megawatts (million Watts) in 2012 to 28 megawatts in 2020. And renewable energy start-ups have come up with novel ways to make off-grid clean electricity available to homes. Lumos Nigeria and Greenlight Planet Sun King, for example, have adopted price models that allow homes to subscribe per day, week or month. Education centres such as the Renewable Energy Technology Training Institute in Lagos are training Nigerian technicians on the installation and maintenance of solar systems. In one of its recent projects, it trained 20 women on solar panel installation in Nigeria's largest slum settlement Makoko. Glory Oguegbu, founder of the institute, says these women have since trained others. In all, she says, about 750 women in the slum settlement were trained and many now have solar systems self-installed in their homes. Despite these positive signs, off-grid connections are still not widely spread, especially in far-flung communities such as Chinenye's small, sleepy village, where she gathers wood for the evening fire. ""I have heard about cooking without firewood and I hope one day I will cook for my children without battling the smoke from my three-stone fire,"" she says. -- Data research and visualisation by Kajsa Rosenblad Animation by Adam Proctor -- Towards Net Zero Since signing the Paris Agreement, how are countries performing on their climate pledges?

economic indicators,The disease driven by an addictive nut,2024-09-15,2023-03-17,Catherine Davison,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230315-how-the-addictive-areca-nut-drives-monkey-fever-in-india,"A tick-borne infection often spread in areca nut plantations in India is among several on the rise around the world. Can we get better at tackling these outbreaks? When Gayatri thinks of her husband, the first thing that she remembers is his voice. ""He used to never stop talking,"" she recalls fondly. One evening in early 2019, Suresh had arrived home from the areca palm nut plantation where he worked complaining of a headache, and had quietly taken himself off to bed. His mumbled goodnight was among the last thing Gayatri would hear him say. Four days later, his health rapidly deteriorating, he had a stroke which left him permanently unable to talk. The mysterious illness which had struck Suresh down was spreading like wildfire that winter through Aralagodu, a tiny village in the middle of a forest in Karnataka, a state in southern India. By the end of that winter, 14 people had died – 0.5% of its inhabitants. A year after his stroke, Suresh also succumbed to the disease, leaving behind two young children. ""I would have paid any price to keep him alive,"" Gayatri tells me, as we sit watching the couple's nine-year-old son play cricket outside the family home. ""I did everything – I made sure he took his medicine at the correct time. But I wasn't able to save him."" Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) – named after the forest in which it originated –  is a tick-borne haemorrhagic disease with a fatality rate of around 5%. Also known as ""monkey fever"", it was first discovered in 1957 after an outbreak in Shivamogga, the district of Karnataka in which Aralagodu is also situated. In the following decades, recurring outbreaks remained largely confined to the area. But in recent years, the disease has begun to spread, with cases popping up for the first time in 2013 in the neighbouring states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, followed by Goa in 2015 and Maharashtra in 2016.   Still, the disease barely registers on global health watchlists; outbreaks largely occur in rural areas bordering forest land and affect a tiny percentage of India's population. But the spread of the disease is indicative of a much larger, more worrying trend, as highlighted most recently by the Covid-19 pandemic: the increasing likelihood of zoonotic disease spilling over into human populations. Deforestation, changing land use and climate change is putting humans into increasing contact with new viruses. Zoonotic diseases – diseases which can be transmitted between humans and animal species – comprise the majority of new and existing diseases which affect human populations. Most researchers believe that KFD was endemic for centuries in the forests of the Western Ghats in India, circulating silently among primate, bird and rodent populations, and the ticks they carry. But as forest land was fragmented by human activity, and changing rainfall patterns affected tick development cycles, the delicate balance of disease cycles was disrupted – triggering new outbreaks. ""New hotspots are probably where the forest landscape has changed, or people's use of the forest has changed, say in the preceding five to 10 years, and that's what's driving the spillover,"" says Bethan Purse, an ecologist and vector-borne disease specialist at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), who is currently leading an interdisciplinary research project to better understand the dynamics of KFD. The pursuit of areca nuts Consumption of addictive areca nuts, also known as betel nuts, is itself a major health concern, with risk factors for many oral and oesophageal cancers. It is consumed by hundreds of thousands of people across the Asia-Pacific region as well as in the US, making it one of the most widely used psychoactive substances worldwide alongside tobacco, alcohol and caffeine. However, unlike tobacco, no global policy exists for the control of its use, with researchers labelling it a ""neglected global public health emergency"". The Western Ghats, a mountain range in southern India, is home to huge stretches of largely undisturbed forest. But the area is undergoing deforestation at unprecedented rates, in part due to a boom in commercial agroforestry. Deforestation in the Shivamogga region has been driven by growing demand for areca nuts, which come from the areca palm tree. Areca nuts are a popular stimulant drug when ground up and chewed. Areca palm plantations like the one where Suresh worked are hotspots for KFD, because they break up dense, undisturbed forest, creating ""transition zones"" where forests – and the diseases which lurk within – meet plantations and human habitats. ""What the degradation does is really bring people into contact with the ticks,"" explains Purse. The next pandemic With deforestation accelerating across the globe, experts fear that the increased contact between human, animal and vector populations risks triggering the next pandemic. One study published in the journal Nature in 2020 found that habitat disturbance led to lower biodiversity and an increase in animal vectors – such as rodents and bats – known to harbour diseases shared by humans. ""Global changes in the mode and the intensity of land use are creating expanding hazardous interfaces between people, livestock and wildlife reservoirs of zoonotic disease,"" the study authors warn. Climate change also plays a role in increasing the risk of zoonotic disease spill-overs, causing shifts in rainfall patterns and affecting biodiversity. Another study published in Nature last year found that climate change would lead to an increase in cross-species transmission of viral diseases, with a predicted 4000 new spillover events in the next half century.  When it comes to KFD, says Purse, climate change will speed up the development cycles and mortality rates of the ticks, leading to a more rapid turnover of ticks and increasing the amount of time they need to spend feeding on a host. The distribution of the ticks’ hosts, and their overlap with people, will also be affected, she adds – meaning that humans are increasingly likely to come into contact with infected ticks, and in an increasing number of places. The spread of Lyme disease Lyme disease is the most common kind of tick-borne infection globally, found across Asia, Europe, Canada as well as the US, where it is the most common vector-borne disease. It is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria which can be spread to humans when they are bitten by infected ticks. It can cause fever, fatigue, joint pain and skin rash, as well as more serious complications. A 2022 study in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) estimated that an astonishing 14.5% of the global population has had, or has, Lyme disease. Research has found climate change is increasing the range and activity of ticks carrying Lyme disease. Prema Jain, a 52-year-old grandmother in Aralagodu, contracted KFD during the 2019 outbreak after finding a dead monkey in the family’s banana plantation. Although she reported the animal to the forest department, it was too late: the ticks it had been carrying had already crawled off into the surrounding areas, eventually infecting her entire family. Jain says that living in the forest, it is not unusual to find dead animals, but that the threat of KFD is new. ""We have always had ticks, but only recently disease,"" she says. Globally, tick-borne diseases are an increasing menace, with research showing that they are on the rise in countries such as the US. And yet the dangers are often little known to the public, especially for tick-borne diseases other than Lyme disease. There are also fewer surveillance systems in place for tick-borne diseases than exist for similar diseases spread by other vectors, such as mosquitoes.  Purse and her team hope to change that. Monkey Fever Risk project is an Indo-UK partnership between UKCEH, the Karnataka state government, and various interdisciplinary research institutes in India, which aims to map historical patterns of KFD in order to determine the main risk factors for new outbreaks. By looking at various environmental factors, such as the level of forest cover and rainfall patterns, and social factors like livelihood activities and proximity to healthcare centres, the team make models of the main drivers of the disease. This data is fed into an interactive tool to predict new areas at risk of disease emergence, allowing public health officials, the forest department and animal husbandry experts to proactively tackle outbreaks. ""When plotted for the entire country, it shows that yes, there are other places which have a favourable condition [for disease emergence],"" says Darshan Narayan, a research associate on the KFD project specialising in epidemiological modelling. He believes that as surveillance increases in these areas, more cases will be discovered. You might also like: The collaboration has provided vital lessons on the importance of predictive disease modelling for diseases where the drivers of emergence are less well understood. The Indian government now aims to replicate the project for other diseases such as scrub typhus, which is spread by mites, and leptospirosis, spread by infected animals. ""Right now in India, I don't think there are many people who are working on these kind of predictive maps,"" says Narayan. Globally, predictive diseases modelling is often used for high-focus diseases like Covid-19, but many neglected diseases which lack funding can fall under the radar of such tools. Bringing together experts in human, animal and environmental health is known as One Health, a framework recommended by the WHO as the best approach for tackling zoonotic diseases. The Monkey Fever Risk project is a model of how One Health collaboration can happen, says Purse. The modelling tool has also proven to be an important visual aid for local healthcare workers, says Narayan. ""For visualisation, this tool is wonderful,"" he says. ""[If] I show them this, they understand the dynamics of the disease very fast."" There are lessons to be learnt for the UK team, too – especially when it comes to tick-borne diseases, says Purse. ""Quite often we don't have good vaccines against tick-borne diseases, so it's really important to look across the different tick-borne diseases globally and understand what the risk factors are leading to spillovers,"" she says. ""We’re actually extending these approaches now into the UK, looking at Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis virus."" A KFD vaccine previously in use recently had its license revoked due to low efficacy, so understanding the risk factors for the disease is even more important. One element of the Monkey Fever Risk project has been to increase awareness of the dangers posed by ticks and help healthcare workers to push for behavioural changes. However, lack of economic opportunity means that locals often have little choice but to continue entering plantations and forests for work. ""I only know how to do this sort of work – I don't have any other skills,"" says Govindha, a 56-year-old plantation worker who fell into a week-long coma after contracting the disease. His wife, Laxmi, was also hospitalised. ""I thought we were both going to die,"" she remembers. ""I told my son to give our cows to someone else."" Despite their ordeal, the couple both returned to work in the plantation. After Suresh died, Gayatri, now the family's sole breadwinner, also felt that she had no choice but to return to her job collecting areca nuts inside the plantation. Still, she believes that better awareness of the disease is important; if she had taken Suresh to the hospital immediately, she says, he might still be alive. ""I hadn't heard of KFD before,"" she says. ""If I had known, I might have been able to act more quickly."" -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

economic indicators,Which countries deserve your money?,2024-09-15,2013-01-23,Lori Robertson,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20130122-which-countries-deserve-your-money,"The 2013 list of the World’s Best Ethical Destinations gives travellers guidance on where their dollar is most needed and best spent. Tourism has the power to bring
jobs and economic development to popular destinations, but how should travellers
decide where to spend their money? Are some countries more deserving of visitors’
dollars than others? That’s the idea behind the 10-destination list put
together by San Francisco-based non-profit Ethical Traveler, which, since 2006,
has published an annual guide to the World’s
Best Ethical Destinations in the developing
world.  “Instead of punishing countries for doing bad things,”
said Jeff Greenwald, executive director of Ethical Traveler, “we’re trying to
offer a carrot, rewarding countries in the developing world that are really
trying to do the right thing.”  
 
And travellers, who Greenwald describes as
“a vast and pretty much un-united political action group”, can also reward
ethical countries – or at least those improving and moving in the right
direction – by spending their time and money there. 
 
So which countries are the most ethical? For
2013, the
winners are Barbados, Cape Verde, Costa Rica, Ghana, Latvia, Lithuania,
Mauritius, Palau, Samoa and Uruguay. Those 10 countries scored highest in three
main areas: social welfare (measured by indicators such as child mortality
rates, economic freedom and crime rates); environmental protection (measured by
an academic index and share of protected areas); and human rights (which includes
press and political freedoms, as well as gay rights).  
 
Greenwald explained that countries must
have a good tourism infrastructure to make the list, but the non-profit also
uses the list to promote some under-visited places that can be a role model for
other countries in their region. For example, Latvia earned
high marks for improving
its environmental efforts and strong human rights record, and the country’s parks
and nature reserves make for a great off-the-beaten-path ecotourism trip. Gauja National Park,
with hiking, biking and canoeing, and the architecture-rich capital, Riga, are
a few of the Baltic country’s highlights.  In addition to just visiting these countries, travellers
should aim to spend their money in locally-owned businesses, Greenwald said, to
ensure their financial support stays in the country they’re visiting. However, that
requires a well-managed tourism infrastructure – something that countries with
poor track records in areas like child mortality and sanitation might not have.
While one could argue those places need the money even more, tourism can put a
strain on countries that face such challenges.  “They need help from other sources, and when tourism
is strong and can be an asset as opposed to a liability, then travellers can
visit,” Greenwald explained. 
 
Erica Avrami, research and education
director at the World Monuments Fund
(WMF) agreed that countries need to be properly
equipped so the influx of travellers does not overwhelm local communities or
heritage sites. WMF works to preserve cultural heritage sites that run the risk
of being damaged
by poorly managed tourism.  But while Avrami said that a
list of ethical destinations is “a wonderful idea”, the idea of being ethical
goes both ways. “There’s also a certain responsibility on the part of the
traveller to make sure their own footprint is as minimal as possible,” she said. Lori Robertson writes

economic indicators,Schools face widening gaps for poorer pupils,2024-09-15,2023-12-10,By Steve Duffy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67456134,"There are widening gaps between pupils from poorer backgrounds and their classmates from better off homes since the post-Covid return to school in Wales. Six key measures reveal the struggles to address this divide, which had been an issue already before the pandemic. Last week brought the worst set of maths, science and reading results for 15-year-olds in the global Pisa tests Here we look at this and other challenges. Whether a pupil is entitled to free school meals has been a long-standing measure of whether they come from a poorer economic background, based on the family being on low income or receiving benefits.  Around 95,000 pupils qualify for free school meals, about 20% of all pupils. All children missed months of classroom teaching during Covid and on key measures, the impact can be seen clearly, but there are worries this is even bigger on those from low income families. Here are the areas of concern: The number of permanent exclusions in 2022 was at a record high - more than 300 pupils. But the rate of permanent exclusions was more than five times higher for pupils entitled to free school meals than those who weren't eligible - 1.7 permanent exclusions per 1,000 pupils compared with 0.3.   These are still a rarity.  Fixed-term exclusions are more common - that's five days or less, with the top reasons abusing or threatening a teacher and assaulting a fellow pupil. There were nearly 28,000 such short-term exclusions in the last year. The exclusion rate for this is now nearly four times higher for those entitled to free school meals than those who are not. The gap had been growing in the two years before the pandemic but now it's the widest on record. This comes at a time when exclusions for all secondary pupils has risen by 35% since the year before Covid. School absenteeism - especially persistent absence - has got much worse since the pandemic. Pupils have been judged to be persistently absent if they miss 20% of class time. So that is 60 half-day sessions a year. But that threshold has now been changed to 10% - in a move designed to focus even more on improving attendance. Education Minister Jeremy Miles said in a recent article: ""Too many teachers tell me they are seeing challenging behaviour, worse attendance and lower levels of literacy and numeracy. We must not allow this to become the 'new normal'."" The figures we have for school absence are more up to date than the ones available for exclusions. The percentage of secondary school pupils who were persistently absent has tripled to 16.3% from 2018-19 - the last full academic year before Covid - and 2022-23. The figures also show that 35.6% of secondary school pupils eligible for free school meals were persistently absent in 2022-23, compared with 11.2% of those who did not qualify.  This is three times higher and an alarming widening of a gap which has now become a gulf. It gets wider as secondary school pupils get older too. The most recent figures so far this first term of the 2023-24 academic year - which includes primary school pupils - show 4.7% of students have met the persistent absence threshold of 10% of sessions missed, slightly down on the previous year. But 10% of those eligible for free school meals are persistently absent (on the 10% threshold), compared with 2.7% of pupils not eligible. The school inspection body Estyn said in its annual report: ""Work to improve attendance has not led to a marked increase in attendance, especially that of pupils eligible for free school meals.""  The attendance rate for the academic year to date has been higher for pupils not eligible for free school meals (93%) than pupils who are eligible for free school meals (86.4%). A widening gap can also be seen in terms of GCSE results. Let's look at two measures here. Firstly, the so-called ""Capped 9 indicator"". This looks at the grades in a pupil's top nine subjects, including literacy, numeracy and science. Points are awarded, with an average points score overall at 365.5. But the points gap between pupils sitting GCSEs who are eligible for free school meals and those who aren't has widened from 77.3 before the pandemic to 88.7 in 2022-23.  The gap is widest in science subjects and narrowest in literacy. Next, when it comes to GCSE grades, Qualifications Wales figures show of pupils eligible for free school meals, 8.3% of grades were the top A and A*, compared to 24.1% of those not eligible. The gap has widened from 14 points before the pandemic to 15.7 in 2023. For those not eligible for free school meals, 70% of the grades were C or above, compared to 41.6% of those who were eligible. That gap has also grown slightly since 2019. When we look at pupils assessed in key subjects at the end of key stage 3 - aged 14 - then the gap is at its widest for 10 years. Just over half (55%) of those eligible for free school meals achieved the core subject indicator - compared to 83% of those pupils not eligible. The gap had been narrowing for most of the years before the pandemic. The new Pisa report for Wales found that there was more academic ""resilience"" than the international average - with more pupils from the poorest backgrounds ranking in the top performers in the maths, science and reading tests. However, there were still gaps in performance between those from the poorer and richer socio-economic backgrounds. When looking at free school meal status, on average learners eligible performed significantly lower in the maths test (average score 423) than learners not eligible (471). Similar patterns were seen in reading (429 and 471) and science (430 for those eligible and 478 for those not eligible) Figures also show similar issues around attainment involving apprentices from poorer backgrounds. Recent figures have also looked at how more than 7,600 apprentices got on - and analysed this against their free school meal eligibility history for when they were in secondary school. The report says: ""Before the coronavirus pandemic, apprentices who had never been eligible for FSM had higher success rates than those who had been eligible, but the gap was narrowing.  ""In 2021-22, the gap increased to more than three times the difference in 2018-19."" The success rate fell post-Covid for all apprentices, but fell much more sharply for those who had been free school meal eligible. Finola Wilson, a former English and maths teacher and director of Caerphilly-based education improvement organisation, Impact, said Covid had further disadvantaged the most vulnerable in society.  ""Children who were already struggling to engage with and access school are now in a worse situation,"" she said.  ""Addressing the disadvantage gap is a societal problem. Each child's situation will be different and will need an individual response. The first target should be to make sure all pupils are receiving an education, whether in school or via alternative provision.  ""We also need to address the mental health crisis exacerbated by covid, which affects children and their parents and carers."""
economic indicators,Bull market for MBA grads,2024-09-15,2015-03-02,Andrew Eder,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20150227-bull-market-for-us-business-grads,"Times are good at the Wisconsin School of Business.   In a positive sign for its newly minted graduates, job postings so far in 2015 are up 36% from the year before. What’s more, the Madison, Wisconsin-based university hosted more than 300 companies during a career fair in December, where recruiters competed for top talent. The school’s master of business administration programme expects the best results in years in placing graduating students in full-time jobs. Other business schools are reporting similar upswings. Why so much optimism? A US economic recovery has boosted consumer confidence and company profits. That means corporations feel more comfortable about creating jobs and filling headcount left open during the economic downturn. Business students are now more hopeful about their employment prospects — and earning potential  — than at any time the past decade, business school executives say. “The bottom line is, as the economy gets stronger, corporate recruiting gets stronger,” said Steve Schroeder, assistant dean of the Bachelor of Business Administration programme at the Wisconsin School of Business. The US economy grew 2.4% in 2014, the best year-over-year growth since 2010, according to government figures. And, the Consumer Confidence Index, an indicator of optimism about the US economy, in January rose to 102.9 — its highest level since August, 2007. To be sure, not all industries are thriving, and some economists point to signs that the recovery may not be as robust as it appears. But business schools are nonetheless reporting a strong market for new graduates. Schroeder said the hiring of Wisconsin graduates is reaching pre-2008-recession levels. Better yet, he expects the momentum to continue in the coming years as companies scramble to fill gaps left by retiring baby boomers. “It’s going to be a (graduating) students’ market for the next 15-plus years,” Schroeder said. Job offers are flowing Barbara Hewitt, senior associate director of career services at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, said only 4.2% of last year’s graduating class of seniors were still seeking employment four to six months after graduation. That number was among the lowest she has seen in 20 years at the school, and she said 2015’s figure is likely to be similar. At Emory University’s Goizueta Business School, in Georgia, 72% of graduating seniors in 2015 already have job offers, said Pam Brown, senior director of the school’s career management centre. At the same time in 2014, the number was at 62%. The improvement was partly due to employers both starting their recruiting process earlier and extending offers earlier than they have in the past, Brown said. In addition, some Goizueta students received offers from high-profile employers such as investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc and e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc, which hadn’t previously recruited at the school. “I think companies are behind the eight ball, still catching up from layoffs and lower hiring years,” Brown said. US employers added 257,000 jobs in January, marking the 11th straight month that more than 200,000 jobs were created — the best such streak since 1994. The private sector has created 11.8 million jobs during a record 59 straight months of job growth, according to US government figures. Where the jobs are Demand is strong for newly minted MBAs. Nine in 10 companies that intend to hire MBA candidates said they will bring on as many, or even more people in 2015, than they did the year before, according to a 2014 survey of 169 employers conducted by the Graduate Management Admission Council. More than half planned to increase starting annual salaries. The positive outlook was driven by the fact that nearly two-thirds of the employers surveyed said their companies were growing. Students at the University of California’s Haas School of Business are feeling optimistic about their job prospects, said Julia Min Hwang, executive director of career management services and corporate engagement. Because the school is close to Silicon Valley, technology accounts for more than 40% of hiring. This year, Hwang said more students are looking at opportunities with startups. For Wisconsin graduates, the number of MBA positions in internal strategy, health care and technology are all growing, said Joe Protopapa, director of MBA career management. At Goizueta, jobs for graduates in technology, consulting and financial services are all seeing strong growth, said Wendy Tsung, associate dean for MBA career services. Health care, pharmaceuticals and energy are also expanding, she said. Companies are ramping up their recruiting efforts earlier to target MBA students, Tsung said. She said more companies are looking to retain former interns to fill full-time jobs — and companies that may not have hired interns in the past are building a programme to avoid missing out on potential hires. Some companies are launching programmes for incoming MBA students as a strategy to identify talented candidates before they even set foot on campus. One such company is accounting and professional services firm PwC. Ryan Rogers, PwC’s advisory MBA recruiting leader, said the company in 2014 launched a program in which they selected four students for a two-week internship prior to enrolling in their MBA programs. PwC this year aims to hire 20% more MBAs and 40% more undergraduates than last year, Rogers said, driven by growth in its advisory practice and the recent acquisition of the management consulting firm Strategy&. In order to compete with other hiring firms, the company is establishing its presence on campus earlier in the school year and aiming to move more quickly in its interviewing and hiring decisions. “It remains a very competitive marketplace,” Rogers said. “We’re seeing talent with opportunities in other industries. Students have a lot of options these days.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
economic indicators,Market madness: Mind your money,2024-09-15,2014-11-03,Vikram Barhat,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20140717-market-madness-mind-your-money,"A shaky global economy and jittery stock indices are making investors nervous these days. Having barely recovered from a sharp decline on 10 July amid concerns about the financial health of Portuguese lender Banco Espirito, the focus of world’s stock markets has now shifted to record high stock prices and economic weakness in North America, of which the US Federal Reserve warned on Tuesday and the Bank of Canada on Wednesday. Though this hasn’t triggered a sustained rout in global equities, money managers across the developed world are taking this opportunity to warn investors that markets in North America have been building toward an inevitable slump and that they should brace themselves for as much as a 20% plunge. A sharp decline of between 5% to 20% or more, called a “correction” in market parlance, would be completely normal given that it’s been nearly three years since the last major pullback, said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Canadian wealth management firm Gluskin Sheff and Associates Inc. “In terms of how big a correction, I would say between 5% and 10%,” he said adding that “in this historic period of ultra-low volatility, it will feel more like 20%.” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Harris Bank in Chicago has been predicting a similar downdraft in the US equity market. “A correction is entirely possible, certainly from a valuation perspective [for] the S&P is trading at about 25% above its median price-to-sales ratio” he argued. “A 10% correction isn't out of the question. All major equity markets could be susceptible to a correction.” An eye on global economies The view from Europe isn’t any better. Jason Hollands, managing director of business development and communications at Bestinvest Ltd brokerage in London has been urging caution for some months. “The US market looks particularly expensive,” Hollands said. “The extreme levels of money printing in recent years by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks, combined with ultra-low interest rates, has turbocharged markets and inflated asset prices.” Globally, central banks have embarked on a journey that will eventually result in more “normal” monetary policy. The Bank of England ended its own Quantitative Easing (asset purchase programme) in 2012, while the Fed has been scaling back its stimulus since the start of this year. As well, leaders of the world’s most important central banks, including Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, and Janet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve have been indicating interest rates could start to rise again soon. Higher interest rates could hurt many S&P 500 companies whose earnings growth in recent years has come, predominantly, from the ability to refinance debt very cheaply. Hollands said these are indications that “some steam coming out of the pressure cooker is a possibility.” He doesn’t see a stock market crash deeper than 10% but said “when a wild party comes to an end, it'll leave some with a hangover.” A set of triggers Triggers for a drastic market correction — such as an interest rate shock and steep stock prices in the US, overheated housing market in Canada, geopolitical events in the Middle East and Ukraine, economic slowdown in emerging markets, and fears of recession in Europe — are all there, yet market volatility (a measure of how widely prices swing) has been eerily low, said Hollands. “This feels like there’s too much complacency,” he said. “You could think of it as the calm before the storm.” Increased interconnectedness within key global markets means that the meltdown will likely spill over into other regions, regardless of where it begins. “There's a saying that when America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold,” said Hollands. “Were the US market to experience a slide, you might see contagion to other exchanges.” Similarly, the Greek debt crisis and fears of hard landing in China in the recent past showed that a macroeconomic event can have a knock-on effect on financial markets far from its epicenter. “All major equity markets could be susceptible to a correction,” said Ablin but asserted that “US small caps appear to be among the most precariously positioned markets now, due to their high valuations.” Small capitalisation stocks are companies that have revenue of more than $300m but less than $2bn. These companies, said Rosenberg, have been selling for 20 times their earnings versus the historic average of 15 times. Large-cap stocks, companies that are larger than $10bn, have been selling for 15.5 times their earnings relative to the long run average of 13.5 times, he added. At biggest risk When US investors panic, they have a tendency to sell the assets they hold overseas and bring their cash home. That means that emerging markets, including Mexico, Turkey and Indonesia, are often the first casualty. Currently, emerging markets appear calm, but Hollands said trouble could be brewing underneath the surface. “The big risk remains in China,” said Hollands. “Its economic growth rate is slowing, but it has only scratched the surface so far in terms of its need to rebalance its economy away from construction and infrastructure investment and towards the consumer.” Yet in India, the other key member of the economic bloc, positive macroeconomic data and political developments have kept the market buoyed. Bengaluru, India-based Kunal Kumar Kundu, vice president and India economist at French financial firm Societe Generale doesn’t foresee a meaningful decline in India. “The Indian equity market is close to be fairly valued and offers a compelling story supported by relatively high growth and a strong government,” he said. “[India’s new] government is expected to usher in some much-desired reform measures. Within the emerging markets space, India looks a safe bet.” But things can change pretty quickly in emerging markets. Rosenberg said markets that bear the brunt during turbulent times are generally those that are the riskiest and have the highest beta — a measure of a stock’s risk relative to the overall market. “I would expect emerging markets to suffer the most in a downdraft,” he added. Andrew Hamlin, vice president and portfolio manager at Aston Hill Asset Management Inc in Toronto said if history repeats itself, a sell-off could be closer than we think. “Summer months are traditionally slower months for the equity market and August is usually a dreadful month for investors,” he said. “Equity markets in the last three of four years in August have been down months with the smallest down being about 3%. We’re heading into that so there could very well be a sell-off in the market.” If the correction is sparked by a rate shock or an economic setback, “the sectors most vulnerable would likely be financials, homebuilders, utilities and capital goods,” Rosenberg said. Ablin said when equity markets tumble, the momentum sectors — lead by technology and consumer discretionaries — could suffer more than others due to a colossal bubble in asset prices. What should investors do? It’s time for investors to rebalance their portfolios not just to weather the storm by taking some risk off the table, but also to strategically ramp up or down certain weightings, said Hamlin. Now, he asserted, is a prime time for investors to take a good look at their holdings. “If you’ve got some big winners in your portfolio, take some gains by selling them,” he urged. “Don’t be afraid to build a war chest of cash, so when a correction does occur you’re able to buy back your favourite names at cheaper prices.” Investors should take time to build a shopping list of stocks or bonds they want to own when they get cheaper as a result of market spasms, he added. As for stock selection, Rosenberg said to focus on high-quality companies with earnings visibility. “We are moving through an era of deflation to reflation to inflation, so I would be hedged by having exposure to energy, gold and basic materials in general,” he said. When markets fall, investors tend to flee to larger, dividend-generating companies with robust balance sheets. “These are safe-haven blue-chip stocks such as utility companies and tobacco firms,” Hollands said.  This story was produced under the BBC's guidelines for financial journalism.

economic indicators,An implausible UK tourist attraction,2024-09-15,2023-01-18,Shafik Meghji,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20230117-canvey-wick-the-uks-implausible-tourist-attraction,"Located just 30 miles east of London, an abandoned oil refinery on the edge of the Thames Estuary has become an unlikely wildlife haven. The 6km journey from Benfleet railway station took me across a creek and along a busy main road into the town of Canvey Island, an expanse of low-lying, reclaimed land separated from the rest of Essex by a network of waterways and protected from tidal flooding by a serpentine seawall. The fields soon disappeared from view, replaced by a semi-industrial sprawl dotted with retail parks, warehouses, factories and huge fuel storage tanks.   A few vehicles turned off at the local golf course, the rest pulled into a large supermarket. Other than a learner driver practising an emergency stop on a quiet stretch, no one else continued onto Northwick Road, where an empty car park with a blink-and-you-miss-it sign and a metal sculpture of an insect were the only indicators I'd reached a biological hotspot.   Spanning some 93ha of meadows, grassland and scrub on the shores of Holehaven Creek, Canvey Wick has ""as many species per square metre... as there are in a rainforest,"" according to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which manages the site in partnership with conservation charity Buglife on behalf of the Land Trust, which looks after public open spaces for the benefit of local communities. It's also one of the most significant areas in the UK for invertebrates – a category that includes insects, arachnids and molluscs, among others – with more than 1,500 species, 30 of which are on the UK's endangered ""red list"". They include the evocatively named shrill carder bee, the five-banded weevil wasp and the scarce emerald damselfly.   As I followed a trail into the 18.5ha Canvey Wick Nature Reserve, the drone of traffic was slowly replaced by rustling leaves and the sound of birdsong. Apart from the occasional dog walker, there was no one else around, and while many of the wildflowers had largely disappeared for the year along with the insects that depend on them, autumn gave the area a stark, eerie beauty. Although I was just 30 miles from central London, it felt like a wilderness.   ""Canvey Wick is a hugely important place,"" said Jamie Robbins, Buglife's programmes manager. ""It's more than just invertebrates. We've got loads of rare flowering plants like orchids. There are birds like nightingales and whitethroats, and it's a real hotspot for reptiles such as common lizards, slow worms and adders.""   The origins of Canvey Wick's abundance of wildlife lie, unexpectedly, in the geopolitical turmoil of the Middle East of the 1970s. Originally a grazing marsh, the site sits on the south-west edge of Canvey Island, which was sparsely populated by sheep farmers, salt harvesters, fishers and shellfish cultivators for some 2,000 years. At the turn of the 20th Century, the island was home to just a few hundred people, but over the following decades the population surged as it became a fashionable seaside resort – until low-cost package holidays in Europe brought the good times to an end – as well as a centre for the petrochemical industry. Canvey Wick, though, remained untouched until 1970, when Occidental Petroleum controversially secured permission to build a six-million-tonne oil refinery, storage depot and deep-water jetty on the site. The US firm ploughed £55m into Canvey Wick, covering it with a 2-3m layer of silt, sand, gravel and shell fragments dredged from the River Thames to help prepare for the development.   Yet work ground to a halt just a few years later thanks to the first ""energy crisis"" – when Middle Eastern countries slashed oil production in response to US support for Israel during the Yom Kippur War, triggering a global economic crisis – which made the project unviable. Canvey Wick was, essentially, abandoned to nature.   In the mid-1990s, many of the refinery's larger structures were eventually demolished, but plans to build housing, a business park and retail developments on the site came to nothing, thanks to campaigns by the local community. This inaction provided the space for a remarkable transformation. The dredged material was partially contaminated and created free-draining conditions, said Robbins, keeping the site largely open and stopping trees and dominant vegetation from establishing. ""You end up having this lovely mosaic of bare ground and flowery stuff, which invertebrates love. Canvey Wick has the kind of habitats that have been lost in the wider landscape as Essex has become more agricultural, industrial and full of housing estates. It's the last refuge for a lot of rare species."" Canvey Wick was named a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 2005, with Dr Chris Gibson, an officer for government advisory body Natural England, memorably describing it as a ""brownfield rainforest"" (a brownfield site is land that was previously used for industrial purposes). The designation protected the site – which was subsequently taken on by the Land Trust – from future developments. After a period of habitat restoration work, the nature reserve opened to the public in 2014. Since then, engaging the local community has been a vital part of the project. According to Marc Outten, the RSPB's site manager for Canvey Wick: ""It's about making it accessible. Canvey Wick lends itself to journeys of discovery and exploration.""   Jo Loman, Buglife's community warden for Canvey Wick, plays a key role in this process, organising a wide range of activities, including school holiday events, conservation programmes for young people and guided walks. She also works with the National Health Service on ""social prescribing"", an approach that see doctors refer patients to non-clinical services to support their health and wellbeing. ""My job is to get the whole [community] to understand that Canvey Wick is there, that it's a unique place and that they should be really proud to have it on their doorstep,"" she said. ""I'm a big believer in education by stealth – doing fun activities, but people learn stuff while they're there.""   Visitors from further afield are also finding their way to Canvey Wick, thanks to the July 2022 launch of a new 85-mile stretch of the England Coast Path, which passes by the site. ""People have certain perceptions of what Essex is about, but I think opening up this path will really help to raise awareness of what the county has to offer,"" said Lisa Bone, tourism and place marketing manager at Visit Essex. ""[Canvey Wick] is a very special place in a very unusual setting. It's a great asset for an area that needs a tourism boost."" Stumbling across the remnants of the refinery today feels like discovering the ruins of a lost city. I walked along roads that led nowhere, greenery lapping at their edges like an incoming tide. There were rows of decapitated streetlights, and the last of the summer wildflowers burst out of giant concrete cylinders at erratic angles. Meanwhile, the rusting niches of the biggest surviving structure, the deep-water jetty that marches out into the creek, provided nesting spots for birds.   It was a vivid illustration of the dramatic change that can take place in semi-urban, post-industrial sites in a relatively short period of time, as well as the vital role these under-appreciated areas can play in tackling the biodiversity and climate crises. This value isn't always recognised: Buglife is currently campaigning against a plan to build a theme park on Swanscombe Peninsula, a similar post-industrial urban wilderness on the Kent side of the Thames Estuary. ""Open, flower-rich grasslands are really important for biodiversity,"" said Robbins. ""When we think about [storing] carbon, a lot of people's brains go straight to trees, but well-managed grasslands and wildflower [landscapes] can store, in some scenarios, even more carbon than trees. Brownfield sites like Canvey Wick often get a bad name but they have a huge amount to contribute."" The climate emergency felt close at hand on Canvey Island. After exploring the nature reserve, I followed the towering seawall south to the Lobster Smack, a 17th-Century pub that features in Charles Dickens' Great Expectations and was once renowned for smuggling and bare-knuckle boxing. Running along the south coast, the concrete barrier is a reminder that Canvey Island has always been threatened by the sea: 58 people were killed in a devastating flood in 1953. The current defences may look formidable but will not protect the island as sea levels continue to rise due to climate change. A government project is set to renew and improve the seawall so that it remains effective until 2070.   The vulnerability of the island underscores the importance of sites such as Canvey Wick. ""Here we want to create an appreciation of the links between nature and our ability to survive on the planet and between biodiversity loss and climate change,"" said Outten. ""[The trick is to] get people interested in nature first – once they're interested, they'll want to protect it."" ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us onFacebook, or follow us onTwitter andInstagram.

economic indicators,Shoppers swap clothes for drink as retail sales sink,2024-09-15,2020-04-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52408885,"UK retail sales fell a record 5.1% in March as many stores shut up shop in the face of the coronavirus lockdown. The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the steepest sales fall since it started collecting the data in 1996. Food and online shopping rose, and alcohol sales also jumped. But clothes sales tumbled by 34%. Online shopping as a proportion of all retail reached a record high of 22%, the ONS said. ""Retailers are in crisis mode as the impact of Covid-19 has obliterated sales to new record-lows,"" said Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics. Off-licences, which were added to the government's list of essential UK retailers last month, saw sales rise 31.4% in volume terms, although with most drinkers buying from supermarkets, they only contribute less than 1% of alcohol sales.  The data comes amid dire estimates for the performance of the UK economy amid the lockdown. Yesterday, one of the Bank of England's top policymakers warned that the UK faces its worst economic shock in several hundred years. Jan Vlieghe, a member of the BoE's interest-rate setting committee, said that ""early indicators"" suggest the UK was ""experiencing an economic contraction that is faster and deeper than anything we have seen in the past century, or possibly several centuries"". He did, though, say there was ""in principle"" a good chance that the UK would return to its ""pre-virus trajectory once the pandemic is over"". But for many shops, it is too late. In the year to date, Oasis, Warehouse, Debenhams, Laura Ashley and Cath Kidston have collapsed, and while some shops will be salvaged, many will be gone for good. Excluding fuel, sales dropped 3.7% compared with February, a record for retail data collection going back to 1988.  Food sales rose a record 11% as households stocked up and restaurants closed. For industries like retail, customer behaviour may never be the same.  ""We don't expect the pattern of post-lockdown spending to be exactly the same as before, with our latest survey indicating that consumers intend to reward more responsible retailers,""said Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at accountants PwC. ""Particularly those who looked after their staff, and shop more on their local high streets and with smaller or independent retailers, giving some more hope to many of the hardest-hit operators."" "
economic indicators,Uighurs 'detained for beards and veils' - leak,2024-09-15,2020-02-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51520622,"A document that appears to give the most powerful insight yet into how China determined the fate of hundreds of thousands of Muslims held in a network of internment camps has been seen by the BBC. Listing the personal details of more than 3,000 individuals from the far western region of Xinjiang, it sets out in intricate detail the most intimate aspects of their daily lives. The painstaking records - made up of 137 pages of columns and rows - include how often people pray, how they dress, whom they contact and how their family members behave. China denies any wrongdoing, saying it is combating terrorism and religious extremism. The document is said to have come, at considerable personal risk, from the same source inside Xinjiang that leaked a batch of highly sensitive material published last year. One of the world's leading experts on China's policies in Xinjiang, Dr Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, believes the latest leak is genuine. ""This remarkable document presents the strongest evidence I've seen to date that Beijing is actively persecuting and punishing normal practices of traditional religious beliefs,"" he says. One of the camps mentioned in it, the ""Number Four Training Centre"" has been identified by Dr Zenz as among those visited by the BBC as part of a tour organised by the Chinese authorities in May last year. Much of the evidence uncovered by the BBC team appears to be corroborated by the new document, redacted for publication to protect the privacy of those included in it. It contains details of the investigations into 311 main individuals, listing their backgrounds, religious habits, and relationships with many hundreds of relatives, neighbours and friends. Verdicts written in a final column decide whether those already in internment should remain or be released, and whether some of those previously released need to return. It is evidence that appears to directly contradict China's claim that the camps are merely schools. In an article analysing and verifying the document, Dr Zenz argues that it also offers a far deeper understanding of the real purpose of the system. It allows a glimpse inside the minds of those making the decisions, he says, laying bare the ""ideological and administrative micromechanics"" of the camps. Row 598 contains the case of a 38-year-old woman with the first name Helchem, sent to a re-education camp for one main reason: she was known to have worn a veil some years ago. It is just one of a number of cases of arbitrary, retrospective punishment. Others were interned simply for applying for a passport - proof that even the intention to travel abroad is now seen as a sign of radicalisation in Xinjiang. In row 66, a 34-year-old man with the first name Memettohti was interned for precisely this reason, despite being described as posing ""no practical risk"". And then there's the 28-year-old man Nurmemet in row 239, put into re-education for ""clicking on a web-link and unintentionally landing on a foreign website"". Again, his case notes describe no other issues with his behaviour. The 311 main individuals listed are all from Karakax County, close to the city of Hotan in southern Xinjiang, an area where more than 90% of the population is Uighur. Predominantly Muslim, the Uighurs are closer in appearance, language and culture to the peoples of Central Asia than to China's majority ethnicity, the Han Chinese. In recent decades the influx of millions of Han settlers into Xinjiang has led to rising ethnic tensions and a growing sense of economic exclusion among Uighurs. Those grievances have sometimes found expression in sporadic outbreaks of violence, fuelling a cycle of increasingly harsh security responses from Beijing.  It is for this reason that the Uighurs have become the target - along with Xinjiang's other Muslim minorities, like the Kazakhs and Kyrgyz - of the campaign of internment. The ""Karakax List"", as Dr Zenz calls the document, encapsulates the way the Chinese state now views almost any expression of religious belief as a signal of disloyalty. To root out that perceived disloyalty, he says, the state has had to find ways to penetrate deep into Uighur homes and hearts. In early 2017, when the internment campaign began in earnest, groups of loyal Communist Party workers, known as ""village-based work teams"", began to rake through Uighur society with a massive dragnet. With each member assigned a number of households, they visited, befriended and took detailed notes about the ""religious atmosphere"" in the homes; for example, how many Korans they had or whether religious rites were observed. The Karakax List appears to be the most substantial evidence of the way this detailed information gathering has been used to sweep people into the camps. It reveals, for example, how China has used the concept of ""guilt by association"" to incriminate and detain whole extended family networks in Xinjiang. For every main individual, the 11th column of the spreadsheet is used to record their family relationships and their social circle. Alongside each relative or friend listed is a note of their own background; how often they pray, whether they've been interned, whether they've been abroad. In fact, the title of the document makes clear that the main individuals listed all have a relative currently living overseas - a category long seen as a key indicator of potential disloyalty, leading to almost certain internment. Rows 179, 315 and 345 contain a series of assessments for a 65-year-old man, Yusup. His record shows two daughters who ""wore veils and burkas in 2014 and 2015"", a son with Islamic political leanings and a family that displays ""obvious anti-Han sentiment"". His verdict is ""continued training"" - one of a number of examples of someone interned not just for their own actions and beliefs, but for those of their family. The information collected by the village teams is also fed into Xinjiang's big data system, called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP). The IJOP contains the region's surveillance and policing records, culled from a vast network of cameras and the intrusive mobile spyware every citizen is forced to download. The IJOP, Dr Zenz suggests, can in turn use its AI brain to cross-reference these layers of data and send ""push notifications"" to the village teams to investigate a particular individual. The man found ""unintentionally landing on a foreign website"" may well have been interned thanks to the IJOP. In many cases though, there is little need for advanced technology, with the vast and vague catch-all term ""untrustworthy"" appearing multiple times in the document. It is listed as the sole reason for the internment of a total of 88 individuals. The concept, Dr Zenz argues, is proof that the system is designed not for those who have committed a crime, but for an entire demographic viewed as potentially suspicious.  China  says Xinjiang has policies that ""respect and ensure people's freedom of religious belief"". It also insists that what it calls a ""vocational training programme in Xinjiang"" is ""for the purposes of combating terrorism and religious extremism"", adding only people who have been convicted of crimes involving terrorism or religious extremism are being ""educated"" in these centres. However, many of the cases in the Karakax List give multiple reasons for internment; various combinations of religion, passport, family, contacts overseas or simply being untrustworthy. The most frequently listed is for violating China's strict family planning laws. In the eyes of the Chinese authorities it seems, having too many children is the clearest sign that Uighurs put their loyalty to culture and tradition above obedience to the secular state. China has long defended its actions in Xinjiang as part of an urgent response to the threat of extremism and terrorism. The Karakax List does contain some references to those kinds of crimes, with at least six entries for preparing, practicing or instigating terrorism and two cases of watching illegal videos. But the broader focus of those compiling the document appears to be faith itself, with more than 100 entries describing the ""religious atmosphere"" at home. The Karakax List has no stamps or other authenticating marks so, at face value, it is difficult to verify. It is thought to have been passed out of Xinjiang sometime before late June last year, along with a number of other sensitive papers. They ended up in the hands of an anonymous Uighur exile who passed all of them on, except for this one document. Only after the first batch was published last year was the Karakax List then forwarded to his conduit, another Uighur living in Amsterdam, Asiye Abdulaheb. She told the BBC that she is certain it is genuine. ""Regardless of whether there are official stamps on the document or not, this is information about real, live people,"" she says. ""It is private information about people that wouldn't be made public. So there is no way for the Chinese government to claim it is fake."" Like all Uighurs living overseas, Ms Abdulaheb lost contact with her family in Xinjiang when the internment campaign began, and she's been unable to contact them since. But she says she had no choice but to release the document, passing it to a group of international media organisations, including the BBC. ""Of course I am worried about the safety of my relatives and friends,"" she says. ""But if everyone keeps silent because they want to protect themselves and their families, then we will never prevent these crimes being committed."" At the end of last year China announced that everyone in its ""vocational training centres"" had now ""graduated"". However, it also suggested some may stay open for new students on the basis of their ""free will"". Almost 90% of the 311 main individuals in the Karakax List are shown as having already been released or as being due for release on completion of a full year in the camps. But Dr Zenz points out that the re-education camps are just one part of a bigger system of internment, much of which remains hidden from the outside world. More than two dozen individuals are listed as ""recommended"" for release into ""industrial park employment"" - career ""advice"" that they may have little choice but to obey. There are well documented concerns that China is now building a system of coerced labour as the next phase of its plan to align Uighur life with its own vision of a modern society.  In two cases, the re-education ends in the detainees being sent to ""strike hard detention"", a reminder that the formal prison system has been cranked into overdrive in recent years. Many of the family relationships listed in the document show long prison terms for parents or siblings, sometimes for entirely normal religious observances and practices. One man's father is shown to have been sentenced to five years for ""having a double-coloured thick beard and organising a religious studies group"". A neighbour is reported to have been given 15 years for ""online contact with people overseas"", and another man's younger brother given 10 years for ""storing treasonable pictures on his phone"". Whether or not China has closed its re-education camps in Xinjiang, Dr Zenz says the Karakax List tells us something important about the psychology of a system that prevails. ""It reveals the witch-hunt-like mindset that has been and continues to dominate social life in the region,"" he said."
economic indicators,Putin confirms first nuclear weapons moved to Belarus,2024-09-15,2023-06-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65932700,"Russia has already stationed a first batch of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Vladimir Putin says. Russia's president told a forum they would only be used if Russia's territory or state was threatened. The US government says there is no indication the Kremlin plans to use nuclear weapons to attack Ukraine. ""We don't see any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said after Mr Putin's comments. Belarus is a key Russian ally and served as a launchpad for Mr Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year. Mr Putin said transferring the tactical nuclear warheads would be completed by the end of the summer.  Answering questions after a speech at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, Russia's president said the move was about ""containment"" and to remind anyone ""thinking of inflicting a strategic defeat on us"". When asked by the forum's moderator about the possibility of using those weapons, he replied: ""Why should we threaten the whole world? I have already said that the use of extreme measures is possible in case there is a danger to Russian statehood."" Tactical nuclear weapons are small nuclear warheads and delivery systems intended for use on the battlefield, or for a limited strike. They are designed to destroy enemy targets in a specific area without causing widespread radioactive fallout. The smallest tactical nuclear weapons can be one kiloton or less (producing the equivalent to a thousand tonnes of the explosive TNT). The largest ones can be as big as 100 kilotons. By comparison, the atomic bomb the US dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 was 15 kilotons. The Russian leader is meeting African leaders in St Petersburg after they visited Kyiv on Friday as part of a peace initiative they are presenting to both countries. However while they were in the city it came under Russian missile attack.  Mr Putin is also expected to hold a separate meeting with the South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa.  In Kyiv, Mr Ramaphosa called for de-escalation on both sides and negotiations for peace. ""We came here to listen and recognise what the people of Ukraine have gone through,"" he said. But Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said instead of making diplomatic overtures to Russia it should be frozen out diplomatically to send a message that the international community condemned its invasion. Kyiv would not enter negotiations with Moscow while it still occupied Ukrainian territory, Mr Zelensky said. Mr Putin also repeated his claim that Ukraine stood no chance of succeeding in its ongoing counter-offensive. The Ukrainian military was also running out of its own military equipment and would soon only be using Western-donated equipment, he said. ""You can't fight for long like that,"" he said, warning that any F16 US fighter jets given to Ukraine ""will burn, no doubt about it"". Ukraine has previously dismissed similar remarks, asserting they are making progress in recapturing territory in both eastern and southern Ukraine.  The BBC cannot independently verify battlefield claims. The Russian leader also addressed economic themes, claiming that Western sanctions on Russia had failed to isolate it and instead led to an expansion in its trade with ""the markets of the future"". He praised new deals with countries in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America - calling them ""reliable, responsible partners""."
economic indicators,What to expect from Biden's big speech,2024-09-15,2023-02-06,By Anthony Zurcher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64377363,"Joe Biden's State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday comes at a pivotal time in his presidency.  By most indications, he is poised to announce a bid for re-election next year, and the speech provides a high-profile platform from which he can make his case to the American people, the media and key figures within the Democratic Party. Before the president gets to that, however, he will be under intense pressure to address the issue that has been hovering over his administration since Friday. The Chinese spy balloon, and the US reaction to it, has dominated headlines, captivated the attention of the American public and prompted sharp criticism of the Biden administration from Republicans. With the Republican-controlled House of Representatives considering holding a vote of disapproval for how the president handled the balloon incursion - on the day of the speech no less - and aggressive hearings into the situation already being planned, Mr Biden will be expected to offer the reasoning behind his decision to shoot the vessel down only after it had traversed the US.  And all eyes will be on how Congress reacts.  While Mr Biden and his advisers may have a strategy devised for how they want to craft his re-election bid, a foreign crisis with China, which could have significant economic and military consequences, could derail even the best-laid plans. His speech is likely to dwell extensively on accomplishments in the first two years of his presidency, when his party controlled both chambers of Congress and was able to pass a variety of substantive legislation.  Those achievements included a $1.9tn (£1.5tn) coronavirus relief package that featured a programme that halved the US child poverty rate and $1tn in climate and healthcare legislation. He is also sure to tout bipartisan legislative achievements on gun control, infrastructure spending and technology investment. The president will make the case that the economy is improving under his watch, citing the latest job-growth figures and inflation and energy numbers that have been tapering off from high levels not seen since the early 1980s. When he's done patting himself on the back, however, Mr Biden will have to cast his eyes forward and make the case for what he hopes to accomplish in the remainder of his first term and what he could offer if he does seek four more years in office after that.  Successful political campaigns, as the established wisdom goes, are about the future, not the past. To that end, Mr Biden is planning on making the phrase ""finish the job"" a recurring theme during his speech. It's a call for Congress to do more, but it also gives the president the opportunity to declare some measure of victory if he successfully implements the programmes launched by the Democratic Congress over the past two years. With the recent spate of mass shootings, Mr Biden may talk about new gun control legislation, including the kind of ban on assault weapons he helped enact as a senator in the 1990s. He may also call for federal law protecting abortion rights, an issue that helped turn out Democratic voters in last year's midterm elections.  Government-supported childcare and pre-kindergarten education are also long-desired but yet-to-be tackled components of the Democratic agenda. And, in the wake of the death of Tyre Nichols at the hands of Memphis police, he might endorse renewed efforts to enact federal policing reform. Mr Biden could also address issues of perceived weakness during his presidency, including rising crime rates in US cities, the rise in undocumented migrants crossing the US-Mexico border and an attempt to forgive some student-loan debt that has faced multiple lawsuits.  While US-China relations are sure to dominate any foreign policy portion of Mr Biden's address, he is also certain to discuss the need for continued American military aid to Ukraine and the effect the tens of billions in aid already approved has had in turning back the Russian invasion. Whatever Biden proposes on any of these issues will crash headfirst into the reality of Republican control of the House of Representatives. Although the conservative margin in that chamber is narrow, it is enough to ensure that none of Mr Biden's ideas will pass, or even receive an up-or-down vote, without tacit Republican approval. While there is always the possibility of bipartisan agreement - and Mr Biden will do his best to present himself as a voice of reason and co-operation - the coming year is more likely to centre on acrimonious fights over avoiding a US default on its national debt this summer and passing legislation that will fund the US government in the autumn.  Mr Biden may use his address on Tuesday night as a means to gain the upper hand in negotiations that are only just beginning. The president's speech could provide a blueprint for how he will handle these fraught confrontations with Republicans and address the growing US-China rift. It will also shed light on the terrain upon which he may want to build his re-election campaign, including which issues to prioritise and which accomplishments to trumpet the loudest. While the delivery of a State of the Union address is always scrutinised, the style of Mr Biden's speech will be almost as important as the substance.  The 80-year-old politician is already the oldest president in US history. If he wins re-election, his second term will expire after he turns 86. Questions about Mr Biden's competence will be unavoidable in the days ahead, and high-profile speeches like this are an opportunity to silence critics - or give them more ammunition. Although public opinion surveys 21 months removed from an election are of limited value, the latest numbers show that if Mr Biden takes the plunge he is in for a closely contested campaign, with Republicans - including his former adversary Donald Trump - more than capable of wresting the White House from his grasp. His overall approval has improved but is still net-negative. Polling indicates that Democrats would be more resigned to a Biden re-election campaign than energised by it. Following his address, the president will travel to Wisconsin and Florida - states that are traditional presidential-election battlegrounds and the latter being the home of two possible Republican presidential opponents. Although 21 months may seem like a long time, and the timing of an official campaign announcement has not even been hinted at, Tuesday night's speech is a prominent waypoint on Mr Biden's road to re-election."
economic indicators,What does 'backstop to the backstop' mean?,2024-09-15,2018-10-15,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-45863618,"The Irish border backstop has emerged as the major sticking point in the Brexit negotiations. Now a new phrase has emerged: ""the backstop to the backstop"". First, a reminder of the big picture: The UK and the EU both want to avoid a ""hard border"" - physical checks or infrastructure between Northern Ireland and Ireland. Both would prefer to solve the border issue through an overarching economic and security deal. However the UK's current red lines, which include leaving the customs union and the single market, make that very difficult. The backstop solution is a safety net - an arrangement that will apply to the Irish border if a wider deal or technological solution cannot keep it as frictionless as it is today. The UK government has so far proposed a backstop which would effectively keep the whole of the UK in the EU customs union for a limited period. The key word here is ""limited"" - Brexit supporters do not want to be indefinitely locked into the EU customs system. The EU has proposed a backstop that would mean Northern Ireland staying in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system. Its chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has continually emphasised that this backstop can only apply to Northern Ireland. He said he wanted to ""de-dramatise"" the issue and suggested that inspections of goods did not necessarily have to take place at Irish sea ports or airports. ""We are clarifying which goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when and by whom these checks could be performed,"" he added. There are indications that the EU has been coming round to a backstop which would involve an all UK customs arrangement. But the EU is adamant that there cannot be a time limit - any backstop must apply ""unless and until"" it is no longer needed. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar has also said that the backstop cannot have a time limit. So if a proposal for a time-limited, all-UK backstop formed part of an agreement there would also need to be something in place in case the issue was not sorted out by the time limit. That ""something"" is the original EU backstop proposal which would apply only to Northern Ireland. A backstop to a backstop."
economic indicators,The Taliban's broken promises,2024-09-15,2022-08-14,By Shruti Menon,https://www.bbc.com/news/62469204,"Two years ago, the Taliban swept into the Afghan capital, Kabul, as foreign forces hastily completed their withdrawal. On taking power, the new administration made a series of pledges on women's rights to education, the economy and on tackling drug production. How far have they lived up to these promises? This was Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, in August 2021.  Since then a wide range of strict measures have been re-imposed on women in Afghanistan.  In December last year, women were banned from attending university. This followed an existing ban on education for girls beyond the sixth grade (11 to 12-year-olds) imposed soon after the Taliban came to power. According to the UN, around 80% of girls and young women of school age are not in education. The Taliban have also banned women from working in all non-governmental organisations, as well as for the UN, and ordered the closure of beauty salons across the country.  Women's participation in the labour force has dropped by 25% between August 2021 and March 2023, according to the International Labour Organization.  Amnesty International and the International Commission for Jurists have said that the restrictions on women imposed in Afghanistan could constitute gender persecution under the International Criminal Court.  This was another pledge made by spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, soon after the Taliban took control two years ago. Opium is used to make heroin - and Afghanistan has been, by far, the world's largest source of opium for many years. In April 2022, the Taliban announced a ban on the growing of opium poppies - but without setting a deadline. A BBC investigation in June this year found there had been a significant drop in cultivation in Helmand, Nangarhar and Kandahar provinces. In Helmand province, which previously accounted for as much as half of all poppy production, there has been a reduction in the cultivated area from 129,000 hectares in 2022 to 740 hectares in April 2023, according to satellite imagery from UK-based analysts, Alcis. Cultivation has also been significantly cut in Nangarhar - from 7,000 hectares in 2022 to just 865 hectares in 2023.  However, in more remote parts of the country, satellite imagery has revealed continued production. Taliban plans for economic growth - expressed here in 2021 by Zabihullah Mujahid - have not been borne out in practice. The suspension of most international aid and the freezing of access to Afghanistan's foreign exchange reserves have had serious economic consequences.  In June last year, the UN Security Council estimated that the Afghan economy had contracted by 30%-40% since the Taliban takeover. Despite some limited improvement in economic indicators since then, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) says ""overall, Afghanistan's economic outlook remains very difficult"".  ""This will be particularly so,"" it adds, ""if the recent restrictions on women's employment in NGOs lead to a significant drop in international aid, exacerbating pressures on the exchange rate and inflation.""  The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has recorded a significant fall in violence against civilians since the peak of the conflict in 2016. However, attacks on former Afghan government and security officials, prisoners, women and journalists have continued. According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled), civilians have been targeted by both the Taliban and rebel groups which oppose them such as the National Resistance Front (NRF), the largest armed anti-Taliban group.  ""Attacks on civilians have often taken place in the context of Taliban raids on villages in search of NRF fighters. Civilians accused of supporting the NRF are frequently detained, tortured or killed,"" Acled notes in its latest report.  Women have also been the targets of assaults as more restrictions are placed their ability to work, acquire education and move freely in public spaces.  A UN survey conducted earlier this year said that 68% women felt their safety was ""very bad"" or ""bad""."
economic indicators,Will the US target Venezuelan oil?,2024-09-15,2019-01-27,By Daniel Gallas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47023002,"In its battle against the rule of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, the United States has been trying to cripple the government's ability to secure funds and run the country - with sanctions that target officials, some sectors of the economy and its official cryptocurrency. But so far it has not yet used what many call ""the nuclear option"" - a full oil embargo, targeting the industry that is responsible for 90% of the government's revenues. Despite the rhetoric between Nicolás Maduro and President Donald Trump, refineries in the US are still buying Venezuelan petroleum. Venezuela's state company PDVSA even owns refineries in Texas through a subsidiary called CITGO. But with the crisis escalating after Washington backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó's claim to the presidency last week, a new round of sanctions is expected in the coming days. On Saturday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo failed to secure backing from the United Nations Security Council against Venezuela, as China and Russia are close Maduro allies. President Maduro backed down from his demand that US diplomats leave the country and said both countries now have a 30-day window to negotiate the new terms of their relationship. Markets are watching now for what the US will do next. Despite its failure in the Security Council, the Trump administration has support from big regional players such as Brazil, Argentina and Colombia. If it does finally move against Venezuelan oil, could that be the nail in the coffin of the country's oil industry, which has been in a crisis of its own for years? And what effect could that have for the rest of the world? A boom in US shale production has helped slash crude prices over the past four years, although they have recovered slightly. But 2019 is shaping up to be a very challenging year for the commodity, and there is no clear indication on which way prices will move. Oil is never a predictable affair, however, and there are many situations that could cause prices to spike. Production is very volatile in Nigeria and Libya. Iran is under a heavy US embargo. Russia and Saudi Arabia are cutting production. Finally there are fears of a global slowdown in the economy which could see prices fall due to a drop in demand. The crisis in Venezuela is another scenario watched closely by oil analysts. There is a general sense in markets that Nicolás Maduro will not be removed from power in the near future and that tensions will keep on rising. Also most analysts discard the full ""nuclear option"", as that would have a devastating impact on the people of Venezuela, instead of just hitting the government. One of the most likely scenarios discussed is a partial restriction of how much oil the US can buy from Venezuela. That would hurt consumers in America and in the rest of the world. Prices would rise as refineries would have to buy their share of oil from more expensive sources. American refineries that buy from Venezuela would also be negatively affected. But US restrictions would benefit Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Iraq - countries that also produce the same variety of heavy crude oil (Canada also produces heavy crude but it does not have logistic capability to increase its exports). These countries have been eating into Venezuela's market share for years. Venezuela would be the biggest loser of all, of course. The country has the world's largest proven oil reserves - even bigger than Saudi Arabia - but it is rapidly running out of money to prospect for crude and pump it out of the ground. In the late 1990s, Venezuela was producing more than three million barrels of oil per day. Output today is hovering above the one million mark, according to experts. Even without any international sanctions Venezuela's oil production will decline dramatically this year because of the lack of investment. The rate of decline in production has been more intense in recent months. Helima Croft, from RBC Capital Markets, forecasts that output this year will drop by 300,000 to 500,000 barrels per day without any sanctions. Restrictions from Washington would accelerate the decline. Venezuela would be able to re-route part of its production to other buying nations, like China, but it wouldn't be able to pass on all of its excess oil to markets not aligned with the US. Venezuela is still seen as an oil powerhouse, especially because it is a producer of heavy crude, which is a variety not widely available in the world. But the severity of its economic crisis may be changing that. ""It will require billions in investment to repair the infrastructure and kick start a recovery. The talented technocrats that once made PDVSA one of the premier national oil companies continue to flee in droves,"" she told the BBC. ""Even if a reformist government comes to power, the international community will have to launch a major reconstruction and rehabilitation effort to get the country back up on its feet."" The IMF now publishes separate indicators for Venezuela in its Latin American analysis. The economy there has become such an outlier that it makes no sense to compare it to other countries. This year Venezuela's GDP is expected to reach a new low: the economy will be half the size of what it was in 2013. Last year the government tried again to use oil to solve its economic woes. It ended subsidies, raised the price of fuel domestically and ramped up its campaign to use a cryptocurrency allegedly pegged to barrels of oil. Still it failed to contain inflation, which is thought to have crossed the million per cent mark, and did not end its shortages of food and medicine. It's hard to imagine life getting any harder for people in Venezuela. Now with fresh sanctions on the cards, it just may."
economic indicators,Interest rate rise 'should be delayed',2024-09-15,2017-10-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41630943,"The Bank of England should hold off from raising interest rates next month, according to a forecasting body. Bank governor Mark Carney has said rates could go up in the ""relatively near term"", with many analysts expecting a hike in November. However, the EY Item Club said such a move risked hurting the UK's ""fragile economic outlook"". The group called on the bank to wait another year before raising the benchmark rate from 0.25% to 0.5%. It comes after the British Chambers of Commerce and ratings agency Standard & Poor's suggested economic growth was not strong enough to warrant a rate rise. The EY Item Club, which uses the Treasury's forecasting model, predicted GDP growth would slow to 1.5% this year and 1.4% in 2018.  It said expectations were high that the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would raise rates at the next meeting on 2 November, but urged it to wait for the economy to pick up. ""While it is understandable that the MPC will want to gradually normalise interest rates from their current 'emergency levels', we believe it would be better to do so once the economy is on a stronger footing,"" said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. The last time rates were raised was July 2007, before the financial crisis. Since then interest rates have been kept low to boost the economy by keeping the cost of borrowing down. The Bank cut rates further - from 0.5% to a record low of 0.25% - after the Brexit vote in a move designed to stimulate the economy.  Recent low unemployment figures and stronger inflation have made a rise in rates more likely. Mr Carney told the BBC at the end of September: ""If the economy continues on the track that it's been on, and all indications are that it is, in the relatively near term we can expect that interest rates will increase."" The Bank is tasked with using interest rates to keep inflation at 2%. It is currently at 2.9%, with the latest figures due out on Tuesday. But according to the EY Item Club's forecasts, inflation will fall back to 2% by the end of next year as the effects of the weaker pound wear off. The forecasting group said consumer spending would slow from a nine-year high in 2016 - 2.8% - to 1.5% this year due to inflation, low wage rises, welfare cuts and a slow housing market. The latest retail industry figures, released on Monday, indicate footfall fell by 1.2% in September. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: ""For the third consecutive month, most shopping destinations suffered a decline."" The British Chambers of Commerce said on Friday it was ""extraordinary"" the Bank was considering a rate rise when economic growth was muted. Earlier this month, Standard & Poor's said it was ""a bit sceptical"" the UK economy needed an interest rate rise. However, others have argued the economy is strong enough to start moving off the emergency rates."
economic indicators,China exports miss expectations,2024-09-15,2015-04-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-32281957,"China's economy grew by 7.4% in 2014, its weakest for almost 25 years China's monthly trade data shows exports fell in March from a year ago by 14.6% in yuan terms, compared to expectations for a rise of more than 8%. Imports meanwhile fell 12.3% in yuan terms compared to forecasts for a fall of more than 11%. The numbers mean the country's monthly trade surplus has shrunk to its smallest in 13 months.  China's economy grew by 7.4% in 2014, its weakest for almost 25 years. Analysts said recent indicators showed further signs the slowdown is continuing. In US dollar terms, China's exports for the month fell 15%, while imports fell 12.7%. Currency conversion factors based on US dollar and Chinese yuan movements over the last year mean some official numbers from the mainland are now reported in both currencies.  The official March data leaves the country with a monthly trade surplus of 18.16bn Chinese yuan ($2.92bn; £1.99bn). In February, China's monthly trade surplus hit a record $60.6bn, as exports grew and imports slid back. In US dollar terms, China's exports for the month fell 15% while imports fell 12.7% Analysts said the export numbers for March were a surprise.  ""We can understand the imports fell because of falling imports of commodities, but exports fell so much, it was very much unexpected,"" said Shanghai-based analyst Nie Wen from Hwabao Trust.  However, he said one major reason for the falling exports was yuan appreciation. Tony Nash, global vice president of Delta Economics, said the numbers took in the lunar new year period which was typically a bit volatile. ""We usually average February and March to get a true picture of what's actually happening,"" he told the BBC. ""If we look at February's 48% rise in exports and March's 15% fall in exports, we get a moving average of 16.7%, which is closer to where we've seen exports over the past two months."" But Mr Nash said Delta Economics was expecting a further slowdown going forward.  ""In the second quarter, we'll look for an average of 9.9% year-on-year export growth and 11.7% import growth,"" he said.  ""Trade will fall towards the back half of the year and we will look for average export growth in 2015 at 8.7% year-on-year, and import growth at 10.3% year-on-year.

economic indicators,Africa’s most exciting city for tech?,2024-09-15,2019-03-18,Thomas Lewton,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190318-addis-ababa-africas-most-exciting-city-of-innovators,"Talented young tech workers want to transform Ethiopia by finding unique solutions to local problems – and with a new prime minister, now may be their time. “I am young, ambitious and ready to transform my country, Ethiopia,” Selam Wondim announces to a conference room packed with high-profile executives and politicians in one of Addis Ababa’s most prestigious hotels. The 29-year old tech entrepreneur has been invited to speak to delegates at a side event of the 32nd African Union Summit, where she hopes to persuade governments across the continent to support technology ecosystems. We need “safe places for us to experiment, fail and succeed in this start-up game,” she says. You might also like: - Why we shouldn’t try to replicate Silicon Valley  - How to teach a distracted generation  - A generation of cyberslackers Here in Ethiopia, she has a receptive audience. Last year Abiy Ahmed, 42, was elected prime minster and quickly made his mark with a series of sweeping reforms, including the release of thousands of political prisoners and the restoration of diplomatic relations with Eritrea. Also among his policies are changes to business, finance, telecoms and education, signalling that technology is now a priority for the government. With this in mind, Wondim and others believe that Addis Ababa could soon become one of Africa’s leading innovation centres, potentially rivalling Nairobi, Lagos or Cape Town. Half of Africa’s tech hubs are found in only four countries: Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Ghana. These same countries account for three quarters of the funds raised by start-ups – funds which are rising rapidly as investors are drawn to the continent. In 2018 alone there was a four-fold increase in start-up funding compared to the previous year. Wondim wants Ethiopia – and her own start-up GroHydro, which manufactures hydroponic farming systems – to be part of this growth. GroHydro is based out of blueMoon, one of several incubation centres found in Addis Ababa’s Bole district. ‘Necessity driving tech innovation’ blueMoon looks like tech hubs and incubators around the world – inspirational quotes adorn the walls of co-working spaces (“Stay hungry, stay foolish” or “#daretodisrupt”), bean-bags abound and a bright blue auto rickshaw is inexplicably nestled in the corner of one room, eight floors above street level. But behind the aesthetic lies an unusual outlook on what sort of problems technology should be solving. “In developed countries technology is creating a comfort or a convenience, whereas in Ethiopia it’s creating a necessity,” says Betelhem Dessie, a tech educator at iCog Labs, the country’s leading artificial intelligence hub. Despite two decades of sustained and substantial economic growth, Ethiopia still has one of the lowest GDPs per capita in the world and most people are subsistence farmers. Now young Ethiopians are turning to technology to tackle the challenges they face. “Great ideas are essentially solutions to problems,” says Eleni Gabre-Madhin, blueMoon’s founder. “And if anything we have a lot of problems.” Gabre-Madhin offers M-Pesa – a mobile banking company based in Kenya – as an example of how technology can uniquely transform developing economies. “Because there wasn’t bricks and mortar banking set up, we didn’t have legacy systems that had to be dismantled to go to mobile banking,” she says. Agriculture, education and healthcare systems are ripe for such technological “leapfrogging” too. One Ethiopian example is Flowius, a start-up taking a radical approach to building affordable water pipelines by using mobile surveying tools, solar power and microfinance. “There are so many people who walk for water,” says Markos Lemma, co-founder of Flowius. “We want innovation that contextually makes sense. Finding local solutions for local problems, instead of adopting solutions all the time.” ‘More connected’ Lemma is also the co-founder of iceaddis, another innovation hub down the road from blueMoon set up in 2011 as the first of its kind in Addis Ababa. In recent years he’s seen young Ethiopians’ interest in technology blossom. “It’s crazy!” he exclaims, looking out over Bole’s bustling streets. “It feels like it’s happening right now. It’s opening up.” In less than a decade, around 100 start-ups have emerged out of Addis Ababa’s nascent tech ecosystem. Every day Lemma receives several meeting requests from technology enthusiasts, asking for advice on how to bring their product to market. He believes a dramatic rise in internet access is a major factor in this change – increasing from 1% of individuals using the internet in 2011 to more than 15% today. The expansion of mobile phone networks, alongside falling smartphone prices, have led to a similar increase in internet users across sub-Saharan Africa. “When more people are connected to the internet, they know what is out there,” he says. “It creates a lot of excitement and motivation.” Wondim and her hydroponics start-up are a case in point. “Before I applied to blueMoon, I used to experiment watching YouTube and I came across this technology. I was really surprised that we can grow crops without soil,” she says. Taking this existing technology, Wondim then created a new business model – one moulded to Ethiopian society. “The youth think that agriculture and farming is outdated, and are even abandoning their parents’ and grandparents’ land,” she explains. “If we make it more high-tech, we can promote the youth into that business.” GroHydro systems are also being designed for refugees in Ethiopia’s urban centres who are often marginalised. Not only does this empower refugees with an income, but Wondim hopes that through business a dialogue will be created between refugees and Ethiopians. “We need to start some kind of engagement,” she says. Ethiopia’s society is highly communal. Injera – a traditional flatbread eaten with most meals – is always shared from the same plate, while coffee is drunk together several times a day. Such social norms influence the tech solutions being developed in Addis Ababa. Lemma points to a traditional crowd-saving practice – called Equb – in which family members and friends regularly put money into a shared pot, and then wait their turn for the dividends. Recently this Ethiopian custom has been digitised into a mobile app. “You wouldn’t think about this in another market, unless you had that culture,” he says. Investors needed While Addis Ababa is teeming with innovative ideas like these, turning them into marketable products is an uphill struggle. For decades, Ethiopia’s business environment has remained conservative and bureaucratic. “Commercialisation for any business here is hard, but if you’re looking at tech innovation, it’s way harder,” says Lemma. The procedure to open or close a new business is lengthy and expensive – the antithesis of the start-up model. Yet Abiy has indicated reforms are on the horizon. In December, he launched the ‘Doing Business Initiative’, which aims to lower the regulatory and administrative hurdles for businesses and promote investment. Foreign investment in Ethiopia is currently tightly controlled, hampering many of its budding start-ups. On a chalkboard scrawled with aspirations at blueMoon there is one common thread: “I want to meet investors”. And while internet access has leapt in recent years, the telecoms sector – which state-owned Ethio Telecom has a monopoly on – is notoriously expensive and unreliable. Under the previous government, nationwide internet blackouts were common as the state shut down communications in the face of widespread protests and ethnic violence. Internet blackouts are a thing of the past since Abiy came to power. He’s also opening up to foreign investment, with Ethio Telecom set to be partially privatised and split into two competing businesses as a first step. In February, he told the Financial Times: “My economic model is capitalism.” Yet the rapid liberalisation of Ethiopia’s economy carries with it the risk of neo-colonialism. Getnet Assefa, the co-founder of iCog Labs and an ardent support of many of Abiy’s reforms notes that most of the technology companies in Kenya and Nigeria are foreign-owned. “Yes, they have a lot of investment,” he says. “But if you look at it in terms of homegrown tech, Ethiopia is doing reasonably well.” Assefa believes the government must tread a line between encouraging foreign investment and fostering the growth of Ethiopian tech companies. Nurturing ideas In July, Abiy met with Sophia the Robot, who was partly built at iCog Labs. “We programmed Sophia to speak a small amount of Amharic for the prime minister,” says Assefa. As much as Abiy’s appearance was a publicity stunt, it signalled his commitment to the technology sector. “People are now seeing Ethiopia in a different eye, not just poverty and politics,” says Assefa. Optimism abounds in Addis Ababa’s tech community, but Lemma cautions that many of Abiy’s proposed changes are yet to happen. “I really support his ideas and his ambition,” he says. “But on the flip side, this is all theoretical.” In the meantime Lemma, Gabre-Madhin and others are nurturing the technology ecosystem themselves. Alongside incubators, they are creating workshops, mentor networks and funding opportunities. “We set out to do something very holistic,” says Gabre-Madhin. In particular, there’s a need to connect university graduates to this technology ecosystem. In the last two decades, the number of universities in Ethiopia has increased from two to more than 40, while it’s mandatory government policy for 70% of university students to study science and engineering subjects. “If you nurture this talent and provide a landing for all of this energy and passion, something good is going to come out of it,” says Gabre-Madhin. “The difference between where ideas thrive and where they die is the fertile ground on which they fall.” -- To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook  page or message us on Twitter.

economic indicators,The cost of a bridge between nations,2024-09-15,2018-11-26,Maddy Savage,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20181122-the-cost-of-the-bridge-between-two-nations,"This brooding Nordic Noir backdrop has its own dramatic, twisting tale.      Swedes call it Öresundsbron. Danes use the spelling Øresundsbroen. Around the world many know it simply as The Bridge, the name of the multi award-winning Nordic Noir drama screened in more than 100 countries that uses the connection as its brooding backdrop. It is huge. With a mass of 82,000 tonnes, held up by two 204m-long metal pylons and stretching for 16km, including its underground tunnel section, it is one of the longest bridges in Europe. It connects Sweden’s third largest city, Malmö with Denmark’s capital, Copenhagen, scrapping the need to take a lengthy ferry or flight across the Oresund strait. Pontus T. Pagler, a 31-year-old actor from a rural town north of Malmö who appeared in Season Four of The Bridge, recalls how tricky it was to make the journey before it was built. “We travelled to Malmö, but not to Denmark as you do now...it was too far and too long of a ride,” he remembers. As a teenager raised in the 1990s, he was aware that investment in infrastructure was more focused around the larger Swedish cities of Stockholm and Gothenburg. “Growing up, I think we felt neglected in a certain way. It’s just a feeling you had.” But the opening of the Oresund bridge in 2000 represented a major economic shift, dramatically improving cross-border access and cutting journey times. Instead of queuing for weather-dependent ferries that took around an hour, passengers could drive over the bridge in just 10 minutes or travel between central Malmö and central Copenhagen in just 34 minutes by train. The landmark quickly became one of the best-known symbols of European cross-border collaboration. “It’s really fast, and you can go there and back in the same day. That’s the biggest impact, I think. And if you want to stay there a weekend or something it’s very, very easy,” says Pagler. Click or pinch to zoom on mobile. The body count In 2017 a record average of 20,361 vehicles passed over the bridge each day and approximately 14,000 commuters took the train, despite temporary identity checks lengthening journey times during the first half of the year. Prior to the bridge opening, around 6,000 people a day commuted by ferry. “I think my career would have been much slower if we didn’t have the bridge,” says 43-year-old Nichole Friberg, a managing director for an IT company who lives in Malmö but has been working in Copenhagen for 12 years. “It’s more dynamic and all the companies I have joined have been quite international, and that is quite important to me since I am multicultural myself - half Peruvian, half Swedish,” she explains. “You have the opportunity to spend your day in a larger city that is a little bit more chaotic than Malmö. Then you get to come home to a little bit of peace and quiet.” While the vast majority of commuters come from Sweden, the bridge also makes it easier for Danish residents to network with their Swedish counterparts. In Malmö city centre, Neil Murray, 34, who lives in Copenhagen and invests in start-ups across the Nordics, is grabbing a latte in between meetings on both sides of the Oresund strait. “I can’t really think of any other place in the world where two strong tech ecosystems exist within half an hour of each other, so for me I see it as a competitive advantage that I can see start-ups in two different countries, because of a bridge,” he says. Worth the wait? But while the bridge has clearly transformed transport in the area, the project was a long time coming and has faced numerous challenges. Engineers had been putting forward proposals for a bridge or a tunnel to the Swedish and Danish governments since 1936. They finally signed an agreement to build a bridge between Malmö and Copenhagen in 1991. Sweden’s goal of boosting cooperation with the rest of Europe (it joined the European Union in 1995) was a key catalyst, alongside Denmark’s desire to increase air traffic from Copenhagen’s Kastrup airport. Both nations supported a stronger regional identity for the Oresund area (home to more than 3.5 million people at that time) by encouraging closer ties between businesses and educational institutions. Locally, there was an urgent need for Malmö to evolve following the collapse of traditional industries such as textiles and shipbuilding. Listen to the clip above.  “Malmö was regarded as a very dull and grey city and there were lots of pessimistic views among politicians, the business community and also among ordinary people,” remembers Christer Persson, who was director of strategic development in the city between 1989 and 2003 and is currently writing a book about the impact of the Oresund bridge. “The government made an investigation and they came to the conclusion that ‘this is the time to build a bridge’, because that could make a change,” he explains from a student lounge at Malmö university, where he is a guest lecturer. “They hoped to accelerate the transformation process of the city, from being a traditional old industrial town to a modern city with small and medium-sized companies in the new modern branches like IT, design, biotechnology for example.” ‘A fantastic adventure’ These were ambitious goals that came with a price tag. The cost of building the bridge and related essential infrastructure like roads and stations was 30bn Danish krone ($4.3bn; £3bn). But both governments sought to secure public engagement by minimising the impact for taxpayers. The main bridge structure was paid for by loans shared between the Swedish and Danish states, to be paid back over 30 years using toll fees. For Kim Smedegaard Andersson, a Danish engineer fresh out of university who was hired by an engineering firm working on the assignment, the excitement was palpable. “It was a fantastic adventure to go into a project like this,” he says. But he also remembers his whole team feeling the weight of responsibility. They had to overcome logistical issues like making sure the bridge wasn’t too high to pose a threat to landing planes or too low, which could have blocked shipping. “No-one had constructed a project like this before, in such close proximity to an airport and a busy navigation channel, and in-between two Scandinavian countries.” There were unexpected setbacks too, including the discovery of 16 unexploded World War Two bombs and two unusually icy winters which made it difficult to transport materials. Sustainability was also controversial: green campaigners protested and Sweden’s Environment Minister Olof Johansson resigned because of his concerns. “The whole ecobalance in the Baltics was debated,” remembers Smedegaard Andersson. “There were challenges to solve every day.” Detailed efforts were made to satisfy critics, including a campaign to encourage travellers to use the train rather than their cars. Motorway lights were positioned to avoid disturbing eels and pylon lighting switched off in fog to limit bird collisions. The construction ended up being completed with stereotypical Scandinavian efficiency in just five years, several months ahead of schedule. There were celebratory activities such as special runs and cycle rides for members of the public and an inauguration ceremony attended by the Swedish and Danish royal families. Smedegaard Andersson recalls being asked to provide commentary for Danish television network TV2. “I was speaking when the first cars and motorcyclists were using the link. That was an amazing experience,” he smiles. Not enough traffic Early on, Christer Persson remembers, there were concerns that “there just wasn’t enough traffic” and that this could hamper debt repayment by the two governments. During the autumn of 2000 there was a daily flow of between 7,000 and 10,000 vehicles compared to a peak of around 14,000 during the summer holiday season. “Some of us said: ‘If you are investing in such a large project that is going to stand for like 100 years, do you really have to have a payback time of 30 years?’ Because if you choose to have a longer payback time, you can of course lower the prices,” he says. Later that year the cost of a single car trip, then priced at 255 Swedish kronor (around £17 at the time) was temporarily cut by almost half to 140 kronor to encourage more people to try the journey. Prices rose again as public interest increased. The current cost of a single trip is 515 kronor per car (£45.78; $56.88) although there are major discounts for frequent travellers and advance online purchase. Earlier this year Oresundsbro Konsortiet, the Danish-Swedish organisation that owns and runs the bridge, predicted that all debts would be to be repaid by 2033, four years ahead of earlier estimates. Train prices today start from 111 kronor (£9.60; $12.28). Click or pinch to zoom on mobile. Border scuffles By far the biggest challenge since the bridge opened has been the Swedish government’s temporary reintroduction of photo identity checks for travellers between January 2016 and May 2017, as Sweden sought to limit the flow of asylum seekers. More than 163,000 asylum seekers arrived in Sweden in 2015, falling to 29,000 in 2016. The additional controls increased journey times by around 30 minutes and led to service cuts. The number of rail passengers dropped by 13% in 2016, according to Danish train operating company DSB. Sweden’s transport authority Länsstyrelsen released a survey suggesting two out of three Swedish commuters were experiencing higher levels of stress and had considered either changing jobs or moving to Denmark. “It was impossible not knowing what time you were going to get to work or what time you were going to get back from work,” laments Nichole Friberg. She initiated sharing a minibus with colleagues so they could drive to work in Copenhagen instead of going by train, a system which they still use despite the abolition of the ID checks in May 2017. But the latest ticket sales statistics from Swedish regional rail company Skånetraffiken suggest that most passengers who sought alternative transport have now returned to the tracks. By October 2018, the number of rail commuters had rebounded to 2015 levels. Swede success? Economic geographer Magnus Andersson says the impressive commuting figures are largely a result of Swedes helping to “plug gaps in the Danish service sector” as well as professional roles in niche industries. He says there are two other key indicators that highlight the huge economic impact of the bridge. Firstly, more than 60 companies from a wide range of industries have moved their Nordic headquarters or specialist offices to Malmö since 2000, helping to fulfil the city transformation goals that Swedish government set in the 1990s. Secondly, he says that the bridge has “improved individual livelihoods” by offering locals subtle changes. Danes can access more affordable housing in southern Sweden, cheaper shopping due to currency differences and can enjoy southern Sweden’s coastline and forests. Swedes have the chance to experience the food and design industries that the Danish capital is globally famous for and make the most of Copenhagen’s large international airport, Kastrup. “Malmö is not only linking up to Copenhagen, but it also links (Sweden) to a global network of cities. When I think about the future for Malmö, that link is of utmost importance,” Andersson says. Nordic Noir tourism From a global perspective, both the bridge and the airport have been instrumental in foreign visitors to the region too. In Copenhagen there were around 3.6m overnight stays from international visitors in 2000, the year the bridge was completed, rising to 7m 2017, according to figures shared by Oresundsinstitutet, a Danish-Swedish regional research hub. Malmö has also experienced a boost, especially in more recent years. There were 480,000 overnight visits from foreigners in 2008, increasing to 820,000 in 2017. Jonas Løvschall-Wedel, a spokesperson for the Danish capital’s official tourist board, Wonderful Copenhagen, says it is hard to quantify how much of this tourism is connected to the popularity of The Bridge television series. However the emergence of Nordic Noir day tours and the fact that Wonderful Copenhagen now uses the slogan ‘one trip – two countries’ in its branding are clear signs that it has had an impact. “It’s weird when people exotify your own culture or your own environment,” laughs The Bridge actor Pontus T. Pagler, who says he was shocked to meet fans from as far away as Australia at the Scandinavian premiere of the fourth season. “But I think it’s cool...The southern part of Sweden has gotten a boost now, which we haven’t had before.” The Oresund bridge has also offered inspiration for similar engineering projects in South Korea and China as well as plans for the so-called Femern tunnel, designed to connect the Danish island of Lolland with the German island of Fehmarn by 2028, pending German approval. Kim Smedegaard Andersson, no longer a fresh-faced engineer, is deputy technical director for the tunnel, and is one of several senior managers who previously worked on the Oresund link or the Great Belt Bridge that connects the Danish islands of Zealand and Funen. “We know what it takes to get approval, because we have learnt the lessons from the Great Belt and the Oresund project,” he says. “We have a good understanding of what happens with the environment and we have utilised that in the development of our project.”   Identity crisis But despite its inspirational economic success, many observers agree that the Oresund bridge has had a much more limited impact in terms of forging a new regional identity. Christer Persson argues that it was a case of “too much, too soon” when it came to initiating cross-border projects between companies and institutions after the bridge opened, many of which “faded out” after a couple of years. These included plans for closer links between Malmö and Copenhagen universities, allowing students to study on both sides of the strait. “The expectations were very big, but it was difficult to fulfil them,” he says, citing differences between the education systems alongside the rapid pace of globalisation. “It became less interesting for many to collaborate across the border instead of with actors in other parts of the world.” More recent initiatives have involved controversial efforts to rebrand the whole Oresund region as Greater Copenhagen, which marketeers have argued is an easier identity for international visitors to grasp. But Magnus Andersson says it’s been challenging to get residents to think beyond their existing labels. “Copenhagen people are very proud of being Danish and living in a capital, and on the Swedish side people have quite a strong regional identity, so merging these two identities has not proven to be easy.” That said, he believes you’d struggle to find anyone in the region who doesn’t feel closer to their Scandinavian neighbours than they did before the bridge was built. “In senior high school some of my friends were actually demonstrating against the bridge and today we are making fun of them… We laugh because today we cannot imagine life without the bridge”. -- To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook  page or message us on Twitter.

economic indicators,A radical plan to tackle obesity,2024-09-15,2018-11-19,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20181113-bittersweet---whos-benefitting-from-the-sugar-tax,"Has a radical plan to help this country kick its sugar habit finally paid off?    Ryan Allen put one foot on his accomplice’s shoulder and hoisted himself onto a bronze horse statue in the centre of Royal Exchange Square in Glasgow in Scotland. Passers-by filmed the spectacle on their phones as he saddled up behind the bronze of the first Duke of Wellington. “There was adrenaline. It was technically illegal,” he later said. “It was just a sense of relief and accomplishment when I got up there.” For more than 30 years, local pranksters had decorated the monument with traffic cones. Now in July 2017, from his seat behind the ‘Iron Duke’, Allen triumphantly crowned it with one of his own. He considered his act righteous and necessary, emulating the Duke’s own fighting spirit. But Allen’s cause wasn’t land or liberty. It was fizzy drinks. Painted in the orange and blue style of his favourite Scottish beverage, the cone was inscribed with one simple demand: “Bring Back Real Irn-Bru.” Three months earlier, the UK government brought in a so-called ‘fat tax’, a multi-tiered levy on sugary soft drinks - the latest effort to curb dangerous levels of obesity. Public Health England (PHE) hoped to push companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Red Bull to reformulate their products in ways that encouraged lower and less frequent sugar consumption. If they failed to change their recipes before 6 April 2018, the tax would go into effect and retailers would be forced to raise prices. Most opted to change the recipes of their popular drinks. The Soft Drinks Industry Levy, also dubbed the ‘sugar tax’, seems to many in the UK like a sensible idea. But for lifelong lovers of fizzy drinks like Allen, it’s a direct assault on his culture. To him, less sugar in the iconic Scottish drink means less flavour. In July, the message on his traffic cone was clear. How does a place like the UK respond to going cold turkey? To understand the scale of its sugar addiction you need to look at the next generation - 20% of Year 6 children (aged 10-11) are obese. Some 26% of adults are classified as obese in England. Can a tax really be used to promote cultural evolution? And if it can, what’s the best way to measure its success? Click or pinch to zoom on mobile. A dire prognosis The UK government debuted ‘Childhood obesity: A plan for action’ in August 2016, a comprehensive report produced by the PHE outlining the obesity epidemic and several paths toward a healthier future. PHE found that nearly a third of children age two to 15 were overweight or obese, and that people were becoming obese earlier in life and staying obese for longer. “The economic costs are great, too,” the report cited. “We spend more each year on the treatment of obesity and diabetes than we do on the police, fire service and judicial system combined.” PHE found that the National Health Service (and therefore every UK tax payer) spends £5.1bn ($6.6bn) on weight-related medical services a year. In 2018, the estimate climbed to £6.1bn ($8bn). Among its long list of solutions was the levy on sugary drinks. Teenagers in England, the biggest consumers of such drinks in Europe, could max out their recommended daily intake of sugar with a single 330 millilitre (ml) can. The time had come to tackle one of the underlying sources of the problem. Then-Chancellor George Osborne announced the tax during the 2016 Budget Statement. The government would wait two years before implementing it to give manufacturers time to adjust their formulas. Companies that refused to reduce sugar would be taxed in two bands. Drinks with more than 5 grams (g) of sugar per 100ml would face a tax equivalent to 18p per litre ($0.23). More than 8g would add a 24p tax per litre ($0.31). The expected yearly revenue was about £500m ($650m), which PHE said would be invested in obesity-reduction programmes for children. Click or pinch to zoom on mobile. People might have expected drinks companies to erupt in outrage at the announcement and for the Treasury to sit in eager anticipation of a funding boost. But it was just the opposite. It was almost as if they had seen it coming. Soft drink manufacturers rapidly began looking at ways to reformulate their products around the new guidelines, often swapping sugar for artificial sweeteners. Supermarkets Tesco, Asda and drinks companies Fanta, Ribena, Britvic and Lucozade slashed the sugar content in their drinks, some by half or more. Irn-Bru reduced its own recipe from 10.3g of sugar to 4.7g per 100ml, stoking the ire of loyalists like Allen. The new formulas began rolling out long before the April 2018 deadline with minimal exceptions. Coca-Cola and Pepsi, opted to shoulder the tax hike and maintain their sugar content. While Pepsi declined to comment on this to BBC Capital, a spokesperson for Coca-Cola says that although Coca-Cola Original Taste is the only product not reformulated in recent years, the company's decision was made with its customers in mind. ""We decided not to change the recipe because people love it and have asked us not to change it. We believe people should have choice."" The number of new soft drink launches with less than 5g of sugar per 100ml since the 2016 report has risen from 32 to 45. Inversely, new beverages above the recommended threshold are down from 60 to 49 in 2018. Of course, as more companies met PHE’s sugar standards, anticipated tax revenue fell from £500m to £385m by mid-2017, then again to £275m in November. Today, more than seven months since the tax was formally applied, it’s generated a measly £62m ($80m). But Treasury officials are nonetheless hailing the tax a success. Lower revenue for the government implies a greater willingness by companies to hit healthier benchmarks. In this case, paradoxically, less really is more. Kicking an ingrained habit  In the midst of this entente cordiale some can’t help but reflect on the days before obesity was considered an epidemic. Naveed Sattar, professor of Cardiology and Medical Sciences at the University of Glasgow, remembers growing up without fear of overdoing the sugar. UK obesity levels were 4%-7% in the 1980s when Sattar was a kid helping in his father’s corner shop. He often watched customers stock up on four litres of Irn-Bru a day. “There’s many people who have grown up on Irn-Bru,” Sattar says. “I drank lots of Irn-Bru from a young age because I didn’t know any better. It was there.” Sattar’s biggest reality check came in medical school. In a test of 300 people, Sattar was found to have one of the highest risks of diabetes based on his insulin levels. When his weight jumped three stone, he knew he needed to ditch the sugar. “I religiously had two sugars in my tea, but I cut it,” he says. The transition, while difficult, was rather quick. Soon, his taste buds adjusted. “Now if you put it back in my tea, it’s vile.” But quitting a soft drink addiction isn’t always that simple. One Irn-Bru addict at the cardiovascular clinic Sattar runs was referred due to high blood fat levels and a recent heart attack. He regularly drank six litres a day, Sattar says, and even got up in the night for a sip. He lost eight kilos after Sattar treated him, and began enjoying proper food for the first time in years. “If people really give themselves a chance, you can adapt your taste buds,” Sattar says. “Just because they like something doesn’t mean they couldn’t change with a little time and a little perseverance.” Sattar represents the majority of those in the medical community and wider public willing to accept the tax for the overall betterment of health. But he thinks it’s much too early to celebrate. Cutting out fizzy drinks is a great start, but experts believe they account for only 5% of the larger obesity issue. Even with thousands of other sugary foods at their disposal, the more outspoken Irn-Bru fans think the tax has gone too far. Irn-Bru declined to comment when approached by BBC Capital. Allen followed up his cone stunt with a petition aimed at parent company AG Barr that received more than 50,000 signatures. Another man came up with his own Irn-Bru-flavoured concoction that he claims tastes just like the original. Others stockpiled the full-sugar version and now sell it illegally online. Allen says he drinks four cans a week, which would cost him about £124 ($161) annually if he purchased each 300ml can individually. Had the makers refused to alter their recipe and passed the tax to Allen, his annual spend would have risen to about £140 ($182). “I would have rather paid the tax,” he says. “It’s brand-suicide and it’s a betrayal of the customers who have made it what it is.” Few can match Allen’s passion, but he’s not alone. According to Kiti Soininen, head of food, drink and foodservice research at Mintel, 64% of people say they drink the same amount they did a year ago and 10% say they drink more. The extra-hot summer weather likely affected consumption a bit, Soininen says, but it’s an indicator that the UK has a long way to go. Click or pinch to zoom on mobile. Global action  The UK is a latecomer to action on sugary drinks. Beginning mostly in the Pacific Islands, levies have slowly spread through cities and countries across every continent since the early ‘80s. Mexico’s 10% tax accelerated the movement in 2014. After just one year, Mexicans were consuming 12% less sugary drinks, the most significant reductions in the poorest households. Five other areas followed suit the same year with a tax of their own, six each in 2015 and 2016, and a whopping 13 in 2017. Hungary witnessed a 40% decrease in soft drink sugar content in the wake of its tax. In Berkeley, California, a minimal tax decreased overall consumption by 21%. According to the World Cancer Research Fund, a total of 48 cities, nations and territories have now imposed taxes of some type on their soft drinks.   But it’s not all plain sailing. Chicago authorities repealed their 1-cent-per-ounce tax in 2017 just two months after it was applied. The measure was pitched primarily as a way of plugging the city’s $1.8bn budget gap (£1.4bn). Health concerns and obesity prevention were secondary priorities, according to the Washington Post. A media battle between the drinks companies and public health groups ended in defeat for the tax’s supporters. The UK’s cooperation with health officials and commitment to school programmes has, so far, allowed its tax to succeed where Chicago’s failed. Looking long-term, one Cambridge University study uses a different yardstick to measure success. It estimates that the tax raised liable soft drink prices by approximately 38%, leading to a 26% decrease in consumption in England. Researchers say this decrease would prevent approximately 370 coronary heart disease deaths, effectively generating about 4,490 life years by 2021. Comparing the 617,000 hospital admissions in 2016 in which obesity was a factor, the projection becomes all the more realistic. As Sattar cautioned, the war on obesity has only just started. Although the Department of Health and Social Care’s plan to cut 20% of sugar in foods most commonly eaten by children is well on its way, the UK has not met the overall 5% reduction goal for its first year. Whether a new wave of levies is picking up speed is anyone’s guess, but given the soft drink tax’s early success, Sattar believes it to be the best way forward. “We need some clever people to make these companies aware of the changes they need to make,” he says. “Pricing taxation does work if you do it properly.” -- To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook  page or message us on Twitter.

economic indicators,How to find the perfect ‘work wife’,2024-09-15,2019-08-04,Celina Ribeiro,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190801-how-australians-find-their-work-wives,"Finding a flexible job at the right level after having children is hard, but one company is pioneering a solution. Lija Wilson really struggled with returning to work after maternity leave. After a corporate career working in marketing and digital business for some of Australia’s largest companies, she had her first child in her late 30s, followed by another soon after. “I love my career. I tried a number of different ways of working. I tried working part time, and I just found I was constantly squashing a full-time remit into part-time hours, getting part-time pay, and everything was suffering. I tried consulting for a while, I tried freelancing and that was even more difficult,” she says. Like millions of women returning to work after taking time out to have children, finding employment which reflected her skills and ambition – and allowed her an extra day or two each week to be with her young children – was proving exceptionally difficult. Then she had a chat with an old colleague. Mike Hill had been the CEO of a marketing company, but had sold up. He wanted to spend more time with his young children, of whom he’d seen little in the previous years, and focus on his passion: start-ups. But, Wilson says, he had a “horrific experience” looking for senior-level part-time work as a man. “The stigma was much, much worse than for women,” says Wilson. There they were, two highly skilled professionals with decades of experience between them, unable to get jobs that reflected their skills and respected their need for reduced hours. “We were joking about job share and saying we should put a joint CV together and bandy ourselves about as a pair,” says Wilson. “And it all sprung from there.” Dating for jobseekers In early 2017, with her three- and four-year-olds in tow, Wilson joined with Hill to launch Puffling, an online service matching potential professional job-share partners and employers. Within three weeks of their soft launch, they had nearly 700 women signed up to the platform. Based in Sydney but servicing all Australia and soon New Zealand, the firm works much like an online dating service, using similar algorithms and technology. “Basically, you’re looking for like-minded matches. You want people that have the same aspirations, values, interests, work ethics, similar backgrounds and similar locations,” says Wilson. Job-seekers sign up to join the community, and then employers advertise a position which they are willing to structure as a job share. Alternatively, job-seekers might find a full-time job they want to apply for, and then look for a potential candidate to join forces with to apply as a team. Puffling encourages matches to meet for a coffee before progressing further; like dating, a match can look good on paper but might not work out in real life. Personality clashes, says Wilson, “is the only reason job shares fail”. Job shares can be structured in various ways: a job may be split, with clear division of responsibilities and key performance indicators; a senior candidate may be matched with a more junior one in a vertical share; the work and targets may be entirely shared across the week; or they might seek to make a “unicorn pair” – more common in technology – that pulls together two employees with different scarce, but complementary, skillsets. “I firmly believe any role can be job-shared,” says Wilson. The ‘motherhood pay gap’ Australia has a high proportion of highly educated women, and they have long outnumbered male graduates. At the same time Australia has one of the higher rates of part-time working among women in the OECD, accounting for nearly half of all working women. The OECD has called part-time working and “inactive” women – particularly those with children – one of the greatest untapped sources of potential in the Australian labour market. “From an economic point of view, it’s a huge problem,” says Professor Marian Baird of the University of Sydney’s Women, Work and Leadership Research Group. “It’s quite clear that women in Australia are highly educated and they’re not being able to realise that education in a career sense. “If it’s a choice they’ve made in order to combine their work and care responsibilities, and it’s working for them for that period, it’s not a bad thing. The problem is that it has longer-term consequences. And that’s where women are really being disadvantaged because they’re not given the opportunities later to ramp up their careers. That means they fall behind both in a pay-gap sense, but also in a career sense and in terms of an opportunity gap… It’s called the motherhood pay gap.” Officially the gender pay gap in Australia is 14% (about the OECD average), but that reflects full-time work. After careers often dotted with breaks and part-time work to accommodate child-rearing, Australian women are retiring with a third of the savings of Australian men. And the problem is not limited to Australia; globally women far outnumber men in terms of part-time work, and often face similar career and pay penalties. However, quality part-time work can offer good work-life balance and financial security, and demand for it is high. A 2017 report from the UK’s Office of National Statistics found that nine out of 10 mothers in part-time work did not want to work full time, and three-fifths of mothers seeking work were looking for a part-time role – compared to just a quarter of fathers seeking the same. Dr Heejung Chung, a sociologist at the University of Kent, says that given the vastly disproportionate amount of housework and childcare women do within heterosexual relationships, she says “they take part-time work to manage”. Job-sharing, says Chung, might overcome some of the barriers women and others in part-time work face in terms of being passed over for promotion or not being valued on their productivity. “But it’s not a magic bullet,” she says. “Mechanisms to change perceptions need to be there, too.” Both Baird and Chung say that if the view persists that it’s “just two part-time roles”, opportunities may remain limited. Lija Wilson is confident that the workplace is changing. She has witnessed a shift towards valuing productivity and results over where and when work is done. Her company is working with big brands like Audi and Visa, and there are other organisations both in Australia and globally which do similar work. Puffling itself has placed around 25 senior job-share pairs, with particular interest from companies and roles within the marketing, HR and technology sectors. In one case, an employer came to Puffling seeking a solution for retaining an employee they risked losing without a job share. As for the pairs, she says, once they’ve found their perfect “work wife”, many say they never want to leave the arrangement. The sharers say they feel they learn from their partner and solve problems better in a team. “They leave the office on their days off feeling their career and workload is in safe hands; the anxiety or stress of working part-time and panicking about not being there on your non-working days, or having things that are not managed in your absence or feeling you are always checking in from home is removed, meaning you love going to work and you love going home,” says Wilson.   It has been a long road, Wilson says, but the platform is making money. Yet while businesses appear enthusiastic about job-sharing, she finds take-up slower than that enthusiasm would suggest. In the end, she says, some businesses will revert to a full-time candidate or a four-day-week role, as it feels easier and more familiar. For her and Puffling, much of the work in promoting job sharing has been around “myth busting” and emphasising the benefits that two brains bring to a single position. Getting more men into such roles is critical; at the moment around 92% of the Puffling community is female. And until men take up part-time and flexible work at a similar rate to women, say both Wilson and the researchers, real change will be limited. “Because it’s not a women’s issue and it’s not a mothers’ issue. It’s not something that should be lumped over for women to solve,” Wilson says. “It’s something that’s not only going to help our economy, but provide such a more engaged and productive workforce in the future.”"
economic indicators,Internet from space will transform work,2024-09-15,2019-08-19,Chris Baraniuk,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190816-how-satellites-could-revolutionise-the-internet,"Four billion people lack internet access. Satellite internet could change that. But will the jobs created be good ones? It’s lunchtime in Mumbai. Millions of workers are looking forward to a meal. For some, that means being handed their lunchbox by a dabbawala – a delivery, usually via bicycle, that has been a familiar service in the city for 125 years. Increasingly, though, some customers don’t deal directly with the courier. They do everything via an app. “I live in Mumbai and food delivery is now a big deal,” says Anu Madgavkar, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute. “If you walk into a Starbucks outlet there will be five delivery executives from [food delivery app] Swiggy.” Here’s proof that a digital revolution is taking place: the app for the dabbawalas was developed by a 13-year-old boy. While this new-fangled way of doing things has split local opinion, Madgavkar says there are plenty of fans. While India has long had the building blocks of a gig economy, the internet has now forced businesses to be more organised and offer a more consistent service. Here, though, is the twist. Internet coverage in India is low. Fewer than a quarter of Indians have access to the web or a smartphone. In rural parts of the country, internet penetration may be as low as 14%. It’s a similar story in many emerging economies around the world – from sub-Saharan Africa to Latin America and much of Southeast Asia. More than half the world is still unconnected to the internet. While coverage is rising in the regions mentioned above, installing cables and mobile phone masts to hook up the remaining 4 billion people would be a very slow process. The distances involved are huge. But now a handful of companies are planning something different – the internet, from space. Big plans for connecting over half the world It’s a spectacular-sounding goal: thousands – perhaps even tens of thousands – of tiny satellites in low Earth orbit beaming the internet to anyone, anywhere. OneWeb is the name of one firm planning to do this. It launched its first six satellites in February. The ultimate aim is to broadcast a mobile internet signal that anyone, anywhere, can connect to with a smartphone. Elon Musk’s SpaceX also plans to launch a constellation of internet-beaming satellites, as does Amazon. There may eventually be more than one satellite network competing to offer broadband internet around the world this way. The impact this could have on employment is staggering. “OneWeb are looking to put up around 1,900 satellites. SpaceX are going close to 12,000,” says Christopher Newman, a professor of space law and policy at Northumbria University. Currently, there are about 2,000 commercial satellites in orbit around the Earth, so the increase would be massive. “We’re talking about a genuine disruption to the space environment.” He says the topic needs a “dose of realism” – it’s not yet clear whether these satellite constellations will be cost-effective to run or if they’ll create too much space debris, polluting the orbital environment. But if they do take off, Newman thinks it will change the world of work drastically. How wider internet coverage will affect work Madgavkar says that what’s happening in India is an early indicator of how other economies might change, should internet coverage reach all corners of the planet. She explains that the vast majority of Indian workers are engaged in informal or self-employed work known as “micro enterprises”. Like the lunch runners, this is work that could conceivably be arranged via apps – Uber for anything. There is evidence that the arrival of high-speed internet access, if it spreads widely enough, can enhance productivity and transform local economies.  In India, for instance, farmers and fishers using mobile phones to check prices and weather conditions increased profits by 8%. There may be less predictable effects. One McKinsey report explains that women-owned micro, small and medium enterprises in Indonesia generate 35% of the country’s ecommerce revenue. For offline women-owned businesses of the same sizes, that share drops to just 15%. Madgavkar says greater connectivity means more opportunities for remote workers. Bank employees, for instance, can offer services to customers via phone. People can be trained remotely for service-based or advisory roles and do much of the work from afar too. With satellite internet, the numbers applying for such jobs could boom. Online freelancing platforms like oDesk could also swell. A 2015 research paper discusses how these sites are being used by online workers in Southeast Asia. The paper gives the example of Amy, a Filipina woman with five siblings. The main breadwinner for her family, she switched from working in a call centre to working as a remote personal assistant for an American woman selling art on Etsy. Amy found herself earning double what she made in the call centre job.  Soon, the biggest hurdle to all this won’t be technology but an older bugbear: lack of education. Literacy has improved slightly in India recently; however, a quarter of its population still cannot read or write. Many other countries face the same problem. Internet access – for those who can afford it – can’t solve everything. Avoiding the downsides of internet-powered work As well, there is a darker side to jobs created by the internet. Besides concerns that platforms like Uber and Deliveroo may disadvantage workers, there are also entirely new categories of job that will seem mind-numbingly menial to many. These include “click work” – such as highly repetitive image-tagging to train artificial neural networks in pattern recognition. This sort of thing helps fine tune the algorithms that big tech firms use in their products. Mark Graham, a professor of internet geography at the Oxford Internet Institute, has visited huge offices in Africa where workers sit at desks doing tasks like this for hours on end. The scale of it shocked him. “Hundreds of people all focusing intently on their screens,” he describes it. “And there is fierce competition on these platforms.” There are more click workers than click work, it turns out. As the next 100 million people get connected, and the next, competition will only get fiercer. “It makes it harder for you as an individual worker to command a higher wage,” explains Graham. “Someone on the other side of the planet can do the same job for a much lower rate.” Graham points out that it’s not just menial click work that can be farmed out to emerging economies. Opportunities in web development, programming and design are also coming to regions with improving internet access. This raises the question of whether we all might find ourselves fighting to keep our jobs – once we become part of a truly global and connected workforce. To be fair, outsourcing is not possible for every role – there is a long history of companies failing to relocate operations to countries with lower wages. But if outsourcing does become easier and cheaper thanks to technology, some employees who were never threatened with it before will soon find themselves affected. A global race to the bottom, with terrible payments and working conditions, might ensue.  “I think we all need to be careful about making sure transformation and reorganisations don’t represent a fundamental erosion in the rights that we have as workers and the quality of our jobs,” adds Graham. We’re at least five to ten years away from seeing one of these satellite networks come online, says Alzbeta Fellenbaum, a market analyst at IHS Markit. But in the context of a person’s career, that’s not a very long time. Today, superior internet connectivity can still elevate one country’s workforce above another. But that might not last forever.    "
economic indicators,States 'may need to build more houses itself',2024-09-15,2023-12-20,By John Fernandez,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-67749809,"The States may need to build its own housing, rather than rely on the Guernsey Housing Association (GHA), the lead politician on social housing says.  Deputy Peter Roffey said the GHA was acting ""cautiously"" around new building and ""rapid expansion"" was needed. A report found Guernsey's housing market was in a ""systemic market failure"" and that ""action is needed"". The GHA's chief executive said the States had to explore options to deal with ""an overheated housing market"". The GHA is an independent group backed by the States to provide additional social housing as part of the States' housing programme. Victoria Slade, who took over as chief executive in October 2022, said: ""It's for the States to determine the form and function of any new entity. ""As a housing association, we are keen to do our bit, and the scale of housing need on the island means we are one part of the much wider solutions needed to tackle the imbalance in the housing market."" Figures in the report revealed an average-priced property now costs more than 16.3 times as much as average earnings, compared to 16 in Jersey and 8.3 times in England. Mr Roffey, the Employment and Social Security Committee president, complimented the GHA on its work since its inception: ""The GHA is marvellous and will continue to contribute in a major way to solving our housing problem. ""I do think they are more risk-averse and slightly more cautious, and are looking more cautiously now, reinvesting in their existing stock and perhaps expanding a bit more slowly. ""We may need to look at doing it ourselves or at other partners."" The GHA's annual report for 2022 showed the agency managed 1,033 homes and 16 new properties were built for it last year.  Guernsey's 2024 budget includes an ability for Policy and Resources to agree up to £150m in new borrowing to be spent on housing.  Mr Roffey said he made sure that money could be given to any housebuilding entity, including the GHA or the States itself. Economic Development Committee President Neil Inder has expressed frustrations with the pace of housebuilding locally. He said: ""I just cannot believe how long this has taken.  ""We have been talking about the Fontaine Vinery for five years and still it's derelict. We've talked about Leale's Yard for 15 years and it's still derelict."" Earlier this year, the GHA asked for the planning decision on the Fontaine Vinery to be delayed because of ""environmental concerns"". Deputy Inder said he was frustrated that ""absolutely nothing is happening in this area at all and it is depressing"".  ""If the GHA can't do it, I'll do it!"" he said. New Policy and Resources Committee President Lyndon Trott has signalled getting more houses built was to be one of his top priorities for the job, as he believed people were leaving because of the lack of affordable properties. In the last two years, the States of Guernsey has spent millions of pounds purchasing a number of sites on which the GHA is set to build housing. Mrs Slade said: ""The Strategic Housing Needs Indicator, published earlier this year by the States, highlights that an additional 721 additional affordable homes would be required between 2023 and 2027. ""To put that number in context, we have grown from zero to just over 1,000 homes in 20 years, and, until recently, during a period of low interest rate borrowing and low inflation. But those economic conditions don't exist any more. ""We want and are doing our bit to try to help meet housing need, but we also have a duty to properly manage our resources within that new reality."" She added: ""Our homes are getting older now, and need more investment; so we need to balance spend on new homes against increasing levels of spend on existing homes, and making sure we pay back existing and new borrowing."" Kenilworth Vinery was bought by the States in November 2021 for £6.5m and has been earmarked for 131 new properties.  The GHA wants to build 66 flats for key workers at the Domaine des Moulins, formerly CI Tyres, in the Charroterie. However, the lack of progress means some politicians are looking at alternatives in a bid to alleviate the current housing crisis. Follow BBC Guernsey on Twitter and Facebook.

economic indicators,Snapshot shows economic strategy progress,2024-09-15,2023-12-24,By Alex Blake,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-67801940,"The Manx government's economic strategy has shown ""signs of growth"" in its first year, the chief minister has said. The 10-to-15-year plan was launched in November 2022 with a number of targets to grow the working population. Alfred Cannan said the report was an ""overarching snapshot"" of  ""early indicators of progress"".  He said despite the ""economic challenges"" the report had shown things were moving forward positively. However Mr Cannan said there was ""still work to do over the coming years to ensure long term security, vibrancy and sustainability"", and the ""full value"" of the strategy would be ""felt over the long-term"". Government hopes to grow the population to 100,000 by 2037 and create 5,000 new employment opportunities.  The report said jobs had risen by 3% since November 2022 with 1,500 new roles, and there was a ""general trend of population growth"" with an average 90 to 100 more people each quarter. The plan's next target is to reach 1,800 new jobs by 2026. The first year report outlined that government had received an estimated £40m ahead of what was budgeted in income tax receipts, however a final figure on that would be announced in February's budget. It also stated market volatility and ""some large expenditures"" had effected the government's ""externally invested reserves"", which had fallen from more than £2bn in 2021 to £1.7m in 2023. Next year's focus was redesigning the Department for Enterprise's support schemes, which were ""a key factor"" in attracting and growing businesses, the report stated. Treasury Minister Alex Allinson said the year had seen ""growing numbers of people employed, new housing developments going through planning approval, and increasing tax receipts"". While the island had tackled cost of living challenges throughout 2023, he said there were positive signs of economic strength. The report will be presented to Tynwald in January.

economic indicators,The upsides of being grumpy,2024-09-15,2016-08-10,Zaria Gorvett,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160809-why-it-pays-to-be-grumpy-and-bad-tempered,"Being bad-tempered and pessimistic helps you to earn more, live longer and enjoy a healthier marriage. It’s almost enough to put a smile on the dourest of faces. On stage he’s a loveable, floppy-haired prince charming. Off camera – well let’s just say he needs a lot of personal space. He hates being a celebrity. He resents being an actor. To his ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley's friends he was apparently known as ‘Grumpelstiltskin’. Hugh Grant may be famed for being moody and a little challenging to work with. But could a grumpy attitude be the secret to his success? The pressure to be positive has never been greater. Cultural forces have whipped up a frenzied pursuit of happiness, spawning billion-dollar book sales, a cottage industry in self-help and plastering inspirational quotes all over the internet. Now you can hire a happiness expert, undertake training in ‘mindfulness’, or seek inner satisfaction via an app. The US army currently trains its soldiers – over a million people – in positive psychology and optimism is taught in UK schools. Meanwhile the ‘happiness index’ has become an indicator of national wellbeing to rival GDP. The truth is, pondering the worst has some clear advantages. Cranks may be superior negotiators, more discerning decision-makers and cut their risk of having a heart attack. Cynics can expect more stable marriages, higher earnings and longer lives – though, of course, they’ll anticipate the opposite. Good moods on the other hand come with substantial risks – sapping your drive, dimming attention to detail and making you simultaneously gullible and selfish. Positivity is also known to encourage binge drinking, overeating and unsafe sex. At the centre of it all is the notion our feelings are adaptive: anger, sadness and pessimism aren’t divine cruelty or sheer random bad luck – they evolved to serve useful functions and help us thrive.   Take anger. From Newton’s obsessive grudges to Beethoven’s tantrums – which sometimes came to blows – it seems as though visionary geniuses often come with extremely short tempers. There are plenty of examples to be found in Silicon Valley. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is famed for his angry outbursts and insults (such as “I’m sorry, did I take my stupid pills today?”) yet they haven’t stopped him building a $300 billion company. For years, the link remained a mystery. Then in 2009 Matthijs Baas from the University of Amsterdam decided to investigate. He recruited a group of willing students and set to work making them angry in the name of science. Half the students were asked to recall something which had irritated them and write a short essay about it. “This made them a bit angrier, though they weren’t quite driven to full-blown fits of rage,” he says. The other half of the group were made to feel sad. Next the two teams were pitched against each other in a game designed to test their creativity. They had 16 minutes to think of as many ways as possible to improve education at the psychology department. As Baas expected, the angry team produced more ideas – at least to begin with. Their contributions were also more original, repeated by less than 1% of the study’s participants. Crucially, angry volunteers were better at moments of haphazard innovation, or so-called “unstructured” thinking. Let’s say you’re challenged to think about possible uses for a brick. While a systematic thinker might suggest ten different kinds of building, it takes a less structured approach to invent a new use altogether, such as turning it into a weapon. In essence, creativity is down to how easily your mind is diverted from one thought path and onto another. In a situation requiring fight or flight, it’s easy to see how turning into a literal “mad genius” could be life-saving. “Anger really prepares the body to mobilise resources – it tells you that the situation you’re in is bad and gives you an energetic boost to get you out of it,” says Baas. To understand how this works, first we need to get to grips with what’s going on in the brain. Like most emotions, anger begins in the amygdala, an almond-shaped structure responsible for detecting threats to our well-being. It’s extremely efficient – raising the alarm long before the peril enters your conscious awareness.  Then it’s up to chemical signals in the brain to get you riled up. As the brain is flooded with adrenaline it initiates a burst of impassioned, energetic fury which lasts for several minutes. Breathing and heart rate accelerate and blood pressure skyrockets. Blood rushes into the extremities, leading to the distinctive red face and throbbing forehead veins people get when they’re annoyed. Though it’s thought to have evolved primarily to prepare the body for physical aggression, this physiological response is known to have other benefits, boosting motivation and giving people the gall to take mental risks. All these physiological changes are extremely helpful – as long as you get a chance to vent your anger by wrestling a lion or screaming at co-workers. Sure, you might alienate a few people, but afterwards your blood pressure should go back to normal. Avoiding grumpiness has more serious consequences. The notion that repressed feelings can be bad for your health is ancient. The Greek philosopher Aristotle was a firm believer in catharsis (he invented the modern meaning of the word); viewing tragic plays, he conjectured, allowed punters to experience anger, sadness and guilt in a controlled environment. By getting it all out in the open, they could purge themselves of these feelings all in one go. His philosophy was later adopted by Sigmund Freud, who instead championed the cathartic benefits of the therapist’s couch. Then in 2010 a team of scientists decided to take a look. They surveyed a group of 644 patients with coronary artery disease to determine their levels of anger, suppressed anger and tendency to experience distress, and followed them for between five and ten years to see what happened next. Over the course of the study, 20% experienced a major cardiac event and 9% percent died. Initially it looked like both anger and suppressed anger increased the likelihood of having a heart attack. But after controlling for other factors, the researchers realised anger had no impact – while suppressing it increased the chances of having a heart attack by nearly three-fold. It’s still not known exactly why this occurs, but other studies have shown that suppressing anger can lead to chronic high blood pressure. And not all benefits are physical: anger can help with negotiating, too. A major flashpoint for aggression is the discovery that someone does not value your interests highly enough. It involves inflicting costs – the threat of physical violence – and withdrawing benefits – loyalty, friendship, or money – to help them see their mistake. Support for this theory comes from the faces we pull when angry. Research suggests they aren’t arbitrary movements at all, but specifically aimed at increasing our physical strength in the eyes of our opponent. Get it right and aggression can help you advance your interests and increase your status – it’s just an ancient way of bargaining. In fact, scientists are increasingly recognising that grumpiness may be beneficial to the full range of social skills – improving language skills, memory and making us more persuasive. “Negative moods indicate we’re in a new and challenging situation and call for a more attentive, detailed and observant thinking style,” says Joseph Forgas, who has been studying how emotions affect our behaviour for nearly four decades. In line with this, research has also found that feeling slightly down enhances our awareness of social cues. Intriguingly, it also encourages people to act in a more – not less – fair way towards others. Harsh, but fair Though happiness is often thought of as intrinsically virtuous, the emotion brings no such benefits. In one study, a group of volunteers was made to feel disgusted, sad, angry, fearful, happy, surprised or neutral and invited to play the “ultimatum game”. In the game, the first player is given some money and asked how they’d like to divide it between themselves and another player. Then the second player gets to decide whether or not to accept. If they agree, the money is split how the first player proposed. If not, neither player gets any money. The ultimatum game is often used as a test of our sense of fairness by showing whether you expect to get a 50-50 share or whether you are happy for each person to be in it for themselves. Interestingly, all negative emotions led to more rejections by the second player, which might suggest that these feelings enhance our sense of fairness and the need for everyone to be treated equally. Reversing the set-up reveals this is not just a case of sour grapes, either. The “dictator game” has exactly the same rules except this time the second player has no say whatsoever – they simply receive whatever the first player decides not to keep. It turns out that happier participants keep more of the prize for themselves, while those in a sad mood are significantly less selfish. “People who are feeling slightly down pay better attention to external social norms and expectations, and so they act in a fairer and just way towards others,” says Forgas. In some situations, happiness carries far more serious risks. It’s associated with the cuddle hormone, oxytocin, which a handful of studies have shown reduces our ability to identify threats. In prehistoric times, happiness would have left our ancestors vulnerable to predators. In modern life, it prevents us paying due attention to dangers such as binge drinking, overeating and unsafe sex. “Happiness functions like a shorthand signal that we’re safe and it’s not necessary to pay too much attention to the environment,” he says. Those in a continuous happy haze may miss important cues. Instead, they may be over-reliant on existing knowledge – leaving them prone to serious errors of judgement. In one study, Forgas and colleagues from the University of New South Wales, Australia, put volunteers in either a happy or sad mood by screening films in the laboratory. Then he asked them to judge the truth of urban myths, such as that power lines cause leukaemia or the CIA murdered President Kennedy. Those in a good mood were less able to think sceptically and were significantly more gullible. Next Forgas used a first-person shooter game to test if good moods might also lead people to rely on stereotyping. As he predicted, those in a good mood were more likely to aim at targets wearing turbans. Of all the positive emotions, optimism about the future may have the most ironic effects. Like happiness, positive fantasies about the future can be profoundly de-motivating. “People feel accomplished, they relax, and they do not invest the necessary effort to actually realise these positive fantasies and daydreams,” says Gabriele Oettingen from New York University. Graduates who fantasise about success at work end up earning less, for instance. Patients who daydream about getting better make a slower recovery. In numerous studies, Oettingen has shown that the more wishful your thinking, the less likely any of it is to come true. “People say ‘dream it and you will get it’ – but that’s problematic,” she says. Optimistic thoughts may also put the obese off losing weight and make smokers less likely to plan to quit. Defensive pessimism Perhaps most worryingly, Oettingen believes the risks may operate on a societal level, too. When she compared articles in the newspaper USA Today with economic performance a week or a month later, she found that the more optimistic the content, the more performance declined. Next she looked at presidential inaugural addresses – and found that more positive speeches predicted a lower employment rate and GDP in during their time in office. Combine these unnerving findings with optimism bias – the tendency to believe you’re less at risk of things going wrong than other people – and you’re asking for trouble. Instead, you might want to consider throwing away your rose-tinted spectacles and adopting a glass half-empty outlook. “Defensive pessimism” involves employing Murphy’s Law, the cosmic inevitability that whatever can go wrong, will go wrong. By anticipating the worst, you can be prepared when it actually happens. It works like this. Let’s say you’re giving a talk at work. All you have to do is think of the worst possible outcomes – tripping up on your way to the stage, losing the memory stick which contains your slides, computer difficulties, awkward questions (truly accomplished pessimists will be able to think of many, many more) – and hold them in your mind. Next you need to think of some solutions. Psychologist Julie Norem from Wellesley College, Massachusetts, is an expert pessimist. “I’m a little clumsy, especially when I’m anxious, so I make sure to wear low-heeled shoes. I get there early to scope out the stage and make sure that there aren’t cords or other things to trip over. I typically have several backups for my slides: I can give the talk without them if necessary, I email a copy to the organizers, carry a copy on a flash drive, and bring my own laptop to use…” she says. Only the paranoid survive, as they say. So the next time someone tells you to “cheer up” – why not tell them how you’re improving your sense of fairness, reducing unemployment and saving the world economy? You’ll be having the last laugh – even if it is a world-weary, cynical snort. -- Join 600,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn and Instagram.

economic indicators,Why are we having less sex?,2024-09-15,2017-05-09,Simon Copland,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170508-the-many-reasons-that-people-are-having-less-sex,"The average sex life appears to be dwindling - and it may reflect some troubling anxieties at the heart of modern society, says Simon Copland. We live in one of the most sexually liberated times of human history. Access to new technologies over the past 40 years, whether it is the contraceptive pill, or dating apps such as Grindr and Tinder, have opened a new world of possibilities. As the sexual revolution of the 1970s matured, societal norms shifted with it, with increasing acceptance of homosexuality, divorce, pre-marital sex, and alternative relationships such as polyamory and swinging. Despite this, research suggests that we’re actually having less sex now than we have for decades. In March, American researchers Jean Twenge, Ryne Sherman and Brooke Wells published an article in the Archives of Sexual Behavior showing that Americans were having sex on average nine fewer times per year in the early 2010s compared to the late 1990s – a 15% drop from 62 times a year to just 53. The declines were similar across gender, race, region, educational level and work status, with married people reporting the most significant drops. While it could be easy to dismiss this as a one-off, or a symptom of the challenges of researching people’s sex lives, this is another point in a growing trend across the world. In 2013, the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal) found that British people between ages 16 and 44 had sex just under five times per month. This was a drop from the previous survey, released in 2000, where men were recorded to have sex 6.2 times a month, and women 6.3 times. In 2014 the Australian National Survey of Sexual Activity showed that people in heterosexual relationships were having sex on average 1.4 times per week, down from 1.8 times 10 years earlier. The situation is perhaps most severe in Japan, where recent data has shown that 46% of women and 25% of men between the ages of 16 and 25 ‘despise’ sexual contact. Why is this happening? While there are many simple conclusions available, BBC Future dug deeper and found a situation that is quite complex. Porn blame An easy first conclusion to make is that increased access to technology is to blame. Two technologies are usually targeted: online pornography and social media. With the growth of online pornography, researchers have focused on its addictive potential, with some trying to label ‘internet sex addiction’ as an official psychiatric disorder. As an addiction, it is argued that porn acts as a replacement for real-life sex, limiting our sexual desire in the bedroom. Porn is also blamed for its unrealistic imagery, with researchers arguing this can create symptoms such as ‘sexual anorexia’, or ‘porn induced sexual dysfunction’. In 2011, a survey of 28,000 porn viewers in Italy found that many engaged in an “excessive” consumption of porn sites. The daily use of porn, researcher Carlo Foresta argued, means that these people became inured to “even the most violent” images. According to this theory, these unrealistic images found in porn make it difficult for men in particular to get aroused when encountering the real thing, resulting in them becoming ‘hopeless’ in the bedroom. Some researchers have even argued there is a link between porn and marriage rates. In a study in 2014, researchers Michael Malcolm and George Naufal surveyed 1,500 participants in the United States to analyse how 18 to 35 year-olds used the internet, and what impact this had on their romantic lives. The results, published in the Eastern Economic Journal, found a strong correlation between high levels of internet use and low marriage rates, a factor that was even more significant for men who viewed online pornography on a regular basis. And it’s not just pornography. Social media in particular has been blamed as a distraction, with people obsessing over their screens instead of their sexual lives. This is an extension of research that previously suggested having a TV in a couple's bedroom significantly reduces sexual activity. It would make sense that the intrusion of social media devices into all aspects of our lives could have a similar effect.  But there are good reasons to question both of these conclusions. Researchers are split on the impact of pornography on our sexual lives, with many debating the existence of ‘internet sex addiction’ in the first place. Others have noted the potential for pornography to enhance sexual activity. For example, in 2015 an article in the journal Sexual Medicine found that watching at least 40 minutes of porn at least twice a week boosted people’s libido and desire to have sex. This study tested the libido of 280 men measured against their use of pornography. The research found a strong correlation between the amount of time spent viewing porn and the desire to have sex, with those who watched over two hours of porn per week having the highest levels of arousal. These results were noted as well by Twenge, Sherman and Wells in their research, who, despite finding overall drops in sexual activity, found no difference in sexual activity amongst those who frequently watched pornography. The same can be said for social media. While social devices can certainly provide a distraction they also provide increasing avenues to access ‘sex on tap’. In fact research has shown that apps such as Grindr and Tinder may speed up people's sexual lives, enabling sex on dates earlier and more regularly. While technology definitely impacts our sexual lives, it cannot be blamed solely for the noted reductions in sexual activity. Chained to the desk Despite early dreams of a population liberated from work, our jobs seems to be intruding even further into our lives. Work hours remain extremely high across the Western world, with data recently showing that the average full-time employee in the US works 47 hours per week. It may seem logical to conclude that the fatigue and stress of work may lead to drops in sexual activity. However it is not quite as simple as that. In 1998 for example Janet Hyde, John DeLamater and Erri Hewitt found in their research, published in the Journal of Family Psychology, that there was no reduction in sexual activity, satisfaction or desire between women who were homemakers and women who were employed either part-time or full-time. Contrary to the rest of their findings, Twenge, Sherman and Wells actually found that a busy work life correlated with higher sexual frequency. But that does not mean work does not have an impact; instead, it’s the quality, rather than the quantity, of our work that matters. Having a bad job can be worse for your mental health than having no job, and this extends to our sexual lives as well. Stress in particular is increasingly being seen as the core indicator of drops in sexual activity and sexual happiness. In 2010, for example, Guy Bodenmenn at the University of Zurich and his research team studied one hundred and three female students in Switzerland across a three month period, finding that higher self-reported stress was associated with lower levels of sexual activity and satisfaction. There are multiple impacts of stress, including changing hormone levels, contributing to negative body image, making us question relationships and partners, and increasing levels of drug and alcohol use. All of these have correlations between drops in sexual activity and sexual drive. It’s about modern life There are many other reasons to think that changes in our mental health and wellbeing may be damaging our sex lives. While Twenge, Sherman and Wells discounted both pornography use and work hours as causes behind the drops in sexual activity, the researchers argued the drops may be due to increasing levels of unhappiness. Western societies in particular have seen a mental health epidemic in the past few decades, focused primarily around depression and anxiety disorders. There is a strong correlation between depressive symptoms and reduction in sexual activity and desire. Conducting a review of relevant studies for the Journal of Sexual Medicine, Evan Atlantis and Thomas Sullivan at the University of Adelaide found significant evidence that depression leads to increases in sexual dysfunction and reductions in sexual desire. Bringing this evidence together with the noted increases mental health issues, Twenge, Sherman and Wells argue there is a causal link between drops in happiness and average drops in sexual activity. Research connects these mental health epidemics with the increasingly insecure nature of modern life, particularly for younger generations. It is this generation that has shown the highest drops in sexual activity, with research from Jean Twenge showing millennials are reporting having fewer sexual encounters than either Generation X or the baby boomers did at the same age. Job and housing insecurity, the fear of climate change, and the destruction of communal spaces and social life, have all been found to connect to mental health problems.  Drops in sexual activity could be argued, therefore, to reflect the nature of modern life. This phenomenon cannot be equated with one problem or another, but is in fact the culmination of many things. It is the creation of the stresses of modern life – a mixture of work, insecurity and technology. Some may celebrate drops in sexual activity as a rejection of loosening sexual mores. But sex is important. It increases happiness, makes you healthier, and even makes you more satisfied at work. Most importantly, for the vast majority of people, sex is fun.  It is for these reasons that people around the world are trying to find ways to deal with this issue. In February this year Per-Erik Muskos, a councilman from the town of Overtornea in Sweden, introduced a proposal to provide the municipality’s 550 employees a subsidised hour each week to go home and have sex. Muskos talked up the benefits of sex, saying his proposal could “be an opportunity for couples to have their own time, only for each other.” Japan has been trying to deal with this issue for a long time, particularly over fears of a plummeting birth rate. Parents in Japan are now being provided cash for having children, while for years companies have been encouraged to give citizens more time off work to procreate. This has involved one of the country’s large economic organisations, Keidanren, encouraging its 1,600 corporate members to allow their employees to spend more time with their families. Meanwhile, local authorities have encouraged procreation through a range of measures, including providing shopping vouchers to larger families and launching government-sanctioned matchmaker websites. The Australian government pursued something similar for many years, providing a ‘baby bonus’ to new parents up until 2014. The problem with these proposals is that they are inevitably just a band-aid. While additional time off work and government incentives may have short-term effects, they do not deal with the structural problems behind the drops in happiness that may be dampening sex drives. Just as this problem is multi-dimensional, so the solutions must be multi-dimensional as well. Tackling the sexual decline will require dealing with the very causes of the mental health crisis facing Western worlds – a crisis that is underpinned by job and housing insecurity, fears of climate change, and the loss of communal and social spaces. Doing so will not just help people with their sex lives, but benefit health and wellbeing overall.  -- Join 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.

economic indicators,The last chance to see the Titanic?,2024-09-15,2018-10-02,Peter Rubinstein,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20181001-is-this-the-last-chance-to-see-the-titanic,"Deep-sea bacteria are quickly consuming the Titanic. One company is offering tickets to visit it one last time – and to help measure its deterioration. Renata Rojas paddled behind her father through the water off the coast of Cozumel, Mexico. She was only five years old; never before had she been allowed out this far. Now, as she glided across the waves, her father stopped her and told her to look down to the sea floor. There, illuminated by the sunlight, was a sunken plane. She breathed through her snorkel as she studied its wings resting on the white sand. It was in this moment that she discovered an eternal love for the ocean. “It’s almost like space opens up. It’s very serene,” she remembers today, decades later. In 2019, following a lifetime of scuba training and saving money, Rojas is scheduled to fulfil her grandest dream: visiting the wreck of the RMS Titanic. This is a dream that has become increasingly urgent over the years. Rust-forming bacteria are rapidly consuming the Titanic. Experts predict it will last only a little more than 20 years. That means that the group of select paying passengers which Rojas is joining won’t only be the first to lay eyes on the wreck since 2005, they will also be among the last to see it at all. And while the expedition is a commercial venture, it is a scientific one too: the group will use advanced 3D-modelling tools to analyse and preserve the memory of the Titanic for generations to come. You might also like: The Titanic struck an iceberg on 14 April 1912 as it steamed across the Atlantic on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. It split in two and sank to a depth of 3.8km (2.5 miles) about 600km (370 miles) off the shores of Newfoundland, Canada. At least 1,500 people died. Engulfed by deep-sea darkness, the wreck sat for more than 70 years while bacteria ate away at its metal hull, leaving behind millions of delicate, icicle-shaped formations. “Now, there’s more life on Titanic than there was floating on the surface,” says Lori Johnston, microbial ecologist and a six-time visitor of the wreck. These ‘rusticles’ are the by-products of bacteria that oxidise the iron they consume. The acidic, oxidised fluid oozes downward with gravity, forming fragile branches of rust. “The rusticles are unique because they’re kind of the dominant species down there,” Johnston says. By the time explorer Robert Ballard and his team discovered the ship in 1985, the rusticles had already taken over. Because they eat about 180kg (400lbs) a day, scientists have given the ship a waning life expectancy. “If it’s going faster, which we hypothesise, it’s going to be less and less of a timeframe,” says Johnston. According to her research, Titanic might be a recognisable shipwreck for just 20 to 50 more years. Last chance As the clock ticks down, the window of opportunity to visit the Titanic, for scientific purposes or otherwise, is quickly vanishing. One new opportunity is with OceanGate, a private company that uses its small fleet of manned submersibles to explore, research and catalogue the oceans surrounding North America. OceanGate has undertaken 13 expeditions since its founding in 2009, including surveys of other shipwrecks like the Andrea Doria near Nantucket and the SS Dix in Puget Sound. Not until the 2019 Titanic expedition, however, have they welcomed paying passengers who don’t have distinct expertise in marine science or research. Chosen “mission specialists”, as OceanGate calls them, will embark on 11-day journeys in groups of nine beginning late June 2019 and ending mid-August. They will fly from St John’s, Newfoundland via helicopter to rendezvous with a support ship at sea, which will be their home base during the mission. Most importantly, they will be able to join at least one submersible dive to the Titanic. Down below, while crammed together inside the newly-updated Titan submersible, mission specialists will aid the crew in using sophisticated lasers, sonars and imaging technology to composite the most detailed and accurate 3D model of the ship in history. A ticket for the 11-day excursion and all of its amenities costs $105,129 (£81,300) – equivalent to the cost of first-class passage on the Titanic’s fateful voyage in 1912, adjusted for inflation. At first, the idea of non-professionals sinking to the bottom of the ocean – where the water temperature is 1C (34F) and the pressure is strong enough to crush them like a tin can – seems alarming. But to Joel Perry, president of OceanGate Expeditions and a diver for close to 30 years, safety is no issue. “It’s certainly not as dangerous as it might appear; we don’t just take anybody with us,” he says. “We go through a fairly rigorous process to screen folks and make sure they are appropriate.” Perry says there is an explicit understanding that the applicants must be physically and mentally suitable for a week at sea. “Think about, is this somebody you want to be in the car with for eight hours with the windows rolled up?” In addition to a generally affable personality and proven physical fitness, all mission specialists will have to go through four hours of ‘helicopter egress training’ (learning what to do in the case of crashing) before departure. They’ll practice in a sinking helicopter cockpit in a large pool. The applicants they accept are ones with track records like Rojas’, or as Perry calls her: “client number one”. “She’s had a passion for ocean exploration and the Titanic forever. Her nickname in the diving world is Mighty Mouse,” he says. The first indicator, and perhaps the most crucial, is her long history of diving experience. Even as a young adult, Rojas shocked her instructors with courage in the face of crisis. “One of my first times diving alone without my dad, I had an emergency,” Rojas says. “I went into a hole and broke an air valve.” Her regulator, which attaches to the air tank, hadn’t been properly maintained. The O-ring inside the attachment exploded, letting out her air while she was 18m (60ft) underwater. Rather than lose her cool, however, Rojas swam to her instructor and borrowed some air from his tank. “He’s asking if I’m okay and I said ‘yeah, I want to keep diving.’ Most people panic and surface.” From free dives in the Caribbean and Arctic to advanced cave diving and even centrifuge training – the kind used by astronauts to familiarise themselves with the effects of G-force – Rojas’ seasoned repertoire is something OceanGate hopes to find in other expedition candidates. The other trait that makes Rojas such an ideal mission specialist is her lifelong passion for everything Titanic. For her, it all began with the black-and-white film from 1953, which she first saw as a child. Her fascination with the glamour of the ship and the mystery of its tragic demise never left her. Even today, she proudly collects piles of Titanic books, magazines and newspaper clippings in her New York City home. “I’ve seen every movie, not read every book,” she admits. “I’ve probably missed a few.” When the wreck was discovered in 1985, Rojas immediately changed her career to oceanography and began saving money for her own trip. She met Ballard himself, but the explorer told her that no-one would be making another expedition to the site. She was crushed. She returned to her previous job, banking. Two years later, she watched on television as William F Buckley emerged from a submersible following his own Titanic voyage. “He wasn’t an oceanographer,” Rojas says. “He was just a millionaire.” She knew then: Ballard was wrong. With the right organisation and funding, visiting the wreck was still possible. It wasn’t until 2012, nearly 30 years after Titanic was found, that Rojas was able to secure a ticket on a commercial dive with Deep Ocean Expeditions (DOE). It would be a centennial journey, a sombre yet uniquely special chance to honour the 100th anniversary of the ship’s sinking. Rojas sent emails to DOE every few weeks to make sure everything was on schedule. But in February, just two months before departure, the trip was cancelled. “I cannot even describe the sadness,” Rojas says. “It took me about a year to get a grip and start thinking about it again.” Surf war The prospect of visiting the Titanic wreck has been controversial since its discovery. According to David Concannon, an expedition leader and attorney who has represented OceanGate in the past, Ballard and his French crew began arguing over jurisdiction and access less than 24 hours after they surfaced in 1985. The back-and-forth resulted in Ballard spearheading the creation of an international agreement to leave the wreck alone – which the French promptly ignored. Ever since, the governments of Britain, France, the US and Canada have been locked in a turf war against private individuals and companies like OceanGate seeking to visit Titanic. “It has always been about control,” says Concannon, who currently advises OceanGate. “Who gets to control the site, the recovery of artefacts, the filming, and the battles over the last 30 years have been about control. And when you look at it that way, the smoke begins to clear.” Today, Concannon calls the guidelines and restrictions from Noaa (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and others “draconian”. For their part, Noaa believe that Titanic visits, even ones that don’t seek to salvage artefacts, are disturbances to its architectural integrity and to its status as an underwater cultural heritage site and memorial. Fortunately for OceanGate, however, there is not much in the way of enforcing Noaa’s rules. Threats of legal retaliation have been tested in the past, never with any real follow-through. “If they try to impose restrictions, no-one’s going to adhere,” Concannon says. “They’re just going to show up, dive, do what they want, and leave.” This oceanic free-for-all is made easier because of how far the wreck is from the Canadian shore. Territorial water boundaries stop at 19km (12 miles) and economic boundaries at 160km (100 miles), Concannon says. The Titanic is 600km (370 miles) away from Newfoundland. In other words: in the high seas. Despite bristling at Noaa’s guidelines, Perry says OceanGate intends to follow them. Their mission in 2019, other than giving participants the trip of a lifetime, is to use 3D-mapping technology to capture the wreck in its entirety for the first time in 10 years. The Titan submersible will be outfitted with sonars and laser scanners courtesy of media company Virtual Wonders to capture billions of spatial data points from the Titanic. The result, after a pass through a liquid-cooled super computer, will be an ultra-high-resolution 3D model unlike anything made before. “What we’ll get this year is the bow section in great detail, and the aft section in good detail,” says CEO Mark Bauman. “It’s going to take years to map the interior. Each year we’ll get better and better.” By making multiple passes over the ship during OceanGate’s six-week expedition schedule, Bauman says they might even be able to see the volumetric change from the bacteria happen in real time. “This should give us something to triangulate it against the last measurements that were made on the Titanic. It should allow us to time the projections of when the Titanic will just be a rust stain on the floor.” Perry says the 3D models and data will be given freely to scientists and researchers who wish to use them in their work, an approach consistent with how Noaa have treated their own visual content from the wreck. A portion of the material will also be made available for education and outreach purposes through the company’s non-profit, OceanGate Foundation. For everyone else, Bauman hopes to create immersive experiences for different entertainment mediums. “We plan to put out AR apps and VR apps, we plan to probably sell it into video games, people will be able to fly the sub down themselves,” Bauman says. “It’ll look better than 3D Imax resolution.” OceanGate’s mission specialists will help to collect this data from both inside the submersible and aboard the support ship, a novel concept that specifically attracted Rojas to the journey. She has eagerly tracked the company’s progress ever since she met them five years ago. “I want to be involved in everything, but mainly submersible operations or communication with the surface,” she says. “We are not tourists. We are actually part of the crew.” If she’s lucky, Rojas will even be able to pilot the sub using its unique steering wheel: a wireless PlayStation game controller. “I’m putting all my bets with OceanGate. I do believe they will be successful.” It’s for this reason that Rojas feels the steep price of a ticket is worth every penny. Not only will she witness a site seen only by a handful of people, but she will be directly involved in every inch of the journey. For her and the other committed applicants, it’s all too good to pass up. Besides, she points out, a space flight is going for $250,000 (£190,000); an Everest trek can be $90,000 (£70,000). This, Perry says, “felt like the right number for the market”. Deep dive If all goes to plan, then in June 2019, Rojas will transfer from the support ship and climb down the ladder into the Titan from the top hatch. After taking her seat beside the other specialists, the hatch will close, and the sub will slowly descend into the blackness. She will hear the clicks and buzzes from inside and watch as condensation forms on the walls. When she finally touches down, the lights will turn on and she’ll be face to face with her dream: the Titanic in all of its ruined glory. “I’m going to feel very overwhelmed. After waiting for so long, I’m able to actually be in front of the shipwreck itself,” she says. “I also think it’s going to be a very sombre moment. The tragedy itself is a very sad event. It’s going to be emotional for me in both aspects.” “It is a gravesite,” Johnston says. “You have this moment of where you are and what you’re seeing. We are immensely respectful of that.” Some, including descendants of Titanic survivors, argue that visiting the wreck is a form of disrespect to the hundreds that perished in 1912. But to Johnston, doing so can create unique learning opportunities for generations that will come long after the ship is gone. It includes “everything from geography to oceanography to deep oceans to history to archaeology,” she says. “It’s part of history, so you want to bring that history to the people.” Rojas hopes to share her own insight from the journey with children as well. She wants them to know that a lifelong dream, even one like hers, is always in reach. “I was a kid one day who had a dream. If they have a dream and it seems big and insurmountable, they can make it happen,” she says. “I’m prepared to go.” -- A previous version of the story had date of the Titanic's sinking as 12 April.

economic indicators,Weighing up the web’s impact,2024-09-15,2014-11-18,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20120905-weighing-up-the-webs-impact,"The first attempt to rank countries by how much benefit their citizens get from the web has been unveiled. But what does it really mean for a country to come top or bottom of the web index? Sweden is the best country in the world at making the web work for its citizens, whilst Yemen and Zimbabwe are the least effective, according to a new global survey backed by the inventor of the world wide web, Tim Berners-Lee. The web index, as it is known, claims to be the “most comprehensive effort yet” to measure the impact of the web around the world and how it is changing people’s lives. It ranks countries by how much benefit their citizens derive from the web and how it has transformed areas such as politics, economics and society. It also assesses any barriers a country has to allowing its citizens to access a free and open web, finding that around 30% of countries face some sort of government restriction. The survey also revealed that just one in three people use the web globally, a number that drops to fewer than one in six in Africa. Sir Tim is the public face of the new index, but it was economist Hania Farhan who was tasked with building it. BBC Future caught up with her to find out how it was done and what it all means. Why build the web index? Tim Berners-Lee and others at the Web Foundation noticed there were lots of stories and anecdotes about how the web had transformed people’s lives through education, social networks, politics and so on. But there was very little data as such. So they said “why don’t we try to come up with an index to measure the value of the web and its impact on people?”  That was where I came in. I had been working on the Ibrahaim index of African governance [which annually ranks the quality of governance in Africa] for three years. My background is as a quantitative policy economist and I had experience of building those kinds of things. Where did you start? You start from the basic idea of how do you, as an individual, get value from the web. We broke it down into three basic components – infrastructure, content and impact. The first thing you need is to get on to the web. So, a country needs the communications infrastructure – broadband or a mobile device, electricity, access to computers etc. Then you also want the institutional infrastructure - you need to have a minimum level of literacy, you need freedom of access and you need to have policies that allow that freedom of access. With those two in place you are online. And then what? Then you need relevant content in a language you understand to be able to use it. So if I get on the web and it is all in Russian, I get zero value as I do not understand Russian, sadly. Then finally the third layer, which is arguably the most relevant - and the one we put the most emphasis on in the model - is the impact. That is measured in terms of political, social, economic, developmental impact etc. We then simply went out and scoured databases - from the likes of the World Bank, the UN, the ITU, the World Economic Forum, Reporters without Borders, Freedom House, etc - to find indicators to populate these various components of the index. In the end we chose 34 indicators from the data we found. Were there any questions you just couldn’t answer or find data for?  Some of the questions that many people kept asking were ‘how many pages are on the web?’ and ‘how many pages are there in each language?’ Those data do not exist because there is no centralised unit - a web central intelligence unit of sorts. When we looked at other questions, especially in the area of web impact, we could also see that there was a massive data gap.  So, I said let’s gather our own data. We identified experts in all 61 countries and asked them about 60 questions. For example, is the web used for political mobilisation in your country? They were all then reviewed by other experts to make sure that the scores were consistent and had evidence to back them up.  That gave us another 51 indicators and allowed us to plug some of the gaps in the data. All of the data was then put through the model - which weights different elements - to come up with the final scores.  What was the result?  In first place was Sweden, followed by the US, UK, Canada and Finland in that order. But taking into account margins of error, the four after Sweden are really not much different from each other. At the bottom, were Yemen, Zimbabwe, Burkina Faso, Benin and Ethiopia. What does it mean to be the top country or even the bottom country? That is the question isn’t it?  The idea is that if you are at the top, then the people in that country are - according to this index - getting the most value from the web. And at the bottom they are getting the least value. The index is a tool for leaders and policy makers so that they can use the web much more effectively to improve people’s lives, be it economic, social or political.  For example, a policy maker sitting in Iceland or Italy may look at Sweden’s ranking and ask why does the web seem to   serve  the people of Sweden apparently better than it does their own people... and therefore what can we do about it to make our citizens better served by the web?. They can zoom into the indicators and see how they can change their country’s performance. Similarly, Ghana might ask why Kenya ranks higher than it does. The lower you are in the rankings, the more indicators you may want to change to affect the lives of the people in that country. Some people may look at the index and see countries like China in 29th place ranking higher than they might expect, and countries like Japan and Korea [in 20th and 13th places respectively] ranking lower than you might expect. Can you explain this? The web index is an average number calculated from lots of underlying indicators. A country could therefore do relatively well in one or more area, say economic impact, but relatively poorly in other areas, say political impact. So, on average, it will score not so badly, but not so well either. In fact, China scores relatively poorly in the political and institutional components, but middling in all other areas. Hence, overall, on average, it ranks in the middle. Also, we need to keep in mind that rankings are always relative to how other countries are doing. They do not just reflect that country's own performance, but its performance relative to how the others are doing.  Why were there only 61 countries included? One of the reasons was getting consistent and comparable data. But to be honest, we were also limited on resources. Google kindly gave us the initial seed funding, but it is expensive to do this kind of thing, particularly collecting your own data. And so we ended up being able to choose close to 65 but we had to leave out a couple because we weren’t too happy with the results. We had to get a spread of countries across the different continents. So it wasn’t an active decision for instance to leave out Denmark or Saudi Arabia. We just needed to make a decision given the resources and the time limitations we had. The whole thing is framed in a very positive way, as if the web only has positive impacts. But there are also negative effects, like cybercrime and censorship. Did you take these into account? The negative impacts are a very important aspect to include. The problem was that there is so little data. There is anecdote and sometimes there is country specific data, but, as far as we could see, there hasn’t been much work done on that. For example, to what extent has criminal activity increased as a result of the web? We could not actually find any data for a large enough country sample for multiple years to be included. So, all we could do was put in a few questions in our own data survey. We have two questions – basically to what extent do you think that the web is making it easier to undertake criminal activities in your country and then the other side which is: are there laws against cybercrime in your country. So in answering that question, any expert needs to consider: do those laws exist and how effectively are they implemented. Of course we need many more questions answered in this area. Also, for now, the questions are framed in that way because they need to take into account cultural differences. That is a very difficult thing, which you have to handle very carefully. For example, how do you factor in that gambling is illegal in some countries?  Framing the questions was actually one of the most difficult parts of designing the survey. Will you try to fill these gaps in subsequent years?  One of the things I would like to do is for sure add more countries and add more survey questions to cover more of the areas, as well as the negative effects. We also want to work with other organisations that produce data that cover some of the dimensions of the web index and ask them to help us cover more countries. For example, Reporters without Borders produce something called Enemies of the Internet. It is totally descriptive and it covers a relatively small number of countries, meaning we can’t use it. So we need to work with organisations like them to expand the country coverage and try to quantify their results. Finally, you openly admit you are not a “techie”. Was that a problem? When I was first asked to construct and produce the index I told the Web Foundation that I wasn’t sure that I was the right person, as I had no clue about the back end of a computer. But they said that was not a problem and, in fact, it was my other skills they needed. I could see things from the point of view of the average user, and the index is targeted at a far wider audience than just techies. I would love to know how to write code and programme, and one day I might learn, but for now, I’m just about managing to keep up with their “special language”.

economic indicators,The gender-fluid look that fans love,2024-09-15,2021-03-09,Cameron Laux,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210308-the-empowering-androgynous-look-that-pop-fans-love,"Playing with gender norms has long been a part of rock-star charm and charisma. So what does Harry Styles' androgynous look tell us about masculinity and sex appeal, asks Cameron Laux. The British pop star Harry Styles is slim and somewhat androgynous, has lots of tattoos, floppy hair (a US writer calls it ""handsome-prince hair""), and an infectious grin. He gives the impression that butter wouldn't melt in his mouth. He is clearly prepared to have fun with his sexuality and masculinity, and has become known for expressing himself adventurously in ways that confound gender norms. A good example of this is  the Gucci outfit he wore when he was hosting the 2019 Met Gala (theme: ""Camp: Notes on Fashion""): including a gauzy, black, see-through blouse, Cuban heels, and a single, large pearl earring, like a Renaissance rake. He looked extremely pretty, or should that be handsome? Or both? More like this: -          Which generation has the best style? -          Queer country music's message of hope -          The millennials redefining sexy What does Styles's playful, androgynous persona tell us about gender now? More recently, he surprised people (and outraged some) by wearing a frilly gown, vaguely belle époque in feel, under a black jacket, on the cover of US Vogue in December 2020 – the cover line read: ""Harry Styles Makes His Own Rules"". He has the honour of being the first solo male cover model in the magazine's history. The fact that the cover photo was cropped at the waist reduces its impact; the Gucci gown in its entirety is voluminous, lacey, and very feminine, as we see in the fashion shots inside, which feature other iconoclastic looks: Styles modelling a skirt, a couple of kilts, a couple of crazy couture coat-gown hybrids, a crinoline worn over a suit, and some more ordinary trouser-and-jacket combinations. An endearing picture of him sitting beside his sister, with whom he used to play dress-up, Styles in his skin, and looking totally comfortable in it. In the accompanying interview, Styles says: ""There is so much joy to be had in playing with clothes. I've never thought too much about what it means – it just becomes this extended part of creating something."" The writer of the article, Hamish Bowles, says that Styles ""manages to make ruffles a compelling new masculine proposition, just as Mr Fish's frothy white cotton dress… did for Mick Jagger when he wore it for the Rolling Stones' free performance in Hyde Park in 1969"". The rampant masculinity of the Stones was never in question, decked in white dresses or not. There is something different going on with Styles; gentler and more ambiguous, as if he is channelling the innocence of childhood, the time before we encounter gender politics. The photos seem to say: what would we grow up to be if we didn't have to choose? Is this question incendiary? The Vogue shoot drew a few attacks from trolls in the United States. One female commentator sounded the alarm on Twitter at ""the steady feminisation of our men at the same time as Marxism is being taught to our children"". A male counterpart joined in on Twitter by declaring that ""it is… a referendum on masculinity for men to don fluffy dresses"", and averring that the Vogue shoot is part of a plot. ""Bring back manly men!"", cried the trolls… because men are an endangered species! In response, Styles doubled down on his image and was photographed for Variety in a frilly coat while eating a banana, and in a pink satin blouse. The banana was a joke, but like everything about him, also weirdly sexy. The message that he doesn't give a damn about his ""masculinity"" is loud and clear. The trolls must be blind, though. Check out the video for Styles' track Watermelon Sugar (""This video is dedicated to touching"", says the introduction) in which he cavorts on a beach with a posse of minimally-clad female models. The video archly presents this as innocent fun. Surely some kind of rampantly heterosexual credentials are on display here? And yes, Styles is wearing a bright orange and lime green knitted vest with what appear to be children's sunglasses; he can't help himself. 'Implosion of masculinity' That aside, the trolls might have a point about the coming apocalypse of old-school masculinity. I can think of two good examples of recent, influential books that argue masculinity is on the way out. Hanna Rosin's The End of Men, and the Rise of Women (2012) argues that women in the West have begun outstripping men on a range of important social and economic indicators (such as education) because women are better suited to life in a post-industrial world. (But see her bleak vision of how women are making backward steps as a result of the pandemic here.) The artist Grayson Perry – who has a female alter-ego, Claire – in his book The Descent of Man explores from the inside the implosion of masculinity, arguing that its rigid norms no longer make sense. Does masculinity have itself up against a wall? The sociologist Raewyn Connell, author of Masculinities, is an expert on what she calls ""hegemonic masculinity"": the rigid codes that constitute and reproduce masculine power. I talked to her about the ""controversy"" over Styles's dress sense. ""I can remember folk becoming apoplectic in the 1960s that 'You can't tell them apart nowadays… '"" she tells BBC Culture. ""Complaining about the Beatles and Gerry & the Pacemakers and the Rolling Stones wearing long hair and paisley blouses, and the girls wearing jeans, and Twiggy looking like an undernourished boy. ""And come to think of it, back in the 1920s they were complaining that the Flappers smoked and swore like men, and got Eton crops like Josephine Baker, and for heaven's sake, they were even getting the vote! Western civilisation is ruined!"" From the perspective of the entertainment industry, where artists have often operated on the margins, wasn't the battle against gender fluidity lost a long time ago? Alexis Petridis, the rock and pop critic at the Guardian, tells BBC Culture that in his view pop music was much more radical with regard to gender back in the 1980s, the era of Soft Cell, Culture Club, Marilyn, and Pete Burns. Gender fluidity 40 years ago ""was a bit bolder than doing it now"", he says, because ""there was a very different, far less accepting attitude to sexuality or gender that wasn't heteronormative "". Still, Petridis's take on Styles is very positive. ""If seeing Harry Styles in a dress on the cover of Vogue makes a kid who doesn't feel that they fit in with accepted gender norms feel better about themselves, then that's great – that's something else that pop can do, at its best. In all sorts of ways, it can make you feel less alone."" Styles certainly impresses Michelle Ruiz, a contributing editor at Vogue who wrote a celebratory essay about how ""The Pure Joy of Harry Styles Got Me Through 2020"". I ask her if she thinks Styles is having a significant impact on masculinity. ""In an era of so much toxic… masculinity, Styles is a refreshing, modern contrast,"" she says. ""Here is a man in a dress preaching about the power of treating people with kindness…. Frankly, being kind and loving and perhaps wearing a strand of pearls over your sweater shouldn't make you any less of a man."" The article in Variety, ""This Charming Man"", gushes about Styles being the next Bowie – Styles is with Bowie's former label, Columbia Records. Styles is wonderfully polymorphous, but this is a stretch. When I ask Petridis about the comparison, he says: ""Bowie was a unique figure, a one-off, you're not going to get someone like him again because pop music isn't the primary focus of youth culture anymore"". Stars like Styles, however eye-catching their dresses, now have to compete with all the information on the internet and social media. His wardrobe aside, it seems Styles' strategy is simply to aim to be a good, honest person, irrespective of his gender.

economic indicators,Will Covid-19 kill air travel?,2024-09-15,2020-07-10,Ashley Nunes,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200709-how-covid-19-will-change-air-travel-as-we-know-it,"In 2001, air travel was dealt a massive blow by the 11 September attacks, and the effects lasted years. But this was a ripple compared to what Covid-19 will do. In the heart of Australian outback lies Alice Springs. The town – colloquially known as Alice – is the site of indigenous human presence dating back nearly 30,000 years. More recently, however, a new (and admittedly very different) type of settler has descended upon Alice. Since April, four Airbus A380s have made their way to the small town. The 500-plus-tonne behemoths belong to Singapore Airlines which, like many other carriers, has grounded almost its entire fleet. The reason is Covid-19. The spread of the novel coronavirus has caused passenger demand to collapse, forcing airlines to park, rather than fly, their planes. Alice offers conditions ideal to do just that. The local airport has a runway long enough to land commercial airplanes and the climate is dry, which means aircraft parts corrode far slower than in the sweltering heat and humidity of South East Asia. Slumps in travel demand aren’t new. Following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, passenger enthusiasm towards flying also waned amid security fears. This forced airlines – then, like now – to cancel flights and puts planes into storage. The industry did recover. Passenger numbers for 2002 were 1.63 billion, only slightly lower than the 1.66 billion who flew in 2001. But passenger numbers don’t tell the whole story. The 9/11 attacks also forced airlines to trim costs through furloughs, layoffs, and most notably, consolidation. Prior to the attacks, the US airline market – the world’s most lucrative – was largely controlled by eight carriers. Today, its four. Following the attacks, airlines also became more cautious and shelved plans for aggressive expansion. This led to fewer flights overall and for passengers, less space as planes got fuller. Whether Covid-19 has a similar impact on the industry and how passengers fare in the aftermath will depend on a few things. The collapse in air travel demand has been driven largely by public policy. As Covid-19 spread, governments worldwide chose – in the interests of preserving public health – to ban entry to non-residents. Some countries like India, Malaysia and South Africa stopped issuing visitor visas. Others like the Australia, New Zealand and the United States suspended visa-free travel reciprocity. The move not only ended the plans of millions of travellers but also forced airlines to stop serving once-lucrative markets. Flying empty planes around makes little fiscal sense. Consequently, getting planes back in the air will require an easing of government entry restrictions. There are some signs this is happening. The South African government recently announced efforts to reopen the country’s tourism sector. With one exception. The move only applies to domestic travellers; international tourists will have to wait a bit longer. Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, South Africa’s minister for tourism, says: “The decision to open the country’s external borders will be based on an 'assessment of scientific evidence… guided by (the government’s) responsibility to protect the lives of South Africans'.” Kubayi-Ngubane’s words reflect the delicate balance governments must strike between delivering for citizens the economic benefits of tourism while protecting those citizens against the public health risks of Covid-19. But there might be a way around these travel restrictions: “travel bubbles”. Colloquially known as “coronavirus corridors” or “air bridges”, the underlying idea is simple. Rather than banning visitors outright (or relegating them to quarantine), some countries agree to open their borders to one other while – in principle – keeping their borders to all other countries closed. Signatory countries would typically be ones where the coronavirus threat has been contained. This minimises transmission risk for travelers within the bubble while preventing the importation of new cases from outside. The UK government recently moved to do just that. Starting 10 July, passengers from over 50 countries will be allowed to enter England, sans quarantine. In announcing the move, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “Instead of quarantining arrivals from the whole world, we will only quarantine arrivals from those countries where the virus is sadly not under control.” But the effectiveness of travel bubbles depends in part on the goodwill of citizens. The success of the UK’s travel bubble with France requires that visitors to the UK do not travel to a high-risk country (say the United States, for example) and then in short order, fly to England via France. How authorities prevent this from happening remains unclear. The situation is particularly precarious if there are no border controls between countries inside the bubble, as is with the case with EU member states. Another workaround involves having rapid testing infrastructure in place. The move would allow authorities to screen passengers for the virus and if needed, quarantine these individuals. Researchers at Stanford University recently launched a study to examine the concept’s viability. The work – which is being conducted in collaboration with the Taiwanese government – will test passengers for signs of the virus on flights across the Pacific. According to the study’s authors, “the goal of the experiment is to figure out the earliest time we can release people if they get tested”. That matters to countries who see air travel as key to jumpstarting the economy. But when it comes to testing, accuracy is everything. Imagine sitting near someone who tested negative for the virus but was actually infected (and infectious) during the entire flight. The idea is not entirely far-fetched. Studies suggest that one in three infected people can receive so-called “false negatives”. According to Maureen Ferran, a professor in biology at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, false negatives can occur when nasal swabs – used to collect samples of the virus – aren’t inserted deep enough into the nose or don’t collect enough of the virus sample. She says false negatives are also possible “if a person is tested too early or too late during their infection and there isn’t a lot of virus in their cells”. A vaccine for Covid-19 would provide relief. Vaccines strengthen the body’s natural defences, lowering the risk of infection and transmission. This curbs the need for entry restrictions, travel bubbles or virus tests altogether. But finding a vaccine isn’t easy. Antidotes to some life-threatening illnesses like HIV and malaria have remained elusive despite decades of research. When vaccines have been found, the process has been painstakingly long. The vaccine used to treat measles took nearly a decade to develop and hit the market 50 years after US healthcare providers starting monitoring the disease. Even if a vaccine for Covid-19 is found, it must be mass produced and distributed worldwide, which will take even more time. For travelers, this means the pre-Covid-19 flying experience isn’t likely to return anytime soon. So what can passengers expect in the meantime? Pre-Covid-19 flyers – particularly those sitting in the premium cabin – were treated to all kinds of perks; amenity kits, noise-cancelling headphones and pyjamas. Some airlines went even further, offering passengers gourmet meals prepared by professional chefs onboard. Those days are over. Instead, flyers can expect pared down service with few if any luxuries. Airlines are axing inflight-magazines, pillows and in some cases, even meals. Singapore Airlines – a carrier long admired for its customer service – suspended serving a trolley meal service for flights within Asia. Passengers will instead be given a snack bag with water and refreshments during boarding. The reason isn’t so much cost (though airlines, already hemorrhaging cash, are keen to make savings). Rather, service-cutting is about limiting so-called “touchpoints”: opportunities for Covid-19 to spread via close physical proximity between flyers and crew. Serving passengers in cramped spaces requires considerable person-to-person interaction. Airlines want to limit those interactions to stop the virus from spreading. Some carriers are taking virus containment efforts one step further by requiring flyers to wear masks and face shields on board. One such airline is Qatar Airways. The airline’s chief, Akbar Al Baker says these measures are needed to “ensure the continued health and wellbeing of […] passengers and cabin crew”. Conventional wisdom suggests that when passenger demand drops, fares follow. So with passenger numbers at record lows (as of April, Heathrow passenger numbers were down 97%), the quest for cheap tickets should be much easier. But that’s not the whole story. Fares are also influenced by the number of seats in the global market. With the world’s passenger planes largely grounded (one estimate suggests nearly 30% of the world’s 26,000 commercial jets are stuck on airport tarmacs worldwide), there are far fewer seats to go around. This gives airlines rather than passengers the upper hand when it comes to setting fares. Fare hikes in the short run aren’t likely, according to Severin Borenstein. Borenstein – a professor at the University of California Berkeley’s Haas School of Business – thinks that fares are more “likely to remain quite moderate, because fuel costs are low and the airlines are flying more capacity than demand can support”. However, he points out that the absence of a Covid-19 vaccine could cause fares to eventually rise albeit, “over multiple years”. Fare hikes are also likely if some airlines go bankrupt. Bankruptcy reduces the number of competitors in a market, which invariably drives up price. The prospect of a major airline going out of business is something aeroplane manufacturer Boeing recently warned about. Similar sentiments have been expressed by Emirates’ chief Tim Clark. And running an airline is pricy. Even small jets, like the single-aisle Boeing 737, can cost upwards of £80m ($102m) apiece. Add to that fuel, insurance and taxes and you’re talking about serious money. With annual expenses running into the billions, airlines need cash to survive – lots of it. Moving cargo around is one way to make money. Another involves partnering with banks to sell airline-branded credit cards. Yet, the best way to generate cash remains filling passenger cabins. Maximising the so-called load factor is particularly important for budget airlines who – despite incurring similar costs as their full-service competitors – offer substantially lower fares. A one-way ticket on Irish budget giant Ryanair averages just €37 (£33.50/$42); you’d be hard pressed to find fares that low on many of Ryanair’s competitors. Budget carriers offset lower fares by squeezing more passengers into their cabins. Ryanair packs 189 flyers onto its jets, 10% more than flag-carriers who fly the same airplane. Yet while high-density seating may save flyers cash, the concept is antithetical to social distancing. And that’s a problem. When it comes to fighting Covid-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls social distancing, “one of the best tools we have to avoid being exposed to this virus and slowing its spread locally and across the country and world”. This sentiment is shared by some lawmakers, who now mandate that airlines fill no more than two-thirds of the passenger cabin. Borenstein says limiting passenger capacity could disrupt the model of budget carriers, “because they rely on higher density on the aircraft and because those airlines tend to have weaker capitalisation, and therefore be more exposed to demand drops in their finances”. No wonder low-fare carriers have panned the move. Airbus chief executive, Guillaume Faury, has called the Covid-19 pandemic, “the gravest crisis the aerospace industry has ever known”. Similar sentiments have been expressed by the International Air Transport Association. The trade group – which represents nearly 300 airlines – says the industry is “only at the very beginning of a long and difficult recovery” and there remains “tremendous uncertainty about what impact a resurgence of new Covid-19 cases in key markets could have”. Put simply, the industry will recover, but when that happens air travel is likely to look very unfamiliar. * Ashley Nunes is a research fellow at Harvard Law School.

economic indicators,The lockdown fight for the Amazon,2024-09-15,2020-05-19,Kimberley Brown,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200518-why-lockdown-is-harming-the-amazon-rainforest,"With fewer planes in the sky and cars on the road, lockdown has brought many benefits to the environment. So why is it harming tropical rainforests? Inside the world’s tropical forests, there are the agents of disease that have the power to bring our way of life to a halt. How we learn to live with these forests will determine our fate, hastening or slowing the onset of future pandemics and the climate crisis. BBC Travel and Future Planet explore two sides of our relationship with forests in two stories; this story is the second, and you can read the first here. -- You might be forgiven for thinking that the global lockdown measures keeping us all at home can only have been good for the environment. Pollution in cities has decreased, wild animals have increasingly been spotted entering urban areas, and many new cycle lanes have opened up worldwide. But in the world’s tropical forest regions, it’s another story. Environmental agencies have reported an uptick in deforestation during lockdowns, as well as increases in poaching, animal trafficking and illegal mining worldwide. The trends are alarming, environmental experts say, and could be hard to reverse.  “This narrative of nature having been given a break during Covid, it’s not entirely accurate. It’s accurate in cities and peri-urban areas,” says Sebastian Troeng, executive vice-president of Conservation International. “But unfortunately in the rural areas, the situation is almost the inverse.” You might also like: Troeng says it’s too soon for detailed data on the scale of the problem since lockdowns began, but their offices have been receiving almost daily reports of increased deforestation from around the world. Brazil and Colombia have seen an uptick in illegal logging and mining; the Philippines has also reported illegal logging and wildlife trafficking; Kenya has reported increased bushmeat and ivory poaching, as well as increases in charcoal production, which has been illegal since 2018; Cambodia has seen an increase in poaching, illegal logging and mining; and similar reports have come from Venezuela and Madagascar. Concerns have also been raised in Malaysia and Indonesia, which have the highest deforestation rates in South-east Asia, while in Ecuador, indigenous and afro-descendent communities have reported increased illegal mining in the Choco and Amazon rainforests. There are two main factors that could be driving these trends, says Troeng. The first is criminal groups and opportunists expanding their activities, taking advantage of lockdown and diminished forest monitoring and government presence. The second is that people living in these rural areas are facing increased economic pressures and are forced to rely more heavily on nature for food and income. In some cases, such as Madagascar and Cambodia, there has been a large urban-rural migration as people lose their jobs in the cities or return home to be with their families during quarantine, which has put extra pressure on local environments.   “What worries me is that we’re seeing these emerging trends, and they’re not going to be reversed when Covid measures are lifted because they’re related to economic factors. So my anticipation is that we’re going to have to deal with this for potentially months and years,” says Troeng. Destruction of the rainforest will have severe ramifications. For indigenous and other communities who live there, it means a destruction of their way of life and may lead to conflict with the criminals who encroach on their territory. Studies have also shown that destroying rainforest ecosystems raises the odds of new pathogens making the jump from animals to humans. It also harms our ability to deal with climate change, as tropical forests are a key component in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Amazon losses One of Troeng’s biggest concerns right now is the Brazilian Amazon, which is seeing unprecedented levels of deforestation, increased illegal mining in indigenous territory and widespread cases of Covid-19 through Amazon communities. “That’s what worries me. It’s the confluence of several bad things happening at the same time,” he says.   Brazil confirmed its first case of coronavirus on 28 February, but while most of the economy has since come to a halt as state and municipal government implement lockdown measures, deforestation has not. In April, rainforest destruction increased 64%, compared with the same month last year, according to the country’s space research agency, INPE. In the first four months of 2020, rainforest destruction rose by 55%, compared with the same time last year, clearing an area of 1,202 square kilometers (464 square miles). “What we have seen with deforestation is that people are not afraid because they apparently think ‘the government is distracted with this health crisis, they won’t pay attention to us’,” says Ane Alencar, science director of the Brazilian environmental organisation, IPAM. “It’s an opportunistic thing.” In March, the country’s two environmental enforcement agencies, Ibama and ICMBio, cut their forest monitoring services. The agencies said mobility restrictions impeded their ability to carry out their tasks, and they couldn’t risk the health of their staff or indigenous communities by trying to continue regular service. Alencar says the majority of deforestation in 2020 so far happened through land grabbing of public property. Data released by IPAM show that the first three months of this year, 53% of this destruction took place on undesignated public land, protected areas and indigenous territories, compared to 38% last year. This will likely be turned into cattle land, Alencar says.  Deforestation in Brazil has spiked since last year, when President Jair Bolsonaro took office. Shortly after being sworn in, he began promoting the development of the Amazon rainforest, including indigenous reserves, calling it necessary to lift locals out of poverty. Last week, Bolsonaro authorised the army to deploy in the Amazon to fight fires and illegal logging. But environmentalists say this will not solve the problems on the ground in the long term. Alencar, and other conservationists, say the president’s own policies have helped bolster land grabbing, as well as illegal mining and logging. Forest fires Conservationists are concerned that the increased deforestation they are seeing in lockdown will lead to even bigger forest fires during Brazil’s dry season than were seen last year. Forest fires in the Amazon generally occur during the dry season when people employ a slash and burn method to turn forest into agriculture land. In 2019, Brazil’s forest fires increased by 84% compared with 2018. Smoke from the fires led to a public health alert, causing respiratory illnesses in people living in nearby cities.     Many of Brazil’s hospitals are already overloaded as they try to cope with cases of Covid-19. In early May, the country was declared the new global epicenter of coronavirus.  “It’s already a nightmare, but it’s going to be a triple nightmare,” says Alencar. Neighbouring Colombia has already seen an uptick in forest fires in the first months of 2020. In March, the country registered 12,953 hot points – thermal anomalies that indicate higher risk of forest fire – in Colombia’s Amazon rainforest, according to the Amazon Institute for Scientific Research, SINCHI. This is almost three times more than the 4,691 hot spots indicated last year during the same month. While hotspots don’t necessarily turn into fires, they are a close indicator; scientists say 93% of registered hot points are later confirmed as forest fires.   Miguel Pacheco, natural resources and livelihoods coordinator with WWF-Colombia, says quarantine measures have not been the cause of this increase in hotspots, but they could exacerbate the problem. Since Colombia went into lockdown in late March, monitoring flights by the armed forces that normally circle the region have significantly reduced. This could allow armed groups to take advantage of this lack of environmental control and continue to clear the area for cattle, coca plantation or other crops, as long as these quarantine measures persist, he says.   Environmental authorities also reported an increase in illegal logging, wild animal trafficking and poaching of large cats since quarantine began, says Pacheco.   In Colombia, lockdown poses the next in a long line of social changes that have fuelled deforestation. The destruction of rainforest has been a major concern since 2016, when the FARC guerrillas and the Colombian government signed a peace agreement. When the guerrillas demobilised from their holding areas in the jungle, it left the regions open to exploitation. In many areas, that meant armed groups and other organised crime cleared the forest for cattle and pasture land, particularly the Amazon states of Caqueta, Meta and Guaviare, some of the most affected. The country’s lockdown has brought to a halt all post-conflict development and conservation programmes with communities in these remote jungle regions, most of which also lack access to schools, hospitals or other public services. This has created another vacuum of other forest monitoring bodies like NGOs and government institutions. “Everything is kind of on standby right now, and I’m sure that this will be reflected later on when the data reveals what actually happened in these territories,” says Carolina Gil, north-west Amazon regional director with the Amazon Conservation Team in Colombia, who has been continuing her work from her home in Bogota during lockdown. Gil says even before lockdown, she received reports that park rangers in the Amazon national parks and protected areas had been receiving death threats from armed groups, warning them to leave their posts. The way back  The solution to the ongoing deforestation and illicit activities is not so easy, says Gil. It involves better forest monitoring by governments, a crackdown on organised crime, and more programmes developed to understand and support communities in the rainforest. It also involves people in cities and overseas, helping them to understand the role they play in the deforestation of tropical forests, she says, by reflecting on how their consumer habits – from beef to cocaine – could be supporting it.     “We have to have a bit more judicious and rigorous reflections about deforestation, which does not necessarily end in the jungle. It can also happen in the centers where economic decisions are made,” says Gil. In the long term, conservationists agree that the solution to saving the world’s tropical forests involves working closely with local communities, empowering them to be active conservationists in their own territories. In some cases, this includes supporting traditional indigenous lifestyles of living with nature. In others, it involves developing sustainable alternative revenue streams that go beyond ecotourism projects. The latter has become a popular conservation strategy over the years, but, as the current global health and economic crisis indicates, is not always reliable, says Troeng. One option, he says, is for governments to pay local communities to work as forest rangers, take on reforestation projects, or work with them to develop sustainable forest products, like honey or bamboo harvesting. In Colombia, Pachecho says deforestation hot spots reduced by up to 70% in 2018, and have stayed low, in areas where local communities have been involved in forest and landscape management programmes in the Amazon states of Guaviare and Caqueta. But in the short term, it’s important that governments make tropical forest areas a priority, and remain focused on enforcement activities, says Troeng. He cites two examples where this is happening. In the Philippines, after learning about increased illegal logging, wildlife trade and fishing in the country, the government stated publicly that it would not tolerate such activities and began to crack down on these crimes. In Peru, the agency that monitors protected areas is still in the field, and conducting patrols and enforcing environmental regulations when necessary, despite Covid-19, which is “encouraging”, Troeng says. It’s also important for decision makers globally to be aware of these dynamics moving forward, as they begin to think about investing resources to kickstart the economy again. “I think there’s definitely an opportunity,” he says. “Let’s figure out how we can reverse these negative trends because we’re going to need it in the battle against climate change.”  This ramped-up deforestation is not likely to go away when lockdown is lifted; the same economic pressures will still be there, as well as the opportunities to exploit the rainforest. Illegal economies often work faster than governments’ and NGOs’ ability to formalise and implement conservation strategies, says Gil. Of course, the longer these illegal activities are left to expand in tropical forest areas, the harder it will be to reverse the damages to these ecosystems and rainforest communities. This increases the urgency to think about new ways to tackle deforestation, both in the tropics and abroad.   -- The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2: the writer interviewed sources remotely from the safety of lockdown.

economic indicators,Where we are on climate in five charts,2024-09-15,2021-01-11,Isabelle Gerretsen,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210108-where-we-are-on-climate-change-in-five-charts,"After the turbulent year of 2020, BBC Future takes stock on the state of the climate at the beginning of 2021. From unprecedented wildfires across the US to the extraordinary heat of Siberia, the impacts of climate change were felt in every corner of the world in 2020. We have come to a ""moment of truth"", United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in his State of the Planet speech in December. ""Covid and climate have brought us to a threshold."" BBC Future brings you our round-up of where we are on climate change at the start of 2021, according to five crucial measures of climate health. 1. CO2 levels The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere reached record levels in 2020, hitting 417 parts per million in May. The last time CO2 levels exceeded 400 parts per million was around four million years ago, during the Pliocene era, when global temperatures were 2-4C warmer and sea levels were 10-25 metres (33-82 feet) higher than they are now. ""We are seeing record levels every year,"" says Ralph Keeling, head of the CO2 programme at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, which has been tracking CO2 concentrations from the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii since 1958. ""We saw record levels again this year despite Covid."" Read more on the solutions:  The effect of lockdowns on concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere was so small that it registers as a ""blip"", hardly distinguishable from the year-to-year fluctuations of the carbon cycle, according to the World Meteorological Organization, and has had a negligible impact on the overall curve of rising CO2 levels. ""We have put 100ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere in the last 60 years,"" says Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute for climate change and the environment at Imperial College London. That is 100 times faster than previous natural increases, such as those that occurred towards the end of the last ice age more than 10,000 years ago. ""If we keep tracking the worst-case scenario, by the end of this century levels of CO2 will be 800ppm. We haven't had that for 55 million years. There was no ice on the planet then and it was 12C warmer,"" says Siegert.   2. Record heat The past decade was the hottest on record. The year 2020 was more than 1.2C hotter than the average year in the 19th Century. In Europe it was the hottest year ever, while globally 2020 tied with 2016 as the warmest. Record temperatures, including 2016, usually coincide with an El Niño event (a large band of warm water that forms in the Pacific Ocean every few years), which results in large-scale warming of ocean surface temperatures. But 2020 was unusual because the world experienced a La Niña event (the reverse of El Niño, with a cooler band of water forming). In other words, without La Niña bringing global temperatures down, 2020 would have been even hotter. Read more on the solutions: The exceptionally warm temperatures triggered the largest wildfires ever recorded in the US states of California and Colorado, and the ""black summer"" of fires in eastern Australia. ""The intensity of those fires and number of people being killed is truly significant,"" says Siegert. 3. Arctic ice Nowhere is that increase in heat more keenly felt than in the Arctic. In June 2020, the temperature reached 38C in eastern Siberia, the hottest ever recorded within the Arctic Circle. The heatwave accelerated the melting of sea ice in the East Siberian and Laptev seas and delayed the usual Arctic freeze by almost two months. ""You definitely saw the impact of those warm temperatures,"" says Julienne Stroeve, a polar scientist from University College London. On the Eurasian side of the Arctic Circle, the ice did not freeze until the end of October, which is unusually late. The summer of 2020 saw sea ice area at its second lowest on record, and sea ice extent (a larger measure, which includes ocean areas where at least 15% ice appears) also at its second lowest. As well as being a symptom of climate change, the loss of ice is also a driver of it. Bright white sea ice plays an important role in reflecting heat from the Sun back out into space, a bit like a reflective jacket. But the Arctic is heating twice as quickly as the rest of the world – and as less ice makes it through the warm summer months, we lose its reflective protection. In its place, large areas of open dark water absorb more heat, fueling global warming further. Multi-year ice is also thicker and more reflective than the thin, dark seasonal ice that is increasingly taking its place. Between 1979-2018, the proportion of Arctic sea ice that is at least five years old declined from 30% to 2%, according to the IPCC. ""White ice reflects a lot of energy from the Sun and helps slow the rate of global warming,"" says Michael Meredith, a polar researcher at the British Antarctic Survey. ""We are accelerating global warming by reducing the amount of Arctic sea ice."" The loss of ice is believed to be disrupting weather patterns around the world already. According to the Grantham Institute, it is possible – though not conclusively shown – that 2018 Arctic conditions provoked the ""Beast from the East"" winter storm in Europe in 2018 by altering the jet stream, a current of air high in the atmosphere. ""Temperature difference between the equator and poles drives a lot of our large-scale weather systems, including the jet stream,"" says Stroeve. And because the Arctic is warming faster than lower latitudes, there is a weakening of the jet stream. ""Everything is interconnected. If one part of the climate system changes, the rest of the system will respond,"" says Stroeve. 4. Permafrost Across the northern hemisphere, permafrost – the ground that remains frozen year-round for two or more years – is warming rapidly. When air temperatures reached 38C (100F) in Siberia in the summer of 2020, land temperatures in several parts of the Arctic Circle hit a record 45C (113F), accelerating the thawing of permafrost in the region. Both continuous permafrost (long, uninterrupted stretches of permafrost) and discontinuous (a more fragmented kind) are in decline. Permafrost contains a huge amount of greenhouse gases, including CO2 and methane, which are released into the atmosphere as it thaws. Soils in the permafrost region, which spans around 23 million square kilometres (8.9 million square miles) across Siberia, Greenland, Canada and the Arctic, hold twice as much carbon as the atmosphere does – almost 1,600 billion tonnes. Much of that carbon is stored in the form of methane, a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming impact 84 times higher than CO2. ""Permafrost is doing us a big favour by keeping that carbon locked away from the atmosphere,"" says Meredith. Thawing permafrost also damages existing infrastructure and destroys the livelihoods of the indigenous communities who rely on the frozen ground to move around and hunt. It is thought to have contributed to the collapse of a huge fuel tank in the Russian Arctic in May, which leaked 20,000 tonnes of diesel into a river. 5. Forests Since 1990 the world has lost 178 million hectares of forest (690,000 square miles) – an area the size of Libya. Over the past three decades, the rate of deforestation has slowed but experts say it isn't fast enough, given the vital role forests play in curbing global warming. In 2015-20 the annual deforestation rate was 10 million hectares (39,000 square miles, or about the size of Iceland), compared to 12 million hectares (46,000 square miles) in the previous five years. ""Globally forest areas continue to decline,"" says Bonnie Waring, senior lecturer at the Grantham Institute, noting that there are big regional differences. ""We are losing a lot of tropical forests in South America and Africa [and] regaining temperate forests through tree planting or natural regeneration in Europe and Asia."" Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Indonesia are the countries losing forest cover most rapidly. In 2020, deforestation of the Amazon rainforest surged to a 12-year high. An estimated 45% of all carbon on land is stored in trees and forest soil. ""Soils globally contain more carbon than all plants and atmosphere put together,"" says Waring. When forests are cut down or burned, the soil is disturbed and carbon dioxide is released. Read more on the solutions: The World Economic Forum launched a campaign this year to plant one trillion trees to absorb carbon. While planting trees might help cancel out the last 10 years of CO2 emissions, it cannot solve the climate crisis on its own, according to Waring. ""Protecting existing forests is even more important than planting new ones. Every time an ecosystem is disturbed, you see carbon lost,"" she says. Allowing forests to regrow naturally and rewilding huge areas of land, a process known as natural regeneration, is the most cost-effective and productive way to capture CO2 and boost overall biodiversity, according to Waring. As well as showing how much the climate has changed already, these five climate indicators also point the way to the solutions that can curb global warming to safer levels by the end of the century. As Guterres noted in his December State of the Planet speech, ""Let's be clear: Human activities are at the root of our descent towards chaos. But that means human action can help solve it."" -- With data research by Miriam Quick. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

economic indicators,The importance of the Pizza Principle,2024-09-15,2017-02-02,Chris Baraniuk,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170202-how-fast-food-reveals-secrets-of-the-economy,"From the Pizza Principle to the Waffle House Index, fast food can reveal surprising things about our behaviour and hidden changes in the market. What is an economist’s favourite food? Burgers, chips and pizza might not immediately come to mind – but the consumption of meals like these can signal changes in people’s economic behaviour. Knowing the price of pizza in New York or the cost of a Big Mac in Beirut can tell market-watchers how the world’s cogs are turning.  THE PIZZA PRINCIPLE In 1980, a New Yorker called Eric Bram noticed that the price of a slice of pizza had matched the cost of a subway ride in the city for nearly 20 years. More recently, commentators have noticed that as the cost of pizza goes up, transit fares often follow. In 2014, data scientist Jared Lander investigated the principle and found that it remains in place. Why is this so? Nobody knows. THE BIG MAC AND KFC INDICES How much will a Big Mac cost you in Lima? Or Abu Dhabi? The answers can tell you a lot about “purchasing power parity (PPP)” – whether exchange rates mean that a product costs the same in different countries. A tool to make this theory more “digestible” was launched by The Economist in 1986. It allows comparison of several base currencies to others around the world. As they wrote this month: “A Big Mac currently costs $5.06 in America but just 10.75 lira ($2.75) in Turkey, implying that the lira is undervalued.” Since McDonald’s restaurants aren’t so common in Africa, the market research firm Sagaci Research invented the supplementary “KFC index” to analyse PPP there. MARS BARS In 1932, a factory in Slough produced the world’s first Mars bar. Fifty years later, Financial Times writer Nico Colchester pointed out that the price of the confectionary in Britain was neatly correlated with the buying power of pound sterling. By measuring the cost of things in Mars Bars, Colechester noted how graduate salaries had improved slightly in 40 years. Meanwhile, train fares had become cheaper but roast beef dinners in pubs had gone up by more than 60%. BAKED BEANS AND POPCORN When financial experts are trying to determine whether an economy is generally in good health, they often look to food products. In 2009, the Odeon cinema company announced an “Odeon Popcorn Index” that it claimed showed higher sales and therefore signs of economic recovery in Britain following the financial crisis of 2008. And analysts have also scrutinised sales of baked beans, popular when times are tough, as an indicator of how people are responding to periods of economic decline. When baked bean sales fell in 2013, some took it as a sign that the UK economy was in rude health. FRENCH FRIES A fascinating article in the Oregonian in 1998 observed that sales of French fries could be a helpful indicator of trade between America and Asia. This food “leads US industries into foreign markets” wrote Richard Read, thanks to the fact that America exports so many of them (something that remains true today). And he added that consumption of French fries was also an indicator of how well-developed an Asian economy had become. This meant that when economic trouble in Asia was brewing in the late 90s, farmers in the US were hit hard. WAFFLE HOUSE INDEX How bad was that hurricane? The length of a fast-food restaurant's menu can be a quick guide, it seems. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the United States keeps a check on the length of the menu at Waffle House outlets in the aftermath of natural disasters. If customers are being offered a limited menu, food supplies at the restaurant may be low and it might only have generator power. If the restaurant is closed? “That’s really bad,” FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate once said.

economic indicators,How to spot the next pandemic,2024-09-15,2022-04-07,Peter Yeung,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220406-how-liberias-frontline-health-workers-stop-next-pandemic,"Remote regions of sub-Saharan Africa are among the world's hotspots for new diseases. But Liberia is using an innovative approach to identify outbreaks before they become a problem. When Cynthia Luogon and her young son became feverish and started vomiting one night, she feared the worst. It was 2014, and an epidemic of Ebola – the highly contagious haemorrhagic fever that can cause uncontrollable internal bleeding – was spreading like wildfire across West Africa. Without phone signal or access to a vehicle, several of Luogon’s neighbours in the remote Liberian village of Gipo – just nine miles (15km) from the border with neighbouring Guinea – were forced to carry the pair in a hammock for over an hour to the nearest health facility. ""I thought I was going to die,"" she says. Luogon, now 35 and with nine children, was initially suspected of having Ebola, but later diagnosed with cholera. She eventually recovered after being treated. ""We were lucky,"" she says. ""But plenty others passed away in those days."" You may also like: Nearly a third of Liberia’s population lives in rural areas similar to Gipo, which health experts say have the potential to be hotspots for emerging infectious diseases that could in turn break out into major epidemics or, in the worst case, pandemics. Traditional healthcare provision systems often aren't a viable way to address this threat in many countries across sub-Saharan Africa, due to limited national budgets and often inadequate infrastructure. But Liberia has found remarkable early success via another approach: recruiting members of rural communities to act as the crucial first line of defence against infectious diseases – helping to spot them before they become a wider problem. Throughout the 21st Century, many infectious diseases have emerged or re-emerged across sub-Saharan Africa. Rural areas in the region are often a particularly vulnerable to disease outbreaks, says Florence Fenollar, an infectious disease specialist at the University Hospital Institute of Mediterranean Infection in Marseille, France. Limited public health systems, poverty and social inequality, violent conflict, and close contact between humans and wildlife are among the reasons for this, she adds. ""Africa has both the greatest infectious disease burden and the weakest public health infrastructure in the world,"" says Fenollar. ""This combination means the region must be observed carefully."" Some of the infectious diseases seen in sub-Saharan Africa in recent years, such as Rickettsia felis, a variety of cat-flea typhus, and the bacteria which causes Whipple's disease, are newly discovered. Others are historically well known, such as cholera and the bubonic plague. Still others, such as Ebola and Zika, are previously known diseases from elsewhere but have seen their first large outbreaks in the area. The risk of failing to properly implement defences in the region has been underlined by the low supply of COVID-19 vaccines in Africa, which the World Health Organization has warned could lead to further variants. Liberia itself is currently battling with Covid-19, but must also be prepared for the potential resurgence of Ebola, as occurred in neighbouring Guinea last year. There is also the ever-present threat of an entirely new disease appearing that could lead to a serious outbreak. But Liberia's community health workers offer a compelling solution to this threat, with thousands of them now on constant lookout for infectious disease in the furthest remote reaches of Liberia. They are part of a radical scheme in the West African nation that has provided disease surveillance and healthcare to rural populations since 2016. These workers are paid, trained healthcare providers who come from and are based in remote villages that traditional healthcare systems often can’t reach. Crucially, the workers also provide a new aspect of pandemic preparedness: rapid warning. ""If you’re building trust with the health workers and the communities, then this is a very effective way for the government to be kept abreast of goings on,"" says Robert Yates, director of the global health programme at Chatham House. Sumor Lomax Flomo, a coordinator at the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL), which carries out surveillance for 21 diseases including yellow fever and tuberculosis, describes a recent example where a community health worker identified two cases of measles in Liberia’s north-central Lofa County. ""That quick work prevented a serious outbreak,"" he says. ""If they have proper support, they can prevent, detect and respond to public health threats."" The health workers are familiar with and trusted by their patients, he adds. This means their work can also be critical in potentially tricky issues such as vaccination hesitancy – an important factor in an age of rumour and disinformation. There are now some 4,000 community health workers across Liberia's 15 counties, according to data shared by Liberia’s Ministry of Health. Each worker, who must be nominated by fellow villagers and then pass a literacy test, receives months of training, covering topics such as malaria diagnosis, first aid and maternal health. They then engage with members of their community, helping to respond to any concerns, registering the details of households in the area, and aiding the launch of a community committee to discuss health issues. Since the scheme’s nationwide launch in 2016, there have been considerable signs of progress. Around 80% of Liberia’s one million rural residents now have access to care, according to the Ministry of Health, with 7.1 million household visits carried out to date. That is resulting in faster care, according to data (which is not publicly available) provided by the Liberian government which shows the proportion of malaria cases treated in less than 24 hours rose from 47% in 2016 to 71% in 2021. Other diseases are also being picked up by community health workers: the number of detected pneumonia cases nearly trebled to 33,800 between 2017 and 2021, with a similar rise seen in the number of seriously ill patients referred to health facilities. ""A community health worker might go to a village, and then see all of a sudden a lot of kids sick,""  says Yates. ""They are the best way to spot outbreaks quickly and bring in the cavalry."" The community health worker model also channels sorely needed income and employment to disadvantaged communities. Early indications also suggests the model is cost effective: the day-to-day running of standard health facilities would cost twice as much per year as the community health model to deliver the similar health services, according to an evaluation by Last Mile Health, one of the Liberian government’s implementing partners for the programme. ""The community health model has proven our best shot at reaching universal health coverage,"" says Ruston Yarnko, director of national community health systems at Last Mile Health. ""It's improved prevention and control, surveillance and identification and coordination."" Just a few years ago, the picture across rural Liberia was dramatically different. The country’s long underfunded healthcare system was decimated by civil wars between 1989 and 2003. In 2008, just 51 doctors were serving a population of 3.7 million people, many living in rural, hard-to-reach areas. With the arrival of Ebola, trust in health institutions plummeted: outpatient visits dropped 61% in a year, immunisation rates among children more than halved, dropping to as low as 36% and women began to give birth at home again. Ebola killed more than 11,000 across the region, 40% of all those infected. But the epidemic also marked a turning point for Liberia’s health service, which was forced to innovate in the face of disaster. The community health model was thrust centre stage, providing, among other things, an early warning system for outbreaks. ""Before Ebola, community members were not engaged and they were not given responsibility,"" says Olasford Wiah, head of community health for Liberia’s Ministry of Health. ""One of the lessons we learned was the power of communities."" Community health workers’ ability to rapidly identify infections was crucial in putting an end to the outbreak in 2016, the year the model was scaled nationally.  They were found to be more effective at carrying out Ebola-related activities than outsiders, and their relationships with locals proved resilient over time. ""Before, it could take days for villagers to be diagnosed,"" says Flomo. ""By then, it was often too late. Community health workers cut the time it took for diagnosis and treatment to a fraction."" Life in Gipo, whose population of 4,600 relies heavily on subsistence agriculture, has markedly improved thanks to the community health workers, who visit people’s houses to check for signs of illness and are on call for emergencies. Amelia Paye, a former farmer, has been watching over the community of Gipo, where she was born, since 2016. ""I do this to help my people, my brothers and my sisters,"" says the 50-year-old. Zoonotic diseases – those transferred from animals to humans – are a particular risk in rural areas like Gipo, where local populations hunt monkeys and other bushmeat for food, according to Bernice Dahn, a public health expert at the University of Liberia and former chief medical officer for the country. These diseases are particularly likely to emerge in areas where humans mix with wildlife and account for more than 65% of all emerging infectious diseases globally. Rita Leah, 26, who lives in Gipo says she sought help from a community health worker in December when one of her children had ""hot skin"". Within an hour the child tested positive for malaria, thanks to a rapid diagnostic test, and by the third day of treatment they were in good health. ""My aunt’s child died of measles before,"" says Leah. ""I don’t think that would happen again."" Community-based health schemes like those being used in Liberia are increasingly seen by global health experts as both an effective way of spotting and preventing epidemics and of delivering better healthcare to rural communities around the world. The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, which was formed by the World Health Organization at the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, has called on countries to further invest in community health workers to ""build resilient health and social protection systems"". ""The pandemic has shown there’s too much at stake to have half-baked programs or approaches,"" says Daniel Palazuelos, assistant professor of medicine at the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School. ""The next emerging disease will be identified by a community health worker. They are living on the frontlines."" Several countries have introduced community health worker schemes over the past 50 years. In the early 1970s, Bangladesh – then the world’s poorest and most densely populated country – began to deploy its first community health workers, which have helped to cut maternal mortality by 75% between 1990 and 2015. Ethiopia’s 40,000 full-time health extension workers and three million part-time volunteers ensure that 92% of the population has access to care. In 1988, Haiti’s ""accompagnateurs"" formed the world’s first programme to provide free HIV treatment in the Global South. When not sufficiently backed, however, the community model can flounder. Experts have warned that the failure to support Brazil’s 286,000 community workers, who, unlike Liberia’s, are low-paid and not considered to be health professionals, has put them ""at risk"" during the Covid-19 pandemic. But Liberia’s community health scheme is breaking new ground. One reason is its formalisation, which includes several months of training and fixed pay of $70 (£53) a month for four hours work a day, a considerable income in a country where people earn on average just $1.70 (£1.30) a day. ""I’ve always railed against volunteer-based programmes,"" says Paula Tavrow, adjunct professor at the department of community health sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""To have a paid workforce who is supervised and more accountable and better equipped is definitely an improvement. They become the final fingertips of the healthcare system."" Another key plank is Liberia’s commitment to employing one community health worker for every 350 villagers. ""It’s one of the lowest ratios I’ve seen,"" says Palazuelos. ""In many other countries, it’s 1 to 2000 or it’s 1 to 500."" The speed of the programme’s scale-up – going from dispersed pilots in 2012 to fully-integrated nationwide scale four years later – is also remarkable. ""It shows that even extremely low-resourced countries can achieve this,"" adds Palazuelos. But the programme still has its difficulties. In Nimba, Liberia’s second most populous county, community health workers report being overworked. Paye says she should be visiting five households a day in Gipo, but often it’s many more. ""All day we are in the community,"" she says. Drug shortages are a regular occurrence in the county, which has porous borders with Guinea and the Ivory Coast. Supply chains must be improved, workers say, but demand is heightened by influxes of migrants visiting for free treatment. ""The improvement has been immense,"" says Ibrahim Kamara of Plan International, Nimba’s implementing partner. ""But everyone wants a piece of the pie."" The model has also yet to overcome gender barriers such as societal gender norms and literacy disparities. Just 17% of Liberia’s community health workers are female, which can be problematic if female patients aren't comfortable interacting with a male health worker about pregnancy or reproductive health. And while the priority for community health workers is the diagnosis and treatment of children under five for malaria, pneumonia and malnutrition in rural areas, Liberia’s wider population also has enormous health needs. Yet amendments are on the way as Liberia’s scheme evolves to the end goal of universal health coverage. In its second five-year strategy, set to come into effect later this year, reporting tools and methods are being improved – negative as well as positive malaria test results, for example, will be recorded. Training will be expanded from four to eight modules, including new areas such as administering injectable contraceptives, and to tackle the low numbers of female community health workers, the minimum requirement of sixth grade education will be dropped to open up access. ""We are on the right trajectory,"" says Wiah. ""But we want to see more being done."" Still, question marks remain over the long-term financial sustainability of the scheme, which is currently heavily reliant on funding from international donors such as US Aid and the Global Fund. That funding could disappear at any time, particularly as governments cut foreign aid budgets. UNICEF, for example, provided technical and financial support to five Liberian counties from 2015 up until March 2021, when, according to a spokesperson, ""it ran out of funds and could no longer support the programme"". A revolving drug fund (RDF) could be one solution. Here, users are required to pay fees for medication rather than receiving it for free, although those who can’t afford the fees can in theory be exempt. Implementing this system could help put an end to drug shortages. A pilot in Lofa County is currently trialling the system. But global health experts argue that the Liberian government should take up the slack instead, arguing that introducing drug fees would see the poorest suffer. ""It would be a huge mistake,"" says Yates. ""Drug fees are inequitable and the poor get excluded – exemptions never work."" Yates points to the examples of Rwanda and Uganda, which scrapped fees, and Ethiopia, which pays for its community health workers through taxation. ""I know public financing is difficult, but other countries have done it,"" he says. ""But given Liberia’s economic situation, external funding will be needed for quite a while."" Donors acknowledge the necessity of that long-term shift. A spokesperson for the Global Fund said it focuses on supporting countries in ""moving away from donor financing toward domestically funded health systems"" as they grow economically. Studies show that the cost of the damage done by major outbreaks far outweigh the investment required to prevent them. The West African Ebola epidemic cost the region $6bn (£4.6bn), and the world $15bn (£11.4bn). Meanwhile, the Covid-19 pandemic is expected to cost the global economy at least $12.5 trillion (£9.6 trillion) by 2024. The hope is that, in Liberia at least, the humble community health worker could play a key role in nipping the next emerging infectious disease in the bud. Meanwhile these workers on the health frontline keep their eyes open for anything out of the ordinary. Under the baking afternoon sun, in Liberia's Wulu Town, Konobo, community health worker Emmanuel Poler examines a four-month-old whose mother has brought to him with swollen feet, a persistent fever, and, she says, ""white eyes"". Wearing blue rubber gloves, Poler, 45, takes a pin prick of blood from the child to test for malaria, which comes out positive. Due to the severity of the symptoms, Poler refers the child to the health facility. ""They know the signs and symptoms themselves,"" says Poler, writing down the results in his large black notebook. ""Now they come to me [for treatment]. They know that their health is in their hands. It’s in all of our hands.""   Reporting for this article was funded by the European Journalism Centre, through the Global Health Security Call, a programme supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

economic indicators,How a desert city holds back its sand,2024-09-15,2022-01-26,Joseph Phelan,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220125-how-dubai-is-pushing-back-its-encroaching-deserts,"Desertification threatens food supply in Dubai. Can its fledgling green tech sector help to stem the encroaching sands? The desert has never been far from Dubai's doorstep. Now a modern financial hub of some three million people, the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) most populous city remains surrounded on one side by sea, on the other by a seemingly endless carpet of sand. Over the last 50 years the city has become a somewhat improbable success story, transforming from a sleepy fishing port to a shining urban metropolis. But despite its opulence, the city faces a major challenge: encroaching deserts which threaten the emirate's remaining fertile land. The UAE is around the same size as Portugal, but some 80% of its land area is already desert. Its ecosystem is fragile and, partly due to desertification, much of its most valuable land is coming under increased strain. A government report published in 2019 stated that ""with an increase in population and food consumption systems, land degradation and desertification are becoming rampant"". Finding effective solutions has become a priority for the country. The goal is not to conquer the desert, but to restore areas of land that are no longer productive. You might also like: The UAE is uniquely positioned compared to many other countries affected by desertification in that it has the financial clout needed to nurture ideas and innovations. Dubai, especially, is making noises around going green, investing heavily in supporting green startups and tech-led education institutions with an environmental slant. You may also like: Dubai's very existence is testimony to what can be achieved when ambition and focus are financially backed. The mentality which helped build a city on sand is now being harnessed to fight against the desert's encroachment. If successful, the solutions developed here could have a major impact globally. Desertification is a type of land degradation whereby fertile, farmable land in arid or semi-arid regions becomes unproductive. It typically occurs when natural resources such as water and soil are overburdened, which makes the land less able to support vegetation. While it can happen naturally, desertification is increasingly prevalent both in the UAE and globally due to human activities such as overgrazing, intensive farming and infrastructure development. ""Desertification occurs when land and vegetation, usually at the borders of deserts, is overstressed,"" says William H Schlesinger, a biogeochemist and president emeritus of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in New York. He has studied deserts for more than 30 years. ""The result is a lower productivity of vegetation and often a transition to vegetation types that are less useful to human activities."" Approximately 12 million hectares (46,000 sq miles) are lost around the world each year as a direct consequence of drought and desertification. That's the equivalent of 2,000 American football fields every hour. To put that into context, if those fields were lined up end to end, you would have to drive at 130 mph (210km/h) just to keep pace with desertification's spread. In the last 20 years, the UAE's loss of valuable land has been stark. According to the World Bank, the UAE had 75,000 hectares (290 sq miles) of arable land in 2002, but by 2018 had only 42,300 hectares (163 sq miles). The data also indicated that, in the same timeframe, the percentage of agricultural land in the UAE fell from 7.97% to 5.38%. During the 1970s and 1980s, the UAE's utilisation of its vast oil reserves sparked an incredible period of growth and financial prosperity, but this largely happened without much consideration for the environment. In 2008, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) ranked the UAE as the country with the worst ecological footprint per person. ""The UAE's development over the past 40 years has required an environmentally unfriendly approach to the Earth's resources,"" says Dawn Chatty, a professor of anthropology at the University of Oxford. ""To undo that is going to require serious financial effort as well as social transformation."" Partly as a result of this negative press, the UAE – and Dubai in particular, which was a primary culprit – pledged to do things better. In 2012, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, prime minister of the UAE and ruler of Dubai, announced the UAE green growth strategy to ""maintain a sustainable environment to support long-term economic growth"" and build the country's green economy. ""Political and business leaders in the UAE understand that burnishing environmental credentials are incredibly important for presenting the country and cities like Dubai as modern,"" says professor Natalie Koch, a specialist in political geography at Syracuse University in New York. Decision-makers in the UAE are also concerned with how they will maintain their current wealth when oil resources run dry or become less valuable, says Gökçe Günel, professor of anthropology at Rice University in Texas and author of Spaceship in the Desert, a book about energy, climate change and urban design in Abu Dhabi. Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. ""There has definitely been a push to attract tech start-ups to the region since the early 2000s as part of Dubai's transition to a knowledge-based economy,"" she says. ""In this context, investments in renewable energy and clean technology, or more broadly in sustainability, also serve as means for economic diversification."" There are already a host of initiatives centered around Dubai. The Dubai Industrial Strategy 2030 outlines the city's plan to ""promote environmentally friendly and energy-efficient manufacturing"", while the 1 gigawatt (one billion watt) Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, located 30 miles (50 km) south of Dubai, is among the world's largest solar parks. But Dubai's environmental issues are far from solved, especially in the case of desertification. Drought, overuse of natural resources, swift urban development and increased soil salinity are all risks for the city. Failure to adequately address them threatens everything from the permanent loss of arable land to the demise of species native to the region. Additionally, given the UAE relies heavily on imports to support its rising population, there is a keen need to increase levels of internal food production so as to make the region more self-sufficient, and thereby more sustainable. In May 2021, Sheikh Mohammed launched Food Tech Valley, a research and innovation incubator that aims to triple the UAE's food production. To achieve this, the UAE is going to need effective anti-desertification initiatives. One approach that has long been touted as central to these efforts is the age-old environmental solution of simply planting more trees. ""Trees bind the soil, sequester carbon, improve soil fertility and also improve infiltration and recharge of groundwater,"" says Anna Tengberg, a professor at the Lund University Centre for Sustainability Studies in Sweden. Dubai's decision-makers are well aware of the potential impact trees can provide in the fight against desertification. In 2010, Sheikh Mohammed launched the One Million Trees initiative, aiming to plant a million trees in a bid to increase green areas in the city and halt desertification. However, according to Hamza Nazzal, a representative of Green Land, the company that developed the project in partnership with the government-backed Zayed International Foundation for the Environment, ""100% of the trees have died and the initiative has failed completely."" Nazzal says the project was ""abandoned"" after Dubai Holding, a government-owned investment company, announced the development of several real estate projects on the same land, although these ultimately did not get built. ""It is clear the project was used for PR and media purposes and to showcase initiatives designed to promote sustainability."" Nazzal states. ""If they really cared about the environment, they would have attempted to save the one million trees that were dying in front of them."" Christian Henderson, a professor of Middle East studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands, says it is ""questionable"" that the real objective of the project was genuine sustainability, noting that political prestige and the image of environmentalism also appear to have been important rationales. ""Ecologically, the failure of this project is a result of the fact that some of the trees were not suited to the environment of the UAE,"" he adds. Future Planet contacted Dubai Holding and the Dubai Municipality about the initiative, but has so far received no response. Selecting the right – preferably native – species is crucial to tree planting projects, agrees Tengberg, as is considering the spacing of trees when planting in dry areas and considering the benefits to local people. Despite the initiative's failure, planting trees is still seen as a core part of Dubai's anti-desertification strategy, as is the case elsewhere in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, for example, recently declared its ambition to plant 10 billion trees over the coming decades as part of its Saudi Green Initiative. Of course, for any project to succeed in a dry, arid landscape, understanding how to intelligently use scant water supplies to keep trees alive and healthy is crucial. Dubai, as well as other parts of the Middle East, has invested in numerous ""cloud seeding"" projects aimed at artificially inducing rain, but many of these are controversial, with success difficult to measure and some arguing it could lead to flooding, and others suggesting the materials used, such as silver iodine, could be harmful. New technologies developed by green start-ups such as Norwegian-based Desert Control offer a different route. Desert Control aims to improve Dubai's desertification problem by deploying liquid natural clay nanoparticles to rapidly turn desert sand into fertile soils. The technology works by spraying a liquid made of water and clay onto dry, damaged ground, creating a layer around 50cm (20in) deep. ""Gravity brings the tiny clay particles down into the ground, and they stick to every grain of sand they encounter,"" explains Ole Kristian Sivertsen, chief executive of Desert Control. ""They then form a soil structure that retains water like a sponge. This, in time, turns degraded sand into fertile soil.""  The nanoparticle liquid not only irrigates the land, but ensures the water can be retained by the soil in the long term, and allows it to hold more nutrients. As a result, mineral-deficient land can be given a new lease of life. The technology showcases the possibilities of forming soil in difficult environmental conditions, says Daniel Evans, who researches sustainable land systems at the Cranfield Soil and Agrifood Institute in the UK. Desert Control is still in the early stages of its story, but since 2019 has implemented liquid natural clay pilots in Dubai with several farmers and landowners and Dubai's International Center for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA). Different soil types require custom liquid natural clay compositions, so robust testing is needed to ensure the correct solution is used in each instance. According to Sivertsen, ICBA documented a 47% water saving using the technology for grasses typically used for sports turf, golf courses, parks and green landscapes. It has also seen better yields of food crops such as watermelon (17%), pearl millet (28%) and courgette (62%). In one project in Dubai, the treatment led to 50% water savings for palms and various other types of trees, says Sivertsen. Still, using liquid natural clay to grow great numbers of trees across Dubai will be a substantial task. ""A single date palm can drink some 250 litres [55 gallons] per day,"" Sivertsen says. Anne Verhoef, a soil physicist at the University of Reading, says that while liquid natural clay is ""in principle, a very exciting opportunity"" there are still questions around its practicality and viability. For example, the use of saline water could impact whether the soils remain healthy and suitable for agriculture in the long-run, she says. Due to the lack of freshwater availability in the UAE, water used in agriculture often comes via desalination plants, which can result in higher-than-normal levels of salt. It is therefore crucial that liquid natural clay is rolled out slowly, says Verhoef, with proper scientific trials taking place over a number of years to ensure there are no adverse effects on the soils, the wider environment and local communities. And even if liquid natural clay treatment works, says Evans, it does not tackle all the challenges to establishing agriculture in desert environments, such as storing harvested food and supporting the workforce needed to harvest crops. ""Technological innovations in robotics, AI and sensors could help to overcome these constraints,"" he adds. An estimated 75% of our planet's land area is already degraded but the issue often lacks the attention it warrants. ""It is a problem mostly affecting Africa, Asia and Latin America, and poor areas in developed countries, such as some dry and marginalised Mediterranean areas,"" says Tengberg. ""Rich countries are more concerned about climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution by chemicals."" This is reflected in the international environmental governance structure and financing mechanisms, she adds, with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification receiving far less multilateral funding than its counterparts in climate change and biodiversity. Given its vast wealth, its push to be at the forefront of progress, and the necessity of reclaiming land increasingly purloined by the sands, the UAE's anti-desertification efforts could provide a remedy to this, and a template for the rest of the world to follow. As a technological leader in the area, a progressive path forged by the country could bring wider benefits to surrounding countries and other regions facing uncertain futures due to desertification. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

economic indicators,Schools face widening gaps for poorer pupils,2024-09-15,2023-12-10,By Steve Duffy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67456134,"There are widening gaps between pupils from poorer backgrounds and their classmates from better off homes since the post-Covid return to school in Wales. Six key measures reveal the struggles to address this divide, which had been an issue already before the pandemic. Last week brought the worst set of maths, science and reading results for 15-year-olds in the global Pisa tests Here we look at this and other challenges. Whether a pupil is entitled to free school meals has been a long-standing measure of whether they come from a poorer economic background, based on the family being on low income or receiving benefits.  Around 95,000 pupils qualify for free school meals, about 20% of all pupils. All children missed months of classroom teaching during Covid and on key measures, the impact can be seen clearly, but there are worries this is even bigger on those from low income families. Here are the areas of concern: The number of permanent exclusions in 2022 was at a record high - more than 300 pupils. But the rate of permanent exclusions was more than five times higher for pupils entitled to free school meals than those who weren't eligible - 1.7 permanent exclusions per 1,000 pupils compared with 0.3.   These are still a rarity.  Fixed-term exclusions are more common - that's five days or less, with the top reasons abusing or threatening a teacher and assaulting a fellow pupil. There were nearly 28,000 such short-term exclusions in the last year. The exclusion rate for this is now nearly four times higher for those entitled to free school meals than those who are not. The gap had been growing in the two years before the pandemic but now it's the widest on record. This comes at a time when exclusions for all secondary pupils has risen by 35% since the year before Covid. School absenteeism - especially persistent absence - has got much worse since the pandemic. Pupils have been judged to be persistently absent if they miss 20% of class time. So that is 60 half-day sessions a year. But that threshold has now been changed to 10% - in a move designed to focus even more on improving attendance. Education Minister Jeremy Miles said in a recent article: ""Too many teachers tell me they are seeing challenging behaviour, worse attendance and lower levels of literacy and numeracy. We must not allow this to become the 'new normal'."" The figures we have for school absence are more up to date than the ones available for exclusions. The percentage of secondary school pupils who were persistently absent has tripled to 16.3% from 2018-19 - the last full academic year before Covid - and 2022-23. The figures also show that 35.6% of secondary school pupils eligible for free school meals were persistently absent in 2022-23, compared with 11.2% of those who did not qualify.  This is three times higher and an alarming widening of a gap which has now become a gulf. It gets wider as secondary school pupils get older too. The most recent figures so far this first term of the 2023-24 academic year - which includes primary school pupils - show 4.7% of students have met the persistent absence threshold of 10% of sessions missed, slightly down on the previous year. But 10% of those eligible for free school meals are persistently absent (on the 10% threshold), compared with 2.7% of pupils not eligible. The school inspection body Estyn said in its annual report: ""Work to improve attendance has not led to a marked increase in attendance, especially that of pupils eligible for free school meals.""  The attendance rate for the academic year to date has been higher for pupils not eligible for free school meals (93%) than pupils who are eligible for free school meals (86.4%). A widening gap can also be seen in terms of GCSE results. Let's look at two measures here. Firstly, the so-called ""Capped 9 indicator"". This looks at the grades in a pupil's top nine subjects, including literacy, numeracy and science. Points are awarded, with an average points score overall at 365.5. But the points gap between pupils sitting GCSEs who are eligible for free school meals and those who aren't has widened from 77.3 before the pandemic to 88.7 in 2022-23.  The gap is widest in science subjects and narrowest in literacy. Next, when it comes to GCSE grades, Qualifications Wales figures show of pupils eligible for free school meals, 8.3% of grades were the top A and A*, compared to 24.1% of those not eligible. The gap has widened from 14 points before the pandemic to 15.7 in 2023. For those not eligible for free school meals, 70% of the grades were C or above, compared to 41.6% of those who were eligible. That gap has also grown slightly since 2019. When we look at pupils assessed in key subjects at the end of key stage 3 - aged 14 - then the gap is at its widest for 10 years. Just over half (55%) of those eligible for free school meals achieved the core subject indicator - compared to 83% of those pupils not eligible. The gap had been narrowing for most of the years before the pandemic. The new Pisa report for Wales found that there was more academic ""resilience"" than the international average - with more pupils from the poorest backgrounds ranking in the top performers in the maths, science and reading tests. However, there were still gaps in performance between those from the poorer and richer socio-economic backgrounds. When looking at free school meal status, on average learners eligible performed significantly lower in the maths test (average score 423) than learners not eligible (471). Similar patterns were seen in reading (429 and 471) and science (430 for those eligible and 478 for those not eligible) Figures also show similar issues around attainment involving apprentices from poorer backgrounds. Recent figures have also looked at how more than 7,600 apprentices got on - and analysed this against their free school meal eligibility history for when they were in secondary school. The report says: ""Before the coronavirus pandemic, apprentices who had never been eligible for FSM had higher success rates than those who had been eligible, but the gap was narrowing.  ""In 2021-22, the gap increased to more than three times the difference in 2018-19."" The success rate fell post-Covid for all apprentices, but fell much more sharply for those who had been free school meal eligible. Finola Wilson, a former English and maths teacher and director of Caerphilly-based education improvement organisation, Impact, said Covid had further disadvantaged the most vulnerable in society.  ""Children who were already struggling to engage with and access school are now in a worse situation,"" she said.  ""Addressing the disadvantage gap is a societal problem. Each child's situation will be different and will need an individual response. The first target should be to make sure all pupils are receiving an education, whether in school or via alternative provision.  ""We also need to address the mental health crisis exacerbated by covid, which affects children and their parents and carers."""
economic indicators,A year of jobs in Trump's America,2024-09-15,2017-11-08,Christopher Borick / Illustrations by Piero Zagami,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20171108-are-american-workers-more-optimistic-under-trump,"On 8 November 2016, presidential candidate Donald Trump defied critics and pollsters alike with a surprise election win. Many voters hoped a political outsider would boost their job prospects and revive embattled industries – so one year on, how do US workers feel about the future of their jobs and industries? BBC Capital commissioned pollsters SmithGeiger to survey 2,060 people across the US, asking whether they felt more or less optimistic about their job prospects a year after the election. We found that almost half of adult Americans do not feel any different about the future of their job since last November’s election, with fairly equal portions optimistic and pessimistic about the direction of their employment situation. Given a tumultuous year in which economic conditions in the US flourished at the same time as the Trump administration struggled to win over the American public, the stability of individual perceptions about their jobs and industries may seem surprising. Key economic indicators such as employment rates, wage levels and the stock market have performed well during Donald Trump’s first year in office. Unemployment has fallen to a 17-year low rate of 4.1%, average hourly wages have risen by 2.8% in the past year and the S&P 500 is up 21% since the election. It is worth putting these figures into context: all of these indicators continue trends that were already in place under President Barack Obama, where the stock market and wages were rising and unemployment falling. But most polls have shown the American public to be pessimistic about the direction of the nation as a whole. For example, a recent Economist/YouGov poll found 60% of Americans think the nation is on the wrong track, compared to only 27% that feel America is headed in the right direction. The same poll at the end of January found 52% of Americans were pessimistic about the nation’s path, compared with 35% optimistic about the trajectory of the country. This rise in pessimism may be linked to President Trump’s disapproval ratings, which have risen by 10 points over the year. The juxtaposition of positive employment measures and negative perceptions of the nation’s future complicates expectations for how Americans may evaluate the outlook for their jobs and industries. Indeed, the large portion of Americans who don't feel differently about the outlook for their careers since Trump’s victory may reflect the conflicting relationship between generally positive employment and economic performance and broader pessimism about the direction of the nation. As is often the case, workers’ perceptions of their jobs and industries are affected by their personal characteristics. American men were twice as likely as their female counterparts (30% to 15%) to be more optimistic about the future of their jobs since Donald Trump’s election. The confluence of long-standing gender inequities such as a significant pay gap between women and men play a part, but significant tensions between many American women and the Trump administration could also be a factor in the low levels of optimism among women regarding their careers. Similarly, white Americans express greater optimism about their employment futures than other racial and ethnic groups. The increased racial tensions that have marked Trump’s first year in office and perennial wage gaps between different ethnic groups will likely have contributed to elevated levels of pessimism among minority populations. Among white Americans there were roughly equal percentages of people feeling optimistic or pessimistic, but we saw the trend swing more towards pessimism with other ethnic groups. The most noticeable swing towards pessimism versus optimism was seen among Asian-Americans, a group that has experienced strong levels of economic success in recent years. The Trump administration’s policy positions on trade and national security in relation to Asia may be causing a general unease within this fast-growing cohort of Americans. Donald Trump’s 2016 victory is often attributed to his ability to energise rural voters with promises to bring jobs back to the small towns and rural areas of America, and he has often highlighted announcements from companies that have expanded or relocated in rural regions. But the survey results suggest that rural Americans are not significantly more optimistic about the future of their jobs than those in the suburbs or the cities. The limited optimism among rural Americans may reflect the entrenched economic impediments that rural communities often face. President Trump has certainly promised to revitalise these communities but the difficult realities of economically transforming these areas may be tempering optimism among rural Americans. Unlike its effect on many aspects of life, age does not seem to be a potent factor in explaining one’s career outlook. There is very little variation across generations of Americans regarding the future of their jobs and industries. Notably the survey did not include a segment for older workers, age 55 and above, and thus potential differences in this age group were not examined. Trump also performed very well among Americans with lower levels of educational attainment in his 2016 victory, winning a majority of voters with no more than a high school degree while losing a majority of Americans with a university degree or more formal education. The survey results indicate that less-educated Americans are modestly more optimistic than those with a bachelors or graduate degree. President Trump’s focus on areas such as manufacturing and mining, which tend to employ more Americans with lower levels of educational attainment, may be buoying optimism among this group. Conversely, the Trump administration’s tense relationship with tech giants such as Apple, Google and Amazon may be raising concern among more highly educated Americans working in these industries. For the nearly one in four Americans who feel more optimistic about the future of their jobs, the economy and the performance of their own industry were the most commonly noted reasons behind the optimistic appraisals. A significant portion of those optimistic about the future of their jobs also cited the possibility of tax reform as a key reason for their positive outlook. With both the White House and Congress pushing forward on what potentially could be America’s most comprehensive tax reform since the Reagan years, segments of the workforce are banking on decreased tax burdens to grow many industries. For those pessimistic about the future of their jobs and industries, non-economic factors played major roles – in particular, America’s relationship with the world and the mood of the nation. President Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and his desire to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) has caused considerable consternation among many business interests in the United States and could also drag down optimism for the future of some jobs and industries. In all, the very positive macroeconomic performance measures of the American economy during President Trump’s first year in office do not appear to have translated into widespread optimism among Americans about the future of their jobs. While levels of pessimism are certainly not high, it doesn’t seem the robust economic conditions are resonating with people in the way one might expect. Concerns about the broader direction of the nation and America’s relationship with other nations appear to be muting the impact of strong economic performance on American perceptions about their jobs and industries in upcoming years.

economic indicators,Market madness: Mind your money,2024-09-15,2014-11-03,Vikram Barhat,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20140717-market-madness-mind-your-money,"A shaky global economy and jittery stock indices are making investors nervous these days. Having barely recovered from a sharp decline on 10 July amid concerns about the financial health of Portuguese lender Banco Espirito, the focus of world’s stock markets has now shifted to record high stock prices and economic weakness in North America, of which the US Federal Reserve warned on Tuesday and the Bank of Canada on Wednesday. Though this hasn’t triggered a sustained rout in global equities, money managers across the developed world are taking this opportunity to warn investors that markets in North America have been building toward an inevitable slump and that they should brace themselves for as much as a 20% plunge. A sharp decline of between 5% to 20% or more, called a “correction” in market parlance, would be completely normal given that it’s been nearly three years since the last major pullback, said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Canadian wealth management firm Gluskin Sheff and Associates Inc. “In terms of how big a correction, I would say between 5% and 10%,” he said adding that “in this historic period of ultra-low volatility, it will feel more like 20%.” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Harris Bank in Chicago has been predicting a similar downdraft in the US equity market. “A correction is entirely possible, certainly from a valuation perspective [for] the S&P is trading at about 25% above its median price-to-sales ratio” he argued. “A 10% correction isn't out of the question. All major equity markets could be susceptible to a correction.” An eye on global economies The view from Europe isn’t any better. Jason Hollands, managing director of business development and communications at Bestinvest Ltd brokerage in London has been urging caution for some months. “The US market looks particularly expensive,” Hollands said. “The extreme levels of money printing in recent years by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks, combined with ultra-low interest rates, has turbocharged markets and inflated asset prices.” Globally, central banks have embarked on a journey that will eventually result in more “normal” monetary policy. The Bank of England ended its own Quantitative Easing (asset purchase programme) in 2012, while the Fed has been scaling back its stimulus since the start of this year. As well, leaders of the world’s most important central banks, including Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, and Janet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve have been indicating interest rates could start to rise again soon. Higher interest rates could hurt many S&P 500 companies whose earnings growth in recent years has come, predominantly, from the ability to refinance debt very cheaply. Hollands said these are indications that “some steam coming out of the pressure cooker is a possibility.” He doesn’t see a stock market crash deeper than 10% but said “when a wild party comes to an end, it'll leave some with a hangover.” A set of triggers Triggers for a drastic market correction — such as an interest rate shock and steep stock prices in the US, overheated housing market in Canada, geopolitical events in the Middle East and Ukraine, economic slowdown in emerging markets, and fears of recession in Europe — are all there, yet market volatility (a measure of how widely prices swing) has been eerily low, said Hollands. “This feels like there’s too much complacency,” he said. “You could think of it as the calm before the storm.” Increased interconnectedness within key global markets means that the meltdown will likely spill over into other regions, regardless of where it begins. “There's a saying that when America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold,” said Hollands. “Were the US market to experience a slide, you might see contagion to other exchanges.” Similarly, the Greek debt crisis and fears of hard landing in China in the recent past showed that a macroeconomic event can have a knock-on effect on financial markets far from its epicenter. “All major equity markets could be susceptible to a correction,” said Ablin but asserted that “US small caps appear to be among the most precariously positioned markets now, due to their high valuations.” Small capitalisation stocks are companies that have revenue of more than $300m but less than $2bn. These companies, said Rosenberg, have been selling for 20 times their earnings versus the historic average of 15 times. Large-cap stocks, companies that are larger than $10bn, have been selling for 15.5 times their earnings relative to the long run average of 13.5 times, he added. At biggest risk When US investors panic, they have a tendency to sell the assets they hold overseas and bring their cash home. That means that emerging markets, including Mexico, Turkey and Indonesia, are often the first casualty. Currently, emerging markets appear calm, but Hollands said trouble could be brewing underneath the surface. “The big risk remains in China,” said Hollands. “Its economic growth rate is slowing, but it has only scratched the surface so far in terms of its need to rebalance its economy away from construction and infrastructure investment and towards the consumer.” Yet in India, the other key member of the economic bloc, positive macroeconomic data and political developments have kept the market buoyed. Bengaluru, India-based Kunal Kumar Kundu, vice president and India economist at French financial firm Societe Generale doesn’t foresee a meaningful decline in India. “The Indian equity market is close to be fairly valued and offers a compelling story supported by relatively high growth and a strong government,” he said. “[India’s new] government is expected to usher in some much-desired reform measures. Within the emerging markets space, India looks a safe bet.” But things can change pretty quickly in emerging markets. Rosenberg said markets that bear the brunt during turbulent times are generally those that are the riskiest and have the highest beta — a measure of a stock’s risk relative to the overall market. “I would expect emerging markets to suffer the most in a downdraft,” he added. Andrew Hamlin, vice president and portfolio manager at Aston Hill Asset Management Inc in Toronto said if history repeats itself, a sell-off could be closer than we think. “Summer months are traditionally slower months for the equity market and August is usually a dreadful month for investors,” he said. “Equity markets in the last three of four years in August have been down months with the smallest down being about 3%. We’re heading into that so there could very well be a sell-off in the market.” If the correction is sparked by a rate shock or an economic setback, “the sectors most vulnerable would likely be financials, homebuilders, utilities and capital goods,” Rosenberg said. Ablin said when equity markets tumble, the momentum sectors — lead by technology and consumer discretionaries — could suffer more than others due to a colossal bubble in asset prices. What should investors do? It’s time for investors to rebalance their portfolios not just to weather the storm by taking some risk off the table, but also to strategically ramp up or down certain weightings, said Hamlin. Now, he asserted, is a prime time for investors to take a good look at their holdings. “If you’ve got some big winners in your portfolio, take some gains by selling them,” he urged. “Don’t be afraid to build a war chest of cash, so when a correction does occur you’re able to buy back your favourite names at cheaper prices.” Investors should take time to build a shopping list of stocks or bonds they want to own when they get cheaper as a result of market spasms, he added. As for stock selection, Rosenberg said to focus on high-quality companies with earnings visibility. “We are moving through an era of deflation to reflation to inflation, so I would be hedged by having exposure to energy, gold and basic materials in general,” he said. When markets fall, investors tend to flee to larger, dividend-generating companies with robust balance sheets. “These are safe-haven blue-chip stocks such as utility companies and tobacco firms,” Hollands said.  This story was produced under the BBC's guidelines for financial journalism.

economic indicators,A radical plan to tackle obesity,2024-09-15,2018-11-19,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20181113-bittersweet---whos-benefitting-from-the-sugar-tax,"Has a radical plan to help this country kick its sugar habit finally paid off?    Ryan Allen put one foot on his accomplice’s shoulder and hoisted himself onto a bronze horse statue in the centre of Royal Exchange Square in Glasgow in Scotland. Passers-by filmed the spectacle on their phones as he saddled up behind the bronze of the first Duke of Wellington. “There was adrenaline. It was technically illegal,” he later said. “It was just a sense of relief and accomplishment when I got up there.” For more than 30 years, local pranksters had decorated the monument with traffic cones. Now in July 2017, from his seat behind the ‘Iron Duke’, Allen triumphantly crowned it with one of his own. He considered his act righteous and necessary, emulating the Duke’s own fighting spirit. But Allen’s cause wasn’t land or liberty. It was fizzy drinks. Painted in the orange and blue style of his favourite Scottish beverage, the cone was inscribed with one simple demand: “Bring Back Real Irn-Bru.” Three months earlier, the UK government brought in a so-called ‘fat tax’, a multi-tiered levy on sugary soft drinks - the latest effort to curb dangerous levels of obesity. Public Health England (PHE) hoped to push companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Red Bull to reformulate their products in ways that encouraged lower and less frequent sugar consumption. If they failed to change their recipes before 6 April 2018, the tax would go into effect and retailers would be forced to raise prices. Most opted to change the recipes of their popular drinks. The Soft Drinks Industry Levy, also dubbed the ‘sugar tax’, seems to many in the UK like a sensible idea. But for lifelong lovers of fizzy drinks like Allen, it’s a direct assault on his culture. To him, less sugar in the iconic Scottish drink means less flavour. In July, the message on his traffic cone was clear. How does a place like the UK respond to going cold turkey? To understand the scale of its sugar addiction you need to look at the next generation - 20% of Year 6 children (aged 10-11) are obese. Some 26% of adults are classified as obese in England. Can a tax really be used to promote cultural evolution? And if it can, what’s the best way to measure its success? Click or pinch to zoom on mobile. A dire prognosis The UK government debuted ‘Childhood obesity: A plan for action’ in August 2016, a comprehensive report produced by the PHE outlining the obesity epidemic and several paths toward a healthier future. PHE found that nearly a third of children age two to 15 were overweight or obese, and that people were becoming obese earlier in life and staying obese for longer. “The economic costs are great, too,” the report cited. “We spend more each year on the treatment of obesity and diabetes than we do on the police, fire service and judicial system combined.” PHE found that the National Health Service (and therefore every UK tax payer) spends £5.1bn ($6.6bn) on weight-related medical services a year. In 2018, the estimate climbed to £6.1bn ($8bn). Among its long list of solutions was the levy on sugary drinks. Teenagers in England, the biggest consumers of such drinks in Europe, could max out their recommended daily intake of sugar with a single 330 millilitre (ml) can. The time had come to tackle one of the underlying sources of the problem. Then-Chancellor George Osborne announced the tax during the 2016 Budget Statement. The government would wait two years before implementing it to give manufacturers time to adjust their formulas. Companies that refused to reduce sugar would be taxed in two bands. Drinks with more than 5 grams (g) of sugar per 100ml would face a tax equivalent to 18p per litre ($0.23). More than 8g would add a 24p tax per litre ($0.31). The expected yearly revenue was about £500m ($650m), which PHE said would be invested in obesity-reduction programmes for children. Click or pinch to zoom on mobile. People might have expected drinks companies to erupt in outrage at the announcement and for the Treasury to sit in eager anticipation of a funding boost. But it was just the opposite. It was almost as if they had seen it coming. Soft drink manufacturers rapidly began looking at ways to reformulate their products around the new guidelines, often swapping sugar for artificial sweeteners. Supermarkets Tesco, Asda and drinks companies Fanta, Ribena, Britvic and Lucozade slashed the sugar content in their drinks, some by half or more. Irn-Bru reduced its own recipe from 10.3g of sugar to 4.7g per 100ml, stoking the ire of loyalists like Allen. The new formulas began rolling out long before the April 2018 deadline with minimal exceptions. Coca-Cola and Pepsi, opted to shoulder the tax hike and maintain their sugar content. While Pepsi declined to comment on this to BBC Capital, a spokesperson for Coca-Cola says that although Coca-Cola Original Taste is the only product not reformulated in recent years, the company's decision was made with its customers in mind. ""We decided not to change the recipe because people love it and have asked us not to change it. We believe people should have choice."" The number of new soft drink launches with less than 5g of sugar per 100ml since the 2016 report has risen from 32 to 45. Inversely, new beverages above the recommended threshold are down from 60 to 49 in 2018. Of course, as more companies met PHE’s sugar standards, anticipated tax revenue fell from £500m to £385m by mid-2017, then again to £275m in November. Today, more than seven months since the tax was formally applied, it’s generated a measly £62m ($80m). But Treasury officials are nonetheless hailing the tax a success. Lower revenue for the government implies a greater willingness by companies to hit healthier benchmarks. In this case, paradoxically, less really is more. Kicking an ingrained habit  In the midst of this entente cordiale some can’t help but reflect on the days before obesity was considered an epidemic. Naveed Sattar, professor of Cardiology and Medical Sciences at the University of Glasgow, remembers growing up without fear of overdoing the sugar. UK obesity levels were 4%-7% in the 1980s when Sattar was a kid helping in his father’s corner shop. He often watched customers stock up on four litres of Irn-Bru a day. “There’s many people who have grown up on Irn-Bru,” Sattar says. “I drank lots of Irn-Bru from a young age because I didn’t know any better. It was there.” Sattar’s biggest reality check came in medical school. In a test of 300 people, Sattar was found to have one of the highest risks of diabetes based on his insulin levels. When his weight jumped three stone, he knew he needed to ditch the sugar. “I religiously had two sugars in my tea, but I cut it,” he says. The transition, while difficult, was rather quick. Soon, his taste buds adjusted. “Now if you put it back in my tea, it’s vile.” But quitting a soft drink addiction isn’t always that simple. One Irn-Bru addict at the cardiovascular clinic Sattar runs was referred due to high blood fat levels and a recent heart attack. He regularly drank six litres a day, Sattar says, and even got up in the night for a sip. He lost eight kilos after Sattar treated him, and began enjoying proper food for the first time in years. “If people really give themselves a chance, you can adapt your taste buds,” Sattar says. “Just because they like something doesn’t mean they couldn’t change with a little time and a little perseverance.” Sattar represents the majority of those in the medical community and wider public willing to accept the tax for the overall betterment of health. But he thinks it’s much too early to celebrate. Cutting out fizzy drinks is a great start, but experts believe they account for only 5% of the larger obesity issue. Even with thousands of other sugary foods at their disposal, the more outspoken Irn-Bru fans think the tax has gone too far. Irn-Bru declined to comment when approached by BBC Capital. Allen followed up his cone stunt with a petition aimed at parent company AG Barr that received more than 50,000 signatures. Another man came up with his own Irn-Bru-flavoured concoction that he claims tastes just like the original. Others stockpiled the full-sugar version and now sell it illegally online. Allen says he drinks four cans a week, which would cost him about £124 ($161) annually if he purchased each 300ml can individually. Had the makers refused to alter their recipe and passed the tax to Allen, his annual spend would have risen to about £140 ($182). “I would have rather paid the tax,” he says. “It’s brand-suicide and it’s a betrayal of the customers who have made it what it is.” Few can match Allen’s passion, but he’s not alone. According to Kiti Soininen, head of food, drink and foodservice research at Mintel, 64% of people say they drink the same amount they did a year ago and 10% say they drink more. The extra-hot summer weather likely affected consumption a bit, Soininen says, but it’s an indicator that the UK has a long way to go. Click or pinch to zoom on mobile. Global action  The UK is a latecomer to action on sugary drinks. Beginning mostly in the Pacific Islands, levies have slowly spread through cities and countries across every continent since the early ‘80s. Mexico’s 10% tax accelerated the movement in 2014. After just one year, Mexicans were consuming 12% less sugary drinks, the most significant reductions in the poorest households. Five other areas followed suit the same year with a tax of their own, six each in 2015 and 2016, and a whopping 13 in 2017. Hungary witnessed a 40% decrease in soft drink sugar content in the wake of its tax. In Berkeley, California, a minimal tax decreased overall consumption by 21%. According to the World Cancer Research Fund, a total of 48 cities, nations and territories have now imposed taxes of some type on their soft drinks.   But it’s not all plain sailing. Chicago authorities repealed their 1-cent-per-ounce tax in 2017 just two months after it was applied. The measure was pitched primarily as a way of plugging the city’s $1.8bn budget gap (£1.4bn). Health concerns and obesity prevention were secondary priorities, according to the Washington Post. A media battle between the drinks companies and public health groups ended in defeat for the tax’s supporters. The UK’s cooperation with health officials and commitment to school programmes has, so far, allowed its tax to succeed where Chicago’s failed. Looking long-term, one Cambridge University study uses a different yardstick to measure success. It estimates that the tax raised liable soft drink prices by approximately 38%, leading to a 26% decrease in consumption in England. Researchers say this decrease would prevent approximately 370 coronary heart disease deaths, effectively generating about 4,490 life years by 2021. Comparing the 617,000 hospital admissions in 2016 in which obesity was a factor, the projection becomes all the more realistic. As Sattar cautioned, the war on obesity has only just started. Although the Department of Health and Social Care’s plan to cut 20% of sugar in foods most commonly eaten by children is well on its way, the UK has not met the overall 5% reduction goal for its first year. Whether a new wave of levies is picking up speed is anyone’s guess, but given the soft drink tax’s early success, Sattar believes it to be the best way forward. “We need some clever people to make these companies aware of the changes they need to make,” he says. “Pricing taxation does work if you do it properly.” -- To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook  page or message us on Twitter.

economic indicators,Africa’s most exciting city for tech?,2024-09-15,2019-03-18,Thomas Lewton,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190318-addis-ababa-africas-most-exciting-city-of-innovators,"Talented young tech workers want to transform Ethiopia by finding unique solutions to local problems – and with a new prime minister, now may be their time. “I am young, ambitious and ready to transform my country, Ethiopia,” Selam Wondim announces to a conference room packed with high-profile executives and politicians in one of Addis Ababa’s most prestigious hotels. The 29-year old tech entrepreneur has been invited to speak to delegates at a side event of the 32nd African Union Summit, where she hopes to persuade governments across the continent to support technology ecosystems. We need “safe places for us to experiment, fail and succeed in this start-up game,” she says. You might also like: - Why we shouldn’t try to replicate Silicon Valley  - How to teach a distracted generation  - A generation of cyberslackers Here in Ethiopia, she has a receptive audience. Last year Abiy Ahmed, 42, was elected prime minster and quickly made his mark with a series of sweeping reforms, including the release of thousands of political prisoners and the restoration of diplomatic relations with Eritrea. Also among his policies are changes to business, finance, telecoms and education, signalling that technology is now a priority for the government. With this in mind, Wondim and others believe that Addis Ababa could soon become one of Africa’s leading innovation centres, potentially rivalling Nairobi, Lagos or Cape Town. Half of Africa’s tech hubs are found in only four countries: Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Ghana. These same countries account for three quarters of the funds raised by start-ups – funds which are rising rapidly as investors are drawn to the continent. In 2018 alone there was a four-fold increase in start-up funding compared to the previous year. Wondim wants Ethiopia – and her own start-up GroHydro, which manufactures hydroponic farming systems – to be part of this growth. GroHydro is based out of blueMoon, one of several incubation centres found in Addis Ababa’s Bole district. ‘Necessity driving tech innovation’ blueMoon looks like tech hubs and incubators around the world – inspirational quotes adorn the walls of co-working spaces (“Stay hungry, stay foolish” or “#daretodisrupt”), bean-bags abound and a bright blue auto rickshaw is inexplicably nestled in the corner of one room, eight floors above street level. But behind the aesthetic lies an unusual outlook on what sort of problems technology should be solving. “In developed countries technology is creating a comfort or a convenience, whereas in Ethiopia it’s creating a necessity,” says Betelhem Dessie, a tech educator at iCog Labs, the country’s leading artificial intelligence hub. Despite two decades of sustained and substantial economic growth, Ethiopia still has one of the lowest GDPs per capita in the world and most people are subsistence farmers. Now young Ethiopians are turning to technology to tackle the challenges they face. “Great ideas are essentially solutions to problems,” says Eleni Gabre-Madhin, blueMoon’s founder. “And if anything we have a lot of problems.” Gabre-Madhin offers M-Pesa – a mobile banking company based in Kenya – as an example of how technology can uniquely transform developing economies. “Because there wasn’t bricks and mortar banking set up, we didn’t have legacy systems that had to be dismantled to go to mobile banking,” she says. Agriculture, education and healthcare systems are ripe for such technological “leapfrogging” too. One Ethiopian example is Flowius, a start-up taking a radical approach to building affordable water pipelines by using mobile surveying tools, solar power and microfinance. “There are so many people who walk for water,” says Markos Lemma, co-founder of Flowius. “We want innovation that contextually makes sense. Finding local solutions for local problems, instead of adopting solutions all the time.” ‘More connected’ Lemma is also the co-founder of iceaddis, another innovation hub down the road from blueMoon set up in 2011 as the first of its kind in Addis Ababa. In recent years he’s seen young Ethiopians’ interest in technology blossom. “It’s crazy!” he exclaims, looking out over Bole’s bustling streets. “It feels like it’s happening right now. It’s opening up.” In less than a decade, around 100 start-ups have emerged out of Addis Ababa’s nascent tech ecosystem. Every day Lemma receives several meeting requests from technology enthusiasts, asking for advice on how to bring their product to market. He believes a dramatic rise in internet access is a major factor in this change – increasing from 1% of individuals using the internet in 2011 to more than 15% today. The expansion of mobile phone networks, alongside falling smartphone prices, have led to a similar increase in internet users across sub-Saharan Africa. “When more people are connected to the internet, they know what is out there,” he says. “It creates a lot of excitement and motivation.” Wondim and her hydroponics start-up are a case in point. “Before I applied to blueMoon, I used to experiment watching YouTube and I came across this technology. I was really surprised that we can grow crops without soil,” she says. Taking this existing technology, Wondim then created a new business model – one moulded to Ethiopian society. “The youth think that agriculture and farming is outdated, and are even abandoning their parents’ and grandparents’ land,” she explains. “If we make it more high-tech, we can promote the youth into that business.” GroHydro systems are also being designed for refugees in Ethiopia’s urban centres who are often marginalised. Not only does this empower refugees with an income, but Wondim hopes that through business a dialogue will be created between refugees and Ethiopians. “We need to start some kind of engagement,” she says. Ethiopia’s society is highly communal. Injera – a traditional flatbread eaten with most meals – is always shared from the same plate, while coffee is drunk together several times a day. Such social norms influence the tech solutions being developed in Addis Ababa. Lemma points to a traditional crowd-saving practice – called Equb – in which family members and friends regularly put money into a shared pot, and then wait their turn for the dividends. Recently this Ethiopian custom has been digitised into a mobile app. “You wouldn’t think about this in another market, unless you had that culture,” he says. Investors needed While Addis Ababa is teeming with innovative ideas like these, turning them into marketable products is an uphill struggle. For decades, Ethiopia’s business environment has remained conservative and bureaucratic. “Commercialisation for any business here is hard, but if you’re looking at tech innovation, it’s way harder,” says Lemma. The procedure to open or close a new business is lengthy and expensive – the antithesis of the start-up model. Yet Abiy has indicated reforms are on the horizon. In December, he launched the ‘Doing Business Initiative’, which aims to lower the regulatory and administrative hurdles for businesses and promote investment. Foreign investment in Ethiopia is currently tightly controlled, hampering many of its budding start-ups. On a chalkboard scrawled with aspirations at blueMoon there is one common thread: “I want to meet investors”. And while internet access has leapt in recent years, the telecoms sector – which state-owned Ethio Telecom has a monopoly on – is notoriously expensive and unreliable. Under the previous government, nationwide internet blackouts were common as the state shut down communications in the face of widespread protests and ethnic violence. Internet blackouts are a thing of the past since Abiy came to power. He’s also opening up to foreign investment, with Ethio Telecom set to be partially privatised and split into two competing businesses as a first step. In February, he told the Financial Times: “My economic model is capitalism.” Yet the rapid liberalisation of Ethiopia’s economy carries with it the risk of neo-colonialism. Getnet Assefa, the co-founder of iCog Labs and an ardent support of many of Abiy’s reforms notes that most of the technology companies in Kenya and Nigeria are foreign-owned. “Yes, they have a lot of investment,” he says. “But if you look at it in terms of homegrown tech, Ethiopia is doing reasonably well.” Assefa believes the government must tread a line between encouraging foreign investment and fostering the growth of Ethiopian tech companies. Nurturing ideas In July, Abiy met with Sophia the Robot, who was partly built at iCog Labs. “We programmed Sophia to speak a small amount of Amharic for the prime minister,” says Assefa. As much as Abiy’s appearance was a publicity stunt, it signalled his commitment to the technology sector. “People are now seeing Ethiopia in a different eye, not just poverty and politics,” says Assefa. Optimism abounds in Addis Ababa’s tech community, but Lemma cautions that many of Abiy’s proposed changes are yet to happen. “I really support his ideas and his ambition,” he says. “But on the flip side, this is all theoretical.” In the meantime Lemma, Gabre-Madhin and others are nurturing the technology ecosystem themselves. Alongside incubators, they are creating workshops, mentor networks and funding opportunities. “We set out to do something very holistic,” says Gabre-Madhin. In particular, there’s a need to connect university graduates to this technology ecosystem. In the last two decades, the number of universities in Ethiopia has increased from two to more than 40, while it’s mandatory government policy for 70% of university students to study science and engineering subjects. “If you nurture this talent and provide a landing for all of this energy and passion, something good is going to come out of it,” says Gabre-Madhin. “The difference between where ideas thrive and where they die is the fertile ground on which they fall.” -- To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook  page or message us on Twitter.

economic indicators,Snapshot shows economic strategy progress,2024-09-15,2023-12-24,By Alex Blake,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-67801940,"The Manx government's economic strategy has shown ""signs of growth"" in its first year, the chief minister has said. The 10-to-15-year plan was launched in November 2022 with a number of targets to grow the working population. Alfred Cannan said the report was an ""overarching snapshot"" of  ""early indicators of progress"".  He said despite the ""economic challenges"" the report had shown things were moving forward positively. However Mr Cannan said there was ""still work to do over the coming years to ensure long term security, vibrancy and sustainability"", and the ""full value"" of the strategy would be ""felt over the long-term"". Government hopes to grow the population to 100,000 by 2037 and create 5,000 new employment opportunities.  The report said jobs had risen by 3% since November 2022 with 1,500 new roles, and there was a ""general trend of population growth"" with an average 90 to 100 more people each quarter. The plan's next target is to reach 1,800 new jobs by 2026. The first year report outlined that government had received an estimated £40m ahead of what was budgeted in income tax receipts, however a final figure on that would be announced in February's budget. It also stated market volatility and ""some large expenditures"" had effected the government's ""externally invested reserves"", which had fallen from more than £2bn in 2021 to £1.7m in 2023. Next year's focus was redesigning the Department for Enterprise's support schemes, which were ""a key factor"" in attracting and growing businesses, the report stated. Treasury Minister Alex Allinson said the year had seen ""growing numbers of people employed, new housing developments going through planning approval, and increasing tax receipts"". While the island had tackled cost of living challenges throughout 2023, he said there were positive signs of economic strength. The report will be presented to Tynwald in January.

economic indicators,China trade surplus hits new record,2024-09-15,2015-03-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-31787698,"Premier Li Keqiang has announced a lowered growth target of around 7% China's monthly trade surplus hit a record $60.6bn (£40.3bn) in February, as exports grew and imports slid back. Exports were up 48.3% year on year to $169.2bn, and imports dropped by a fifth to $108.6bn, said the country's General Administration of Customs. The growth in exports was well ahead of analyst expectations. China's economy grew by 7.4% in 2014, its weakest for almost a quarter of a century, and recent indicators show signs the slowdown is continuing. Customs officials put the surge in exports down to a flurry of activities by companies to get orders processed before the Chinese New Year, which fell in the middle of February this year.  ""Affected by the Spring Festival factors, export companies in the country again rushed to export ahead of the holiday and only resumed working after it,"" a statement said. The surplus figure stood at $8.9bn in the same period last year. But he Lunar New Year had fallen on 31 January in 2014, followed by a week-long national holiday, which meant it provided a weak comparison with this February. For the first two months of the year, China's trade surplus has totalled $120.7bn, following the $60bn surplus in January. ""We still see strong headwinds facing China's exports this year,"" said ANZ economists Liu Ligang and Zhou Hao in a research note. Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday announced a lowered growth target of ""approximately 7%"" for this year, and cut the trade growth target for 2015 to ""around 6%"".

economic indicators,How to find the perfect ‘work wife’,2024-09-15,2019-08-04,Celina Ribeiro,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190801-how-australians-find-their-work-wives,"Finding a flexible job at the right level after having children is hard, but one company is pioneering a solution. Lija Wilson really struggled with returning to work after maternity leave. After a corporate career working in marketing and digital business for some of Australia’s largest companies, she had her first child in her late 30s, followed by another soon after. “I love my career. I tried a number of different ways of working. I tried working part time, and I just found I was constantly squashing a full-time remit into part-time hours, getting part-time pay, and everything was suffering. I tried consulting for a while, I tried freelancing and that was even more difficult,” she says. Like millions of women returning to work after taking time out to have children, finding employment which reflected her skills and ambition – and allowed her an extra day or two each week to be with her young children – was proving exceptionally difficult. Then she had a chat with an old colleague. Mike Hill had been the CEO of a marketing company, but had sold up. He wanted to spend more time with his young children, of whom he’d seen little in the previous years, and focus on his passion: start-ups. But, Wilson says, he had a “horrific experience” looking for senior-level part-time work as a man. “The stigma was much, much worse than for women,” says Wilson. There they were, two highly skilled professionals with decades of experience between them, unable to get jobs that reflected their skills and respected their need for reduced hours. “We were joking about job share and saying we should put a joint CV together and bandy ourselves about as a pair,” says Wilson. “And it all sprung from there.” Dating for jobseekers In early 2017, with her three- and four-year-olds in tow, Wilson joined with Hill to launch Puffling, an online service matching potential professional job-share partners and employers. Within three weeks of their soft launch, they had nearly 700 women signed up to the platform. Based in Sydney but servicing all Australia and soon New Zealand, the firm works much like an online dating service, using similar algorithms and technology. “Basically, you’re looking for like-minded matches. You want people that have the same aspirations, values, interests, work ethics, similar backgrounds and similar locations,” says Wilson. Job-seekers sign up to join the community, and then employers advertise a position which they are willing to structure as a job share. Alternatively, job-seekers might find a full-time job they want to apply for, and then look for a potential candidate to join forces with to apply as a team. Puffling encourages matches to meet for a coffee before progressing further; like dating, a match can look good on paper but might not work out in real life. Personality clashes, says Wilson, “is the only reason job shares fail”. Job shares can be structured in various ways: a job may be split, with clear division of responsibilities and key performance indicators; a senior candidate may be matched with a more junior one in a vertical share; the work and targets may be entirely shared across the week; or they might seek to make a “unicorn pair” – more common in technology – that pulls together two employees with different scarce, but complementary, skillsets. “I firmly believe any role can be job-shared,” says Wilson. The ‘motherhood pay gap’ Australia has a high proportion of highly educated women, and they have long outnumbered male graduates. At the same time Australia has one of the higher rates of part-time working among women in the OECD, accounting for nearly half of all working women. The OECD has called part-time working and “inactive” women – particularly those with children – one of the greatest untapped sources of potential in the Australian labour market. “From an economic point of view, it’s a huge problem,” says Professor Marian Baird of the University of Sydney’s Women, Work and Leadership Research Group. “It’s quite clear that women in Australia are highly educated and they’re not being able to realise that education in a career sense. “If it’s a choice they’ve made in order to combine their work and care responsibilities, and it’s working for them for that period, it’s not a bad thing. The problem is that it has longer-term consequences. And that’s where women are really being disadvantaged because they’re not given the opportunities later to ramp up their careers. That means they fall behind both in a pay-gap sense, but also in a career sense and in terms of an opportunity gap… It’s called the motherhood pay gap.” Officially the gender pay gap in Australia is 14% (about the OECD average), but that reflects full-time work. After careers often dotted with breaks and part-time work to accommodate child-rearing, Australian women are retiring with a third of the savings of Australian men. And the problem is not limited to Australia; globally women far outnumber men in terms of part-time work, and often face similar career and pay penalties. However, quality part-time work can offer good work-life balance and financial security, and demand for it is high. A 2017 report from the UK’s Office of National Statistics found that nine out of 10 mothers in part-time work did not want to work full time, and three-fifths of mothers seeking work were looking for a part-time role – compared to just a quarter of fathers seeking the same. Dr Heejung Chung, a sociologist at the University of Kent, says that given the vastly disproportionate amount of housework and childcare women do within heterosexual relationships, she says “they take part-time work to manage”. Job-sharing, says Chung, might overcome some of the barriers women and others in part-time work face in terms of being passed over for promotion or not being valued on their productivity. “But it’s not a magic bullet,” she says. “Mechanisms to change perceptions need to be there, too.” Both Baird and Chung say that if the view persists that it’s “just two part-time roles”, opportunities may remain limited. Lija Wilson is confident that the workplace is changing. She has witnessed a shift towards valuing productivity and results over where and when work is done. Her company is working with big brands like Audi and Visa, and there are other organisations both in Australia and globally which do similar work. Puffling itself has placed around 25 senior job-share pairs, with particular interest from companies and roles within the marketing, HR and technology sectors. In one case, an employer came to Puffling seeking a solution for retaining an employee they risked losing without a job share. As for the pairs, she says, once they’ve found their perfect “work wife”, many say they never want to leave the arrangement. The sharers say they feel they learn from their partner and solve problems better in a team. “They leave the office on their days off feeling their career and workload is in safe hands; the anxiety or stress of working part-time and panicking about not being there on your non-working days, or having things that are not managed in your absence or feeling you are always checking in from home is removed, meaning you love going to work and you love going home,” says Wilson.   It has been a long road, Wilson says, but the platform is making money. Yet while businesses appear enthusiastic about job-sharing, she finds take-up slower than that enthusiasm would suggest. In the end, she says, some businesses will revert to a full-time candidate or a four-day-week role, as it feels easier and more familiar. For her and Puffling, much of the work in promoting job sharing has been around “myth busting” and emphasising the benefits that two brains bring to a single position. Getting more men into such roles is critical; at the moment around 92% of the Puffling community is female. And until men take up part-time and flexible work at a similar rate to women, say both Wilson and the researchers, real change will be limited. “Because it’s not a women’s issue and it’s not a mothers’ issue. It’s not something that should be lumped over for women to solve,” Wilson says. “It’s something that’s not only going to help our economy, but provide such a more engaged and productive workforce in the future.”"
economic indicators,Internet from space will transform work,2024-09-15,2019-08-19,Chris Baraniuk,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190816-how-satellites-could-revolutionise-the-internet,"Four billion people lack internet access. Satellite internet could change that. But will the jobs created be good ones? It’s lunchtime in Mumbai. Millions of workers are looking forward to a meal. For some, that means being handed their lunchbox by a dabbawala – a delivery, usually via bicycle, that has been a familiar service in the city for 125 years. Increasingly, though, some customers don’t deal directly with the courier. They do everything via an app. “I live in Mumbai and food delivery is now a big deal,” says Anu Madgavkar, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute. “If you walk into a Starbucks outlet there will be five delivery executives from [food delivery app] Swiggy.” Here’s proof that a digital revolution is taking place: the app for the dabbawalas was developed by a 13-year-old boy. While this new-fangled way of doing things has split local opinion, Madgavkar says there are plenty of fans. While India has long had the building blocks of a gig economy, the internet has now forced businesses to be more organised and offer a more consistent service. Here, though, is the twist. Internet coverage in India is low. Fewer than a quarter of Indians have access to the web or a smartphone. In rural parts of the country, internet penetration may be as low as 14%. It’s a similar story in many emerging economies around the world – from sub-Saharan Africa to Latin America and much of Southeast Asia. More than half the world is still unconnected to the internet. While coverage is rising in the regions mentioned above, installing cables and mobile phone masts to hook up the remaining 4 billion people would be a very slow process. The distances involved are huge. But now a handful of companies are planning something different – the internet, from space. Big plans for connecting over half the world It’s a spectacular-sounding goal: thousands – perhaps even tens of thousands – of tiny satellites in low Earth orbit beaming the internet to anyone, anywhere. OneWeb is the name of one firm planning to do this. It launched its first six satellites in February. The ultimate aim is to broadcast a mobile internet signal that anyone, anywhere, can connect to with a smartphone. Elon Musk’s SpaceX also plans to launch a constellation of internet-beaming satellites, as does Amazon. There may eventually be more than one satellite network competing to offer broadband internet around the world this way. The impact this could have on employment is staggering. “OneWeb are looking to put up around 1,900 satellites. SpaceX are going close to 12,000,” says Christopher Newman, a professor of space law and policy at Northumbria University. Currently, there are about 2,000 commercial satellites in orbit around the Earth, so the increase would be massive. “We’re talking about a genuine disruption to the space environment.” He says the topic needs a “dose of realism” – it’s not yet clear whether these satellite constellations will be cost-effective to run or if they’ll create too much space debris, polluting the orbital environment. But if they do take off, Newman thinks it will change the world of work drastically. How wider internet coverage will affect work Madgavkar says that what’s happening in India is an early indicator of how other economies might change, should internet coverage reach all corners of the planet. She explains that the vast majority of Indian workers are engaged in informal or self-employed work known as “micro enterprises”. Like the lunch runners, this is work that could conceivably be arranged via apps – Uber for anything. There is evidence that the arrival of high-speed internet access, if it spreads widely enough, can enhance productivity and transform local economies.  In India, for instance, farmers and fishers using mobile phones to check prices and weather conditions increased profits by 8%. There may be less predictable effects. One McKinsey report explains that women-owned micro, small and medium enterprises in Indonesia generate 35% of the country’s ecommerce revenue. For offline women-owned businesses of the same sizes, that share drops to just 15%. Madgavkar says greater connectivity means more opportunities for remote workers. Bank employees, for instance, can offer services to customers via phone. People can be trained remotely for service-based or advisory roles and do much of the work from afar too. With satellite internet, the numbers applying for such jobs could boom. Online freelancing platforms like oDesk could also swell. A 2015 research paper discusses how these sites are being used by online workers in Southeast Asia. The paper gives the example of Amy, a Filipina woman with five siblings. The main breadwinner for her family, she switched from working in a call centre to working as a remote personal assistant for an American woman selling art on Etsy. Amy found herself earning double what she made in the call centre job.  Soon, the biggest hurdle to all this won’t be technology but an older bugbear: lack of education. Literacy has improved slightly in India recently; however, a quarter of its population still cannot read or write. Many other countries face the same problem. Internet access – for those who can afford it – can’t solve everything. Avoiding the downsides of internet-powered work As well, there is a darker side to jobs created by the internet. Besides concerns that platforms like Uber and Deliveroo may disadvantage workers, there are also entirely new categories of job that will seem mind-numbingly menial to many. These include “click work” – such as highly repetitive image-tagging to train artificial neural networks in pattern recognition. This sort of thing helps fine tune the algorithms that big tech firms use in their products. Mark Graham, a professor of internet geography at the Oxford Internet Institute, has visited huge offices in Africa where workers sit at desks doing tasks like this for hours on end. The scale of it shocked him. “Hundreds of people all focusing intently on their screens,” he describes it. “And there is fierce competition on these platforms.” There are more click workers than click work, it turns out. As the next 100 million people get connected, and the next, competition will only get fiercer. “It makes it harder for you as an individual worker to command a higher wage,” explains Graham. “Someone on the other side of the planet can do the same job for a much lower rate.” Graham points out that it’s not just menial click work that can be farmed out to emerging economies. Opportunities in web development, programming and design are also coming to regions with improving internet access. This raises the question of whether we all might find ourselves fighting to keep our jobs – once we become part of a truly global and connected workforce. To be fair, outsourcing is not possible for every role – there is a long history of companies failing to relocate operations to countries with lower wages. But if outsourcing does become easier and cheaper thanks to technology, some employees who were never threatened with it before will soon find themselves affected. A global race to the bottom, with terrible payments and working conditions, might ensue.  “I think we all need to be careful about making sure transformation and reorganisations don’t represent a fundamental erosion in the rights that we have as workers and the quality of our jobs,” adds Graham. We’re at least five to ten years away from seeing one of these satellite networks come online, says Alzbeta Fellenbaum, a market analyst at IHS Markit. But in the context of a person’s career, that’s not a very long time. Today, superior internet connectivity can still elevate one country’s workforce above another. But that might not last forever.    "
economic indicators,Who’s in the front row?,2024-09-15,2014-10-21,Harriet Quick,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20140206-whos-in-the-front-row,"It’s the place at a show where everyone wants to sit – and something of an obsession in the world of fashion. Harriet Quick examines the politics of the front row. As fashion week opens in New York, revealing the new collections for Autumn/Winter 2014, another type of show will be played out on the front row. With an ever-increasing number of press, buyers and bloggers jostling for a limited number of seats, the politics of who is invited, who sits where and next to whom have never been more more fraught. Manhattan (then London, Milan and Paris) will soon be echoing with the shrills of “don’t you know who I am?” as egos are flattered and battered by the guardians of the best seats in the house. Behind the scenes, PR people and show producers armed with iPads and lists will be plotting and replotting seating plans, endeavouring to accommodate thousands of invitation requests that will have been flooding in for the past month. A designer’s commercial team will be overseeing the placement of buyers while another team of VIP fixers will be finalising contracts with talent agencies to secure appearances by it-girls, actors and other celebrities. Magazine fashion co-ordinators will be hitting the inbox around the clock to ensure that staff at a title like Vogue get as many seats on the front row as competitor titles like Harper’s Bazaar. And freelancers will be battling it out alone, flagging up their affiliations and social media data to secure their own perch. The front row show, which ends in Paris on 5 March, the day Nicolas Ghesquiere debuts his first collection for Louis Vuitton (the biggest, grandest and most expensive of all productions) is fraught with tension. “Demand stems from fashion’s increased industry exposure via various social media platforms. The industry has become democratised, bloggers validated. Those with talent, an artistic eye [and] a credible voice have been authenticated and have bred a whole generation of wannabes who fill up our inboxes,” says Sara Byworth, associate director of RMO Communications, which looks after press and publicity for designers like Preen and Giles in London and Tibi in New York. “It starts with the first request, sometimes two months before the shows, and ends when the very last person takes their seat at the show – which can be once the show has already started.” Show business The seating format will usually see countries banked in areas that are reserved for either buyers or press. The width and depth of that bank – which might be ten rows deep at large scale shows like Dior, Chanel and Marc Jacobs – is also an indicator of a country’s economic and media clout. Seven years ago, China was sidelined into a slither of space; now, it commands nearly as many seats as the US. In 2014, press from new titles in emerging markets such as Harper’s Bazaar Indonesia and Vogue Mexico will be in the mix.   International fashion weeks are essentially, like a motor show or a hoteliers’ convention, a trade show for professionals, revealing new products and trends for the season ahead. It was in the early ‘90s with the advent of the supermodel and the blockbuster show that the mainstream media realised the entertainment and marketing potential of the catwalk. The front row has since grown in size, expense and theatrics in tandem with the globalisation of luxury fashion. Byworth estimates that even a medium-sized show for a young designer or contemporary brand would cost in the region of £333 ($543) per ""bum on seat."" For powerhouse brands like Louis Vuitton and Chanel, where costs can reach  many millions of dollars for productions including calligraphed invitations, live performances, artistic installations and goodie bags, that ‘bum on seat’ price escalates dramatically. The players on the front row can be as eclectic as the season’s trends. The trend now is to invite a mix that might suggest the depth and multi-faceted nature of your brand. “In recent seasons, there has been less emphasis on celebrity which is no bad thing. It's an expensive task getting a clutch of recognisable faces to sit at your show and I think brands are wisely putting funds elsewhere or simply cutting back,” says Sarah Harris, fashion features director at Vogue UK. “It's become a more interesting mix on the front row – not just magazine editors – but friends of the house, bloggers, European royalty and aristocratic types which keeps it a lot more interesting.” Seats of power Some designers have turned the tables on the fashion show’s traditions, which stretch back to Paul Poiret and his salon shows in Paris at the turn of the 20th Century. Then guest lists were simple: couturiers invited clients, would-be clients and society page reporters to leisurely affairs over tea and cocktails. The provocateur Alexander McQueen once created a catwalk surrounded by walls of mirrored glass for his show entitled Voss in 2001. Guests nervously twitched and whispered when faced with the spectacle of themselves. Other designers have tried to democratise the show by choosing large spaces and two-bench-deep seating arrangements that flank a flat rather than raised runway. Back in the 1990s, Imitation of Christ, a conceptual New York brand, flipped the coin and positioned models in the seats wearing the collection and invited press to walk down the catwalk. There is an ongoing debate about the actual purpose of the shows given the advent of live streaming. Yet industry professionals agree that the networking and intelligence gathering that happens on those congested benches is invaluable – not to mention the chance to see the designs in motion.“Personally, I would not accept anything other than a front row seat,” confides a leading fashion stylist, who asked not to be named. “It does matter and I think I’ve earned it.” For her, the front row is also a valuable showcase for her own highly choreographed outfits that declare herself a leading image-maker. There is also an unwritten front row etiquette.  As regards dress, says Vogue’s Sarah Harris,“Typically the bags get more expensive the closer to the front. The more expensive designer looks are spotted on the first two rows – and they're not always bought, but borrowed for the sole purpose of wearing it to the shows.” Shoes are given a lot of attention, ditto hair styles, and new season ‘trophy’ coats, jackets and dresses.  But the fewer items you carry, the more powerful you can seem. The leggy and beautiful Emmanuelle Alt, editor in chief of Paris Vogue carries little more than a device. No need: the rest is with the driver. Journalists work from iPads and portable keyboards propped on knees while bloggers like Susie Lau will be seen juggling cameras and smartphones. Hunched up in close proximity, you also need to be armed with mints, tittle-tattle to fill in the gaps and an eagle eye on the opposition. But should a venue not be filling up – a designer might have fallen from grace or be hit by traffic delays and bad weather – those behind are invited to shuffle into the prime spots (discreetly). No matter how much has been spent, there is nothing worse for a designer than empty seats. Front row anxieties work every which way.

economic indicators,Scots economy 'needs post-Brexit clarity',2024-09-15,2017-09-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-41319651,"Uncertainty over Brexit continues to loom over Scotland's economic recovery, according to a leading forecaster. The Fraser of Allander Institute (FAI) said indicators suggested the economy was improving following ""an exceptionally weak last two years"".  But it warned that the Brexit negotiations remained the ""greatest cloud on the immediate horizon"". It said the economy faced severe risks if the UK government could not reach a deal with the EU. The report also called for UK ministers to clarify which powers they envisage will be transferred to Holyrood after Brexit. It said this would help enable ""preparatory discussions"" to take place between business and the devolved administrations. The UK government and the devolved administrations are currently locked in a dispute over what should happen to powers in areas such as fishing and farming which are not currently reserved to Westminster, but which are exercised in Brussels. In its latest quarterly economic commentary, the institute said its forecasts for Scottish growth remained broadly the same as its previous report in June. It now predicts growth of 1.2% this year, 1.4% next year and 1.7% in 2019.  But it warned: ""On balance, our forecasts are based upon the assumption that a constructive deal between the UK and the EU is reached.  ""Should this not occur, outcomes toward the lower end of our forecast range are more likely."" The report argued that the immediate concern facing many businesses was the potential for the exit process ""to go awry"".  It said: ""We are now 15 months on from the referendum with a deal likely to be needed in just over a year's time.  ""But very little progress - if any - seems to have been made on the key elements of the UK's terms of exit. ""'No deal' would clearly not be in the interests of either the UK or the EU. The potential risks from such a 'cliff-edge' scenario, with companies finding themselves outside the single market and customs union, would be severe indeed."" The report added: ""Whilst a detailed agreement will not be reached until the end of the process, the longer we wait for evidence that serious progress is being made, the greater the likelihood that companies and investors will start to plan for the worst."" Meanwhile, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has called for measures to ""cushion"" the impact of Brexit on Scottish firms, It follows an FSB survey that showed a sharp fall in business confidence across the UK in the last quarter, amid rising costs. FSB Scottish policy convener Andy Willox said: ""It is critical that agreement with the EU27 is now reached on issues such as the length and nature of a transitional deal. ""We would argue that a three-year interim period would be sensible, alongside a comprehensive free trade agreement. Further, EU citizens working in or running businesses in Scotland must have the right to remain in the country."" SNP MSP Mairi Gougeon, who sits on Holyrood's Europe Committee, said the Fraser of Allander and FSB reports underlined ""just how damaging the Tories' Brexit plans were to Scotland's economy"". She added: ""With both the FSB and Fraser of Allander Institute telling us that businesses are losing confidence and being harmed by rising prices and a weak pound, and with Brexit uncertainty continuing to loom over our economy, it is clear that the Tories must take action now to change course and end their obsession with a hard Brexit. ""There is nothing at all to be gained from tearing us out of the single market and customs union, but everything to lose. ""The Tories must wake up to the reality of their disastrous Brexit policies."" A UK government spokesman said: ""Scotland's economy is improving but still lags behind the UK as a whole. We want the Scottish government to make full use of their powers to support the economy. ""We are also determined to make the most of opportunities presented by Brexit, trading with new partners and reaching new markets, and we will negotiate as one UK to reach the best possible deal as we forge a new partnership with the EU.""

economic indicators,Sharp decline in new construction sector orders,2024-09-15,2023-10-09,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67021016,"Northern Ireland's private sector downturn continued in September, according to an Ulster Bank survey. Every month, the bank asks firms about staffing levels, exports and new orders in what is a reliable indicator of economic performance. All four economic sectors - services, retail, manufacturing and construction - reported a fall in activity. The construction sector recorded the sharpest decline as new orders fell for a fourth month in a row. Despite this, employment is a bright spot which continued to grow with Northern Ireland firms increasing their staffing levels at the fastest pace in the UK. Ulster Bank chief economist Richard Ramsey said: ""On a positive note, the one silver lining with the weakening demand cloud is that supply chain delivery times eased for the sixth month running."" He said firms also cited facing higher fuel and wage costs but despite this, most were optimistic of a pick-up in demand over the next 12 months. ""While we may be anticipating an Indian Summer in the coming weeks weather-wise, a similar improvement in business conditions during October doesn't look likely. ""Similarly, on the political front, there is no immediate sign of a return of the Stormont Executive."""
economic indicators,Iran 'has increased enriched uranium production',2024-09-15,2019-06-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48587347,"The head of the global nuclear watchdog has confirmed Iran is increasing its production of enriched uranium. But International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Yukiya Amano said it was not clear when they will reach a limit set under a 2015 international deal. Iran announced last month that it would suspend some commitments in retaliation for sanctions reinstated by the US. Mr Amano also said he was worried about the current tensions over the Iranian nuclear issue and called for dialogue. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif later said reducing tensions was only possible by stopping what he called the ""economic war by America"". ""Those who wage such wars cannot expect to remain safe,"" he told a news conference during a visit to Tehran by his German counterpart, Heiko Maas. Mr Maas warned that the situation in the region was ""highly explosive and extremely serious"" and could lead to a military escalation between the US and Iran. US President Donald Trump abandoned the nuclear deal last year and reinstated sanctions that had been lifted in return for Iran limiting its nuclear activities. Then last month, he ended exemptions from US secondary sanctions for countries that continued buying oil from Iran. This decision was intended to bring Iranian oil exports to zero, denying their government its main source of revenue. Days later, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said his country was rolling back some restrictions under the deal. This included no longer complying with caps on its stockpiles of enriched uranium and heavy water - set at 300kg and 130 tonnes respectively - and halting sales of surplus supplies overseas. Enriched uranium is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons, while spent fuel from a heavy-water reactor contains plutonium that would be suitable for a bomb. Mr Rouhani also gave the other five states still party to the nuclear deal - Germany, the UK, France, China and Russia - until 7 July to protect Iranian oil sales from US sanctions. Otherwise Iran will suspend its restrictions on the purity of enriched uranium. At the same time, the White House sent an aircraft carrier strike group, B-52 bombers, and a Patriot missile defence battery to the Gulf because of ""troubling and escalatory indications"" related to Iran. Iran was subsequently accused by the US of being behind attacks on four oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates; two oil pumping stations in Saudi Arabia; and the Green Zone in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, where many foreign embassies are located. Iran denied the allegations. Then, on 20 May, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran announced that it would quadruple its production of low-enriched uranium and had informed the IAEA, which is tasked with monitoring Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal. On Monday, the nuclear watchdog's chief confirmed that Iran had increased its production rate. But Mr Amano declined to specify by how much and said it was not clear when the stockpile limit would be exceeded. He told the IAEA's Board of Governors it was essential that Iran fully implemented its commitments under the nuclear deal. ""As I have constantly emphasised, the nuclear-related commitments entered into by Iran under the [deal] represent a significant gain for nuclear verification,"" he said. ""I therefore hope that ways can be found to reduce current tensions through dialogue."" Germany's Foreign Minister stressed that European powers wanted to fulfil their obligations under the deal and were attempting to provide Iran with alternative ways to trade.  ""We cannot work miracles, but we will try to avert a failure,"" Mr Maas said. The Europeans have set up a ""special purpose vehicle"" that would essentially allow goods to be bartered between Iranian and foreign companies without direct financial transactions. But the mechanism - known as Instex - is not yet operational."
economic indicators,Dow sheds more than 4% twice in week,2024-09-15,2018-02-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42991310,"Wall Street shares slid sharply again on Thursday, compounding losses on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 which started last week.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,000 points for the second time this week, plunging 4.15% to 23,860. The S&P 500 dropped 100.6 points or 3.75% to 2,581, while the Nasdaq slid 274.8 points or 3.9% to 6,777.1. The moves follow a day of losses on all key European exchanges. The 100 share index in London closed down 1.49% at 7,170.69 points. Germany and France fell 2.6% and 2% respectively. The dive extends a sell-off that started last week, as investors started to worry that inflation might rise more quickly than expected, leading policymakers to raise interest rates. On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for that view. The bank left interest rates where they were at 0.5% at its meeting, but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting. Also worrying markets was a government budget proposal US lawmakers in Congress have announced, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation.  Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates. Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity. The uptick in volatility comes as investors react to the shifting conditions. Thursday's declines mean the Dow and S&P 500 have now fallen by more than 10% from the record highs set in January, a threshold analysts call a correction. Shares in financial, technology and consumer companies led the declines on Thursday, which infected every sector. American Express and Intel were the two biggest losers on the Dow. Analysts, who have said for months that the financial markets were due a correction after a long period of rising prices, urged calm. ""The latest decline takes us back to where we were 17 November,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, which tracks interest rates. ""We've just given back some recent gains, not wiped out anyone's life savings.""  But the declines have led to questions for President Donald Trump, who had repeatedly boasted of the market's rapid rise in value last year. The White House said on Thursday markets were reacting to data that is good news for the broader economy, including low unemployment and signs of wage growth. ""The president like the rest of the White House is concerned about long term economic indicators and factors,"" a White House spokesman said. ""The fundamentals in terms of the long term are very strong."""
economic indicators,The truth about Icelandic happiness,2024-09-15,2016-05-11,Eric Weiner,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20160509-the-truth-about-icelandic-happiness,"Icelandic culture, shaped over centuries of hardship and shared suffering, reminds us of the importance – and the power – of resilience. Several years back, I visited Iceland in the dead of winter. I was researching a book on global happiness, and the small Nordic nation intrigued me. What was this country, adrift in the freezing North Atlantic, doing perched atop the world’s happiness rankings? In pursuit of answers, I buttonholed anyone willing to talk, dined on harkl (rotten shark), drank excessively, and, of course, took a dip in the Blue Lagoon, the otherworldly geothermal waters that have become synonymous with Icelandic bliss. Shortly after I left, Iceland’s largest banks went belly up and the nation’s economy teetered on the verge of collapse, collateral damage from the global financial meltdown of 2008. The unemployment rate spiked eightfold. Trust in institutions, like the banks and parliament, plummeted. I assumed that the nation’s happiness also nosedived. I was wrong. “The economic crisis had a limited effect on happiness,” according to health scientist Dora Gudmundsdottir, author of an exhaustive study published in the Social Indicators Researchjournal. Not only did the nation’s overall happiness dip only slightly during the crisis, but 25% of Icelanders reported greater happiness. What was going on? I emailed Karl Blöndal, a newspaper editor I had met in Reykjavik. “A lot of individuals have been hit hard, pensioners lost their savings. But one thing about living in a small community is that everyone you know is within reach,” he explained. “Those who lose their jobs are not isolated, the risk of estrangement is not the same as it would be in bigger societies.” Here was an essential truth about Icelandic happiness: it is largely a collective enterprise. Iceland, even with its cosmopolitan capital of Reykjavik, resembles a small town in many ways. People needn’t worry about falling into a black hole, Icelanders say, because there is no black hole to fall into you. There’s always someone to catch you. As one American immigrant to Iceland told me, if your car is stuck in the snow, someone will always, always stop.  In fact, trust levels are so high that it’s not unusual to see six-year-olds walking to school alone in the winter darkness. In a typically optimistic Icelandic statement, Blöndal even managed to see the opportunity embedded in the financial crisis. “Now we can wipe the slate clean. Who knows – this might just as well be an opportunity to forge a better, more open society where power is more diffused and the old vested interests and economic blocks have been cleared out of the way.” This idea of an open, fair society seems to be key. According to a recent United Nations report on world happiness, happiness is evenly distributed in Iceland. That is, most Icelanders are more or less equally happy, while in other nations – particularly those in the Middle East and Latin America – happiness levels vary tremendously. This is important because “new research suggests that people are significantly happier living in societies where there is less inequality of happiness.” In other words, we can achieve only so much happiness if our neighbours are miserable. Icelanders seem to intuitively recognise this essential truth. Icelanders have also developed a fierce resilience honed over centuries of deprivation and isolation. Think winter darkness, volcanic eruptions and unforgiving terrain so otherworldly that NASA dispatched the Apollo astronauts here in 1965 to train for their upcoming moon walks. You see this sort of stubborn optimism at work every day in Iceland. You see it in the way people swim outdoors, year round, or how there is no stigma attached to abandoning a bad job or relationship. This resilience can also be found in the country’s rich literary culture, one that dates back to the old sagas – Viking tales of heroism in the face of adversity. Today, Iceland publishes more books per capita than any country in the world. Some psychologists believe that literature – and other cultural resources – provides a buffer during difficult times. Stories provide a vehicle for expressing grief, and grief expressed is grief reduced. They also provide a means for a culture to channel its creative energies. And Icelanders certainly recognise the value of the written word, an attitude reflected in a common Icelandic saying: “Better to go barefoot than without books.” A happy thought, if ever there were one.

economic indicators,Why Gen Z are so pay motivated,2024-09-15,2023-05-31,Megan Carnegie,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230530-why-gen-z-are-so-motivated-by-pay,"Young workers want to be compensated well from the get-go. Their quest to make higher salaries isn't simply a money grab. The oldest Gen Zers have had money on the brain since they first entered the workplace –and many have been dissatisfied with their pay packets. Data shows that as Gen Z enter and rise through the workforce, they’re highly pay motivated – and perhaps more than any other generation right now. The laser-focus on pay is not wholly new – 2016 data from jobs site Monster showed 70% of American Gen Zers named salary as their top work motivator, along with health insurance – but several years on, experts say the economic squeeze has made these young workers even more wage-conscious. In the past year, surveys show their salary expectations have skyrocketed: many are targeting six-figure salaries early in their careers.  This is in no small part due to the fact that Gen Z have found themselves in a unique position among generations. They’ve grown up watching their parents, largely Gen Xers, struggle with money amid economic downturns; now, they’ve graduated into their own economic turbulence, and are worried about securing their futures. As a result, they’re demanding more remuneration from their employers than ever, and at earlier stages in their career – and experts say many young workers are willing to walk for better-paying opportunities. To some people, Gen Z may seem salary ‘obsessed’. In some cases, say experts, it may be hard for older generations to understand why young workers have such an intense focus on pay. “At Gen Z’s age, older people worked 40 hours a week, and made enough money to buy a house and have barbecues on the weekend,” says Corey Seemiller, an educator, researcher and TEDx speaker on Gen Z. “Gen Z works 50 hours a week at their jobs, and another 20 hours a week side hustling, yet still make barely enough to cover rent.” But there’s more to the story than just the human desire to make as much as possible. And what’s more: their quest for higher salaries could benefit everyone. Downturns and turbulence Most of Gen Z, generally defined as born between 1997 and 2012, grew up against a backdrop of multiple global recessions and economic downturns. For some, instability is all they’ve known. “They were raised around their parents’ conversations about not having enough money and the bad things that happened because of that – homes were re-possessed, and savings decimated,” says Seemiller. Although money stress may have been abstract to many of them, observed largely through their parents’ experiences, the economic instability of the past few years has hit them personally – and head on – as they’ve entered the workplace.  Many of these young workers graduated into the workforce or were in their very first roles during the Covid-19 pandemic. Along with being professionally stunted and unable to climb the salary ladder, they also became susceptible to layoffs – according to some data, more than other generations. “Such experiences have shaped their values, and that fear of not having enough runs deep,” says Seemiller. They are also on entry-level salaries in extremely tough economic times, which has compounded their financial worries – and made them a feature of daily life. Spiking inflation has raised the cost of living; and as education costs have bloated, many young people are also carrying student loans. Bank of America data from 2022 shows a significant portion of Gen Z has reported the inability to save and pay down debt in the current climate. In short, they’re extremely worried about their finances, and often more than other generations. A Cigna survey of 12,000 global workers showed 39% of Gen Zers cite financial insecurity as their leading stressor, compared to 34% of millennials and 29% of 50-to-64-year-olds. Younger workers are particularly worried about the rising cost of living and how it will impact their futures.  “Both from the data and anecdotally, Gen Z workers clearly want to be fairly compensated and recognised for the value they bring to the workplace, but also seek stability,” says Sam Chen, the Gen Z founder and CEO of US-based job-matching site Fetti. Indeed, a 2022 survey from early-career jobs community Handshake shows 74% of 1,400 2023 US graduates surveyed said they prioritise stability and salary from employers, outweighing factors including a known employer brand (41%), a fast-growing field (39%) or overall benefits (66%). Essentially, says Seemiller, Gen Z are seeking high pay packets to ensure that security. “They want to be able to live off their salaries and not worry about paying their bills,” she says. “My studies have shown that being happy and fulfilled, and making enough to live comfortably top the most important features in Gen Z’s ideal careers – not being rich and travelling the world.” So, it’s not necessarily that Gen Z are greedy or money-grabbing; the majority, say experts, just want to cover their costs. Workers in locations with higher cost of living – mostly major cities – are particularly angling for higher pay; for example, by some estimates, the average entry-level salary for US workers in late 2022 was $55,260 (£44,627), yet a single adult living in San Francisco would need to be earning over $74,280 (£59,978) – after tax – to cover their costs. While, of course, all generations are experiencing the cost-of-living strains, Gen Z aren’t as far ahead in life stages, and are therefore less secure. Millennials, for example, have been in the workforce longer, and made more money cumulatively, with some able to buy homes before prices surged and Covid-19-inflation hit. “Gen Zers simply won’t be able to have a comparable life, in terms of financial stability, compared to older generations when they were entering the workforce,” says Seemiller. “Other generations, apart from perhaps millennials who entered the workforce during the recession, didn’t face these circumstances when they were young adults.” The right conditions for pay rises? Will Gen Z get the higher pay they want, then? In some cases, signs are positive. Current job-market conditions are setting up a good situation for young workers. Although hiring has cooled since its pandemic high, the jobseekers’ market is still “red-hot”  in many countries, which means workers still have the power to make demands on potential and current employers. Experts say this means that Gen Z are more confident in demanding a higher pay packet; emboldened by the intense competition for talent, some studies show that they’re feeling positive about getting their needs met. The Handshake data shows that more than 80% of survey respondents believe they can find a job that pays well – and fulfils them personally, to boot. There is a caveat, however. Data from recruitment-industry platform Sonovate, which surveyed 500 UK small- and medium-sized business owners that have increased salaries to get and keep talent, shows 54%doubt they will be able to keep up this pace of wage rises for long. Simply, even the most hopeful of young people may find themselves disappointed with their employer’s offer down the line. Many Gen Z employees may instead have to move companies if they want higher pay. And some Gen Zers are also taking the drive to make more into their own hands, especially if they’re not going to get what they need directly from their employers. In the face of pay that fails to keep up with inflation, they’re seeking new sources of income at a higher rate than older generations, with Gen Z most likely to take on a second role (30%) and increase their hours (32%) – significantly higher than Boomers, at 17% and 13%, respectively, according to Randstad’s 2023 Workmonitor Report. A rising tide Seemiller says older generations may stand to benefit from this salary motivation. Yes, Gen Z are trying to shore up their financial futures, but Seemiller also believes their salary quest is largely linked to their fine-tuned radars for fairness and equity.  “They’re a generation who call things out, speaking up when they feel the work they’re doing isn’t fairly paid,” she says. “By doing this, they’re drawing attention to the issues and getting other generations to feel empowered to ask for a fairer share, greater flexibility or more suitable hours.” Many companies are already feeling these changes. The April 2023 Beamery data shows 91% of 700 UK business leaders surveyed believe the needs and expectations vocalised by younger employees could have a positive impact onallgenerations. Ultimately, even as some older workers grumble about Gen Z’s hefty pay demands, salaries are becoming more important to all generations. Gallup has been tracking American jobseekers’ priorities since 2015, and salary has climbed from the fourth highest priority (with 41% claiming it very important) to the number one priority (64%). As for whether salary will continue to be a priority for Gen Z, Seemiller finds it hard to imagine them reneging or staying static once they reach a certain pay grade. “Our indicators point to a generation that cares about happiness, meaningfulness and fulfilment over a high salary just for the sake of it,” she says. “Either way, they’re hyper focused on equity and will continue to be the first to speak up if they’re not getting what they think should be.” "
economic indicators,Why we can't shake presenteeism,2024-09-15,2023-07-24,Josie Cox,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230718-post-pandemic-presenteeism-overwork-culture,"The pandemic changed nearly everything about work. Why are we still stuck with performative long hours? For many workers, Covid-19 altered our attitudes towards our jobs and how we do them. The conditions of the past three years catalysed a full re-evaluation of careers and values, and subsequently dislodged some staid traditions that have bogged down workplace progress. In the new world of work, many employees have received what they’ve wanted from their employers – new ways of getting things done including flexible hours, remote working and even shortened workweeks. Despite this, however, one entrenched feature of business culture that’s proved tough – and in some cases impossible – to shift, is presenteeism. Before the pandemic, presenteeism – a compulsion, often performative, to work long hours and be available around the clock even when unwell or unproductive – was a common part of the culture of many organisations. This has been particularly the case across industries including finance, consulting and tech, where bosses have historically expected to see long hours from their workers, even when it’s not quantifiably tied to output. Despite so many workplace-culture changes, evidence suggests that not only is presenteeism still entrenched – but it may also be getting worse. This might especially be the case as employee-employer trust waivers, and digital presenteeism rises alongside the fear of job security amid an uncertain economic climate.  Can it change? Evolving expectations In 2020, as Covid-19 forced companies to shut down offices, employees were given the chance to experience new ways of working.   Flexible and remote work was arguably the biggest change: many employees realised they could fulfil their professional responsibilities from home and remain just as productive. The opportunity to spend more time with family or to engage in leisure activities also created a desire for lasting change in job demands and working schedules. Indeed, many employers have risen to the occasion, making some dramatic changes. One 2022 McKinsey & Company survey of 25,000 US workers showed 58% of respondents report having the opportunity to work from home at least one day a week, while 35% of respondents said they had the option to work from home five days a week. A 2023 survey from the Pew Research Center showed about a third of workers with jobs that can be done remotely are working from home all the time, compared to just 7% who did so before the pandemic. Despite these changes, little has seemed to meaningfully chip away at a pervasive culture of presenteeism that still plagues much of the workforce. Indeed, in some cases, new ways of working may even exacerbate it. First, the dissolution of personal and professional boundaries during home working may have played a significant role. “Without a clear physical separation between work and home, individuals may find it challenging to disconnect and set clear boundaries,” says Peter Brown, who leads PwC’s Global People and Organisation practice. “This lack of separation can lead – and in many cases did lead – to longer working hours, increased workloads and difficulty taking breaks or time off, all contributing to presenteeism.”  Lucy Kallin, executive director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Catalyst, a workplace consultancy that focuses on gender equality, agrees. “The overnight switch to home-working in the pandemic undoubtedly increased some people’s workloads, as they were unable to switch off metaphorically and literally. Instead of using the commute home to wind down from work people stayed ‘always on’.” She adds a rise in trust issues between employees and employers hasn’t helped shake workers’ compulsion to be present for their managers, even if they are unwell or not on work hours. Amid the shift to remote work, some managers haven’t entirely trusted their workers to remain productive – but the issue cuts both ways. Gallup research published in April 2023 shows during the pandemic and in its aftermath, employee trust in organisational leadership faltered for reasons including poor communication around Covid-19, and a lack of direction in terms of the company’s plans and strategies for the future. Gallup data shows that in the US, only 21% of employees said that they strongly agree that they trust their company’s leaders. “Lack of trust is intrinsically linked to presenteeism,” explains Kallin. Simply, employees may have felt compelled to be always on, because they can’t rely on being valued for their contributions and achievements if they’re not always on. Brown adds as businesses scrambled to stay solvent amid Covid-19, employees may also have felt additional pressure to be excessively present. “During the pandemic, many organisations were focused on adapting quickly to remote work and ensuring business continuity. The immediate priority was to keep operations running smoothly, which may have inadvertently reinforced presenteeism,” he says. “Employees may have felt compelled to work longer hours or be constantly available to prove their dedication and productivity, even in a remote setting.” Only getting worse? As many employees continue to work at least partially remotely, the rise of digital presenteeism is also a factor in keeping the behaviour entrenched – and an increasing concern. In the UK, 2022 data from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) showed that while presenteeism among employees had fallen slightly throughout the past few years, some 65% of HR workers said that they were still observing it in their organisations. And the number of respondents who said they were seeing it among those working from home rose from 77% in 2021 to 81% in 2022. The CIPD also found ‘leavism’ – the practice of using allocated time off, such as annual leave, to work – to be prevalent.  Results from a 2021 academic research paper also point to more reasons why Covid-19 might’ve exacerbated digital presenteeism. One reason, posit the researchers, is workers’ increasing digital footprints. As formerly in-person work went digital, workers may have felt more aware that bosses could track how many hours they were putting in, and how much work they were producing via their online communication. “When employees recognize that their online activities generate digital footprints that can be followed by their employers, they may perceive their inputs and activities as extremely visible and under scrutiny, and therefore put in greater effort, which has been found to result in greater burnout,” wrote the researchers. “By intensifying the employees’ efforts at work, monitoring can promote a culture of being constantly available and generate feelings of attendance pressure, likely leading to working when sick.” Lead by example Cultures of presenteeism may have survived the pandemic, but that’s not to say that they’ll be here forever. To dislodge them, though, the impetus is largely on employers to understand why the behaviour is so entrenched, and subsequently remedy it in their cultures.  This may take managers really mining the root of the problem in their companies, says Catalyst’s Kallin. For instance, she says, senior leaders need to stop celebrating people for being “always on”, or praising people for working overtime. And crucially, firms also need to recognise the ways in which the pandemic-induced changes in the workplace – a shift to hybrid and remote working, for example – might have exacerbated presenteeism. Even though leaders can’t see the behaviour because it’s happening remotely, she says, they need to spearhead changes so employees feel willing and able to turn off from work. Brown adds that defining working hours and sticking to them can help employees disconnect and rebuild their work-life boundaries. Fundamentally, says Brown, for managers to dismantle a culture of presenteeism, they must make sure employees feel trusted and empowered. For now, employees may unfortunately be stuck with presenteeism in the workplace, as employers still need to recognise the issue and buy into the solution. Still, much continues to change in the workplace, so workers can stay optimistic that even this boulder may eventually move."
economic indicators,Retail sales hit lowest level since 2021 lockdowns,2024-09-15,2023-11-17,By Dearbail Jordan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67447597,"Shoppers bought less fuel and food in October as they were hit by rising living costs and poor weather, according to official figures. The volume of products sold last month fell by 0.3% to the lowest level since February 2021 when large parts of the UK were in Covid lockdowns. Retail sales had widely been forecast to grow in October. The worse-than-expected data emerged as recent figures showed the UK economy was failing to grow.  Gross domestic product - the amount of the goods and services produced by the UK - flatlined between July and September and the Bank of England expects only subdued growth until 2025. Next week, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will make his Autumn Statement when he will set out the government's tax and spending plans and his strategy to grow the economy.        Commenting on the latest data, the Office for National Statistics said petrol and diesel sales may have been ""affected by increasing fuel prices"". Demand for other goods was also lower, said the ONS. ""It was another poor month for household goods and clothes stores with these retailers reporting that cost of living pressures, reduced footfall and poor weather hit them hard,"" said Heather Bovill, deputy director for survey and economic indicators at the ONS.  During October, Storm Babet hit much of the UK resulting in ""exceptional rainfall"", according to the Met Office.  Fuel sales fell by 2% between September and Octobers with retailers reporting that ""consumers were spending their money more cautiously, alongside the impact of bad weather"". Supermarkets said shoppers were buying more food, but specialist stores, such as butchers and bakers, recorded a decline. Sales of alcohol and tobacco also dropped, down 4.2% and 10.4%, respectively.  Retailers said shoppers ""were buying cheaper products and prioritising important items"". The retail sector is heading into its most important trading period which includes Christmas.   Lisa Hooker, leader of industry for consumer markets at PwC, said: ""We know from earlier in the year that in tough times consumers prioritise special events and family occasions, so retailers will be hoping that consumers are keeping their powder dry for a last minute Christmas spending surge come December."" Compared to last October, retail sales volumes were 2.7% lower.  The ONS also revised down its reading of retail sales in September to a drop of 1.1% after initially estimating a decline of 0.9%. Recent figures showed that inflation - which measures the rate at which prices are rising - fell sharply to 4.6% in the year to October from 6.7%.It follows a long succession of interest rate rises by the Bank of England. While raising rates can reduce inflation, it also affects economic growth by making it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow money.  Aled Patchett, head of retail and consumer goods at Lloyds Bank, said: ""Another dip in sales suggests rising household costs remain at the forefront of consumers' minds, despite headline inflation easing in recent months. ""The rising cost of living remains a drag on consumers' discretionary incomes. Households continue to prioritise essential spending, particularly as falling winter temperatures push energy use up."""
economic indicators,An implausible UK tourist attraction,2024-09-15,2023-01-18,Shafik Meghji,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20230117-canvey-wick-the-uks-implausible-tourist-attraction,"Located just 30 miles east of London, an abandoned oil refinery on the edge of the Thames Estuary has become an unlikely wildlife haven. The 6km journey from Benfleet railway station took me across a creek and along a busy main road into the town of Canvey Island, an expanse of low-lying, reclaimed land separated from the rest of Essex by a network of waterways and protected from tidal flooding by a serpentine seawall. The fields soon disappeared from view, replaced by a semi-industrial sprawl dotted with retail parks, warehouses, factories and huge fuel storage tanks.   A few vehicles turned off at the local golf course, the rest pulled into a large supermarket. Other than a learner driver practising an emergency stop on a quiet stretch, no one else continued onto Northwick Road, where an empty car park with a blink-and-you-miss-it sign and a metal sculpture of an insect were the only indicators I'd reached a biological hotspot.   Spanning some 93ha of meadows, grassland and scrub on the shores of Holehaven Creek, Canvey Wick has ""as many species per square metre... as there are in a rainforest,"" according to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which manages the site in partnership with conservation charity Buglife on behalf of the Land Trust, which looks after public open spaces for the benefit of local communities. It's also one of the most significant areas in the UK for invertebrates – a category that includes insects, arachnids and molluscs, among others – with more than 1,500 species, 30 of which are on the UK's endangered ""red list"". They include the evocatively named shrill carder bee, the five-banded weevil wasp and the scarce emerald damselfly.   As I followed a trail into the 18.5ha Canvey Wick Nature Reserve, the drone of traffic was slowly replaced by rustling leaves and the sound of birdsong. Apart from the occasional dog walker, there was no one else around, and while many of the wildflowers had largely disappeared for the year along with the insects that depend on them, autumn gave the area a stark, eerie beauty. Although I was just 30 miles from central London, it felt like a wilderness.   ""Canvey Wick is a hugely important place,"" said Jamie Robbins, Buglife's programmes manager. ""It's more than just invertebrates. We've got loads of rare flowering plants like orchids. There are birds like nightingales and whitethroats, and it's a real hotspot for reptiles such as common lizards, slow worms and adders.""   The origins of Canvey Wick's abundance of wildlife lie, unexpectedly, in the geopolitical turmoil of the Middle East of the 1970s. Originally a grazing marsh, the site sits on the south-west edge of Canvey Island, which was sparsely populated by sheep farmers, salt harvesters, fishers and shellfish cultivators for some 2,000 years. At the turn of the 20th Century, the island was home to just a few hundred people, but over the following decades the population surged as it became a fashionable seaside resort – until low-cost package holidays in Europe brought the good times to an end – as well as a centre for the petrochemical industry. Canvey Wick, though, remained untouched until 1970, when Occidental Petroleum controversially secured permission to build a six-million-tonne oil refinery, storage depot and deep-water jetty on the site. The US firm ploughed £55m into Canvey Wick, covering it with a 2-3m layer of silt, sand, gravel and shell fragments dredged from the River Thames to help prepare for the development.   Yet work ground to a halt just a few years later thanks to the first ""energy crisis"" – when Middle Eastern countries slashed oil production in response to US support for Israel during the Yom Kippur War, triggering a global economic crisis – which made the project unviable. Canvey Wick was, essentially, abandoned to nature.   In the mid-1990s, many of the refinery's larger structures were eventually demolished, but plans to build housing, a business park and retail developments on the site came to nothing, thanks to campaigns by the local community. This inaction provided the space for a remarkable transformation. The dredged material was partially contaminated and created free-draining conditions, said Robbins, keeping the site largely open and stopping trees and dominant vegetation from establishing. ""You end up having this lovely mosaic of bare ground and flowery stuff, which invertebrates love. Canvey Wick has the kind of habitats that have been lost in the wider landscape as Essex has become more agricultural, industrial and full of housing estates. It's the last refuge for a lot of rare species."" Canvey Wick was named a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 2005, with Dr Chris Gibson, an officer for government advisory body Natural England, memorably describing it as a ""brownfield rainforest"" (a brownfield site is land that was previously used for industrial purposes). The designation protected the site – which was subsequently taken on by the Land Trust – from future developments. After a period of habitat restoration work, the nature reserve opened to the public in 2014. Since then, engaging the local community has been a vital part of the project. According to Marc Outten, the RSPB's site manager for Canvey Wick: ""It's about making it accessible. Canvey Wick lends itself to journeys of discovery and exploration.""   Jo Loman, Buglife's community warden for Canvey Wick, plays a key role in this process, organising a wide range of activities, including school holiday events, conservation programmes for young people and guided walks. She also works with the National Health Service on ""social prescribing"", an approach that see doctors refer patients to non-clinical services to support their health and wellbeing. ""My job is to get the whole [community] to understand that Canvey Wick is there, that it's a unique place and that they should be really proud to have it on their doorstep,"" she said. ""I'm a big believer in education by stealth – doing fun activities, but people learn stuff while they're there.""   Visitors from further afield are also finding their way to Canvey Wick, thanks to the July 2022 launch of a new 85-mile stretch of the England Coast Path, which passes by the site. ""People have certain perceptions of what Essex is about, but I think opening up this path will really help to raise awareness of what the county has to offer,"" said Lisa Bone, tourism and place marketing manager at Visit Essex. ""[Canvey Wick] is a very special place in a very unusual setting. It's a great asset for an area that needs a tourism boost."" Stumbling across the remnants of the refinery today feels like discovering the ruins of a lost city. I walked along roads that led nowhere, greenery lapping at their edges like an incoming tide. There were rows of decapitated streetlights, and the last of the summer wildflowers burst out of giant concrete cylinders at erratic angles. Meanwhile, the rusting niches of the biggest surviving structure, the deep-water jetty that marches out into the creek, provided nesting spots for birds.   It was a vivid illustration of the dramatic change that can take place in semi-urban, post-industrial sites in a relatively short period of time, as well as the vital role these under-appreciated areas can play in tackling the biodiversity and climate crises. This value isn't always recognised: Buglife is currently campaigning against a plan to build a theme park on Swanscombe Peninsula, a similar post-industrial urban wilderness on the Kent side of the Thames Estuary. ""Open, flower-rich grasslands are really important for biodiversity,"" said Robbins. ""When we think about [storing] carbon, a lot of people's brains go straight to trees, but well-managed grasslands and wildflower [landscapes] can store, in some scenarios, even more carbon than trees. Brownfield sites like Canvey Wick often get a bad name but they have a huge amount to contribute."" The climate emergency felt close at hand on Canvey Island. After exploring the nature reserve, I followed the towering seawall south to the Lobster Smack, a 17th-Century pub that features in Charles Dickens' Great Expectations and was once renowned for smuggling and bare-knuckle boxing. Running along the south coast, the concrete barrier is a reminder that Canvey Island has always been threatened by the sea: 58 people were killed in a devastating flood in 1953. The current defences may look formidable but will not protect the island as sea levels continue to rise due to climate change. A government project is set to renew and improve the seawall so that it remains effective until 2070.   The vulnerability of the island underscores the importance of sites such as Canvey Wick. ""Here we want to create an appreciation of the links between nature and our ability to survive on the planet and between biodiversity loss and climate change,"" said Outten. ""[The trick is to] get people interested in nature first – once they're interested, they'll want to protect it."" ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us onFacebook, or follow us onTwitter andInstagram.

economic indicators,A treaty that changed how we travel,2024-09-15,2018-12-03,Kirsten Henton,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20181202-schengen-a-tiny-village-that-changed-european-travel,"The now-renowned Schengen Agreement was signed in a tiny village in Luxembourg’s south-east, a location that was drenched in symbolism. Blink, and you could pass through Europe’s smaller nations without realising. Take Luxembourg, which can be crossed by car in just over an hour at its widest point. Before you know it, you’ve popped out into the surrounding countries of France, Germany or Belgium, with only the eagle-eyed spying the border sign and the striped flags of the Grand Duchy far behind. The ability to do this is partly down to its petite size, but also thanks to a Luxembourgian legacy: a treaty signed more than 30 years ago in the tiny village of Schengen in the country’s far south-east. The now-renowned Schengen Agreement dramatically changed the way we travel within Europe, and continues to evolve today. Not-so-little Luxembourg On the surface of things, Luxembourg could be viewed as a starchy centre of commerce, where European bigwigs busy themselves and money is made. It also appears to take up very little space on the map and, as a result, is often unwittingly overlooked as a destination in favour of its more sizeable neighbours.

There’s a flourishing domestic wine industry, an impressive restaurant scene, countless museums and memorials (from the Unesco-listed fortress and old city centre to the grave of General George S Patton Jr), and a seemingly inherent love of seafood, cheese and all things pastry. In 1985, Luxembourg was also instrumental in the creation of a landmark legislation: the signing of the Schengen Treaty, a unilateral agreement ensuring border-free travel within European member countries. On the trail of this historic spot, I travelled down the Moselle Valley, a quiet, unassuming part of eastern Luxembourg. The Moselle River lazily acting as a natural border between Luxembourg and Germany. The valley is evidently central to the country’s wine production, with row upon row of vineyards draped over the low-lying hillsides interrupted only by a scattering of towns and villages. Just as I thought I was running out of country, I arrived at tiny Schengen, tucked in among the vines on the western bank of the Moselle. With fewer than 520 residents, it’s certainly not the big-name, bright-lights destination one might expect for an agreement that would change the way people travelled in Europe. Nevertheless, it was here, on a murky morning on 14 June 1985, that representatives of Belgium, France, Luxembourg, West Germany (as was) and the Netherlands gathered to officially seal the deal on this revolutionary new border-free zone.   A bit of background The number of European treaties, alliances, cross-alliances and counter-treaties that emerged during the second half of the 20th Century is near mind-boggling. The list screams bureaucracy, but understanding something of the various allegiances at this time goes a long way to setting the scene in Schengen, so stay with me. As World War Two drew to a close in 1944, Belgium, Luxembourg and The Netherlands joined together to establish the Benelux. This party of three recognised the benefits that would come over the following, inevitably difficult, decades from working together, and were hoping to encourage trade through a customs agreement. Building on Benelux, the 1957 Treaty of Rome created the European Economic Community (EEC), an expanded customs union of six founding member states (Benelux plus West Germany, France and Italy). By the early 1980s, there were 10 EEC members, and while only quick border checks were being enforced between the nations, the reality was that this still stopped the flow of traffic, required man-power and was increasingly seen as unnecessary red tape. The concept of unilateral internal border-free travel split the members, however, with half wanting free movement for EU nationals only and thus remaining committed to internal border checks to distinguish between EU and non-EU nationals. As Martina Kneip, manager of the European Museum Schengen, explained: ""The idea of open borders in 1985 was something extraordinary – like a kind of utopia. Nobody really believed that it could become reality."" It was left to the remaining five members (Benelux, France and West Germany), keen to implement the free-flowing movement of all people and goods, to spearhead the creation of the area to which Schengen would give its name. Why Schengen? As Luxembourg was soon to take over the EEC presidency, the small nation was entitled to choose where the signing of this treaty would take place. It just so happens that Schengen is the only place where France and Germany both join with a Benelux member, securing it as the destination of choice. As the meeting place of three countries, the choosing of Schengen was drenched in symbolism. To ensure it was a neutral affair, the signatories were assembled on a pleasure cruiser, the MS Princesse Marie-Astrid, to put pen to paper. The cruiser was moored as close as possible to the tri-point border, which runs down the middle of the Moselle River. Regardless, the signing in Schengen failed to attract a great deal of support or attention at the time. As well as the five EEC member states who were against it, many officials from all sides simply didn't believe it would come into force or succeed. So much so, there wasn’t a single head of state from the five signing nations present on the day. From the outset, the agreement was underestimated, “considered an experiment and not something that would last,” according to Kneip. This was compounded by the inevitable red tape that ensured the complete abolition of internal borders within the five founding countries didn’t materialise until 1995. The Schengen Area today Today, the Schengen Area comprises 26 member states. Of these, 22 are members of the EU, while four (Iceland, Switzerland, Norway and Liechtenstein) are not. Schengen has its critics now as it did then. The recent migrant crisis and the 2015 Paris attacks undermined Schengen, giving those against open borders plenty of ammunition to strike at the inclusive efforts made by the agreement.  Despite this, the Schengen Area continues to grow, even if the process of joining remains cumbersome. Politics still determine who can join, since new members must be unanimously voted in. Bulgaria and Romania, for example, have repeatedly been vetoed from joining Schengen largely due to concerns over domestic corruption and the security of their external borders. In fact, no country has joined the Schengen Area for several years; Liechtenstein was the last addition in 2011.   Nevertheless, the pros of Schengen far outweigh the cons for the majority of people. As Kneip observes: “The Schengen Agreement is something that affects the everyday lives of all the Schengen member states – some 400 million people.” For locals, this can mean anything from visiting friends and going to work to nipping into Luxembourg to take advantage of the country's relatively low tax on fuel when compared with its neighbours, diesel in particular. As for travellers, the Schengen Agreement grants immediate access to all member countries, making travel – be it by road, rail or air – quicker and easier. Add to this the Schengen visa, which allows non-EU travellers to apply for a single visa valid for 90 days with entry to all participating countries, and its appeal is blindingly clear, saving travellers both time and money. What of Schengen itself? Since Schengen is removed from any major artery, you’re only likely to find yourself there if you make a conscious effort to go. Around a 35km drive from Luxembourg City, the route takes you through forests, over farmland and down into the Moselle Valley. The landscape changes quite noticeably as you descend the rural hills to the town of Remich. From here, it's a pleasant riverside drive, winding between vine-clad slopes and the Moselle River to the epicentre of Schengen, the European Museum. Here, the story of how the Schengen Area came to exist is expertly told through interactive displays inside and a variety of monuments outside. Don’t miss the cabinet of official border control caps from the member states at the time they joined the area, each a piece of national identity that was surrendered in order to make Schengen work. Poignant sections of the Berlin Wall sit perfectly placed in front of the museum, set there to remind us all that walls – in this case, world-famous reinforced concrete from one of its founding members, no less – don’t have to remain in place forever. Further along the jetty in front of the museum, you’ll find three steles, or steel slabs, each with their own star commemorating the founding members. Finally, there are the striking Pillars of Nations that beautifully detail iconic sights from each member of the Schengen Area. Of course, there’s more to this laidback border village than international legislation. Visitors can extend their stay to enjoy a river cruise on the Moselle, go hiking or cycling in the surrounding hills, or set about sampling some crémant (the region’s revered sparkling white wine) to get a true taste of life in Schengen, the tiny rural village now committed to the annals of history.

economic indicators,What our thirst for bubbly really means,2024-09-15,2016-05-27,Pádraig Belton,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160526-why-were-drinking-more-champagne-than-ever-before,"After the global financial crisis put a big dent in consumption, bubbly is back in a big way. Here's why. Maybe the good times are here to stay. More of us are quaffing Champagne than ever before, and at a record rate — the fizzy stuff has just racked up its best year ever. Champagne shipments around the world reached a record 4.75 billion euros (£3.73bn, $5.34bn) last year. And sales are expected to continue rising in 2016, with growers confident they can increase value per bottle rather than volume. Treated as a barometer of global consumer confidence, Champagne sales are a good indicator of whether shoppers are buying luxury or premium goods, and also whether they feel flush enough to invest in global equities or housing. Champagne’s previous best year was 2007, on the eve of the financial crisis — when sales hit 4.56bn euros ($5.15bn). But then business fell off a cliff. No one felt like cracking open a bottle of bubbly as the global economy tanked. The Bubble Index Champagne sales — and headline-grabbing bar tabs — closely track optimism in the wider economy, according to Constantin Gurdgiev, professor of finance at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, California. After eight years of post-crisis adjustments, it appears “demand for premium goods and services is finally getting back to the pre-crisis ‘normal’,” said Gurdgiev. The next stage in this recovery will be price inflation, he said, adding to stable volume of sales growth, “as more and more upper middle class buyers re-enter the premium markets.” There’s a close correlation between GDP per capita and Champagne sales, agreed Vincent Perrin, a former French diplomat now managing director of the Comité Champagne, the trade association that represents the interests of independent Champagne producers. Right now, with strong economic recovery in Italy and Spain and good economic results in northern Europe, we’re seeing a good level of growth in Champagne in these markets, said Perrin. Sipping in secret Out of sight, out of mind During the downturn, the wealthy hid their Champagne habit, said Joël Claustre. “We really felt it in the City, in the financial sector — people could not be seen saying, ‘let’s have a drink at the Champagne bar’.”  Customers would drink in more discreet places “but would not invite their clients, or drink Champagne.” According to Claustre, the bigger bar tabs shifted out of sight, to private members’ clubs, over worries tabloid newspapers would name and shame bankers running up large bar tabs in more public establishments. Asian buyers are also helping drive sales. Countries growing thirstier include Taiwan (where Champagne sales bubbled up 29% in 2015, after a flat year in 2014) and South Korea (up by 31%). A weak euro has helped make imports cheaper and local factors such as distribution channels, and a strong base of knowledgeable sommeliers able to educate customers have helped too. China’s burgeoning middle class, however, remains committed to wine rather than Champagne, according to analysts. Future growth  Only so much Champagne can be produced in a year — there is a natural annual limit of around 350 million bottles, which means its growth prospects aren’t infinite. Over the past four years, the annual volume produced by the region has hovered between 305 and 312 million bottles. But the boundaries of France’s Champagne region, laid down in 1927’s Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée law, are about to be extended. A further 40 villages will be included from 2018 to 2020. Sara Guiducci, from wine merchants Corney and Barrow, said this will increase the amount of Champagne that can be produced — and the land prices of vineyards. The view from behind the bar  Europe’s bartenders are confident Champagne will stay popular with their customers in the year ahead. The average spend per person has been gently nudging up, said Joël Claustre, head of Champagne at Searcys, one of London’s most prominent Champagne bar chains. “Champagne very much follows the mood of the economy,” he added. David Wiedemann, owner of Reingold — a speakeasy-style cocktail bar in Berlin — said his customers have grown more discerning post-financial crisis. By researching on blogs and forums before they even get to the bar, “guests like to order the extraordinary which they cannot get elsewhere,” he said. As a result, he serves less prosecco and more ‘classical’ drinks such as Champagne and cocktails. “I think the masses are, in a way, now drinking Champagne more than they used to be,” said Claustre. “This is exactly what we want — I think [it] should be something everybody could drink.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
economic indicators,Meeting the needs of India’s mega-rich,2024-09-15,2017-01-05,Vikram Barhat,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20161230-the-people-meeting-the-needs-of-indias-super-rich,"India boasts a growing number of millionaires, spawning a high-end service industry. Vikram Barhat meets the people serving the country’s super-wealthy. India has a growing number of millionaires — there currently are 200,000 Indians worth a million dollars or more (about 68m rupees). It’s not surprising, given India’s large population and the meteoric rise in its economic fortunes in the past two decades. With this many millionaires, India is home to the 12th largest population of high-net-worth individuals — that is, those with investable assets of $1m or more. Although this number is relatively low compared to the size of the population, India is home to the fourth-highest number of billionaires in the world (84, with a combined net worth of around $248 billion, according to Forbes). This rise in the rich has spawned a growing industry that fusses over its wealthy and finicky clientele. These businesses offer top-notch services tailored exclusively to the exacting standards of the ultra-wealthy, their unique tastes and lifestyles. From matchmaking to private jets and from lifestyle management to expensive fine art, no matter how eccentric the demand, no request is too outlandish. Lifestyle management Like millionaires elsewhere, India’s rich “want access to the best things in life, but don’t have the time, nor the connections, to acquire them,” says Tanu Jain, head of marketing at the Gurgaon office of Quintessentially Lifestyle, a firm that offers round-the-clock personalised concierge services for its ultra-wealthy members. Whether it’s Belgium’s Tomorrowland music festival, Formula One action in Monaco, or the glamour of red carpets at Cannes, the company can arrange a VIP ticket to the best and most exclusive events worldwide, says Jain. “We have an unparalleled network of contacts allowing us to source the most elusive of items from anywhere in the world,” says Jain who’s helped clients secure “an autographed Roger Federer Tennis racquet, and a limited edition John Lennon pen, as a surprise for a loved one.” “India’s super-rich want things that can create memories for a lifetime,” says Jain, whose company has organised “a romantic meal on an iceberg for a couple,” and “an anniversary surprise in Paris with five hundred roses,” for its members. When serving a small community where word travels fast, nothing is left to chance. Each HNWI client is assigned a personal “lifestyle manager” who painstakingly “studies the behaviour of each member — their likes, dislikes, preferences — and accordingly recommends a personalised solution for each request,” says Jain. The sky is the limit India’s millionaires are people in a hurry with little time or patience for mass transport. “The new generation of Indian HNWIs wants to save time,” says Delhi-based Atiesh Mishra, vice president of operations and business development at Ligare Aviation Limited, a private air charter service. “They don’t want the hassles of flying a commercial airline.” This has spawned the world’s fastest growing aviation market by frequency of flights, according to a KPMG report. A rise in private jets and charter services has contributed to this growth. In recent years, many start-ups have sprung up in India’s chartered aviation sector. Companies like BookMyCharters, JetSetGo, and JetSmart allow high fliers to book private jets online. “The entire booking process is customised for each customer’s requirement, right from the schedule and airport check-ins to catering and in-flight services,” says Mishra whose company offers customised options including long-haul aircraft, and short-hop helicopters rides to remote locations. Clients’ requests, he says, could range from unusual (mid-air birthday celebrations) to plain outlandish (transporting large mango trees to the Middle East). Some of the more eccentric demands have included “a hookah with specific flavours onboard” and asking “the pilot to circle over the Taj Mahal to have an up-close aerial view of the architectural marvel.” Both had to be declined “due to stringent aviation regulations”, Mishra notes. Fit for a king When it comes to serving the super-rich, the ‘customer is king’ approach guides everything. Quite literally so for Lakshyaraj Singh Mewar, executive director of Historic Resort Hotels (HRH Group), India’s only privately owned chain of palace-hotels and resorts. The group owns several high-end heritage properties that were fashioned out of centuries-old palaces and princely mansions, including the Jagmandir Island Palace Hotel, in the middle of Lake Pichola, in Udaipur, the venue for the $18m fairy-tale wedding of British-Indian tycoon Sanjay Hinduja. The group owns several palaces and heritage havelis (mansions) that routinely play host to “celebrity events, high-profile weddings, corporate gigs, and glamour shows” for “high-net-worth clientele not just from India but across Europe, UK and the US,” says Mewar. Occasionally, there are unusual requests. Mewar recalls one particular instance where a young man booked the entire Jagmandir Island Palace for an evening to propose to his girlfriend. “The two were ferried on a flower-decked boat, and they romanced on the island-palace under the starry skies,” says Mewar. “We just played out his dream evening for him. This is our hospitality, nothing odd about it.” The millionaire matchmakers  Many high-powered executives and businesspeople are too busy to find a life partner through conventional social channels in their own community. And, in culturally diverse India, “community” is a catch-all term referring to a population of people of the same or similar religion, caste, culture, cuisine, and customs. Matchmaking companies like EliteMatrimony and Ultra Rich Match were quick to sense a market opportunity in finding a prospective soulmate for India’s most eligible singles. For a fee ranging between 50,000 rupees (about $1,000) and 300,000 rupees ($4,500), they discretely seek prospective candidates with the ideal characteristics to suit their high-net-worth client. The clients’ checklists can be diverse and demanding. “Some are fine with a match from outside their community, while others insist on prospects from within their own community,” says Murugavel Janakiraman, managing director of Chennai-based EliteMatrimony. Another matchmaker, Ultra Rich Match, has a rigorous vetting process to find the best possible match. “We don’t claim to make people fall in love, but we definitely make the journey of finding the love of your life much easier,” says Ahmedabad-based Saurabh Goswami, the company’s managing director. His client base includes business owners with a net worth between 1bn rupees (about $15m) and 10bn rupees (about $151m), many of whom “went to Ivy League schools, travelled the world, and have had exposure to different cultures.” The growing allure of fine art A sharp rise in wealth has also fuelled India’s art market. The country has a rich history of art, passed down by successive dynasties such as Rajput, Mughal and Mysore. However, it’s only recently that Indian artworks started gaining in commercial interest leading to Indian art and artists receiving global recognition. A 2016 study of ultra-high-net-worth Indians by Kotak Wealth management found 68% of participants had bought art on impulse. “As people acquire wealth and power, it’s natural to extend their spending to art,” says Dinesh Vazirani, co-founder of Saffronart, a leading Indian auction house for art and collectibles. “Acquiring art is seen as a reflection of social status; refined tastes reflect refined minds.” At its most recent sale in New Delhi, Saffronart sold modern art worth $10.38m, including a painting by contemporary Indian artist Akbar Padamsee that fetched $3m, more than twice its expected sale price, says Vazirani. A Christie’s auction in Mumbai in 2015 sold art worth nearly $15m, a record for any auction held in India. These figures provide validation of the domestic art market, currently worth about $225m, being propelled by the new crop of wealthy Indian buyers. And as their species swells in numbers, along with their appetite for luxury, it’s touched off a race among service providers, trying to break into the HNWI market. India is exploding with entrepreneurial energy, not the least of which is flowing through the sector whose business it is to know where the super-rich shoppers want to spend their dosh.

economic indicators,The many upsides of a happy workforce,2024-09-15,2017-07-06,Lennox Morrison,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20170705-the-many-upsides-of-a-happy-workforce,"Research shows most of us aren’t really happy to be at work – but there’s a burgeoning new niche of consultants offering to inject some joy into the office In 2012, John de Koning’s company did something surprising: they decided their number one priority would be the happiness of their staff. His employer, IT firm Incentro, based in Utrecht, the Netherlands, once operated as a traditional online services provider, with a top-down hierarchy of bosses and employees. But after a market downturn between 2002 and 2005, the management rebooted to become less flashy but more fun; a place where talented, ambitious young professionals would want to work. Now, all staff are equal and all information about the business is shared. Instead of the usual pyramid structure, people work in independently functioning ‘cells’ – groups of 60 or fewer. As well as organising their own work, they take part in company-wide decisions and even set their own salary. Rather than senior management dictating pay rises, each ‘cell’ or team decides whether they are happy to share salary information. If so, they make a collective decision on what they should earn – based on everyone knowing the full financial picture of the company. “We decided to introduce just one key performance indicator, and that’s employee happiness,” says de Koning, managing director of Incentro Marketing Technology. By doing so, staff numbers have grown from 40 in 2008 to more than 300 today across four countries, he says. While structural and organisational changes may not get the pulse racing compared to gourmet lunches or gaming consoles, Incentro’s approach to fostering staff contentment is shared by a growing number of companies – so much so that there’s a burgeoning new niche of happiness-at-work consultants offering to inject joy into the workplace with similar advice. So is there an outbreak of idealism in the boardroom? Not quite. Research suggests that smiling faces in the office are also good for the company’s bottom line. Objective benefits  There are many benefits to putting happiness at the centre of business and policy decisions, says economist Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, a professor at the University of Oxford’s Said Business School. He points to a 2014 study, which suggests that raising people’s happiness makes them more productive by between 7% and 12%. In a separate study, researchers took Fortune’s annual list of ‘Best Companies to Work For’ and compared it over time with how peer companies performed on the stock market. They found that the top best-to-work-for firms outperformed the others, and also that investors undervalued the intangibles of employee well-being. It’s an important piece of research, says De Neve, because it shows that the potential cost of raising well-being is more than matched by productivity and increased performance. Consultancies offering to perk up the mood in the workplace are targeting a potentially large market. In his work for the United Nations’ latest World Happiness Report De Neve found that fewer than 20% of people worldwide were actively engaged with their job and 20% were actively disengaged. Active engagement is more than mere satisfaction in a job, or at having a job in the first place, he explains – it is “being positively absorbed by the work you’re doing, identifying with and promoting the mission of the company you’re working for.” One 2016 UK study tracked tens of thousands of people who recorded their sense of well-being at different times of day on a smartphone app, ranking 39 activities in terms of happiness levels. Of the 39, paid work ranked second from bottom – just above being sick in bed. So what’s making people so melancholy?  Listening to would-be career-switchers, and looking at other studies, it’s about a lack of purpose and meaning in work and a sense that it’s impinging too much on other aspects of life. When work is a grind More than 1,000 discontented people have spent £2,000 ($2,570) each to join 12-week courses run by Escape the City, a training and recruitment consultancy based in London and New York. “The courses are designed to help people get unstuck or to start a business,” says co-founder Dominic Jackman. Typically, participants are aged 27 to 35, the majority are female and employed in corporate roles where they feel their role lacks purpose, says Jackman.  Many joined large corporates through grad schemes. “You work very, very hard. You get paid well. But the notion of a job that makes you feel alive takes a backseat,” he says. Increased life expectancy and higher retirement age mean people’s attitude to work is changing. “You’re going to be working for a long time so let’s enjoy our time at work and make an impact,” says Jackman. Portfolio freelance careers, remote working as a digital nomad, creating your own start-up and an “impact career” with a purpose-before-profit company are the four most sought-after new paths for his clients, he says. “It’s about making a difference to society, having a purpose and making it more sustainable. People want to work for a company that’s making things better for the world.” But if changing career tracks isn’t an option, what do people think would brighten their daily grind? Positivity pioneers  Wages are far less important to happiness at work than issues related to work-life balance and having colleagues’ support and social capital in the workplace, according to De Neve’s analysis of European data. Having variety in the job, learning on the job and having a sense of autonomy and control over what you are doing were also valued, he says. So what do consultancies propose? For Netherlands-based consultancy Corporate Rebels, which helped Incentro fine-tune their ideas, the approach stems from co-founders Pim de Moree and Joost Minnaar stepping out of corporate life to travel the world collecting pioneering ideas on how to foster a happy workplace. De Moree tells his clients the key to happiness “involves moving from profit to purpose, from hierarchy to a network of teams, from leaders who tell people what to do, to leaders who ask how they can best support [their team], from rules to freedom, from secrecy to transparency.” From what they have learned from business leaders and entrepreneurs who have put employee happiness centre stage, Corporate Rebels suggest open-book management – where everyone knows the financial and operational details of where they work. Another is results-based working, where it doesn’t matter how many hours you work, as long as you get the right result. Their stories underpin the data referred to by De Neve about a clear link between staff well-being and financial results. “The level of well-being of employees ought to be measured systematically and put on page one of the annual shareholders’ report,” he says. “It would send a strong signal about how a company is doing, and how it will be doing in the future. “There’s a philosophical argument about how looking after staff well-being is the right thing to do, but there are also huge objective benefits.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
economic indicators,Which countries deserve your money?,2024-09-15,2013-01-23,Lori Robertson,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20130122-which-countries-deserve-your-money,"The 2013 list of the World’s Best Ethical Destinations gives travellers guidance on where their dollar is most needed and best spent. Tourism has the power to bring
jobs and economic development to popular destinations, but how should travellers
decide where to spend their money? Are some countries more deserving of visitors’
dollars than others? That’s the idea behind the 10-destination list put
together by San Francisco-based non-profit Ethical Traveler, which, since 2006,
has published an annual guide to the World’s
Best Ethical Destinations in the developing
world.  “Instead of punishing countries for doing bad things,”
said Jeff Greenwald, executive director of Ethical Traveler, “we’re trying to
offer a carrot, rewarding countries in the developing world that are really
trying to do the right thing.”  
 
And travellers, who Greenwald describes as
“a vast and pretty much un-united political action group”, can also reward
ethical countries – or at least those improving and moving in the right
direction – by spending their time and money there. 
 
So which countries are the most ethical? For
2013, the
winners are Barbados, Cape Verde, Costa Rica, Ghana, Latvia, Lithuania,
Mauritius, Palau, Samoa and Uruguay. Those 10 countries scored highest in three
main areas: social welfare (measured by indicators such as child mortality
rates, economic freedom and crime rates); environmental protection (measured by
an academic index and share of protected areas); and human rights (which includes
press and political freedoms, as well as gay rights).  
 
Greenwald explained that countries must
have a good tourism infrastructure to make the list, but the non-profit also
uses the list to promote some under-visited places that can be a role model for
other countries in their region. For example, Latvia earned
high marks for improving
its environmental efforts and strong human rights record, and the country’s parks
and nature reserves make for a great off-the-beaten-path ecotourism trip. Gauja National Park,
with hiking, biking and canoeing, and the architecture-rich capital, Riga, are
a few of the Baltic country’s highlights.  In addition to just visiting these countries, travellers
should aim to spend their money in locally-owned businesses, Greenwald said, to
ensure their financial support stays in the country they’re visiting. However, that
requires a well-managed tourism infrastructure – something that countries with
poor track records in areas like child mortality and sanitation might not have.
While one could argue those places need the money even more, tourism can put a
strain on countries that face such challenges.  “They need help from other sources, and when tourism
is strong and can be an asset as opposed to a liability, then travellers can
visit,” Greenwald explained. 
 
Erica Avrami, research and education
director at the World Monuments Fund
(WMF) agreed that countries need to be properly
equipped so the influx of travellers does not overwhelm local communities or
heritage sites. WMF works to preserve cultural heritage sites that run the risk
of being damaged
by poorly managed tourism.  But while Avrami said that a
list of ethical destinations is “a wonderful idea”, the idea of being ethical
goes both ways. “There’s also a certain responsibility on the part of the
traveller to make sure their own footprint is as minimal as possible,” she said. Lori Robertson writes

economic indicators,The last chance to see the Titanic?,2024-09-15,2018-10-02,Peter Rubinstein,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20181001-is-this-the-last-chance-to-see-the-titanic,"Deep-sea bacteria are quickly consuming the Titanic. One company is offering tickets to visit it one last time – and to help measure its deterioration. Renata Rojas paddled behind her father through the water off the coast of Cozumel, Mexico. She was only five years old; never before had she been allowed out this far. Now, as she glided across the waves, her father stopped her and told her to look down to the sea floor. There, illuminated by the sunlight, was a sunken plane. She breathed through her snorkel as she studied its wings resting on the white sand. It was in this moment that she discovered an eternal love for the ocean. “It’s almost like space opens up. It’s very serene,” she remembers today, decades later. In 2019, following a lifetime of scuba training and saving money, Rojas is scheduled to fulfil her grandest dream: visiting the wreck of the RMS Titanic. This is a dream that has become increasingly urgent over the years. Rust-forming bacteria are rapidly consuming the Titanic. Experts predict it will last only a little more than 20 years. That means that the group of select paying passengers which Rojas is joining won’t only be the first to lay eyes on the wreck since 2005, they will also be among the last to see it at all. And while the expedition is a commercial venture, it is a scientific one too: the group will use advanced 3D-modelling tools to analyse and preserve the memory of the Titanic for generations to come. You might also like: The Titanic struck an iceberg on 14 April 1912 as it steamed across the Atlantic on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. It split in two and sank to a depth of 3.8km (2.5 miles) about 600km (370 miles) off the shores of Newfoundland, Canada. At least 1,500 people died. Engulfed by deep-sea darkness, the wreck sat for more than 70 years while bacteria ate away at its metal hull, leaving behind millions of delicate, icicle-shaped formations. “Now, there’s more life on Titanic than there was floating on the surface,” says Lori Johnston, microbial ecologist and a six-time visitor of the wreck. These ‘rusticles’ are the by-products of bacteria that oxidise the iron they consume. The acidic, oxidised fluid oozes downward with gravity, forming fragile branches of rust. “The rusticles are unique because they’re kind of the dominant species down there,” Johnston says. By the time explorer Robert Ballard and his team discovered the ship in 1985, the rusticles had already taken over. Because they eat about 180kg (400lbs) a day, scientists have given the ship a waning life expectancy. “If it’s going faster, which we hypothesise, it’s going to be less and less of a timeframe,” says Johnston. According to her research, Titanic might be a recognisable shipwreck for just 20 to 50 more years. Last chance As the clock ticks down, the window of opportunity to visit the Titanic, for scientific purposes or otherwise, is quickly vanishing. One new opportunity is with OceanGate, a private company that uses its small fleet of manned submersibles to explore, research and catalogue the oceans surrounding North America. OceanGate has undertaken 13 expeditions since its founding in 2009, including surveys of other shipwrecks like the Andrea Doria near Nantucket and the SS Dix in Puget Sound. Not until the 2019 Titanic expedition, however, have they welcomed paying passengers who don’t have distinct expertise in marine science or research. Chosen “mission specialists”, as OceanGate calls them, will embark on 11-day journeys in groups of nine beginning late June 2019 and ending mid-August. They will fly from St John’s, Newfoundland via helicopter to rendezvous with a support ship at sea, which will be their home base during the mission. Most importantly, they will be able to join at least one submersible dive to the Titanic. Down below, while crammed together inside the newly-updated Titan submersible, mission specialists will aid the crew in using sophisticated lasers, sonars and imaging technology to composite the most detailed and accurate 3D model of the ship in history. A ticket for the 11-day excursion and all of its amenities costs $105,129 (£81,300) – equivalent to the cost of first-class passage on the Titanic’s fateful voyage in 1912, adjusted for inflation. At first, the idea of non-professionals sinking to the bottom of the ocean – where the water temperature is 1C (34F) and the pressure is strong enough to crush them like a tin can – seems alarming. But to Joel Perry, president of OceanGate Expeditions and a diver for close to 30 years, safety is no issue. “It’s certainly not as dangerous as it might appear; we don’t just take anybody with us,” he says. “We go through a fairly rigorous process to screen folks and make sure they are appropriate.” Perry says there is an explicit understanding that the applicants must be physically and mentally suitable for a week at sea. “Think about, is this somebody you want to be in the car with for eight hours with the windows rolled up?” In addition to a generally affable personality and proven physical fitness, all mission specialists will have to go through four hours of ‘helicopter egress training’ (learning what to do in the case of crashing) before departure. They’ll practice in a sinking helicopter cockpit in a large pool. The applicants they accept are ones with track records like Rojas’, or as Perry calls her: “client number one”. “She’s had a passion for ocean exploration and the Titanic forever. Her nickname in the diving world is Mighty Mouse,” he says. The first indicator, and perhaps the most crucial, is her long history of diving experience. Even as a young adult, Rojas shocked her instructors with courage in the face of crisis. “One of my first times diving alone without my dad, I had an emergency,” Rojas says. “I went into a hole and broke an air valve.” Her regulator, which attaches to the air tank, hadn’t been properly maintained. The O-ring inside the attachment exploded, letting out her air while she was 18m (60ft) underwater. Rather than lose her cool, however, Rojas swam to her instructor and borrowed some air from his tank. “He’s asking if I’m okay and I said ‘yeah, I want to keep diving.’ Most people panic and surface.” From free dives in the Caribbean and Arctic to advanced cave diving and even centrifuge training – the kind used by astronauts to familiarise themselves with the effects of G-force – Rojas’ seasoned repertoire is something OceanGate hopes to find in other expedition candidates. The other trait that makes Rojas such an ideal mission specialist is her lifelong passion for everything Titanic. For her, it all began with the black-and-white film from 1953, which she first saw as a child. Her fascination with the glamour of the ship and the mystery of its tragic demise never left her. Even today, she proudly collects piles of Titanic books, magazines and newspaper clippings in her New York City home. “I’ve seen every movie, not read every book,” she admits. “I’ve probably missed a few.” When the wreck was discovered in 1985, Rojas immediately changed her career to oceanography and began saving money for her own trip. She met Ballard himself, but the explorer told her that no-one would be making another expedition to the site. She was crushed. She returned to her previous job, banking. Two years later, she watched on television as William F Buckley emerged from a submersible following his own Titanic voyage. “He wasn’t an oceanographer,” Rojas says. “He was just a millionaire.” She knew then: Ballard was wrong. With the right organisation and funding, visiting the wreck was still possible. It wasn’t until 2012, nearly 30 years after Titanic was found, that Rojas was able to secure a ticket on a commercial dive with Deep Ocean Expeditions (DOE). It would be a centennial journey, a sombre yet uniquely special chance to honour the 100th anniversary of the ship’s sinking. Rojas sent emails to DOE every few weeks to make sure everything was on schedule. But in February, just two months before departure, the trip was cancelled. “I cannot even describe the sadness,” Rojas says. “It took me about a year to get a grip and start thinking about it again.” Surf war The prospect of visiting the Titanic wreck has been controversial since its discovery. According to David Concannon, an expedition leader and attorney who has represented OceanGate in the past, Ballard and his French crew began arguing over jurisdiction and access less than 24 hours after they surfaced in 1985. The back-and-forth resulted in Ballard spearheading the creation of an international agreement to leave the wreck alone – which the French promptly ignored. Ever since, the governments of Britain, France, the US and Canada have been locked in a turf war against private individuals and companies like OceanGate seeking to visit Titanic. “It has always been about control,” says Concannon, who currently advises OceanGate. “Who gets to control the site, the recovery of artefacts, the filming, and the battles over the last 30 years have been about control. And when you look at it that way, the smoke begins to clear.” Today, Concannon calls the guidelines and restrictions from Noaa (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and others “draconian”. For their part, Noaa believe that Titanic visits, even ones that don’t seek to salvage artefacts, are disturbances to its architectural integrity and to its status as an underwater cultural heritage site and memorial. Fortunately for OceanGate, however, there is not much in the way of enforcing Noaa’s rules. Threats of legal retaliation have been tested in the past, never with any real follow-through. “If they try to impose restrictions, no-one’s going to adhere,” Concannon says. “They’re just going to show up, dive, do what they want, and leave.” This oceanic free-for-all is made easier because of how far the wreck is from the Canadian shore. Territorial water boundaries stop at 19km (12 miles) and economic boundaries at 160km (100 miles), Concannon says. The Titanic is 600km (370 miles) away from Newfoundland. In other words: in the high seas. Despite bristling at Noaa’s guidelines, Perry says OceanGate intends to follow them. Their mission in 2019, other than giving participants the trip of a lifetime, is to use 3D-mapping technology to capture the wreck in its entirety for the first time in 10 years. The Titan submersible will be outfitted with sonars and laser scanners courtesy of media company Virtual Wonders to capture billions of spatial data points from the Titanic. The result, after a pass through a liquid-cooled super computer, will be an ultra-high-resolution 3D model unlike anything made before. “What we’ll get this year is the bow section in great detail, and the aft section in good detail,” says CEO Mark Bauman. “It’s going to take years to map the interior. Each year we’ll get better and better.” By making multiple passes over the ship during OceanGate’s six-week expedition schedule, Bauman says they might even be able to see the volumetric change from the bacteria happen in real time. “This should give us something to triangulate it against the last measurements that were made on the Titanic. It should allow us to time the projections of when the Titanic will just be a rust stain on the floor.” Perry says the 3D models and data will be given freely to scientists and researchers who wish to use them in their work, an approach consistent with how Noaa have treated their own visual content from the wreck. A portion of the material will also be made available for education and outreach purposes through the company’s non-profit, OceanGate Foundation. For everyone else, Bauman hopes to create immersive experiences for different entertainment mediums. “We plan to put out AR apps and VR apps, we plan to probably sell it into video games, people will be able to fly the sub down themselves,” Bauman says. “It’ll look better than 3D Imax resolution.” OceanGate’s mission specialists will help to collect this data from both inside the submersible and aboard the support ship, a novel concept that specifically attracted Rojas to the journey. She has eagerly tracked the company’s progress ever since she met them five years ago. “I want to be involved in everything, but mainly submersible operations or communication with the surface,” she says. “We are not tourists. We are actually part of the crew.” If she’s lucky, Rojas will even be able to pilot the sub using its unique steering wheel: a wireless PlayStation game controller. “I’m putting all my bets with OceanGate. I do believe they will be successful.” It’s for this reason that Rojas feels the steep price of a ticket is worth every penny. Not only will she witness a site seen only by a handful of people, but she will be directly involved in every inch of the journey. For her and the other committed applicants, it’s all too good to pass up. Besides, she points out, a space flight is going for $250,000 (£190,000); an Everest trek can be $90,000 (£70,000). This, Perry says, “felt like the right number for the market”. Deep dive If all goes to plan, then in June 2019, Rojas will transfer from the support ship and climb down the ladder into the Titan from the top hatch. After taking her seat beside the other specialists, the hatch will close, and the sub will slowly descend into the blackness. She will hear the clicks and buzzes from inside and watch as condensation forms on the walls. When she finally touches down, the lights will turn on and she’ll be face to face with her dream: the Titanic in all of its ruined glory. “I’m going to feel very overwhelmed. After waiting for so long, I’m able to actually be in front of the shipwreck itself,” she says. “I also think it’s going to be a very sombre moment. The tragedy itself is a very sad event. It’s going to be emotional for me in both aspects.” “It is a gravesite,” Johnston says. “You have this moment of where you are and what you’re seeing. We are immensely respectful of that.” Some, including descendants of Titanic survivors, argue that visiting the wreck is a form of disrespect to the hundreds that perished in 1912. But to Johnston, doing so can create unique learning opportunities for generations that will come long after the ship is gone. It includes “everything from geography to oceanography to deep oceans to history to archaeology,” she says. “It’s part of history, so you want to bring that history to the people.” Rojas hopes to share her own insight from the journey with children as well. She wants them to know that a lifelong dream, even one like hers, is always in reach. “I was a kid one day who had a dream. If they have a dream and it seems big and insurmountable, they can make it happen,” she says. “I’m prepared to go.” -- A previous version of the story had date of the Titanic's sinking as 12 April.

economic indicators,Where we are on climate in five charts,2024-09-15,2021-01-11,Isabelle Gerretsen,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210108-where-we-are-on-climate-change-in-five-charts,"After the turbulent year of 2020, BBC Future takes stock on the state of the climate at the beginning of 2021. From unprecedented wildfires across the US to the extraordinary heat of Siberia, the impacts of climate change were felt in every corner of the world in 2020. We have come to a ""moment of truth"", United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in his State of the Planet speech in December. ""Covid and climate have brought us to a threshold."" BBC Future brings you our round-up of where we are on climate change at the start of 2021, according to five crucial measures of climate health. 1. CO2 levels The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere reached record levels in 2020, hitting 417 parts per million in May. The last time CO2 levels exceeded 400 parts per million was around four million years ago, during the Pliocene era, when global temperatures were 2-4C warmer and sea levels were 10-25 metres (33-82 feet) higher than they are now. ""We are seeing record levels every year,"" says Ralph Keeling, head of the CO2 programme at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, which has been tracking CO2 concentrations from the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii since 1958. ""We saw record levels again this year despite Covid."" Read more on the solutions:  The effect of lockdowns on concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere was so small that it registers as a ""blip"", hardly distinguishable from the year-to-year fluctuations of the carbon cycle, according to the World Meteorological Organization, and has had a negligible impact on the overall curve of rising CO2 levels. ""We have put 100ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere in the last 60 years,"" says Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute for climate change and the environment at Imperial College London. That is 100 times faster than previous natural increases, such as those that occurred towards the end of the last ice age more than 10,000 years ago. ""If we keep tracking the worst-case scenario, by the end of this century levels of CO2 will be 800ppm. We haven't had that for 55 million years. There was no ice on the planet then and it was 12C warmer,"" says Siegert.   2. Record heat The past decade was the hottest on record. The year 2020 was more than 1.2C hotter than the average year in the 19th Century. In Europe it was the hottest year ever, while globally 2020 tied with 2016 as the warmest. Record temperatures, including 2016, usually coincide with an El Niño event (a large band of warm water that forms in the Pacific Ocean every few years), which results in large-scale warming of ocean surface temperatures. But 2020 was unusual because the world experienced a La Niña event (the reverse of El Niño, with a cooler band of water forming). In other words, without La Niña bringing global temperatures down, 2020 would have been even hotter. Read more on the solutions: The exceptionally warm temperatures triggered the largest wildfires ever recorded in the US states of California and Colorado, and the ""black summer"" of fires in eastern Australia. ""The intensity of those fires and number of people being killed is truly significant,"" says Siegert. 3. Arctic ice Nowhere is that increase in heat more keenly felt than in the Arctic. In June 2020, the temperature reached 38C in eastern Siberia, the hottest ever recorded within the Arctic Circle. The heatwave accelerated the melting of sea ice in the East Siberian and Laptev seas and delayed the usual Arctic freeze by almost two months. ""You definitely saw the impact of those warm temperatures,"" says Julienne Stroeve, a polar scientist from University College London. On the Eurasian side of the Arctic Circle, the ice did not freeze until the end of October, which is unusually late. The summer of 2020 saw sea ice area at its second lowest on record, and sea ice extent (a larger measure, which includes ocean areas where at least 15% ice appears) also at its second lowest. As well as being a symptom of climate change, the loss of ice is also a driver of it. Bright white sea ice plays an important role in reflecting heat from the Sun back out into space, a bit like a reflective jacket. But the Arctic is heating twice as quickly as the rest of the world – and as less ice makes it through the warm summer months, we lose its reflective protection. In its place, large areas of open dark water absorb more heat, fueling global warming further. Multi-year ice is also thicker and more reflective than the thin, dark seasonal ice that is increasingly taking its place. Between 1979-2018, the proportion of Arctic sea ice that is at least five years old declined from 30% to 2%, according to the IPCC. ""White ice reflects a lot of energy from the Sun and helps slow the rate of global warming,"" says Michael Meredith, a polar researcher at the British Antarctic Survey. ""We are accelerating global warming by reducing the amount of Arctic sea ice."" The loss of ice is believed to be disrupting weather patterns around the world already. According to the Grantham Institute, it is possible – though not conclusively shown – that 2018 Arctic conditions provoked the ""Beast from the East"" winter storm in Europe in 2018 by altering the jet stream, a current of air high in the atmosphere. ""Temperature difference between the equator and poles drives a lot of our large-scale weather systems, including the jet stream,"" says Stroeve. And because the Arctic is warming faster than lower latitudes, there is a weakening of the jet stream. ""Everything is interconnected. If one part of the climate system changes, the rest of the system will respond,"" says Stroeve. 4. Permafrost Across the northern hemisphere, permafrost – the ground that remains frozen year-round for two or more years – is warming rapidly. When air temperatures reached 38C (100F) in Siberia in the summer of 2020, land temperatures in several parts of the Arctic Circle hit a record 45C (113F), accelerating the thawing of permafrost in the region. Both continuous permafrost (long, uninterrupted stretches of permafrost) and discontinuous (a more fragmented kind) are in decline. Permafrost contains a huge amount of greenhouse gases, including CO2 and methane, which are released into the atmosphere as it thaws. Soils in the permafrost region, which spans around 23 million square kilometres (8.9 million square miles) across Siberia, Greenland, Canada and the Arctic, hold twice as much carbon as the atmosphere does – almost 1,600 billion tonnes. Much of that carbon is stored in the form of methane, a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming impact 84 times higher than CO2. ""Permafrost is doing us a big favour by keeping that carbon locked away from the atmosphere,"" says Meredith. Thawing permafrost also damages existing infrastructure and destroys the livelihoods of the indigenous communities who rely on the frozen ground to move around and hunt. It is thought to have contributed to the collapse of a huge fuel tank in the Russian Arctic in May, which leaked 20,000 tonnes of diesel into a river. 5. Forests Since 1990 the world has lost 178 million hectares of forest (690,000 square miles) – an area the size of Libya. Over the past three decades, the rate of deforestation has slowed but experts say it isn't fast enough, given the vital role forests play in curbing global warming. In 2015-20 the annual deforestation rate was 10 million hectares (39,000 square miles, or about the size of Iceland), compared to 12 million hectares (46,000 square miles) in the previous five years. ""Globally forest areas continue to decline,"" says Bonnie Waring, senior lecturer at the Grantham Institute, noting that there are big regional differences. ""We are losing a lot of tropical forests in South America and Africa [and] regaining temperate forests through tree planting or natural regeneration in Europe and Asia."" Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Indonesia are the countries losing forest cover most rapidly. In 2020, deforestation of the Amazon rainforest surged to a 12-year high. An estimated 45% of all carbon on land is stored in trees and forest soil. ""Soils globally contain more carbon than all plants and atmosphere put together,"" says Waring. When forests are cut down or burned, the soil is disturbed and carbon dioxide is released. Read more on the solutions: The World Economic Forum launched a campaign this year to plant one trillion trees to absorb carbon. While planting trees might help cancel out the last 10 years of CO2 emissions, it cannot solve the climate crisis on its own, according to Waring. ""Protecting existing forests is even more important than planting new ones. Every time an ecosystem is disturbed, you see carbon lost,"" she says. Allowing forests to regrow naturally and rewilding huge areas of land, a process known as natural regeneration, is the most cost-effective and productive way to capture CO2 and boost overall biodiversity, according to Waring. As well as showing how much the climate has changed already, these five climate indicators also point the way to the solutions that can curb global warming to safer levels by the end of the century. As Guterres noted in his December State of the Planet speech, ""Let's be clear: Human activities are at the root of our descent towards chaos. But that means human action can help solve it."" -- With data research by Miriam Quick. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

economic indicators,Evergrande chairman put under police surveillance,2024-09-15,2023-09-28,By Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66932548,"Evergrande's chairman Hui Ka Yan has been put under police surveillance as the problems for the Chinese property giant mount. Evergrande said its shares would remain suspended until further notice. It marks another low for the heavily indebted property giant which defaulted in 2021, triggering China's current real estate market crisis. In August, it filed for bankruptcy in the US in a bid to protect its American assets as it worked on a deal. In a statement on Thursday, Evergrande said Mr Hui ""has been subject to mandatory measures in accordance with the law due to suspicion of illegal crimes"", without giving any further detail. The latest share suspension comes just a month after the firm's previous 17-month suspension was lifted. Evergrande - once the world's most valuable property developer - is at the centre of a real estate crisis threatening the world's second largest economy. With more than $300bn (£247bn) of debt, the firm has been scrambling to raise cash by selling assets and shares to repay suppliers and creditors. Most of Evergrande's debt is owed to people within China, many of whom are ordinary citizens whose homes have not been finished. When the firm defaulted on its huge debts in 2021, it sent shockwaves through global financial markets as the property sector contributes to roughly a quarter of China's economy. Several other of the country's major developers have defaulted over the past year and many are struggling to find the money to complete developments. Hui Ka Yan, also known as Xu Jiayin, was born into a poor family in China's central Henan province in 1958, during Mao Zedong's economic and social campaign, the Great Leap Forward. Despite his upbringing, after setting up Evergrande in 1996, he became a poster child for China's super-rich. He earned the nickname ""Belt Brother"" in 2012 by wearing a gold-buckled belt from the French luxury label Hermès to China's annual legislative conference. In 2017, he became China's richest person with his fortune rising to $42.5bn (£34bn). But his wealth has plummeted since then, largely as Evergrande's problems have grown, and he has kept a low profile in recent years. There are several reasons why Evergrande's problems are serious. Firstly, many people bought property from Evergrande even before building work began. They have paid deposits and could potentially lose that money if it goes bust. There are also the companies that do business with Evergrande. Firms including construction and design firms and materials suppliers are at risk of incurring major losses, which could force them into bankruptcy. The third is the potential impact on China's financial system: If Evergrande defaults, banks and other lenders may be forced to lend less. This could lead to what is known as a credit crunch, when companies struggle to borrow money at affordable rates. A credit crunch would be very bad news for the world's second largest economy, because companies that can't borrow find it difficult to grow, and in some cases are unable to continue operating. This may also unnerve foreign investors, who could see China as a less attractive place to put their money. In July, Evergrande revealed it had lost a combined 581.9bn yuan ($79.6bn; £65.6bn) over the past two years. It has been working on a new repayment plan and the company seemed to have been moving closer to resolving the problem after it filed for US bankruptcy protection. Its latest plan was to reissue its overseas debt as new bonds that it had to pay back in about 10 years' time, as well as offering their creditors stakes in the company as shares. But earlier this week, Evergrande revealed its mainland unit Hengda Real Estate had defaulted on 4bn yuan of debt. Chinese business wire Caixin also reported that several current and former executives has been detained. Trading in its two other units - property services and electric vehicles - was also suspended on Thursday. ""China's property-sector stress will continue to pose cross-sector credit risks in the near term,"" wrote Lan Wang and Duncan Innes-Ker of Fitch Ratings.  ""The government's modest policy easing to date is unlikely to drive a sharp turnaround in homebuyers' sentiment, even though it has led to some recent improvements in broader economic indicators,"" their report said."
economic indicators,What is the Brics group and what does it do?,2024-09-15,2023-12-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-66525474,"Saudi Arabia has joined Brics, the alliance of major developing countries, along with four other nations. The Saudi membership was due to start on 1 January, but there was a delay before it was confirmed. The Brics group wants emerging economies to have more influence in international politics.  In 2006, Brazil, Russia, India and China created the ""Bric"" group. South Africa joined in 2010, making it ""Brics"". The group was designed to bring together the world's most important developing countries, to challenge the political and economic power of the wealthier nations of North America and Western Europe. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were invited to become members with effect from 1 January 2024. A Saudi Arabian government minister said in mid January it had not joined.  But South Africa's government since confirmed its membership status. Argentina was also invited to join, but President Javier Milei pulled out in December 2023, shortly after taking office.  The group sets priorities and makes decisions at an annual summit. Members take it in turns to serve as president for a year. The name for the expanded group has not yet been announced, but may be ""Brics +"". Brics countries include major world powers, such as China and Russia, and countries which are influential on their continent, such as South Africa and Brazil. The expanded group has a combined population of about 3.5 billion, or 45% of the world's inhabitants. Combined, members' economies are worth more than $28.5tn - about 28% of the global economy.  With Iran, Saudi Arabia and UAE as members, Brics countries produce about 44% of the world's crude oil. However, the group argues that Western nations dominate important global bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which lend money to governments.  It wants to see a ""greater voice and representation"" for emerging economies.     In 2014, the Brics nations set up the New Development Bank to lend money to boost infrastructure.  By the end of 2022, it had provided nearly $32bn to emerging nations for new roads, bridges, railways and water supply projects. This is China's main aim for Brics, according to Prof Padraig Carmody from Trinity College Dublin.  ""Through Brics, China is trying to grow its power and influence - especially in Africa,"" he says. ""It wants to be be the leading voice for the global south.""  The other major world power in the group has a different purpose: ""Russia sees [Brics] as part of its fight against the West, helping it to overcome the sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine,"" says Creon Butler of the London-based think tank Chatham House.  Iran's membership could increase the anti-Western nature of Brics, he adds. Nations often use the US dollar to trade between themselves. Leading politicians in Brazil and Russia have suggested creating a Brics currency, to reduce the dollar's dominance. However, this was not discussed at the group's 2023 summit. It would be impractical for Brics nations to create a common currency because their economies are so different, says Professor Carmody. However, he says it is possible that ""they may consider in the future creating some new currency to be used for international trade payments, or a cryptocurrency for international trade"".  The G20 group was set up in 1999 for developed and developing nations to discuss global issues.  However, the Brics group also contains many of the countries which are in the G20.  In future, they may work in tandem, says Dr Irene Mia from the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank. ""Together, they might push for more money for developing nations to tackle climate change,"" she says.   Russia will host the 20024 Brics summit in Kazan in October. President Vladimir Putin has said he wants to: ""With Brics, Russia will want to show the West that it still has friends and allies in the rest of the world, despite its invasion of Ukraine,"" says Dr Mia."

Hui Ka Yan, also known as Xu Jiayin, was born into a poor family in China's central Henan province in 1958, during Mao Zedong's economic and social campaign, the Great Leap Forward. Despite his upbringing, after setting up Evergrande in 1996, he became a poster child for China's super-rich. He earned the nickname ""Belt Brother"" in 2012 by wearing a gold-buckled belt from the French luxury label Hermès to China's annual legislative conference. In 2017, he became China's richest person with his fortune rising to $42.5bn (£34bn). But his wealth has plummeted since then, largely as Evergrande's problems have grown, and he has kept a low profile in recent years. There are several reasons why Evergrande's problems are serious. Firstly, many people bought property from Evergrande even before building work began. They have paid deposits and could potentially lose that money if it goes bust. There are also the companies that do business with Evergrande. Firms including construction and design firms and materials suppliers are at risk of incurring major losses, which could force them into bankruptcy. The third is the potential impact on China's financial system: If Evergrande defaults, banks and other lenders may be forced to lend less. This could lead to what is known as a credit crunch, when companies struggle to borrow money at affordable rates. A credit crunch would be very bad news for the world's second largest economy, because companies that can't borrow find it difficult to grow, and in some cases are unable to continue operating. This may also unnerve foreign investors, who could see China as a less attractive place to put their money. In July, Evergrande revealed it had lost a combined 581.9bn yuan ($79.6bn; £65.6bn) over the past two years. It has been working on a new repayment plan and the company seemed to have been moving closer to resolving the problem after it filed for US bankruptcy protection. Its latest plan was to reissue its overseas debt as new bonds that it had to pay back in about 10 years' time, as well as offering their creditors stakes in the company as shares. But earlier this week, Evergrande revealed its mainland unit Hengda Real Estate had defaulted on 4bn yuan of debt. Chinese business wire Caixin also reported that several current and former executives has been detained. Trading in its two other units - property services and electric vehicles - was also suspended on Thursday. ""China's property-sector stress will continue to pose cross-sector credit risks in the near term,"" wrote Lan Wang and Duncan Innes-Ker of Fitch Ratings.  ""The government's modest policy easing to date is unlikely to drive a sharp turnaround in homebuyers' sentiment, even though it has led to some recent improvements in broader economic indicators,"" their report said."
economic indicators,China tightens stock market rules after sell-off,2024-09-15,2024-01-29,By Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68125359,"China has tightened its financial industry rules as the government tries to halt a deepening sell-off in the world's second largest economy. Nearly $6tn (£4.7tn) has been wiped off Chinese and Hong Kong stocks since their most recent peak three years ago. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) says the measures will create ""a fairer market order"". Under the new rules limits will be put on so-called ""short-selling"" from Monday. Short selling is when a trader bets that a share or other asset will fall in value. They borrow the asset and sell it immediately with the aim of buying it back later at a lower price and keeping the difference. Defenders of short selling say it can play an important part in financial markets, by helping find the true value of an asset. However, some critics see short selling as a ruthless trading strategy that undermines companies. The latest announcement by the CSRC comes after a series of informal measures introduced by the regulator over the last year did little to shore up financial markets. The CSRC said that following ""a complete suspension of the lending of restricted stocks"", which takes effect today, further limitations on securities lending will be introduced from 18 March. Last week, the country's premier Li Qiang asked authorities to take more ""forceful"" measures to stabilise share prices. The sell-off in China's stock market comes as some investors are concerned that the country's economy could face a long period of slow economic growth. Central to China's economic problems is its property market. For two decades, the sector boomed and accounted for a third of the country's entire wealth. But when the government put limits on how much developers could borrow in 2020, they started owing billions which they could not pay back. When property giant Evergrande defaulted in 2021, after missing a crucial repayment deadline, it triggered the current crisis. On Monday, the firm was ordered to liquidate by a court in Hong Kong, sending its shares down by more than 20% before trading in them was suspended. The real estate sector's troubles have also revealed issues faced by the country's so-called ""shadow banks"" which have lent billions of dollar to developers. The shadow banks operate in a very similar way to traditional banks but are not subject to the same regulations. In November, Chinese officials launched an investigation into ""suspected illegal crimes"" at one of the country's biggest shadow banks, Zhongzhi Enterprise Group, which filed for bankruptcy and earlier this month. There are also a number of indications that China's once-booming economy is slowing sharply. Official figures show the economy expanded by more than 5% in 2023. While that is stronger growth than many other major economies it is much lower than China saw before the pandemic. Meanwhile, the country's exports, which have been a major contributor to its growth, fell last year. At the same time, youth unemployment hit a record high and local government debt has jumped."
economic indicators,EU leaders weigh up hard choices over Brexit trade deal,2024-09-15,2020-10-14,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54541761,"The threat was implicit.  On the eve of their two-day summit in Brussels, the prime minister reminded EU leaders of his words back in early September. A trade deal had to have been agreed between the two sides by 15 October for it to be in force by the end of the year, he'd said. If not, he added: ""I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on."" In other words - end negotiations and walk away. Yet, Boris Johnson moved the goalpost himself on Wednesday evening. In a call with the European Commission president and the European Council president he said he would wait for EU leaders to finish their summit discussions on Friday before deciding the UK's next steps. EU diplomats I spoke to were unimpressed. ""Boris Johnson swore before he'd die in a ditch. He's set deadlines again and again and they have come and gone,"" a seasoned EU figure told me. But Brussels is far from sanguine about the prospect of failing to agree a UK deal. Leaders like the Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte have said the Covid-19 pandemic makes it all the more important to have an agreement. The economic fallout of no-deal come the end of the year would provoke additional political and economic headaches EU politicians would far prefer to avoid. They assume Boris Johnson feels the same way. Yet EU leaders are not yet all on the same page when it comes to how much they should give up or give in to get a deal. Brussels keeps calling on the UK to make concessions but a successful outcome will require compromises on both sides. And that is the real significance of this week's summit. It's not all about Brexit. EU leaders plan to discuss Covid-19, the environment and EU-Africa relations as well. But this is very likely the last time they'll be face to face before negotiations with the UK end. It's also the first time in a long time that EU leaders hold a detailed discussion on Brexit. For much of this year the Covid-19 pandemic has sucked the political oxygen across Europe. So, how much is a deal worth to them? Will France's Emmanuel Macron relinquish his hard-line position about keeping current fishing quotas in UK waters? He'll have to, to get a UK deal. Will Germany's Angela Merkel give way on some demands on competition regulations (aka the level playing field) yet still grant the UK zero tariff, zero quota access to the single market? EU leaders must agree all this amongst themselves and it won't be straightforward. A trade agreement with the UK impacts the bloc's global reputation, EU businesses (especially those in countries with high trade volumes with the UK, like Germany and the Netherlands) and political fortunes. Angela Merkel is thinking of her legacy as she prepares to step down as chancellor next year. She wants to maintain close ties with the UK for geopolitical as well as economic reasons. She also keen to avoid any major internal EU disagreements over the deal. Emmanuel Macron meanwhile, is looking over his shoulder at his arch political rival, the Eurosceptic nationalist Marine Le Pen. He hopes to demonstrate in negotiations with the UK that leaving the EU is fraught with difficulty. He also wants to be seen fighting for French interests - hence the hard line on fish. And on competition regulations. Mr Macron and other EU leaders don't want to grant the UK advantageous access to their single market if the UK is then free to undercut European businesses by slashing regulations and/or boosting UK enterprises with government subsidies that Brussels doesn't allow its members. So how much will the EU curb its desire to keep the UK attached to its competition rules and standards in order to reach a deal? The UK says it's left the bloc, is now a sovereign nation and must be recognised by Brussels as such. EU diplomats suggest it would help them ease up on their level-playing-field demands if the UK signed up to a dispute mechanism with teeth - meaning if either side breached the terms of their trade deal, then swift and hefty legal action could be taken. One diplomat close to the negotiations rather patronisingly described this potential EU compromise position by comparing the UK to a toddler that doesn't want to eat its vegetables. He said the EU was now looking for alternative arrangements to get the UK to sign up to a deal. He described it as mixing things up to hide the vegetables from the toddler. So will the UK sign up to a vegetable mush? To an aggressive dispute mechanism and to high-level common principles on state aid, for example, as well as a strong national regulator? There are indications it might, but working out the technical details is ""not to be underestimated"" as a UK source put it. British negotiators say they're frustrated that the EU has so far refused to start working on joint legal texts that can be sent backwards and forwards between the two sides as negotiations progress.   The most likely outcome from this week's EU summit as far as Brexit is concerned is that leaders will call for negotiations to step up in pace and intensity (if you think you've heard all this before, you are absolutely right). France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says EU-UK talks between now and mid-November will be decisive. If the prime minister signs up to them."
economic indicators,EU and China rebuff Trump on climate,2024-09-15,2017-05-31,By Matt McGrath,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40106281,"Chinese and EU leaders are to agree a joint statement on the Paris climate agreement saying it is ""an imperative more important than ever"". A draft of the document, seen by the BBC, stresses the ""highest political commitment"" to implement the deal. It will be widely seen as a rebuff to the US, as President Trump prepares to announce on Thursday if the US is withdrawing from the accord.  The joint statement will be published on Friday after a summit in Brussels.  For more than a year, Chinese and EU officials have been working behind the scenes to agree a joint statement on climate change and clean energy. The document highlights the dangers posed by rising temperatures, ""as a national security issue and multiplying factor of social and political fragility,"" while pointing out that the transition to clean energy creates jobs and economic growth.  ""The EU and China consider the Paris agreement as an historic achievement further accelerating the irreversible global low greenhouse gas emission and climate resilient development,"" the draft document says.  ""The Paris Agreement is proof that with shared political will and mutual trust, multilateralism can succeed in building fair and effective solutions to the most critical global problems of our time. The EU and China underline their highest political commitment to the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement in all its aspects."" Both sides say they will step up action to and ""forge ahead with further policies and measures"" to implement their national plans on cutting carbon. Significantly, both the EU and China agree that they will outline their long term low carbon strategies by 2020. The document outlines other areas of co-operation including on the development and linking of carbon markets. There will also be bilateral work on energy labelling, energy performance standards and the performance standards of buildings.  ""The EU and China are joining forces to forge ahead on the implementation of the Paris agreement and accelerate the global transition to clean energy,"" said EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete. ""No one should be left behind, but the EU and China have decided to move forward."" Climate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect of gases, or emissions, released from industry and agriculture on the atmosphere.       The Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions.   Countries agreed to: To date, 147 out of the 197 countries have ratified the accord, including the US, where the accord entered into force last November. Exxon shareholders back 'historic' vote on climate Antarctic ice crack takes major turn  The increased co-operation between the EU and China comes as reports indicate a further cooling in the US towards the Paris accord.  Several sources, quoted by US media, suggest that President Trump is set to pull out. The president himself tweeted he would make his announcement at 15:00 (19:00 GMT) on Thursday.  This comes after the President failed to find common ground with other global leaders at G7 summit in Taormina, Sicily. In the wake of that meeting, German Chancellor Angela Merkel vented her frustration with the US position. ""The entire discussion about climate was very difficult, if not to say very dissatisfying,"" she told reporters. ""There are no indications whether the United States will stay in the Paris Agreement or not."" The new move by the EU and China was warmly welcomed by environmental campaigners, rattled by the prospect of the world's second largest emitter of carbon pulling out of the globally supported agreement. ""If US-China climate cooperation gave birth to the Paris Agreement, now it is up to EU and China to defend and enhance it,"" said Li Shuo, from Greenpeace.

economic indicators,Four things that could decide who wins US election,2024-09-15,2024-01-31,By Anthony Zurcher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68146241,"Donald Trump and Joe Biden will do battle in November to determine who occupies the White House for the next four years. This contest will be unique in modern history as a rematch between the current president and his immediate predecessor. The contrast will be simple, according to Sean Spicer, who served as Mr Trump's first press secretary and worked for the Republican National Committee prior to that. ""For those people who say, well, during Trump, the policies of Donald Trump made my life better, more secure, made the economy and our communities better, it's a no brainer."" The Trump campaign will be hoping to distract from the weaknesses of their candidate - his legal troubles, his divisive rhetoric and his attempts to undermine the 2020 election results, which contributed to the January 2021 attack on the US Capitol. But Mr Biden also has key vulnerabilities, struggling to sell his first-term achievements and trying to convince the public he has the energy for the campaign and a second term.  He paints his predecessor as out-of-control and a threat to America, and to democracy itself. ""Here, you've got somebody who's very well known, and you're just trying to prove he's a big risk."" says Susan Estrich, a Democratic author and analyst who managed Michael Dukakis' presidential campaign in 1988. It's a rematch few Americans say they want but it's a presidential choice that at this point they seem almost certain to get. Here are four factors that will determine who comes out on top. Mr Biden's approval ratings continue to languish in dangerous territory for an incumbent entering an election year. Public perceptions of Mr Trump are also negative, however. By all indications, November's general election is going to be tight. National polls show the two candidates either neck and neck or Mr Trump with a slight advantage. But this early in the race they are of limited usefulness, given the nature of the US political map. While Americans will head to the polls across the nation, this race will once again be decided in only a handful of states. That's because the electoral college, the system the US has to pick its president, depends on candidates winning each state and most states are solidly Democratic or Republican. The most crucial states that could go either way this year include Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan in the so-called Rust Belt, and Arizona and Georgia, two states that Mr Biden flipped Democratic in 2020. Nevada is also considered a toss-up but its small population makes it a less valuable prize. A few states that have been battlegrounds in previous election cycles have slipped off this map - Florida and North Carolina have trended Republican of late, while Virginia and Colorado appear to be more solidly Democratic. So while national polls provide fodder for political commentators, a much smaller subset of voters will ultimately be the ones who matter. Polling showing Mr Trump inching ahead in these key states have caused alarm among some Democrats, but the size of his lead is not statistically significant. When it comes down to it, Americans tend to vote from their wallets in national elections - for the governing party in good times and the opposition in bad. ""It's the economy, stupid"" was the mantra of Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign, and the refrain has become political gospel in the decades since. One of the factors that makes 2024 challenging to predict is that, on the whole, economic indicators are positive.  If you're in the UK, sign up here. And if you're anywhere else, sign up here. The economy is growing at a steady clip. Unemployment is near record lows. The stock market is hitting record highs. And yet American voters continue to have a grim view of their economic situation. Some of this can be attributed to several years of high inflation and the continuing high cost of housing in many parts of the US. Home sales in the US have sunk to the lowest levels in nearly 30 years. At the Trump victory party in Iowa, two large video screens cycled through graphics showing how rising home mortgage interest rates during the Biden administration have driven up monthly home payments. There are some recent signs of hope for Mr Biden, however.  In March consumer confidence, as measured by a University of Michigan survey, reached its highest level since July 2021. Inflation and gas prices have fallen well below their recent highs. There is still plenty of time for voters to change their minds about the state of the American economy. Mr Trump will argue that things were better when he was in office.  According to Mr Spicer, the economy - like crime - is a ""gut"" issue and many Americans still don't believe their everyday situation has improved. ""Until you viscerally feel it,"" he says, ""it doesn't matter what statistic gets thrown at you."" Mr Biden will counter that the US weathered the post-Covid economic storm better than almost any other country in the world and that Bidenomics - his blend of infrastructure investment, tax cuts and social spending - has improved the lot of working Americans. The Biden campaign will try to convince voters that Mr Trump is responsible for abortion becoming illegal or greatly curtailed in dozens of states, even as the former president has tried to moderate his position on the issue. Ever since the US Supreme Court, with the help of three Trump-appointed justices, discarded a 50-year precedent giving the right to abortion constitutional protections, Democrats have been riding a groundswell of support on the issue to post better-than-expected results at the ballot box. Mr Biden has pointed to state court decisions approving stringent new abortion restrictions in Florida and Arizona, along with upcoming voter referendums on the subject, to encourage liberal voters head to the polls in November. Vice-President Kamala Harris has held rallies across the country focusing on women's reproductive rights. ""Abortion has turned out to be a much more powerful issue than a lot of people thought it would be,"" Ms Estrich says. ""Everywhere it's been on the ballot, the pro-choice position has won."" If abortion is the electoral issue the Democrats will be trying to elevate in the minds of voters, Mr Trump and the conservatives will be doing the same for immigration.  Border crossings reached an all-time high in December with 249,785 arrests on the Mexican border - up 31% from November and up 13% from December 2022, the previous record. They have been falling in recent months. This massive influx of undocumented migrants and asylum-seekers has at times overwhelmed government processing facilities and strained social service programmes in major cities thousands of miles away.  Polls show that immigration is the top issue for much of Mr Trump's base - and a source of weakness for the president and division among Democrats.  Efforts to address the problem in Congress have proven unsuccessful, in no small part because Mr Trump has been pressuring Republicans to block compromise legislation until after the election. ""The Biden administration has lost the argument on safety and security at our southern border,"" says Mr Spicer. ""It's over."" Other issues might also play a factor in the upcoming presidential race, including US crime rates, the environment and climate change, and foreign policy.  The Gaza War, in particular, might be an ongoing headache for Mr Biden, as the administration's support for Israel has angered some Democrats, including a larger percentage of the young voters whose turnout in November could decide the election. The longest general election campaign in recent memory leaves plenty of time for the unpredictable to occur. Given the advanced age of both Mr Biden (81) and Mr Trump (77), an incident that calls into question their health and fitness could happen any time.  In the autumn presidential debates, their energy and composure under pressure will be particularly scrutinised. ""Age is hurting Biden right now. Everybody thinks Biden is old,"" say Ms Estrich. ""The question is, will Trump show the signs of his age?"" Given that polls indicate a majority of Americans are dissatisfied with their two major-party options, the environment is ripe for a third-party or independent candidate to emerge.  Robert Kennedy Jr, the anti-vaccine activist, is polling in double-digits nationally, although he is only on a handful of ballots so far. Left-wing academic Cornel West is also running, and the Libertarian and Green parties will field their own candidates. Mr Trump's legal headaches could also factor into the race - he faces 91 charges and four criminal trials. Although the indictments seem to have buoyed his standing among Republicans, a criminal conviction may be a different matter. According to an exit poll of voters in the New Hampshire Republican primary, 42% said Mr Trump would not be fit for office if he were found guilty. Polls of voters in other Republican primaries have produced similar results. Although several of Mr Trump's highest-profile trials have been repeatedly delayed, the spectacle of Mr Trump in the defendant's dock and a detailed litigation of his alleged crimes could affect public opinion in a way that the indictments have not. The January 2021 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters, with Mr Trump accused of egging them on, has left a scar on the American psyche.  While Republican voters appear willing to move past it, Democrats - and, perhaps, the kind of independent voters who will help decide this election - still remember. The more they are reminded of that trauma, and the way the first Trump presidency ended - whether by Mr Biden and the Democrats or through courtroom drama - the more the former president's past actions may ultimately come back to haunt him."
economic indicators,Modi Mania defines India's optimism,2024-09-15,2015-01-11,Simon Atkinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30772884,"This video can not be played The BBC's Sameer Hashmi reports from Vibrant Gujarat 2015 Stalls selling clothes don't usually feature at conferences dedicated to foreign investment.  At Vibrant Gujarat 2015 they have made an exception though - shoppers can choose between just two items: a collarless jacket or a collarless shirt, traditional garments popularised by the fashion tastes of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Take home the original souvenir,"" says the sign above a photo of the ""Modi Jacket"". ""Made in India, loved by the world."" The conference plays unashamedly on Mr Modi's popularity both with business leaders and more widely in Gujarat, the state where he was chief minister for 13 years. His face looms from almost every billboard, while another stall lets visitors take a virtual ""selfie"" with the Prime Minister.  Delegates stand in line for a virtual ""selfie"" with India's prime minister The official photos will be a touch more formal - with A-list guests including US Secretary of State John Kerry, heads of the United Nations and World Bank and dozens of government ministers and global chief executives. And while the event is billed as attracting investment to Gujarat, Mr Modi's speech, a rare one in English, was pushing the message that India as a whole is open for business. ""We have a large number of hands to work and, we have even larger number of dreams to be realised,"" he said. Tens of billions of dollars were committed by Indian firms on the first day of the conference, though observers said these events had a history of pledges that were never followed through.  A $1.5bn (£987m) UK investment in a new power plant was one of the few solid foreign investments unveiled. And UK Trade Minister Lord Livingston told the BBC that Mr Modi was a big factor in that investment. ""What he wants to do is bring that degree of pro-business friendly environment to India. I certainly see among Indian and UK businessmen excitement and possibilities. And we are starting to see some changes and I think we expect a lot more on the way."" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pushing the message that India is open for business A film played to the thousands of delegates highlighted policy decisions taken by the government since coming to power, from raising the foreign direct investment levels for insurance, defence and railways, to overhauling labour laws.  But some say more real action is needed on the ground, with delays in approving projects still a big issue according to Edward Monser, president of US manufacturing and technology firm Emerson.  ""We look at a great backlog of identified projects,"" he told the BBC . ""The faster they can get that approved, the faster the economy can grow."" The economy was at the heart of Mr Modi's election campaign last year, with a pledge that he could do for India what he had managed in his home state.  But opponents say Gujarat failed to outperform several other states. Others argue it fared less well on social indicators, including malnutrition and literacy rates.  And while World Bank President Jim Yong Kim used his speech at the summit to describe India as ""a bright spot in an otherwise mediocre global economic outlook"", he also pointed to changes needed if growth is to benefit more people. Critics say the Indian government has done little for the poor ""The Indian society has an enduring exclusion that is based, among other things, on caste identities,"" he said. ""This bias can impede shared prosperity, serving as a basis for discrimination in many spheres."" It was a sentiment shared by some locals outside the conference centre too. Waiting in line for a rickshaw, a middle-aged woman complained to my colleague that the state government had spent heavily on the summit, while doing little for the poor. Cooking gas prices had doubled, she said. And a new policy giving her a bank account meant she was spending money travelling to the nearest branch to withdraw cash. Mr Modi has arguably won over Indian business and is showing signs of doing the same with would-be investors, but convincing many of his own people to believe in his vision could be a much trickier task.

economic indicators,Retail sales fall at sharpest rate since Covid,2024-09-15,2024-01-19,By Dearbail Jordan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68027820,"Retail sales volumes fell by 3.2% in December in the sharpest drop since the UK was in a Covid lockdown. Official figures revealed a sharp fall in demand for goods, but food sales also declined in the run-up to Christmas. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said it appeared people did their shopping earlier in November, taking advantage of Black Friday sales. It meant that retail sales tumbled at the fastest rate since January 2021.  The ONS said the amount of non-food products people bought in December fell by 3.9%, with department stores the worst hit. That compares to a 2.7% increase for non-food products in November. Food demand was also down at the end of the year, falling 3.1%. In November, food sales rose by 1.1%. Lisa Hooker from PwC said there were ""fewer large family gatherings reducing the number of gifts being bought overall"". She added that people ""reined back on areas such as toys, sports equipment, watches and jewellery,"" but said fashion was ""one of the least affected categories"". Heather Bovill, deputy director for surveys and economic indicators at the ONS, said December's fall in retail sales was ""the largest overall monthly fall since January 2021, when the reintroduction of pandemic restrictions knocked sales heavily"". While she said that discounting in November encouraged people to shop earlier for Christmas, there was also evidence from department stores, clothing retailers and those selling household goods that consumers spent less on gifts. While the fall was the biggest since January 2021, when further Covid restrictions were enforced, the actual volume of goods that people bought in December was the lowest since May 2020 when the country was in the first Covid lockdown.  Supermarkets have been reporting strong sales over the Christmas period, although the value of their sales has been helped by rising prices over the past year. For non-food stores the pattern has been mixed. Fashion chain Next enjoyed strong sales, but JD Sports issued a profit warning after its trading was weaker then expected. Specialist wine outlet Majestic said it had seen record sales in the run-up to Christmas, helped by a rebound in its trade with the hospitality sector. However, chairman and chief executive John Colley told the BBC's Today programme that, overall, consumers were still reeling from the high food prices seen over the previous 12 months.  ""I think we've still got fallout from inflation... and I think consumers are still feeling the pinch and I don't think that's over, even now."" Earlier this month, the British Retail Consortium predicted a ""challenging"" year ahead for the sector with household budgets still being squeezed by higher living costs. The worse-than-expected retail sales also raise the risk that the UK ended 2023 in ""the mildest of mild recessions"", according to Alex Kerr, assistant economist at Capital Economics. A recession is typically defined as two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row of shrinking economic output.  The UK economy shrank by 0.1% between July and September. It contracted again in October but bounced back in November. Mr Kerr said that even factoring in the effect of Black Friday sales on shopping, December's drop was ""far bigger"" than expected. ""That may have been partly because of consumers bringing forward their Christmas purchases into November,"" he said. ""But it was also because the drags from the cost-of-living crisis and sharp rise in interest rates are still weighing on real incomes and consumer spending.""  Inflation, which measures the rate at which prices are rising, has fallen sharply since the highs reached in October 2022. However, the most recent inflation figures showed that the rate edged up to 4% in December against widespread expectations that it would continue to fall. Economists and financial markets had forecast that the Bank of England would cut interest rates this year, possibly in the spring. However, the recent inflation figures suggest that a cut may not be made until June. Interest rates are currently at 5.25%."
economic indicators,Health expert's fears over gambling rates,2024-09-15,2024-01-23,By Olivia Copeland & George Thorpe,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-68068875,"Health experts believe gambling rates in Guernsey may have increased because of Covid and economic challenges. Research commissioned by Public Health Services Guernsey showed 79.9% of locals gambled between 2019 and 2020. This figure is above both the Isle of Man - at 75.9 per cent - and Great Britain, which stood at 57%. However, a public health boss believes the impact of the Covid pandemic and financial issues may have now pushed Guernsey's level above 80%. The study from Liverpool John Moores University was set up in 2019 to ""assess the health impact"" gambling had on Guernsey's population and looked at a 12-month period. The report has now been published after very long delays caused by Covid, with Public Health Services using it to determine the ""pre-pandemic position"" for the island. Director of public health Dr Nicola Brink said the current level had probably increased four years after the initial research took place. Dr Brink said: ""It is my view that pandemic pressures and the ongoing economic challenges that have followed are likely, if anything, to have worsened or exacerbated the trends that were detected in 2019/2020. ""Hence, we can think of the findings as the minimum extent of the issues affecting Guernsey residents in 2024 and beyond."" The research showed the Channel Islands Christmas Lottery was the most popular activity with 67.5% participating, including some below the legal age limit of 18. Buying scratch cards was the second highest activity with 46.3% purchasing one, compared to 29.3% in the Isle of Man and 21% across Great Britain. The research also found those who gambled had a significantly higher risk of poor health indicators such as obesity, smoking or violence. Follow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

economic indicators,Retail sales fall at sharpest rate since Covid,2024-09-15,2024-01-19,By Dearbail Jordan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68027820,"Retail sales volumes fell by 3.2% in December in the sharpest drop since the UK was in a Covid lockdown. Official figures revealed a sharp fall in demand for goods, but food sales also declined in the run-up to Christmas. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said it appeared people did their shopping earlier in November, taking advantage of Black Friday sales. It meant that retail sales tumbled at the fastest rate since January 2021.  The ONS said the amount of non-food products people bought in December fell by 3.9%, with department stores the worst hit. That compares to a 2.7% increase for non-food products in November. Food demand was also down at the end of the year, falling 3.1%. In November, food sales rose by 1.1%. Lisa Hooker from PwC said there were ""fewer large family gatherings reducing the number of gifts being bought overall"". She added that people ""reined back on areas such as toys, sports equipment, watches and jewellery,"" but said fashion was ""one of the least affected categories"". Heather Bovill, deputy director for surveys and economic indicators at the ONS, said December's fall in retail sales was ""the largest overall monthly fall since January 2021, when the reintroduction of pandemic restrictions knocked sales heavily"". While she said that discounting in November encouraged people to shop earlier for Christmas, there was also evidence from department stores, clothing retailers and those selling household goods that consumers spent less on gifts. While the fall was the biggest since January 2021, when further Covid restrictions were enforced, the actual volume of goods that people bought in December was the lowest since May 2020 when the country was in the first Covid lockdown.  Supermarkets have been reporting strong sales over the Christmas period, although the value of their sales has been helped by rising prices over the past year. For non-food stores the pattern has been mixed. Fashion chain Next enjoyed strong sales, but JD Sports issued a profit warning after its trading was weaker then expected. Specialist wine outlet Majestic said it had seen record sales in the run-up to Christmas, helped by a rebound in its trade with the hospitality sector. However, chairman and chief executive John Colley told the BBC's Today programme that, overall, consumers were still reeling from the high food prices seen over the previous 12 months.  ""I think we've still got fallout from inflation... and I think consumers are still feeling the pinch and I don't think that's over, even now."" Earlier this month, the British Retail Consortium predicted a ""challenging"" year ahead for the sector with household budgets still being squeezed by higher living costs. The worse-than-expected retail sales also raise the risk that the UK ended 2023 in ""the mildest of mild recessions"", according to Alex Kerr, assistant economist at Capital Economics. A recession is typically defined as two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row of shrinking economic output.  The UK economy shrank by 0.1% between July and September. It contracted again in October but bounced back in November. Mr Kerr said that even factoring in the effect of Black Friday sales on shopping, December's drop was ""far bigger"" than expected. ""That may have been partly because of consumers bringing forward their Christmas purchases into November,"" he said. ""But it was also because the drags from the cost-of-living crisis and sharp rise in interest rates are still weighing on real incomes and consumer spending.""  Inflation, which measures the rate at which prices are rising, has fallen sharply since the highs reached in October 2022. However, the most recent inflation figures showed that the rate edged up to 4% in December against widespread expectations that it would continue to fall. Economists and financial markets had forecast that the Bank of England would cut interest rates this year, possibly in the spring. However, the recent inflation figures suggest that a cut may not be made until June. Interest rates are currently at 5.25%."
economic indicators,EU and China rebuff Trump on climate,2024-09-15,2017-05-31,By Matt McGrath,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40106281,"Chinese and EU leaders are to agree a joint statement on the Paris climate agreement saying it is ""an imperative more important than ever"". A draft of the document, seen by the BBC, stresses the ""highest political commitment"" to implement the deal. It will be widely seen as a rebuff to the US, as President Trump prepares to announce on Thursday if the US is withdrawing from the accord.  The joint statement will be published on Friday after a summit in Brussels.  For more than a year, Chinese and EU officials have been working behind the scenes to agree a joint statement on climate change and clean energy. The document highlights the dangers posed by rising temperatures, ""as a national security issue and multiplying factor of social and political fragility,"" while pointing out that the transition to clean energy creates jobs and economic growth.  ""The EU and China consider the Paris agreement as an historic achievement further accelerating the irreversible global low greenhouse gas emission and climate resilient development,"" the draft document says.  ""The Paris Agreement is proof that with shared political will and mutual trust, multilateralism can succeed in building fair and effective solutions to the most critical global problems of our time. The EU and China underline their highest political commitment to the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement in all its aspects."" Both sides say they will step up action to and ""forge ahead with further policies and measures"" to implement their national plans on cutting carbon. Significantly, both the EU and China agree that they will outline their long term low carbon strategies by 2020. The document outlines other areas of co-operation including on the development and linking of carbon markets. There will also be bilateral work on energy labelling, energy performance standards and the performance standards of buildings.  ""The EU and China are joining forces to forge ahead on the implementation of the Paris agreement and accelerate the global transition to clean energy,"" said EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete. ""No one should be left behind, but the EU and China have decided to move forward."" Climate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect of gases, or emissions, released from industry and agriculture on the atmosphere.       The Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions.   Countries agreed to: To date, 147 out of the 197 countries have ratified the accord, including the US, where the accord entered into force last November. Exxon shareholders back 'historic' vote on climate Antarctic ice crack takes major turn  The increased co-operation between the EU and China comes as reports indicate a further cooling in the US towards the Paris accord.  Several sources, quoted by US media, suggest that President Trump is set to pull out. The president himself tweeted he would make his announcement at 15:00 (19:00 GMT) on Thursday.  This comes after the President failed to find common ground with other global leaders at G7 summit in Taormina, Sicily. In the wake of that meeting, German Chancellor Angela Merkel vented her frustration with the US position. ""The entire discussion about climate was very difficult, if not to say very dissatisfying,"" she told reporters. ""There are no indications whether the United States will stay in the Paris Agreement or not."" The new move by the EU and China was warmly welcomed by environmental campaigners, rattled by the prospect of the world's second largest emitter of carbon pulling out of the globally supported agreement. ""If US-China climate cooperation gave birth to the Paris Agreement, now it is up to EU and China to defend and enhance it,"" said Li Shuo, from Greenpeace.

economic indicators,Chinese millennials: Skipping Lunar New Year trips,2024-09-15,2024-02-05,Owen Guo,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240202-the-chinese-millennials-shunning-lunar-new-year-travel,"Following a long-held tradition, many Chinese people travel great distances for the Spring Festival. But millennials are increasingly bucking the trend, making their own plans. For Lunar New Year on 10 February, Cassidy Yu has opted for a road trip with a friend instead of a family reunion. This won't be her first time skipping the trek home. ""Heading home for the occasion doesn't get me excited anymore,"" says Yu, a 32-year-old marketing professional from Shenzhen, a city in southern China. As a child, she relished simple rituals of the Lunar New Year: home decorations, firecrackers and feast after feast. Not anymore. ""With so many entertainment options available today, I'd rather travel and have a quieter holiday.""  Like Christmas, Lunar New Year is a time for family reunions. People traditionally gather for a big dinner on the night of the New Year's Eve, followed by visits to relatives' homes during the week-long holiday.  It sets off the world's biggest human migration, as millions return to their home villages and cities, where a labyrinth of celebrations, rooted in centuries-old regional traditions, awaits. One tradition is known as Chunyun, a 40-day period when billions of trips take place. Some experts estimate the 2024 season will bring record amount of movement, spurred by the lifting of the Covid-19 restrictions of the past several years. Yu is part of a growing number of young Chinese millennials who are making alternative plans and approaching the Spring Festival with a shrug. Changing family dynamics, new lifestyles and economic pressure have upended some holiday traditions – and many young Chinese are minting their own celebrations. Numbering 400 million, Chinese millennials mostly came of age during China's boom years of the 2000s. And this generation – many of whom are college educated and the only children in their family – doesn't always hew to old playbooks as they forgo traditional values upheld by their parents. That can come to a head during the Spring Festival, as the Lunar New Year is often called in China. A result is some millennials view the festival as just an extended vacation that doesn't have to involve family gatherings. On Mafengwo, a Chinese travel website, a user asked: is solo travel during the Spring Festival tantamount to being unfilial? Most respondents said no. The post garnered more than one-million views and more than 6,000 answers. ""Travelling is more fun than feeling just bored at home during the Lunar New Year, isn't it?"" the user wrote after posing the question.  Millennials' trepidation towards the festival partly stems from fraying familial ties, says Hu Xiaowu, an associate professor at Nanjing University in eastern China, who studies urban issues. ""The independent streak of young people as a result of urbanisation and social mobility has fractured family relations,"" he says. ""Traditional family ties in China de-emphasise personal boundaries, which can be manifested through excessive concern and overbearing behaviour from the elders. That's partly why young people dread the Spring Festival."" The Chinese media has coined a term for this feeling of apprehension: kongguizu. Many Chinese millennials, in pursuit of better opportunities, have left their hometowns for big cities. An individualistic lifestyle, coupled with the stress of living in big cities, often leave them with little time – or appetite – to talk to their families, says Hu. According to a survey Hu conducted in 2022, younger people between 18 and 30 years old interacted with relatives less frequently than their older peers. Most respondents born after 1990, the survey showed, only interacted with their relatives ""occasionally"". One reason Yu especially wants to avoid family and even neighbours this year is because she is single. Her family is always eager to play matchmaker, she says, and the prying can get particularly intense during the Spring Festival. No questions are too private. ""They want to know what you do and how much you make. If you get married, they will ask when you plan to have babies,"" she says. ""Imagine being interrogated by a spy agency."" A slowing economy isn't helping. In recent years, companies have laid off workers and cut benefits. Even for those who are working, underemployment is widespread. Stocks have tumbled. And the housing market, to which nearly three-quarters of Chinese household wealth is tied, is in turmoil.   Bill Bishop, who writes the China-focused newsletter Sinocism, expects a mixed mood for the festival this year. ""This is the first new year holiday since 2019 that doesn't have Covid hanging over it,"" he says. ""On the other hand, how many people are going to be talking about how much money they have lost in the stock market or have lost their jobs or had salaries and benefits reduced, or know people who have?"" On Zhihu, a Quora-like Q&A platform in China, users have posted their reasons for not going home for the Lunar New Year in 2024. One wrote simply, ""No money"". ""For some people, the idea of setting aside 3,000 yuan (£330; $432) to go home to see family, after you take into account train tickets, clothing and gifts, can be an economic burden,"" says Zak Dychtwald, founder of Young China Group, a market insights and management consulting firm. ""And you want to return home triumphantly, rather than with your tail between your legs."" Not every young millennial is avoiding the trip home – yet they aren't all travelling with open arms.  Yu Meiling, a 29-year-old freelance product manager in the eastern city of Hangzhou, will return to her ancestral village with her husband. She is doing the usual, time-consuming preparations: stuffing red envelopes with 1,000 yuan (£110; $140) each for her mum, dad and younger sister. The couple will also buy wine and cigarettes as gifts to other relatives, as per tradition. Yet expectations – and financial burdens – are weighing on her this year. She feels intensified pressure to uphold mianzi, a Chinese concept of saving face for social prestige and standing. In Yu's world, that could be exhibited through the gifts one brings or even the attire one chooses to wear. To elevate mianzi, the couple will drive home this year in a new car they recently purchased. ""In the past, gifts we bought were pretty much the same during the Lunar New Year. Things were simpler because everyone's living standard was more or less the same. Now with a wider wealth gap, we constantly compare ourselves to others when we go home for the festival,"" she says. ""I don't particularly like the Spring Festival. But I'm going home this year with my husband because I want to give my parents face.""  Whether young people like Yu Meiling are finding their way back home, or seeking the open road like Cassidy Yu, the Lunar New Year is looking increasingly different."
economic indicators,Modi Mania defines India's optimism,2024-09-15,2015-01-11,Simon Atkinson,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30772884,"This video can not be played The BBC's Sameer Hashmi reports from Vibrant Gujarat 2015 Stalls selling clothes don't usually feature at conferences dedicated to foreign investment.  At Vibrant Gujarat 2015 they have made an exception though - shoppers can choose between just two items: a collarless jacket or a collarless shirt, traditional garments popularised by the fashion tastes of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Take home the original souvenir,"" says the sign above a photo of the ""Modi Jacket"". ""Made in India, loved by the world."" The conference plays unashamedly on Mr Modi's popularity both with business leaders and more widely in Gujarat, the state where he was chief minister for 13 years. His face looms from almost every billboard, while another stall lets visitors take a virtual ""selfie"" with the Prime Minister.  Delegates stand in line for a virtual ""selfie"" with India's prime minister The official photos will be a touch more formal - with A-list guests including US Secretary of State John Kerry, heads of the United Nations and World Bank and dozens of government ministers and global chief executives. And while the event is billed as attracting investment to Gujarat, Mr Modi's speech, a rare one in English, was pushing the message that India as a whole is open for business. ""We have a large number of hands to work and, we have even larger number of dreams to be realised,"" he said. Tens of billions of dollars were committed by Indian firms on the first day of the conference, though observers said these events had a history of pledges that were never followed through.  A $1.5bn (£987m) UK investment in a new power plant was one of the few solid foreign investments unveiled. And UK Trade Minister Lord Livingston told the BBC that Mr Modi was a big factor in that investment. ""What he wants to do is bring that degree of pro-business friendly environment to India. I certainly see among Indian and UK businessmen excitement and possibilities. And we are starting to see some changes and I think we expect a lot more on the way."" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pushing the message that India is open for business A film played to the thousands of delegates highlighted policy decisions taken by the government since coming to power, from raising the foreign direct investment levels for insurance, defence and railways, to overhauling labour laws.  But some say more real action is needed on the ground, with delays in approving projects still a big issue according to Edward Monser, president of US manufacturing and technology firm Emerson.  ""We look at a great backlog of identified projects,"" he told the BBC . ""The faster they can get that approved, the faster the economy can grow."" The economy was at the heart of Mr Modi's election campaign last year, with a pledge that he could do for India what he had managed in his home state.  But opponents say Gujarat failed to outperform several other states. Others argue it fared less well on social indicators, including malnutrition and literacy rates.  And while World Bank President Jim Yong Kim used his speech at the summit to describe India as ""a bright spot in an otherwise mediocre global economic outlook"", he also pointed to changes needed if growth is to benefit more people. Critics say the Indian government has done little for the poor ""The Indian society has an enduring exclusion that is based, among other things, on caste identities,"" he said. ""This bias can impede shared prosperity, serving as a basis for discrimination in many spheres."" It was a sentiment shared by some locals outside the conference centre too. Waiting in line for a rickshaw, a middle-aged woman complained to my colleague that the state government had spent heavily on the summit, while doing little for the poor. Cooking gas prices had doubled, she said. And a new policy giving her a bank account meant she was spending money travelling to the nearest branch to withdraw cash. Mr Modi has arguably won over Indian business and is showing signs of doing the same with would-be investors, but convincing many of his own people to believe in his vision could be a much trickier task.

economic indicators,Four things that could decide who wins US election,2024-09-15,2024-01-31,By Anthony Zurcher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68146241,"Donald Trump and Joe Biden will do battle in November to determine who occupies the White House for the next four years. This contest will be unique in modern history as a rematch between the current president and his immediate predecessor. The contrast will be simple, according to Sean Spicer, who served as Mr Trump's first press secretary and worked for the Republican National Committee prior to that. ""For those people who say, well, during Trump, the policies of Donald Trump made my life better, more secure, made the economy and our communities better, it's a no brainer."" The Trump campaign will be hoping to distract from the weaknesses of their candidate - his legal troubles, his divisive rhetoric and his attempts to undermine the 2020 election results, which contributed to the January 2021 attack on the US Capitol. But Mr Biden also has key vulnerabilities, struggling to sell his first-term achievements and trying to convince the public he has the energy for the campaign and a second term.  He paints his predecessor as out-of-control and a threat to America, and to democracy itself. ""Here, you've got somebody who's very well known, and you're just trying to prove he's a big risk."" says Susan Estrich, a Democratic author and analyst who managed Michael Dukakis' presidential campaign in 1988. It's a rematch few Americans say they want but it's a presidential choice that at this point they seem almost certain to get. Here are four factors that will determine who comes out on top. Mr Biden's approval ratings continue to languish in dangerous territory for an incumbent entering an election year. Public perceptions of Mr Trump are also negative, however. By all indications, November's general election is going to be tight. National polls show the two candidates either neck and neck or Mr Trump with a slight advantage. But this early in the race they are of limited usefulness, given the nature of the US political map. While Americans will head to the polls across the nation, this race will once again be decided in only a handful of states. That's because the electoral college, the system the US has to pick its president, depends on candidates winning each state and most states are solidly Democratic or Republican. The most crucial states that could go either way this year include Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan in the so-called Rust Belt, and Arizona and Georgia, two states that Mr Biden flipped Democratic in 2020. Nevada is also considered a toss-up but its small population makes it a less valuable prize. A few states that have been battlegrounds in previous election cycles have slipped off this map - Florida and North Carolina have trended Republican of late, while Virginia and Colorado appear to be more solidly Democratic. So while national polls provide fodder for political commentators, a much smaller subset of voters will ultimately be the ones who matter. Polling showing Mr Trump inching ahead in these key states have caused alarm among some Democrats, but the size of his lead is not statistically significant. When it comes down to it, Americans tend to vote from their wallets in national elections - for the governing party in good times and the opposition in bad. ""It's the economy, stupid"" was the mantra of Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign, and the refrain has become political gospel in the decades since. One of the factors that makes 2024 challenging to predict is that, on the whole, economic indicators are positive.  If you're in the UK, sign up here. And if you're anywhere else, sign up here. The economy is growing at a steady clip. Unemployment is near record lows. The stock market is hitting record highs. And yet American voters continue to have a grim view of their economic situation. Some of this can be attributed to several years of high inflation and the continuing high cost of housing in many parts of the US. Home sales in the US have sunk to the lowest levels in nearly 30 years. At the Trump victory party in Iowa, two large video screens cycled through graphics showing how rising home mortgage interest rates during the Biden administration have driven up monthly home payments. There are some recent signs of hope for Mr Biden, however.  In March consumer confidence, as measured by a University of Michigan survey, reached its highest level since July 2021. Inflation and gas prices have fallen well below their recent highs. There is still plenty of time for voters to change their minds about the state of the American economy. Mr Trump will argue that things were better when he was in office.  According to Mr Spicer, the economy - like crime - is a ""gut"" issue and many Americans still don't believe their everyday situation has improved. ""Until you viscerally feel it,"" he says, ""it doesn't matter what statistic gets thrown at you."" Mr Biden will counter that the US weathered the post-Covid economic storm better than almost any other country in the world and that Bidenomics - his blend of infrastructure investment, tax cuts and social spending - has improved the lot of working Americans. The Biden campaign will try to convince voters that Mr Trump is responsible for abortion becoming illegal or greatly curtailed in dozens of states, even as the former president has tried to moderate his position on the issue. Ever since the US Supreme Court, with the help of three Trump-appointed justices, discarded a 50-year precedent giving the right to abortion constitutional protections, Democrats have been riding a groundswell of support on the issue to post better-than-expected results at the ballot box. Mr Biden has pointed to state court decisions approving stringent new abortion restrictions in Florida and Arizona, along with upcoming voter referendums on the subject, to encourage liberal voters head to the polls in November. Vice-President Kamala Harris has held rallies across the country focusing on women's reproductive rights. ""Abortion has turned out to be a much more powerful issue than a lot of people thought it would be,"" Ms Estrich says. ""Everywhere it's been on the ballot, the pro-choice position has won."" If abortion is the electoral issue the Democrats will be trying to elevate in the minds of voters, Mr Trump and the conservatives will be doing the same for immigration.  Border crossings reached an all-time high in December with 249,785 arrests on the Mexican border - up 31% from November and up 13% from December 2022, the previous record. They have been falling in recent months. This massive influx of undocumented migrants and asylum-seekers has at times overwhelmed government processing facilities and strained social service programmes in major cities thousands of miles away.  Polls show that immigration is the top issue for much of Mr Trump's base - and a source of weakness for the president and division among Democrats.  Efforts to address the problem in Congress have proven unsuccessful, in no small part because Mr Trump has been pressuring Republicans to block compromise legislation until after the election. ""The Biden administration has lost the argument on safety and security at our southern border,"" says Mr Spicer. ""It's over."" Other issues might also play a factor in the upcoming presidential race, including US crime rates, the environment and climate change, and foreign policy.  The Gaza War, in particular, might be an ongoing headache for Mr Biden, as the administration's support for Israel has angered some Democrats, including a larger percentage of the young voters whose turnout in November could decide the election. The longest general election campaign in recent memory leaves plenty of time for the unpredictable to occur. Given the advanced age of both Mr Biden (81) and Mr Trump (77), an incident that calls into question their health and fitness could happen any time.  In the autumn presidential debates, their energy and composure under pressure will be particularly scrutinised. ""Age is hurting Biden right now. Everybody thinks Biden is old,"" say Ms Estrich. ""The question is, will Trump show the signs of his age?"" Given that polls indicate a majority of Americans are dissatisfied with their two major-party options, the environment is ripe for a third-party or independent candidate to emerge.  Robert Kennedy Jr, the anti-vaccine activist, is polling in double-digits nationally, although he is only on a handful of ballots so far. Left-wing academic Cornel West is also running, and the Libertarian and Green parties will field their own candidates. Mr Trump's legal headaches could also factor into the race - he faces 91 charges and four criminal trials. Although the indictments seem to have buoyed his standing among Republicans, a criminal conviction may be a different matter. According to an exit poll of voters in the New Hampshire Republican primary, 42% said Mr Trump would not be fit for office if he were found guilty. Polls of voters in other Republican primaries have produced similar results. Although several of Mr Trump's highest-profile trials have been repeatedly delayed, the spectacle of Mr Trump in the defendant's dock and a detailed litigation of his alleged crimes could affect public opinion in a way that the indictments have not. The January 2021 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters, with Mr Trump accused of egging them on, has left a scar on the American psyche.  While Republican voters appear willing to move past it, Democrats - and, perhaps, the kind of independent voters who will help decide this election - still remember. The more they are reminded of that trauma, and the way the first Trump presidency ended - whether by Mr Biden and the Democrats or through courtroom drama - the more the former president's past actions may ultimately come back to haunt him."
economic indicators,North Korea's surge of friendly visitors,2024-09-15,2018-04-17,By Alistair  Coleman,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43781981,"Ever since the secretive trip to Pyongyang by two South Korean officials that opened the way for a dialogue with the US, North Korea has seen a flurry of friendly visits.  Art troupes, an arts festival and diplomats seeking to warm ties have streamed to Pyongyang and North Korean state media is taking full advantage with fulsome coverage.  There is little doubt that this is part of a continuing campaign to seize the narrative on the Korean peninsula and burnish Pyongyang and Kim Jong-un's image ahead of two crucial summits with South Korea and the US. But who is it really aimed at?   China remains North Korea's most significant trading partner and economic supporter, always opposing the harshest of sanctions for its smaller neighbour. But as Pyongyang accelerated testing of missiles and nuclear devices, its frustration was beginning to show.   That changed when Kim Jong-un took a slow train to Beijing for his first ever meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping last month. The latest manifestation of this slow but steady mending of ties between the neighbours was the weekend visit by a Chinese artistic delegation led by senior official Song Tao, the head of the Communist Party's International Liaison Department. On Sunday, North Korea's state-run Central Television showed Kim Jong-un greeting the delegation and meeting the Chinese envoy in a hall decorated with a huge portrait of Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Inside the train Kim travelled to China in Why Xi's still the one Kim needs to see The political gamble of the 21st Century North Korean TV's famous ""lady in pink"", senior newscaster Ri Chun-hee, generally brought out for more significant bulletins, came forth to praise a ""new era"" of relations between the two countries. Mr Kim went on to host a ""grand"" banquet for the visiting Chinese delegation, where toasts were made to the ""steadfast will of the two parties and two peoples, to more beautifully decorate the flower garden of the DPRK-China friendship"".  There, another enormous image of Xi Jinping looked down from the stage.  It's a signal to China as much as it is to the world and those North Koreans with access to this media that the old alliance is certainly not fractured.  This has also provided an opportunity for a solo engagement for Mr Kim's wife, the ""respected Madame Ri Sol-ju"" who was shown  greeting China's Mr Song at the theatre, and enjoying a performance of 'Giselle' by the National Ballet of China. It's the first time that Mrs Ri has been seen in North Korean media without her husband and she was presented as the ""First Lady of DPRK"" (Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name) for the first time. She had only previously been presented as ""Comrade"", South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper says. With KCNA news agency filing the report under ""Supreme Leader's Activities"", this is an indicator of the greater role both she and the leader's sister Kim Yo-jong are playing in North Korea's PR initiatives.  South Korea was the first to send over a cultural troupe when in early April several star acts performed in Pyongyang. Among them was K-pop band Red Velvet, known for their upbeat electronica and Mr Kim addressed rumours that he was a secret fan in comments quoted in a pool report at the time.  Kim watches K-pop idols in peace concert The South Korean rock band returning to perform in Pyongyang ""There had been interest in whether I would come and see Red Velvet. I had initially planned to attend a performance the day after tomorrow but I came here today after adjusting my schedule ""I thank you for this kind of gift to Pyongyang citizens."" A Red Velvet band member's subsequent comment that it was an ""honour"" to meet Mr Kim divided many in South Korea, with some accusing her of humanising a reckless leader.  For some critics, the comments by Mr Kim were little short of a careful and canny exercise in soft power and humanising an unreadable figure at a critical moment.  The first two weeks of April also saw Pyongyang's first international singing contest, with artists visiting from Kazakhstan, Armenia and Mongolia.  It was won, hardly surprisingly, by a North Korean singer. But it marks a clear-cut offensive on the part of state media to present Pyongyang as an international cultural destination.  In that vein, the recent Spring Friendship Art Festival featured performers from Bulgaria, Russia and Laos, alongside a Singapore-based stage magician called Mr Bottle. This was a performance deemed important enough to clear Central TV's early evening schedule on 16 April. As a contrast last week's annual Pyongyang marathon was not given as much domestic coverage as in previous years.  While official reports noted the presence of sport minister Choe Hwi and competitors from around the world, the number of foreigners taking part was less than half of last year's race.  One company organising tours to the race said that people were still travelling despite government warnings against going to North Korea, following the death of American student Otto Warmbier last year and the country's poor human rights record.  But North Korean state media have made sure that foreign tourists are still visible, with state television airing English-language interviews with visitors to Pyongyang's Juche Tower on the occasion of Day of the Sun, the birthday of state founder Kim Il-sung.  It's been an unprecedented few weeks for North Korea's relations with the world but the glowing narrative of star-struck audiences and smiling performances are no accident.

economic indicators,Almost a quarter of NI children living in poverty,2024-09-15,2024-03-27,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-68664109,"The number of children living in poverty in Northern Ireland showed a significant increase in 2022, official figures suggest. They indicate that about 109,000 children or 24% were living in relative poverty, compared to 19% in 2021. Most other poverty indicators worsened, although pensioner poverty continued its long term improvement. The general increase in poverty coincided with the spike in energy prices and other costs. The figures from the Department for Communities use two main measures of living standards: relative poverty and absolute poverty. Over the past decade the percentage of children living in relative poverty in Northern Ireland has hovered at about 20%.  It reached a high of 25% in 2014 and a low of 18% in 2021. The long term trend shows that children are at a higher risk of living in poverty than the overall Northern Ireland population in both relative and absolute measures. The new figures also suggest that the percentage of pensioners living in absolute poverty fell to just 7% in 2022, down from 12% the year before. There are two main measurements of low income used by the government. Income is counted as the money a household has to spend after housing costs are taken into account.  An individual is considered to be in relative poverty if they are living in a household with an income below 60% of the typical UK income. This is a measure of whether those in the lowest income households are keeping pace with the growth of incomes in the population as a whole. In 2022 the relative poverty threshold for a couple with no children was an income, from all sources, of £373 per week, before housing costs.  For a couple with children the threshold would be higher and for a single person the threshold would be lower at £250. An individual is considered to be in absolute poverty if they are living in a household with an income below 60% of the typical UK income as measured in 2010. Figures, produced on the same basis, for the UK as a whole suggest poverty rates in Northern Ireland are better than the UK average. The rate of absolute poverty in the UK in 2022 was 18% while in Northern Ireland it was 14%. The rate of absolute child poverty in the UK was 25% while in Northern Ireland it was 19%.  In recent years Northern Ireland has generally had lower rates of poverty than the UK as a whole. That may be because Stormont introduced measures to mitigate the impact of benefit cuts imposed by the Conservative and Liberal Democrats coalition. For example the 'bedroom tax' has effectively been disapplied in Northern Ireland. "
economic indicators,Bosnian protests: A Balkan Spring?,2024-09-15,2014-02-07,Tim Judah,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26093160,"Police have condemned the protesters as ""hooligans"" For years the best description of the political situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina has been ""stagnant but stable"".  Now, with astonishing speed, analysts are already talking about a ""Bosnian Spring"".  In Tuzla, Mostar, Zenica and Sarajevo, government buildings have been set on fire and there have been demonstrations across much of the rest of the country. Hundreds have been injured, including policemen.  Politicians have condemned ""hooligans"" for the violence but many are frightened.  Pictures have gone viral of cars, allegedly belonging to politicians, which have been tipped into a canal in Zenica.  The trouble began in the northern town of Tuzla on Wednesday. Workers from several factories which were privatised and which have now gone bankrupt united to demand action over jobs, unpaid salaries and pensions.  The workers were joined by students and political activists. After they began stoning the local court, violence broke out.  Unemployment is high in Bosnia-Hercegovina Bosnia's four-year war ended in 1995, and since then there have been few protests over social issues.  Up to 2006, there was progress in making Bosnia something of a more functional state. But ever since, Bosnian politics have been in a state of utter stalemate and like the rest of the western Balkans, the country has been hit hard by years of economic crisis.  Unemployment is running at 27.5%, and none of the economic indicators point to anything like a serious recovery. Old socialist-era industries, which dominated towns like Tuzla, were often left as shells after the war. Privatisations were often corrupt, with well-connected people buying companies to strip of them of their assets to make a quick profit - before declaring them bankrupt.  For years, Bosnians have fumed about their politicians - whom they almost universally believe to be corrupt.  Tens of police officers were injured in Friday's protests But the war left people apathetic, frightened and cynical. Indeed, the war years left such deep traumas that anger about the way politicians have prospered while standards of living have declined has been suppressed out of fear of a return to conflict.  Bosnia's basic political problem is that the war left its people with a dysfunctional state.  The country is divided into two main parts. Half the country is the Serbian-dominated Republika Srpska, whose leader Milorad Dodik wants it to become an independent state.  The other half is called the Federation and is comprised of ten cantons, which are either dominated by Bosniaks (who used to be called Bosnian Muslims) or Bosnian Croats. Each canton has its own government, which is then superimposed over local, city and town councils.  Finally, one town, Brcko, is an autonomous entity.  This week's protests mark the worst unrest since the end of the Bosnian war With only some 3.8m people, it is sometimes said that what Bosnia really needs is actually just a mayor, but ethnic divisions mean it has proved impossible to change the situation.  Indeed, ever since 2009 Bosnia's leaders have been preoccupied with the so-called ""Sejdic-Finci question,"" which while important in and of itself, is of no relevance to most people, who are worried about schools, jobs and health care.  Under the terms of the Dayton peace accords, which ended the war in 1995, certain key jobs, such as being a member of the country's tripartite presidency, are reserved for Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks only.  This was successfully challenged at the European Court of Human Rights by Jakob Finci and Dervo Sejdic, who are Jewish and Roma respectively. Ever since then, European and American officials have tried everything to cajole Bosnia's leaders to adapt the constitution - but they have had no success.  However, issues such as these have sucked the air out of political debate - meaning that the economy is always neglected.  All Balkan countries, including Croatia, which joined the European Union last year, have been hit by the economic crisis and share many of the same problems.  But in Bosnia the legacies of the war mean that few even hope for change anymore. For this reason, anger has been simmering for years, but now it has boiled over.  The protests broke out in the northern town of Tuzla But will the protests actually change anything?  Two important points. Firstly, social protests in summer in Sarajevo fizzled out very quickly, despite much excitement.  Secondly, up to now, the protests are mostly a Bosniak affair.  While the protesters have been avowedly anti-nationalist, so far they have not spread to the Republika Srpska or to predominantly Croat areas, even though economically everyone in Bosnia faces exactly the same problems.  This year three big events are on the Bosnian calendar. It will hold elections, its mostly (but not entirely) Bosniak-supported football team will play in the World Cup, and Sarajevo will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the event that changed the world - the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June 1914 which sparked the First World War.  It is still far too early to say whether 2014 will one day be remembered as the year that changed Bosnia. But today hope is running high.  ""My impression is that there is no going back now,"" says Dusica Ikic-Cook, a business administrator in Tuzla. ""I believe we will get results, even if only in the Federation to kill this huge administration which is sucking up all our money.""  So far the protests have not spread to Serb areas Violent protests spread in Bosnia Scenes of violence in Bosnia.

economic indicators,Conservatives claim Croatia victory,2024-09-15,2015-11-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34758843,"Tomislav Karamarko and his HDZ party now face the task of forming a new government Croatia's conservative opposition has declared victory in parliamentary elections, but faces a challenge to form a government. Results show the centre-right coalition, led by the HDZ, won 59 seats while the ruling alliance, led by the Social Democrats, won 56. Both are well short of the 76 needed for a parliamentary majority. It was Croatia's first general election since joining the European Union two years ago.  The migration crisis was one of the main issues. More than 320,000 migrants have passed through Croatia this year. ""The victory brought us responsibility to lead our country, which is in a difficult situation,"" HDZ leader Tomislav Karamarko told supporters. ""Whoever wants to fight with us for the quality of life in Croatia is welcome."" A new, third group in the election - an alliance of independent candidates known as Most (Bridge) - emerged as a powerful force in the election, winning 19 seats. Mr Milanovic had won praise for his compassionate handling of the migrant crisis Most said before the vote it would not join either main coalition, reports the BBC's Guy De Launey in Croatia's capital Zagreb.  However leading Most figure Drago Prgomet said on Monday it was ready for discussions, and that the group would ""decide who will be the next prime minister"". The success of Most shows that many Croatians are disenchanted with the traditional political parties, which have failed to address the country's deep-rooted economic problems, our correspondent says. Croatia's two main alliances have promised different approaches on how to handle the arrival of more refugees and migrants. The country has become a transit hub for migrants, many from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, who want to travel north. Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic says the cost of managing the arrivals has been close to 2m kuna (£189,000; $284,000) a day. Close to 320,000 migrants have passed through Croatia so far this year Numbers increased when Hungary shut its border with Serbia, forcing more people to seek an alternative route north through Croatia. Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic and his Social Democrats (SDP) won approval for their compassionate handling of the refugee crisis. Whereas Mr Karamarko has suggested using troops and fences to reduce the number of arrivals. As well as the migrant crisis, Croatia's next government will be faced with a weak economy: unemployment is at 15.4% - the third-highest in the European Union, external, after Greece and Spain youth unemployment is at 43.1% - also the third-highest in the EU the country has suffered six years of recession, but has seen little growth this year Migrant crisis stirs historical Croatia-Serbia enmity Croatia country profile"
economic indicators,Santander ups mortgage rates despite competition,2024-09-15,2024-01-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68075289,"One of the UK's biggest banks, Santander, has raised mortgage rates despite fierce competition among lenders in recent weeks. Santander will nudge up rates by up to 0.20 percentage points on some fixed rate products from Wednesday. It bucks wider trends with Nationwide among the latest to reduce rates. Analysts said they still expect the benchmark interest rate to be cut this year despite worries about inflation. The move by Santander came after official figures recently showed that inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, unexpectedly ticked up to 4% in December. ""Lenders' margins at the moment are tight, so this increase will be expected,"" said Elliott Culley, director of Switch Mortgage Finance.  ""Borrowers should not panic as its unlikely this will be a trend and overall across the year, predictions are for rates to fall further"". Mortgage rates reached their highest level in 15 years in 2023 as the Bank of England raised interest rates in an attempt to rein in rising prices. In theory, by making borrowing more expensive and dissuading people from taking out loans, such moves cool down the economy, easing pressures pushing up prices. But the higher interest rates also led some landlords to increase rents and made homebuying more expensive, exacerbating what has been described as a cost-of-living crisis. About 1.6 million existing borrowers have relatively cheap fixed-rate deals expiring this year and are facing the prospect of more expensive deals. More recently, however, as prices have eased, many lenders have been cutting rates, providing some relief. The average rate on a two-year fixed deal has dropped to 5.62% compared with 5.93% at the start of the year, according to financial information service Moneyfacts. ""While rates are not as cheap as they used to be, they are significantly better than they were"", said Aaron Strutt from Trinity Financial.  ""We have been saying for a while that rates may start to level off and there may not be many more price reductions for a while, but the pricing improvements keep coming"". Britain's biggest building society, Nationwide, on Wednesday said that its new products would include a five-year fixed-rate mortgage at 3.85% for new customers with a 40% deposit who are moving home. The deal has a £1,499 fee. But its chief economist, Robert Gardiner, warned that upheaval in the Red Sea was ""part of a broader picture of uncertainty"", and could pose a ""serious risk"" to inflation in the UK if it starts to impact trade significantly. Some analysts said that Santander's move to raise rates might be precautionary, amid predictions that the Bank of England may not cut rates as early as some have forecast. A Santander spokesman said that the lender ""reviews its rates based on a number of factors, such as wider market conditions including swap rates"", which are a leading indicator for mortgage rates.

economic indicators,The Scottish economy: 'Poor but improving',2024-09-15,2024-03-28,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-68682295,"Is the economy ""turning the corner""? Conservative MPs hope so. It's the only pathway for turning round the daunting polling lead for Labour in an election year.  As we end the first quarter of 2024, what's the evidence? In Scotland, where evidence tends towards scarcity, we have more than usual. Thursday brings publication of an important survey of members of Scottish Chambers of Commerce, all of them employing under 250 people, and at the same time, the quarterly assessment of the Fraser of Allander Institute. Having cornered much of the market in business surveys, it is that Strathclyde University institute which is behind both publications. Asked between mid-February and 11 March, members of the Chambers of Commerce are facing ""extreme cost pressures"", says their president, Stephen Leckie. This is partly due to the challenge of recruiting people, with nearly half of respondents facing problems, up from the end of last year.  The battle for scarce skills means wages are pushed up. Scottish wage inflation is faster than the rest of the UK, much of that explained by more generous public sector pay deals. And the legal minimum wage is about to rise. From Monday, it's going up from £10.42 per hour to £11.44, and the minimum age to qualify for that is coming down from 23 to 21. For those aged 23 and above, that's a welcome 10% increase in pay, and 12% for those in their early 20s. Lower minimum pay rates for under-21s and apprentices are up more steeply.   But the headline rate remains 56p per hour below the Real Living Wage, at £12, independently calculated to provide a basic standard of living to full-time workers.  For employees with price-sensitive custom and lots of younger staff on, or near, minimum wage - notably hospitality and retail - this is less welcome. Payroll is the main cost pressure bosses are facing. More than three-quarters in the Chambers survey say so, while three in five say energy costs continue to be a major input concern. For some, their concerns are worsened by the sharply tightened criteria for recruiting abroad. The minimum salary is going up, to a level far above the Scottish average wage. To quote the UK government's fact sheet, it is ""increasing the earning threshold for overseas workers by nearly 50% from its current position of £26,200 to £38,700 from 4 April 2024, encouraging businesses to look to British talent first and invest in their workforce, helping us to deter employers from over-relying on migration"". Over half of firms reported investment is frozen, and that's the way they expect it to remain during the second quarter of 2024, while economic uncertainty remains. Consumer price inflation has eased considerably - at 3.4% and soon to decline further as household energy bills fall from next week, it's the figure cited by those Tories looking for green shoots of recovery.  But of the Scottish firms surveyed, half say they expect to put prices up, and that's a sharp increase on price expectations at the end of last year. That is one reason economists at the Bank of England is holding off on an interest rate cut, until it can be more confident that wage and price inflation rates are under control. Earlier this week, a different view from the boardroom was published by the Institute of Directors in Scotland.  They were sizing up artificial intelligence, cyber-security and the transition to net zero as costs for some and market opportunities for others. They claim to see opportunities for their businesses in improved work contracts, inclusivity and diversity. But their concerns are focused on the problems of government getting the economic fundamentals right, says Catherine McWilliam.  She highlights problems with workforce skills and implementation of government policy and a lack of economic priority or business collaboration coming from Holyrood. Among their main concerns (82% of those responding) is the impact of another income tax bracket being introduced in Scotland next week, raising the tax bill for earnings above £75,000 to 45%, even if National Insurance is about to go down by 2p in the pound. Those earners can't expect much sympathy, but company directors say these are the people they need to recruit into Scotland, and the divergence in tax regimes is not helping. Nor does it impress potential inward investors, say more than quarter of them.  A further bit of data helps fill out the picture, issued by the Scottish government on Wednesday - its first estimate of growth across the Scottish economy during January. After a contraction of 0.6% across the preceding quarter, output rose in the first month of this year by the same amount.  December had also seen such an increase, indicating that the trend may, indeed, be turning a corner back to growth and away from a long period of stagnation. So what do they think at the Fraser of Allander Institute? Its forecast for this year, of 0.6% over the whole of 2024, has not changed since the last quarter. It sees that rising to 1.1% next year and 1.2% the year after, still below long-term trend. The Institute's commentary on the economy acknowledges falling inflation as a positive, moreso if it feeds through to lower borrowing costs. But it comes with a lot of uncertainty about other factors in the economy. There's a fear that the improving outlook could be clouded once more by factors controlled beyond Scotland, including wars, energy prices and supply disruption.  That feeds into an indicator that the Scottish government monitors of consumer confidence. It's improved, from a negative outlook while inflation was high, both the outlook for the Scottish economy and for people's household finances.  Expectations of household finances have risen to the point where they are finely balanced: as many people are positive as feel negatively.  That could be a vital trend to watch for those fighting the Westminster election. The Allander report has the headline ""Poor but Improving"".  The big question - one of them, at least - is ""do you feel better off?"", and whether people's consumer and political choices reflect the perception that they feel they've got poorer, or even if they have, that things might be improving?"
economic indicators,Is this the worst economic inheritance since WW2?,2024-09-15,2024-03-20,By Gerry Georgieva & Anthony Reuben,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68535073,"Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves claims that whichever party wins the election, it will inherit the worst set of economic circumstances since World War Two. There are certainly problems facing the next government, but other governments in the last 80 years have also faced big economic challenges. Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979 at the time of an oil crisis and rapidly-rising prices and the coalition government of 2010 followed a global financial crisis. Ms Reeves told the BBC that the current situation was ""a dire inheritance"" as she laid out the measures she was basing her claim upon. We have had a look at the evidence for each of them.  Ms Reeves said: ""If you look at debt as a share of our economy that's the highest since 1951."" Actually, the Office for National Statistics, which compiles the figures, says: ""Net debt as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is currently at levels last seen in the early 1960s."" Ethan Ilzetzki, from the London School of Economics, described the current level of debt as being ""high but nowhere close to where it was in the 1950s"". And on the overall claim about the worst conditions since World War Two, he said: ""I struggle to find a metric that would make that statement correct"". The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank said: ""The next government is likely to face some of the most difficult economic and fiscal choices the UK has faced outside of pandemics, conflicts and financial crises.""    The shadow chancellor said: ""The tax burden is the highest for 70 years."" The tax level, measured by how much of the country's economic output (measured by GDP) is raised in tax revenues, is estimated to be just above 36% this year.  This is high historically. It has only been higher last year and in the first two years on record, 1948 and 1949, a time when the UK was recovering from the war and the NHS was founded.  Taxation is projected to rise to 37.1% in the next five years which would be the highest level on record.  When asked about her claim, Ms Reeves pointed out: ""The economy is currently in recession.""  GDP has been relatively flat over the past two years and the UK went into recession because the economy shrank in the last two quarters of 2023. But there have been deeper and longer ones since World War 2, including recessions during the mid-70s, early-80s and the 2008 Financial Crisis that resulted in shrinkages in the economy for two years in a row. While it is rare for a country to be in recession during the run-up to an election, if that happens it would not be the first time. Both the 2010 and the 1992 elections, for example, happened right after years when the UK was in recession. Stephen Millard, from the National Institute for Economic and Social Research think tank, pointed to the recession at the time of the February 1974 election in which the economy contracted 3.7% while inflation was over 10%. ""These numbers suggest to me that the incoming Labour government in 1974 inherited an economy in worse shape than currently,"" he said.  ""This will be the first Parliament on record where living standards have gone backwards not forwards,"" the shadow chancellor said. The change to living standards is best reflected in households' real disposable income (RHDI) per person, which fell by 2.2% in 2022-23 - the biggest drop since records began in 1955.  Ms Reeves and the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on people on lower incomes, pointed out that it will also be the first time on record that households will be poorer on this measure at the end of a parliament, than they were at its start. The measure is projected to rise by 0.8% in 2023-24.  Nevertheless, living standards are obviously considerably better than they were in the 1940s, with current households' disposable income more than four times higher than after World War Two. There are other indicators that the shadow chancellor could have looked at that show a different picture. Inflation is at 3.4%, which is well above the 2% target, but much lower than some previous governments have had to deal with. The rate of unemployment is at a relatively low level although there is concern about the number of people who have withdrawn from the labour market. And the volume of retail sales is below pre-pandemic levels but is still higher than it was at any point prior to 2018. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"
economic indicators,Stormont return 'positive step forward' - Biden,2024-09-15,2024-03-15,By Jayne McCormack,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-68568536,"US President Joe Biden has hailed the return of power-sharing in Northern Ireland as a ""positive step forward"". He made the remarks as he held bilateral talks with Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar at the White House as part of St Patrick's Day celebrations. Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers are among politicians taking part in events in Washington DC. President Biden said the US remained ""committed to protecting peace and progress"" in Northern Ireland. ""I was glad to see the Northern Ireland Executive back up and running and from my perspective, it's a positive step forward,"" he said. The institutions were restored last month after a two-year hiatus. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he was pleased to see the return of power-sharing since he and Mr Biden had met last autumn. ""It's really good to see the promise of the Good Friday Agreement being fulfilled again, which is such a positive change since we last met,"" he added. Mr Biden said Ireland and the US shared a ""deepening economic partnership"" and friendship. First Minister Michelle O'Neill also spoke with President Biden on Friday and said the United States has been a ""critical partner for peace in Ireland"". ""We deeply value this support,"" Ms O'Neill said. ""Our peace process and your role in this are a fine example of successful US diplomacy and foreign policy success,"" she added.  Both Mr Varadkar and Ms O'Neill spoke with the US president on global issues, including the need for an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza conflict. President Biden said ""a whole lot more has to be done in Gaza"". Referencing the need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, Ms O'Neill called on the US to apply ""the same constructive role"" they showed in helping to bring an end to the almost 30 year conflict in Northern Ireland. Speaking outside the White House, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it was ""fair to say"" the US was working very hard to put in place a temporary humanitarian ceasefire. ""There's a strong hope and belief if that can be achieved then there's the possibility of something more permanent."" He added that President Biden had said the US would continue to support Israel and assist it. But he said: ""None of us like to see American weapons being used the way they are, the way they're being used at the moment is not self-defence"". Pressed on his opinion over a ceasefire, he said it ""is well over due - the number of lives that have been lost is just too much - but it has to be on both sides.""  A former President of Ireland, Mary Robinson, had earlier called on Leo Varadkar to tell the US government to stop its military and financial support for Israel whilst he is in Washington. Speaking to RTÉ, Mrs Robinson said: ""The United States can influence Israel by not continuing to provide arms, it has provided a lot of the arms, bombs that have been used on the Palestinian people and he's continuing to do that and he's also providing money."" Later, at a lunch hosted by the US Speaker on Capitol Hill, President Biden congratulated Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers. He said the appointment of Michelle O'Neill and Emma Little-Pengelly ""reminded us what possibilities there are on overcoming disagreements"". The ministers received a round of applause from the attendees in the room.  Speaking after the event, Ms Little-Pengelly said ""so many people have talked about our joint message and about Northern Ireland being open for business, so it's really great they are talking about Northern Ireland but they are also talking about our pitch and what we can offer."" ""Northern Ireland is a small place but we get really good access to key and influential people here in the US,"" she added. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is walking a political tightrope.  He wanted to deliver a tough message to President Biden over Gaza while not embarrassing his host.  Choosing his words carefully he said they had ""to work together to secure a humanitarian ceasefire"", President Biden said he agreed.  He got a further nod of approval from the president when he suggested a ""two state solution was the best way to secure lasting peace and security"".  President Biden also acknowledged in his speech there was work to be done on Gaza.  It is clear both men are on the same page but the president is not yet in a position to call for a permanent ceasefire.  The fact he described Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer's speech criticising the Israeli government as a ""good speech"" which all Americans could support is also a clear indicator.  It will feel like mission accomplished for the taoiseach.  He did not get a firm commitment of a change of policy on Gaza but he got the next best thing. The return of the Northern Ireland power sharing institutions was something they could both celebrate."
economic indicators,Morning business round-up,2024-09-15,2011-04-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13048575,"What made the business news in Asia and Europe this morning? Here's our daily business round-up: Inflation in the UK saw a surprise fall in March, official statistics showed. The Consumer Prices Index fell to 4% from 4.4%, while the Retail Prices Index fell to 5.3% from 5.5% in February, largely due to a fall in the price of food and non-alcoholic drinks. The news followed a report from the British Retail Consortium, which said that sales on the High Street saw the biggest fall since records began in 1996. These two indicators have led some economists to suggest the Bank of England will not start to increase interest rates as early as previously thought.  Meanwhile, as the fallout from Japan's nuclear disaster continues, a report by JP Morgan has estimated that Tepco may face as much as 2 trillion yen ($23.6bn; £14.5bn) in compensation claims. The company has been attempting to contain the radiation leak crisis at its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also downgraded its view on Japan's economy in the wake of the devastating earthquake and tsunami. It now expects Japan's economy to grow by 1.4% this year, compared with a previous forecast of 1.6%. But the IMF maintained its forecast for the global economy, saying it expects it to grow by 4.4% in 2011. This video can not be played Biz Heads The IMF also warned about the impact of high oil prices on the global economy.  This was also reflected in a report from the International Energy Agency which said that the high price of oil was beginning to have an effect on energy demand. Global oil output fell by about 700,000 barrels per day in March due to unrest in Libya, the agency said.

The Bank of England's financial policy committee says banks must raise capital to withstand the downturn, particularly that caused by eurozone debt problems. The governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, said they needed to build up their capital buffers further to protect against an ""exceptionally threatening"" environment. He also said this could involve raising capital by issuing new shares. He also said banks should keep lending, but should cut dividends and bonuses.

economic indicators,North Korea's surge of friendly visitors,2024-09-15,2018-04-17,By Alistair  Coleman,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43781981,"Ever since the secretive trip to Pyongyang by two South Korean officials that opened the way for a dialogue with the US, North Korea has seen a flurry of friendly visits.  Art troupes, an arts festival and diplomats seeking to warm ties have streamed to Pyongyang and North Korean state media is taking full advantage with fulsome coverage.  There is little doubt that this is part of a continuing campaign to seize the narrative on the Korean peninsula and burnish Pyongyang and Kim Jong-un's image ahead of two crucial summits with South Korea and the US. But who is it really aimed at?   China remains North Korea's most significant trading partner and economic supporter, always opposing the harshest of sanctions for its smaller neighbour. But as Pyongyang accelerated testing of missiles and nuclear devices, its frustration was beginning to show.   That changed when Kim Jong-un took a slow train to Beijing for his first ever meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping last month. The latest manifestation of this slow but steady mending of ties between the neighbours was the weekend visit by a Chinese artistic delegation led by senior official Song Tao, the head of the Communist Party's International Liaison Department. On Sunday, North Korea's state-run Central Television showed Kim Jong-un greeting the delegation and meeting the Chinese envoy in a hall decorated with a huge portrait of Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Inside the train Kim travelled to China in Why Xi's still the one Kim needs to see The political gamble of the 21st Century North Korean TV's famous ""lady in pink"", senior newscaster Ri Chun-hee, generally brought out for more significant bulletins, came forth to praise a ""new era"" of relations between the two countries. Mr Kim went on to host a ""grand"" banquet for the visiting Chinese delegation, where toasts were made to the ""steadfast will of the two parties and two peoples, to more beautifully decorate the flower garden of the DPRK-China friendship"".  There, another enormous image of Xi Jinping looked down from the stage.  It's a signal to China as much as it is to the world and those North Koreans with access to this media that the old alliance is certainly not fractured.  This has also provided an opportunity for a solo engagement for Mr Kim's wife, the ""respected Madame Ri Sol-ju"" who was shown  greeting China's Mr Song at the theatre, and enjoying a performance of 'Giselle' by the National Ballet of China. It's the first time that Mrs Ri has been seen in North Korean media without her husband and she was presented as the ""First Lady of DPRK"" (Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name) for the first time. She had only previously been presented as ""Comrade"", South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper says. With KCNA news agency filing the report under ""Supreme Leader's Activities"", this is an indicator of the greater role both she and the leader's sister Kim Yo-jong are playing in North Korea's PR initiatives.  South Korea was the first to send over a cultural troupe when in early April several star acts performed in Pyongyang. Among them was K-pop band Red Velvet, known for their upbeat electronica and Mr Kim addressed rumours that he was a secret fan in comments quoted in a pool report at the time.  Kim watches K-pop idols in peace concert The South Korean rock band returning to perform in Pyongyang ""There had been interest in whether I would come and see Red Velvet. I had initially planned to attend a performance the day after tomorrow but I came here today after adjusting my schedule ""I thank you for this kind of gift to Pyongyang citizens."" A Red Velvet band member's subsequent comment that it was an ""honour"" to meet Mr Kim divided many in South Korea, with some accusing her of humanising a reckless leader.  For some critics, the comments by Mr Kim were little short of a careful and canny exercise in soft power and humanising an unreadable figure at a critical moment.  The first two weeks of April also saw Pyongyang's first international singing contest, with artists visiting from Kazakhstan, Armenia and Mongolia.  It was won, hardly surprisingly, by a North Korean singer. But it marks a clear-cut offensive on the part of state media to present Pyongyang as an international cultural destination.  In that vein, the recent Spring Friendship Art Festival featured performers from Bulgaria, Russia and Laos, alongside a Singapore-based stage magician called Mr Bottle. This was a performance deemed important enough to clear Central TV's early evening schedule on 16 April. As a contrast last week's annual Pyongyang marathon was not given as much domestic coverage as in previous years.  While official reports noted the presence of sport minister Choe Hwi and competitors from around the world, the number of foreigners taking part was less than half of last year's race.  One company organising tours to the race said that people were still travelling despite government warnings against going to North Korea, following the death of American student Otto Warmbier last year and the country's poor human rights record.  But North Korean state media have made sure that foreign tourists are still visible, with state television airing English-language interviews with visitors to Pyongyang's Juche Tower on the occasion of Day of the Sun, the birthday of state founder Kim Il-sung.  It's been an unprecedented few weeks for North Korea's relations with the world but the glowing narrative of star-struck audiences and smiling performances are no accident. For the message-makers in state media, politics is likely to be in mind.  BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

economic indicators,Five cities making the world a better place,2024-09-15,2024-04-02,Amanda Ruggeri,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240402-five-standout-cities-making-the-world-a-better-place,"The Global Destination Sustainability Index reveals the destinations that are working towards a sustainable and lower-carbon future. With time running out to keep global temperature to a 1.5C rise – above which, experts warn, consequences could include far hotter days, higher sea-levels and loss of nearly all the world's coral reefs – implementing solutions for a more sustainable, lower-carbon future is key. And when it comes to destinations, some are proving better at this than others. The most recent Global Destination Sustainability Index looks at 69 indicators – such as recycling rates, air pollution levels, quantity of cycling paths and the percentage of hotel rooms that are certified eco-friendly – to select the world's most sustainable cities. While the index is geared towards recognising tourism sectors for their sustainability commitments, it also takes into account data that affects city residents – making the index a good resource not only for travellers who want to choose a sustainable destination, but for would-be residents looking to settle in an eco-friendly city, too. Here are five cities that fare among the best. The Swedish city ranks top of the Global Destination Sustainability Index, but its bona fides don't end there: Sweden's second-largest city has led the index every year from 2016-2021; was named by Lonely Planet as the world's best sustainable city stay in 2021; and, in 2022, signed up to be one of the EU's 100 cities that plan to be climate-neutral by 2030. Top 10 cities on the Global Destination Sustainability Index 2023: Since moving from Yorkshire, UK, to just outside Gothenburg a year ago, Harriet Pickering and her family have noticed the Swedish city's commitment to sustainability in their everyday lives. Take how they now get around. Her husband is an avid cyclist but found that the traffic and lack of bike paths made cycling more difficult in the UK. ""I don't think we would have ever transported our son by cycling. It wouldn't have felt safe enough,"" Pickering said. ""But we do it here. There are cyclists everywhere and loads of cycling paths."" They've even bought an electric car, she added, partly because of how many spaces there are in the area for electric vehicle charging. But these aren't the only ways in which Gothenburg is helping to cut its residents' and visitors' carbon footprints. A full 95% of the city's public transport runs on renewable energy, such as its electric buses. Its airport has been certified to one of the highest levels by the Airport Carbon Accreditation scheme, meaning it is committed to tracking, cutting and offsetting carbon emissions; while around nine in 10 of its hotel rooms are environmentally certified. Even its festivals, which can be hefty CO2 emitters, strive to reduce their impact, with Way Out West – which only serves vegetarian meals, sells upcycled garments as merchandise and eschews single-use plates and cutlery – becoming the world's first music festival to be certified sustainable in 2013. Pickering says living in this environment hasn't just nudged her family to make more sustainable choices in the moment; she also hopes that it will influence her son as he gets older. ""He'll just grow up with certain things being the norm,"" she said. ""So, when he's an adult, he won't think twice about things like electric vehicles, or recycling – that will just be part of his normal."" Runner-up on the list – and the second of eight Nordic cities to make the top 10 – is Oslo, which also was named the official European Green Capital in 2019. Perhaps paradoxically, given Norway's economic dependence on oil and gas, the country routinely gets top marks for its sustainability commitments. It makes sense that Oslo, Norway's capital, does, too. Walk around Oslo, and this commitment is clear. In terms of transport alone, the city has 270 city bike stations, 5,000 electric vehicle charging stations and has introduced electric scooters. Then there's how green the city is, literally. Most of the municipality – 63% – is forest. Another 9% is made up of green areas and city parks. But many of the sustainability initiatives have been behind the scenes, says Anne-Signe Fagereng, marketing manager of Oslo's tourism board, VisitOSLO. ""We do green 'nudging' with the tourists that come here,"" she said. ""When you look at our website, you won't see that we put lots of green leaves everywhere, or call everything 'sustainable'. But we try to make the sustainable choices the more go-to choices, if you will."" The website highlights restaurants like Maaemo, which has received a Michelin Green Star for its sustainable practices; and accommodations like the Thon Hotel Astoria, an environmentally certified budget hotel that cuts its carbon footprint by using renewable energy. VisitOSLO also has developed its own criteria for businesses to receive a ""Visit Oslo Responsibly"" badge and has dedicated resources like its Green Guide for tourists who want to prioritise sustainable options, too. Offline, the tourism board is incorporating the same principles. At the tourist office, if a visitor asks for advice on how to get from point A to point B, the staff will provide them with information about public transport first, Fagereng said. The tourism board has also developed a course in sustainable business practice for the travel industry, with topics like reducing wood waste or minimising noise pollution. Fagereng is realistic about the challenges: as long as flying to a destination remains a necessity, for example, it's all but impossible to say travel anywhere is a ""sustainable"" choice. But she's optimistic. ""As a whole, the travel industry isn't sustainable. But we are really making huge efforts to go in that direction,"" she said. ""Tourism can be a force for good."" Even Glasgow's name speaks to its environmental heritage: ""Glaschu"", the Gaelic name for Glasgow, means grey-green hollow. Some 1,500 years after its founding, the Scottish city ranks highest of any in the UK (and eighth overall) on the Global Destination Sustainability Index, where it's placed in the top 10 every year since 2016. Even since she moved to Glasgow 10 years ago, Kathi Kamleitner, who is originally from Vienna, says it's obvious that strides have been taken towards a more sustainable future. In 2023, for example, the city put a low-emissions zone in place, restricting which cars can enter the centre in order to cut down on air pollution. Electric vehicle charging stations have been built, ""smart"" LED streetlights installed, and there have also been noticeable efforts to boost cycling with bike hire schemes and new bike paths. ""The execution wasn't always the best. Sometimes it felt a bit like they got someone to build a bike path who doesn't actually ride a bike,"" Kamleitner said with a laugh. ""But overall, I think it's good to see more of that infrastructure coming into place."" Glasgow also embodies its reputation as a green city, Kamleitner said. Her house at the edge of the city looks over a woodland; but even in the heart of Glasgow, there are numerous parks (the city has more than 90 overall). While there are disparities between neighbourhoods, on average, eight in 10 children in Glasgow live within 400m of a public green space. Still, the city has hurdles to overcome. Compared to Vienna and Berlin, where she's lived before, Kamleitner says that Glasgow's public transport is more expensive and less extensive. However, she's not surprised that Glasgow consistently performs well. A lot of that, she says, comes down to the attitudes of residents. Circular-economy schemes have become more popular, for example, with more community hubs to repair or lend out products. ""I see a lot of social enterprises and a lot of businesses really pursuing that sustainability aspect, and making it easier to meet more sustainable choices,"" she said. ""And that's certainly something I've seen in Glasgow – more maybe than even in some of the other cities I've lived in."" Most people might know Bordeaux for its stunning architecture and swill-able wine, but there's another reason to fall in love with the French city: it's seeking a more sustainable future. As well as ranking in the top 10 on the Global Destination Sustainability Index, Bordeaux is the third highest-ranked sustainable destination on TripAdvisor. Walk around the city, and signs of these efforts are everywhere. The city is navigable by self-service V3 bikes, electric buses, trams and even river shuttles, while zero-kilometre restaurants and second-hand stores abound. Around three-quarters of Bordeaux's vineyards and one-third of its tourism companies have been eco-certified, as has its tourist office itself. Even the Bordeaux Wine Festival – this year from 27-30 June – is trying to cut its carbon footprint: eco-certified since 2021, it composts food waste, sells no plastic items and measures and reports on its emissions each year. But the city is aiming far higher, according to Olivier Occelli, director of the Bordeaux tourism office. The city's tourism sector has committed to getting 80% of its stakeholders, from hotels to tour agencies, to be eco-certified by 2026. ""Sustainability is one major strategy that we have to focus on for the years to come,"" he said. ""We know that global warming is here, and all the economic sectors need, in that sense, to take care of our future, and of the planet."" Of course, as for all the cities on the list, there's plenty of work to do. One thing he and his associates are thinking about, says Occelli, is how to reduce the carbon footprint of the actual travel to Bordeaux itself: after all, staying just one or two nights in a destination is more carbon-intensive than if you stayed longer. ""We have to work on that,"" he said. ""And if someone is coming for two days' work, for example, we really have to say okay, you stay two days for work, but stay three more days to visit the city, see the vineyards and to take public transportation within the city."" Which – given everything Bordeaux has to offer – doesn't seem like such a punishment. Ranking 14th on the list – and the highest of any city outside of Europe – is Goyang, South Korea, where the tourism industry has been hard at work improving its green credentials. Carbon Count The travel emissions it took to report this story were 0 metric tons of CO2e. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. In 2017, Goyang, located just outside of Seoul, became the first city in South Korea to join the Global Destination Sustainability Index. The following year, the index awarded it ""Most Improved Destination"". It's been climbing up the GDSI rankings ever since. In 2022, it earned its first ISO 20121 sustainability certifications, particularly for its conventions and events. Today, the convention/exhibition centre recycles rainwater for the bathrooms, pond and gardens. The city itself also has 68 parks and a bike sharing system. ""Actively and continuously pursuing sustainability in a small regional city with significantly limited manpower and budget, compared to international cities, was no easy feat,"" said Peter Lee, managing director of the Goyang Convention and Visitors Bureau. Aside from initiatives like the convention centre's attempts to cut its carbon footprint, the city has ""excellent environmental conditions"", Lee says, such as more than 1,000 hectares of ""green and blue"" (like parks and water) per 100,000 people, and 424km of cycling paths. ""It is a liveable city where rural and urban areas are well harmonised, and it boasts top-notch environmental policies and practical measures within South Korea,"" Lee said.

Results show the centre-right coalition, led by the HDZ, won 59 seats while the ruling alliance, led by the Social Democrats, won 56. Both are well short of the 76 needed for a parliamentary majority. It was Croatia's first general election since joining the European Union two years ago.  The migration crisis was one of the main issues. More than 320,000 migrants have passed through Croatia this year. ""The victory brought us responsibility to lead our country, which is in a difficult situation,"" HDZ leader Tomislav Karamarko told supporters. ""Whoever wants to fight with us for the quality of life in Croatia is welcome."" A new, third group in the election - an alliance of independent candidates known as Most (Bridge) - emerged as a powerful force in the election, winning 19 seats. Mr Milanovic had won praise for his compassionate handling of the migrant crisis Most said before the vote it would not join either main coalition, reports the BBC's Guy De Launey in Croatia's capital Zagreb.  However leading Most figure Drago Prgomet said on Monday it was ready for discussions, and that the group would ""decide who will be the next prime minister"". The success of Most shows that many Croatians are disenchanted with the traditional political parties, which have failed to address the country's deep-rooted economic problems, our correspondent says. Croatia's two main alliances have promised different approaches on how to handle the arrival of more refugees and migrants. The country has become a transit hub for migrants, many from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, who want to travel north. Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic says the cost of managing the arrivals has been close to 2m kuna (£189,000; $284,000) a day. Close to 320,000 migrants have passed through Croatia so far this year Numbers increased when Hungary shut its border with Serbia, forcing more people to seek an alternative route north through Croatia. Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic and his Social Democrats (SDP) won approval for their compassionate handling of the refugee crisis. Whereas Mr Karamarko has suggested using troops and fences to reduce the number of arrivals. As well as the migrant crisis, Croatia's next government will be faced with a weak economy: unemployment is at 15.4% - the third-highest in the European Union, external, after Greece and Spain youth unemployment is at 43.1% - also the third-highest in the EU the country has suffered six years of recession, but has seen little growth this year Migrant crisis stirs historical Croatia-Serbia enmity Croatia country profile"
economic indicators,Bosnian protests: A Balkan Spring?,2024-09-15,2014-02-07,Tim Judah,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26093160,"Police have condemned the protesters as ""hooligans"" For years the best description of the political situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina has been ""stagnant but stable"".  Now, with astonishing speed, analysts are already talking about a ""Bosnian Spring"".  In Tuzla, Mostar, Zenica and Sarajevo, government buildings have been set on fire and there have been demonstrations across much of the rest of the country. Hundreds have been injured, including policemen.  Politicians have condemned ""hooligans"" for the violence but many are frightened.  Pictures have gone viral of cars, allegedly belonging to politicians, which have been tipped into a canal in Zenica.  The trouble began in the northern town of Tuzla on Wednesday. Workers from several factories which were privatised and which have now gone bankrupt united to demand action over jobs, unpaid salaries and pensions.  The workers were joined by students and political activists. After they began stoning the local court, violence broke out.  Unemployment is high in Bosnia-Hercegovina Bosnia's four-year war ended in 1995, and since then there have been few protests over social issues.  Up to 2006, there was progress in making Bosnia something of a more functional state. But ever since, Bosnian politics have been in a state of utter stalemate and like the rest of the western Balkans, the country has been hit hard by years of economic crisis.  Unemployment is running at 27.5%, and none of the economic indicators point to anything like a serious recovery. Old socialist-era industries, which dominated towns like Tuzla, were often left as shells after the war. Privatisations were often corrupt, with well-connected people buying companies to strip of them of their assets to make a quick profit - before declaring them bankrupt.  For years, Bosnians have fumed about their politicians - whom they almost universally believe to be corrupt.  Tens of police officers were injured in Friday's protests But the war left people apathetic, frightened and cynical. Indeed, the war years left such deep traumas that anger about the way politicians have prospered while standards of living have declined has been suppressed out of fear of a return to conflict.  Bosnia's basic political problem is that the war left its people with a dysfunctional state.  The country is divided into two main parts. Half the country is the Serbian-dominated Republika Srpska, whose leader Milorad Dodik wants it to become an independent state.  The other half is called the Federation and is comprised of ten cantons, which are either dominated by Bosniaks (who used to be called Bosnian Muslims) or Bosnian Croats. Each canton has its own government, which is then superimposed over local, city and town councils.  Finally, one town, Brcko, is an autonomous entity.  This week's protests mark the worst unrest since the end of the Bosnian war With only some 3.8m people, it is sometimes said that what Bosnia really needs is actually just a mayor, but ethnic divisions mean it has proved impossible to change the situation.  Indeed, ever since 2009 Bosnia's leaders have been preoccupied with the so-called ""Sejdic-Finci question,"" which while important in and of itself, is of no relevance to most people, who are worried about schools, jobs and health care.  Under the terms of the Dayton peace accords, which ended the war in 1995, certain key jobs, such as being a member of the country's tripartite presidency, are reserved for Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks only.  This was successfully challenged at the European Court of Human Rights by Jakob Finci and Dervo Sejdic, who are Jewish and Roma respectively. Ever since then, European and American officials have tried everything to cajole Bosnia's leaders to adapt the constitution - but they have had no success.  However, issues such as these have sucked the air out of political debate - meaning that the economy is always neglected.  All Balkan countries, including Croatia, which joined the European Union last year, have been hit by the economic crisis and share many of the same problems.  But in Bosnia the legacies of the war mean that few even hope for change anymore. For this reason, anger has been simmering for years, but now it has boiled over.  The protests broke out in the northern town of Tuzla But will the protests actually change anything?  Two important points. Firstly, social protests in summer in Sarajevo fizzled out very quickly, despite much excitement.  Secondly, up to now, the protests are mostly a Bosniak affair.  While the protesters have been avowedly anti-nationalist, so far they have not spread to the Republika Srpska or to predominantly Croat areas, even though economically everyone in Bosnia faces exactly the same problems.  This year three big events are on the Bosnian calendar. It will hold elections, its mostly (but not entirely) Bosniak-supported football team will play in the World Cup, and Sarajevo will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the event that changed the world - the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June 1914 which sparked the First World War.  It is still far too early to say whether 2014 will one day be remembered as the year that changed Bosnia. But today hope is running high.  ""My impression is that there is no going back now,"" says Dusica Ikic-Cook, a business administrator in Tuzla. ""I believe we will get results, even if only in the Federation to kill this huge administration which is sucking up all our money.""  So far the protests have not spread to Serb areas Violent protests spread in Bosnia Scenes of violence in Bosnia.

economic indicators,Succession debate overshadows ANC conference,2024-09-15,2015-10-09,Milton Nkosi,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-34473198,"The ruling African National Congress is still held in high regard by those loyal to Nelson Mandela's legacy South Africa's governing party is at a crossroads as it begins its policy review conference in Johannesburg - whether the African National Congress should follow its business-friendly National Development Plan, or to implement a more radical economic strategy. But most of the 3,000 delegates from across the country will have their minds on something else.  Top of the official agenda for the ANC is to find new ways to jump-start a sluggish economy and deal with the shambolic energy supply which is holding the country back.  But it also hopes to dig deep into the party's soul - looking for that great infectious optimism which swept the nation and the rest of the world when Nelson Mandela became the country's first black president, following the end of white-minority rule 21 years ago. The ANC hopes to retain its majority vote at next year's municipal elections ANC leaders have admitted and spoken openly about the cancer of corruption and the demonic in-fighting that are plaguing the 103-year-old liberation movement.  The nation's hopes are pinned on a thorough introspection at the National General Council - the party's mid-term policy review conference.  But another issue is likely to dominate the sidelines of the conference.  It has very little to do with the troubled party's will to deliver real material change for the masses of the people.  The elephant in the room is: The party's leadership succession battle, which to all intents and purposes is already underway. Cyril Ramaphosa (L) is believed to be the front runner to succeed Jacob Zuma as African National Congress leader President Zuma is in his second and last term as president of the country. He is not, by law, allowed to stand for a third term in 2019.   He is expected to step down as leader of the party when his current term expires in 2017 to prepare for a new national leader, as the ANC says it does not want two centres of power.  Judging by the ANC's overwhelming victory in last year's general election, the party's leader would be favourite to move on to become national president. Current party deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa is in pole position to assume the highest office in the land - that's if all goes according to plan.  However, the ANC would not be the organisation I know if everything went according to plan.  Already there is a strong voice coming from lobbyists who want President Zuma's former wife and chair of the African Union, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, to be the ANC's next president.  Structures of the ANC on the ground are divided. The Women's League says it is time for a female president.  Maite Nkoana-Mashabane (C) says the party is ready for a female president Minister of International Relations and Co-operation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, who is also the treasurer in the women's wing, told me they are ready for a woman president. But she denies it will sidetrack her from the issues at hand. ""Here at the NGC, we will spend 90% of our time discussing policy reviews,"" she said. ""That's what we are here for. We will not pre-occupy ourselves with the party leadership matters until 2017.""  Susan Booysen, a professor at Wits University's school of governance and the author of The African National Congress and the Regeneration of Political Power, told me that Mr Ramaphosa is not guaranteed to be the next president.  She told me: ""He is the fire fighter for many of the issues for the Zuma government but he is not safe because he was a default [compromise] candidate.""  She also said that President Zuma ""by all indications... has endorsed Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma"".  Some say that President Zuma may be endorsing his former wife in order to look after his interests in retirement. The pair remain on cordial terms. Trade unions have held a number of protests in recent years calling for an end to corruption in government The president of the trade union federation Cosatu, which is allied to the ANC, Sdumo Dlamini, recently told a workers' march that it was too early to talk about the ANC's succession race, and those who did so were putting the party at risk.  He said: ""We say to the ANC: 2017 is two years from now, the rush to debate about the leadership in 2017 is a recipe for disaster for all of us.""  Another influential supporter of President Zuma, Blade Nzimande who is also minister of Higher Education and leader of the South African Communist Party (SACP) warned a crowd of protesters, who were standing in the heatwave currently sweeping Johannesburg, against ambitious politicians who use money to secure delegates' support.  He said: ""If you buy delegates for the conference it means nawe [you too] can be bought. They will be bought by the single highest imperialist bidder."" While delegates insist that they are just going to deliberate about policy matters such as education, health, and the economy, behind the scenes, the different factions will be hard at work lobbying for their preferred candidate.  The fight for the soul of the ruling party is in full swing, whether on the record or off it.

economic indicators,Iran 'boosts nuclear capabilities',2024-09-15,2013-08-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-23867903,"Iran has reportedly been making fuel assemblies for its Arak research reactor Iran has further boosted its capacity for uranium enrichment, according to a report from the UN's nuclear agency, external. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says Tehran has now installed more than 1,000 advanced centrifuges at its Natanz enrichment plant. It comes as the IAEA says it will resume talks with Iran on 27 September - the first such negotiations since President Hassan Rouhani was elected. The West fears Iran wants to develop nuclear weapons - a claim it denies. The IAEA's quarterly report says there has not been much growth in the production of the most sensitive nuclear material - uranium enriched to 20%. The Natanz facility is at the heart of disputes with the UN Security Council However it says Iran has installed 1,008 advanced IR2m centrifuges at its Natanz plant compared with almost 700 in May. It also says the Islamic state has begun making nuclear fuel for its planned Arak heavy-water research reactor, although it has postponed the commissioning of the reactor beyond the planned first quarter of 2014. The report again raised concerns about the Parchin site, a suspected nuclear weapons development facility that investigators have been unable to fully inspect. It also says the IAEA has still not got answers on outstanding issues about Iran's nuclear programme, ""including those related to possible military dimensions"". Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has pledged to pursue ""serious"" talks with the West to ease tensions - and economic sanctions - over its controversial nuclear programme. Commentators point out that much of the latest technological developments will have taken place before Mr Rouhani took office on 3 August. The country has been the target of four rounds of UN sanctions and numerous UN Security Council resolutions calling on it to cease enrichment work amid fears it aims to develop nuclear weapons. Iran has refused to obey, saying it intends to enrich only for power station fuel or other peaceful purposes. It already has about 18,000 centrifuges for uranium enrichment in operation but they are of the older IR1 type. The new IR2m machines are said to be faster and more effective. Uranium enriched to 90% is required for a nuclear weapon. Iran's talks with the IAEA were apparently held up by the country's presidential elections in June. No negotiations between the two have taken place since the last quarterly report in May. In June, IAEA director general Yukiya Amano complained of a lack of progress during 10 rounds of negotiations between Iran and the so-called P5+1 - the US, UK, France, Russia, China plus Germany - despite intensified discussions.

economic indicators,Seven big questions now facing Liz Truss,2024-09-15,2022-09-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-62769937,"Liz Truss, the UK's next prime minister, will arrive in Downing Street to an overflowing in-tray of potential problems - an all-consuming cost of living crisis, dire warnings about the state of the NHS, and an ongoing war in Ukraine.  Seven BBC correspondents identified some of the biggest questions No 10's latest occupant will have to tackle. Faisal Islam, economics editor The new prime minister won't actually be able to solve fully their biggest challenge - the cost-of-living crisis. And it's got notably worse during the leadership campaign. At its core is the problem that energy, especially gas, is not flowing normally. This is primarily because of the Ukraine conflict and the conscious actions of the Kremlin. Prices spiked further recently, as European nations stored up gas for the winter. The overall result is energy prices most people will find unaffordable. The extent, timing, and targeting of help - which will stretch into tens of billions of pounds just for households - are the key judgements the new prime minister will face. Other prices - especially for food - are also surging, which could lead the inflation rate beyond 15%. All that is before the impact of further falls in the value of Sterling. Meanwhile, interest rates are on the rise, not just for families, but also for companies and the government itself. It is a toxic economic cocktail, and will require judicious, credible, and timely interventions. Nick Triggle, health correspondent NHS performance has been deteriorating for the best part of a decade, but the pandemic has exacerbated its problems even further. Record numbers are on hospital waiting lists - nearly one in eight people are currently waiting for treatment. Meanwhile, emergency services are warning patients are being harmed because of delays responding to 999 calls and long waits in A&E.  There is the threat of industrial action, with unions unhappy with pay. And all this is happening ahead of winter, with the prospect of flu and Covid circulating at high levels for the first time. Part of the problem hospitals are facing is the inability to discharge patients when they are medically fit to leave because of a lack of social care places.  The government does have a plan for social care - the care cap - but that is about protecting people's assets rather than providing more funding for services. Even then, there has been debate about whether the government is right to increase national insurance to pay for it, in part because of rising inflation.  James Landale, diplomatic correspondent Boris Johnson offered Ukraine early political and military support. The new prime minister is expected to maintain that approach and is likely to be willing to provide Ukraine with more weapons as the conflict progresses.  But as time goes by, the new prime minister may face a growing challenge of convincing doubters at home and abroad that the economic price of supporting Ukraine is worth it. With rising energy costs exacerbating the cost-of-living crisis, the PM will have to persuade voters that their financial discomfort is needed to defend Ukraine.  There will also be a big job of diplomacy to protect the pro-Ukraine alliance across Europe. There may well be countries that want to seek an accommodation with Russia and end the fighting to help secure their energy supplies.   Ione Wells, political correspondent After months of infighting, uniting the Conservative party is the main political challenge. And party unity will face an early test: the privileges committee investigation into whether Boris Johnson misled MPs over Downing Street parties.  If the committee of MPs recommends a punishment for Mr Johnson, MPs will need to vote on it. The prime minister will have to decide whether to let Tories vote how they want, or whether to instruct them to vote a certain way. Whipping them to vote for a sanction could anger those who support Boris Johnson, but the opposite approach risks accusations of trying to cover up wrongdoing.  Why does Tory infighting matter when there are pressing concerns, like the cost of living? Firstly, because governments with divided parties can struggle to pass policies that matter to people's lives. Secondly, it can be hard - as Mr Johnson discovered - to land your messages with the public if ministers spend more time on the airwaves trying to defend various behavioural issues, rather than policies.  Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political correspondent The next PM will quickly face a conundrum over the Northern Ireland protocol. Talks with the EU all but ground to a halt after the government introduced a bill to give UK ministers powers to override parts of the post-Brexit trading arrangements.   The Democratic Unionist Party declared it won't form a power-sharing government at Stormont until the protocol is changed, arguing it damages Northern Ireland's position within the UK. The key date is 28 October, the deadline for restoring government at Stormont.  After that date, the government will either have to call a fresh assembly election, draw up legislation for a new deadline, or begin taking more decisions for Northern Ireland from Westminster. The PM will also have to bear in mind that most Northern Irish politicians want the protocol to remain and won't shy from laying blame at the door of Downing Street.   Glenn Campbell, BBC Scotland News political editor Theresa May made the trip to Scotland on her first full day in office. Boris Johnson arranged his meeting within a week. It's not clear whether the new prime minister will be in quite the same hurry to go at a time when Nicola Sturgeon is pressing for an agreement to hold another independence referendum, in 2023.  In October, the UK Supreme Court will be asked to consider whether or not Holyrood has the power to hold IndyRef2 without Westminster's consent. The weight of legal opinion suggests the answer may be no but if the case goes the other way, the PM would face a big call: allow the vote to go ahead or take active steps to stop it.  In resisting Scottish independence, any prime minister must be careful not to choose an approach that risks undermining support for the union further.  Jonah Fisher, BBC environment correspondent In the midst of a gas price crisis, the new prime minister will very rapidly have to make decisions on energy that could set us on course to make, or break, the UK's commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  Will they prioritise the push for more renewables against the demands from some that they look again at the fossil fuels that already warm our planet? Should new oil and gas projects be greenlighted in the North Sea? Will the new leader give any encouragement to the UK fracking industry? As part of the net zero strategy, the government has committed to decarbonise the generation of electricity by 2035. For that to happen there will need to be a massive expansion in renewable energy. Offshore wind is already a British success story, but the fastest renewable projects from conception to completion are on land - solar and onshore wind.  Both are currently stymied by the planning process. Could that be simplified to speed up the transition to renewables? Early indications are that the answer will be no."
economic indicators,Nepal limits imports as foreign reserves slide,2024-09-15,2022-04-12,Annabelle  Liang & Sanjaya Dhakal,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61076089,"Nepal has restricted imports of non-essential goods - including cars, cosmetics and gold - after its foreign currency reserves dropped. It comes as a fall in tourism spending and money sent home by Nepalis working abroad helped drive up government debt.  Meanwhile, the governor of the country's central bank was removed from his role last week. Nepal's finance minister said he was ""surprised"" the issue was being compared with the crisis in Sri Lanka. According to the country's central bank, Nepal Rastra Bank, foreign currency reserves fell by more than 16% to 1.17tn Nepali rupees ($9.59bn; £7.36bn) in the seven months to the middle of February. Over the same period, the amount of money sent to Nepal by people working abroad fell by almost 5%. Narayan Prasad Pokharel, deputy spokesperson at the central bank, told the Reuters news agency that the institution believed the country's foreign currency reserves were ""under pressure"".  ""Something must be done to restrict the import of non-essential goods, without affecting the supply of essential goods,"" Mr Pokharel said.  He added that importers were allowed to bring in 50 ""luxurious goods"" if they paid for them in full. ""This is not banning the imports but discouraging them,"" Mr Pokharel said. Last week, Nepal's government removed central bank governor Maha Prasad Adhikari from his role, without giving a reason for the decision. Government debt in Nepal has risen to more than 43% of its gross domestic product, as officials increased spending to help cushion the economic impact of pandemic, Nepal's finance ministry said on Monday. The ministry also said indicators of the country's economic health were ""normal"".  ""However, due to some pressures in the external sector, some steps have already been taken to manage imports and increase foreign exchange reserve,"" it said in a statement.  Earlier in the day, finance minister Janardan Sharma said Nepal's debt was lower than other countries in the region and elsewhere. Mr Sharma told reporters: ""I am surprised why people are comparing with Sri Lanka"". The island nation is facing its most serious economic crisis since independence from the UK in 1948. Alex Holmes, an emerging markets economist at research firm Capital Economics also told the BBC that the situation in Nepal appears ""much better than in Sri Lanka"". Nepal's foreign currency reserves are double what is considered ""a comfortable minimum"" and government debt ""is not particularly high"", Mr Holmes said. ""Of course, things will eventually regress if the current account deficit does not narrow,"" he added. ""But crisis does not appear imminent"". Last week, Sri Lanka named a new central bank chief and almost doubled its key interest rate to help tackle soaring prices and shortages of essential goods. In recent weeks, demonstrators have taken to the streets of the capital Colombo as homes and businesses were hit with long power cuts. Sri Lankans are faced with shortages and rising inflation after the country steeply devalued its currency last month ahead of talks with the International Monetary Fund over a bailout."
economic indicators,Santander ups mortgage rates despite competition,2024-09-15,2024-01-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68075289,"One of the UK's biggest banks, Santander, has raised mortgage rates despite fierce competition among lenders in recent weeks. Santander will nudge up rates by up to 0.20 percentage points on some fixed rate products from Wednesday. It bucks wider trends with Nationwide among the latest to reduce rates. Analysts said they still expect the benchmark interest rate to be cut this year despite worries about inflation. The move by Santander came after official figures recently showed that inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, unexpectedly ticked up to 4% in December. ""Lenders' margins at the moment are tight, so this increase will be expected,"" said Elliott Culley, director of Switch Mortgage Finance.  ""Borrowers should not panic as its unlikely this will be a trend and overall across the year, predictions are for rates to fall further"". Mortgage rates reached their highest level in 15 years in 2023 as the Bank of England raised interest rates in an attempt to rein in rising prices. In theory, by making borrowing more expensive and dissuading people from taking out loans, such moves cool down the economy, easing pressures pushing up prices. But the higher interest rates also led some landlords to increase rents and made homebuying more expensive, exacerbating what has been described as a cost-of-living crisis. About 1.6 million existing borrowers have relatively cheap fixed-rate deals expiring this year and are facing the prospect of more expensive deals. More recently, however, as prices have eased, many lenders have been cutting rates, providing some relief. The average rate on a two-year fixed deal has dropped to 5.62% compared with 5.93% at the start of the year, according to financial information service Moneyfacts. ""While rates are not as cheap as they used to be, they are significantly better than they were"", said Aaron Strutt from Trinity Financial.  ""We have been saying for a while that rates may start to level off and there may not be many more price reductions for a while, but the pricing improvements keep coming"". Britain's biggest building society, Nationwide, on Wednesday said that its new products would include a five-year fixed-rate mortgage at 3.85% for new customers with a 40% deposit who are moving home. The deal has a £1,499 fee. But its chief economist, Robert Gardiner, warned that upheaval in the Red Sea was ""part of a broader picture of uncertainty"", and could pose a ""serious risk"" to inflation in the UK if it starts to impact trade significantly. Some analysts said that Santander's move to raise rates might be precautionary, amid predictions that the Bank of England may not cut rates as early as some have forecast. A Santander spokesman said that the lender ""reviews its rates based on a number of factors, such as wider market conditions including swap rates"", which are a leading indicator for mortgage rates.

economic indicators,UK economy rebounds more slowly than expected,2024-09-15,2020-07-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53400721,"The UK's economy rebounded more slowly than expected in May, growing just 1.8% from the previous month, as the gradual easing of lockdown had a modest impact. Manufacturing and house building showed signs of recovery in May as some firms saw staff return to work.  But the Office for National Statistics said the economy was ""in the doldrums"". As a result of big contractions in previous months, the UK economy is now 24.5% smaller than it was in February, the ONS added. The return to economic growth in May was described as ""disappointing"" by economists, who had expected an expansion of 5% or more. The increase came after a fall of 6.9% in March and a record 20.4% decline in April. In the three months to May, the economy shrank by 19.1% compared with the previous three-month period, the ONS said. ""The economy was still a quarter smaller in May than in February, before the full effects of the pandemic struck,"" said Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS. ""In the important services sector, we saw some pick-up in retail, which saw record online sales. However, with lockdown restrictions remaining in place, many other services remained in the doldrums, with a number of areas seeing further declines."" Mr Athow told the BBC's Today programme that there could be signs of improvement in next month's release of figures. ""Some of the survey data we're seeing suggests that as more of the economy reopened and as some of the restrictions were eased, we did see stronger performance in June, but it's really early,"" he said.  ""You've got one month of firm data and some indicators suggesting June might be stronger, but there's a long road to go here and we're still trying to figure out what the best data is to understand the overall picture."" May's modest month-on-month expansion came as sectors such as manufacturing, construction, DIY retailers and garden centres were allowed to reopen.  Manufacturing grew by more than 8% during the month, as did construction. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the sum (measured in pounds) of the value of goods and services produced in the economy. But the measurement most people focus on is the percentage change - the growth of the country's economy over a period of time, typically a quarter (three months) or a year. It's been used since the 1940s. It's the main way of determining the health of the UK economy. ""Today's figures underline the scale of the challenge we face,"" said Chancellor Rishi Sunak. ""I know people are worried about the security of their jobs and incomes. That's why I set out our Plan for Jobs last week, following the PM's new deal for Britain, to protect, support and create jobs as we safely reopen our economy. ""Our clear plan invests up to £30bn in significant and targeted support to put people's livelihoods at the centre of our national renewal as we emerge through the other side of this crisis."" A quarter of the economy's output was lost under lockdown in March and April, and May's figures show even firms who are back in business may be struggling to get on track. It's one thing being allowed to open the doors again (and some firms remain mothballed); another to be confident you can do so safely. And then there's the biggest hurdle of all, ensuring customers are willing and able to spend again.  As job losses mount, it clear that even some firms who qualify for government help are faltering. Some won't have made it as far. The Bank of England's own chief economist is among those who've voiced hopes for a ""V-shaped"" recovery - a swift and full bounce back in activity.  But history tells us that economies can take years to make up lost ground after a slump. The blow from this crisis was felt within days, convalescence may be tougher. And in the meantime, the livelihoods of many may feel the strain.  The British Chambers of Commerce said May's ""modest rally"" in economic growth did little to alter ""the UK's historically downbeat growth trajectory"".   ""The pick-up in output in May is more likely to reflect the partial release of pent-up demand as restrictions began to loosen rather than evidence of a genuine recovery,"" said the BCC's head of economics, Suren Thiru.  ""While UK economic output may grow further in the short term as restrictions ease, this may dissipate as the economic scarring caused by the pandemic starts to bite, particularly as government support winds down.""  Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the data showed the recovery was ""maybe not so V-shaped after all"" - a reference to remarks last month by Bank of England economist Andy Haldane, who said the UK was on track for a quick recovery. He said May's figure was ""a disappointing first step on the road to recovery"" and suggested that ""hopes of a rapid rebound from the lockdown are wide of the mark"".  ""Indeed, the path to full economic recovery will probably be much longer than most people anticipate,"" he added. Has your business or job been affected by the economic downturn?

Other prices - especially for food - are also surging, which could lead the inflation rate beyond 15%. All that is before the impact of further falls in the value of Sterling. Meanwhile, interest rates are on the rise, not just for families, but also for companies and the government itself. It is a toxic economic cocktail, and will require judicious, credible, and timely interventions. Nick Triggle, health correspondent NHS performance has been deteriorating for the best part of a decade, but the pandemic has exacerbated its problems even further. Record numbers are on hospital waiting lists - nearly one in eight people are currently waiting for treatment. Meanwhile, emergency services are warning patients are being harmed because of delays responding to 999 calls and long waits in A&E.  There is the threat of industrial action, with unions unhappy with pay. And all this is happening ahead of winter, with the prospect of flu and Covid circulating at high levels for the first time. Part of the problem hospitals are facing is the inability to discharge patients when they are medically fit to leave because of a lack of social care places.  The government does have a plan for social care - the care cap - but that is about protecting people's assets rather than providing more funding for services. Even then, there has been debate about whether the government is right to increase national insurance to pay for it, in part because of rising inflation.  James Landale, diplomatic correspondent Boris Johnson offered Ukraine early political and military support. The new prime minister is expected to maintain that approach and is likely to be willing to provide Ukraine with more weapons as the conflict progresses.  But as time goes by, the new prime minister may face a growing challenge of convincing doubters at home and abroad that the economic price of supporting Ukraine is worth it. With rising energy costs exacerbating the cost-of-living crisis, the PM will have to persuade voters that their financial discomfort is needed to defend Ukraine.  There will also be a big job of diplomacy to protect the pro-Ukraine alliance across Europe. There may well be countries that want to seek an accommodation with Russia and end the fighting to help secure their energy supplies.   Ione Wells, political correspondent After months of infighting, uniting the Conservative party is the main political challenge. And party unity will face an early test: the privileges committee investigation into whether Boris Johnson misled MPs over Downing Street parties.  If the committee of MPs recommends a punishment for Mr Johnson, MPs will need to vote on it. The prime minister will have to decide whether to let Tories vote how they want, or whether to instruct them to vote a certain way. Whipping them to vote for a sanction could anger those who support Boris Johnson, but the opposite approach risks accusations of trying to cover up wrongdoing.  Why does Tory infighting matter when there are pressing concerns, like the cost of living? Firstly, because governments with divided parties can struggle to pass policies that matter to people's lives. Secondly, it can be hard - as Mr Johnson discovered - to land your messages with the public if ministers spend more time on the airwaves trying to defend various behavioural issues, rather than policies.  Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political correspondent The next PM will quickly face a conundrum over the Northern Ireland protocol. Talks with the EU all but ground to a halt after the government introduced a bill to give UK ministers powers to override parts of the post-Brexit trading arrangements.   The Democratic Unionist Party declared it won't form a power-sharing government at Stormont until the protocol is changed, arguing it damages Northern Ireland's position within the UK. The key date is 28 October, the deadline for restoring government at Stormont.  After that date, the government will either have to call a fresh assembly election, draw up legislation for a new deadline, or begin taking more decisions for Northern Ireland from Westminster. The PM will also have to bear in mind that most Northern Irish politicians want the protocol to remain and won't shy from laying blame at the door of Downing Street.   Glenn Campbell, BBC Scotland News political editor Theresa May made the trip to Scotland on her first full day in office. Boris Johnson arranged his meeting within a week. It's not clear whether the new prime minister will be in quite the same hurry to go at a time when Nicola Sturgeon is pressing for an agreement to hold another independence referendum, in 2023.  In October, the UK Supreme Court will be asked to consider whether or not Holyrood has the power to hold IndyRef2 without Westminster's consent. The weight of legal opinion suggests the answer may be no but if the case goes the other way, the PM would face a big call: allow the vote to go ahead or take active steps to stop it.  In resisting Scottish independence, any prime minister must be careful not to choose an approach that risks undermining support for the union further.  Jonah Fisher, BBC environment correspondent In the midst of a gas price crisis, the new prime minister will very rapidly have to make decisions on energy that could set us on course to make, or break, the UK's commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  Will they prioritise the push for more renewables against the demands from some that they look again at the fossil fuels that already warm our planet? Should new oil and gas projects be greenlighted in the North Sea? Will the new leader give any encouragement to the UK fracking industry? As part of the net zero strategy, the government has committed to decarbonise the generation of electricity by 2035. For that to happen there will need to be a massive expansion in renewable energy. Offshore wind is already a British success story, but the fastest renewable projects from conception to completion are on land - solar and onshore wind.  Both are currently stymied by the planning process. Could that be simplified to speed up the transition to renewables? Early indications are that the answer will be no."
economic indicators,Annual housebuilding target not yet met,2024-09-15,2023-11-29,Becky Morton & Alex Forsyth,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67564451,"The government fell short of its annual housing target again last year, according to new figures. There were 234,397 net additional dwellings in England in 2022/23, a similar figure to the previous year. The 2019 Conservative manifesto promised to build 300,000 homes a year in England by the mid-2020s. However, the government has said it is on track to meet its target of one million more homes by the end of this Parliament. The number of net additional dwellings includes new builds, houses being converted to flats, or commercial buildings switching to domestic use, as well reflecting demolished homes. Housebuilding reached a peak in 2019-20, with 248,591 net additional dwellings - the highest figure for any financial year so far this century.  Numbers fell during the pandemic, partly due to Covid restrictions, before picking up again.  However the post-Covid recovery in housebuilding now appears to have stalled.  There was little change from the 2021-22 figure, which was 234,462, according to data published by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. Are you struggling to get on the property ladder? Get in touch. The Home Builders Federation said while the latest figures only covered up to March 2023, ""all leading indicators show rapid slides in future output"".  A spokesman said: ""Weakening the requirements of councils to plan for the homes communities need and a lack of local authority capacity to process planning applications has seen investment in new sites collapse and a lack of support for buyers is further driving down delivery."" Earlier this month, the government announced it wanted to remove the requirement for planning permission to convert a house into two flats, to help boost new homes. It hopes to implement the changes next year, following a consultation.  In 2022-23 there were 4,499 additional homes created from conversions between houses and flats.  Kayleigh Wrigg, 28, and her partner Connor have been together for nine years, but live separately with their parents in Bedfordshire as they try to save to buy a house.  She says owning their own home feels ""barely achievable"", despite both of them working full-time.  ""The house prices are just insane,"" she told the BBC. ""If we went further north we could potentially look at it but that's moving further away from everything we know and love.""  However, there is often a tension between the demand for new housing and the impact on existing communities. Murray and Jane Stewart are among residents opposing proposals for 3,750 new homes near Barton-le-Clay in Bedfordshire. The applicants describe the proposed development as a ""highly-sustainable community"" which would deliver family housing, rental properties and affordable homes along with local facilities.  But Murray and Jane have concerns about the proximity to flood plains, heritage sites and protected areas, as well as a lack of infrastructure.  ""We're a long way from everything,"" Jane said. ""Thousands of cars would be driving through tiny narrow roads, villages without pavements."" Murray added: ""It's very hard to get a GP appointment, as in many parts of the country. Where would people go to work? There's no employment."" The couple stress they are not opposed to housebuilding, but say the current system does not always deliver the right homes in the right places. ""It's about how you build, not whether you build,"" Murray said.  ""There's a lot of acceptance that we need better housing stock, we need social housing... But certainly the impact on infrastructure has left people feeling they're left behind, and there's a sort of lottery nature of how development happens that gives people a sense of uncertainty and unsettledness."" Housebuilding is expected to be a key battleground at the next general election, which must be held by January 2025.  In December, the government said councils would get more flexibility over meeting centrally-set housing need targets, after a threatened rebellion by some Tory MPs.  Critics of the government-set targets had argued they undermined powers of local councils to decide where building takes place. But others have raised concerns the changes will lead to fewer homes being built. Labour has pledged to restore local housing targets and ""bulldoze"" through planning rules to build 1.5 million homes during the five years of the next Parliament, if it wins power. This broadly matches the government's annual target of 300,000 new homes.  Shadow housing secretary Angela Rayner said: ""When swift and meaningful action is required, this government is taking us backwards, with fewer houses delivered than last year and a generation locked out of a secure home."" Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said: ""Today's statistics show that despite the escalating housing emergency, very little has changed in a year and we are still miles away from building the number of homes we need."" She called for ""urgent action"" and a commitment from all political parties ""to build a new generation of safe and affordable social homes with rents tied to local incomes"". A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: ""We need to build more homes, but the latest figures show that despite the difficult economic climate we are on track to meet the manifesto commitment of delivering one million homes over this Parliament.  ""Backed by £10bn investment in housing supply since the start of this Parliament we are making good progress and our long-term housing plan will allow us to go further and build the homes we need."""
economic indicators,Typical energy bill set to rise by £800 a year,2024-09-15,2022-05-24,Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61562657,"The typical household energy bill is set to rise by about £800 a year in October, the energy regulator warns. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley said the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, is expected to increase to £2,800 a year, due to continued volatility in gas prices.  Mr Brearley said the price rises were a ""once in a generation event not seen since the oil crisis in the 1970s"". He added the number of households in fuel poverty may double to 12 million. A household is in fuel poverty when it has to spend 10% or more of its disposable income on energy.  The energy price cap already rose sharply in April to £1,971, meaning that homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying an extra £700 per year on average. Mr Brearley told the business select committee of MPs that Ofgem was only part way through reviewing prices ahead of setting the next cap in October, but added: ""We are expecting a price cap in the region of £2,800.""  It means the typical household bill could rise by £800 per year. Ofgem's price cap covers England Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland does not have a price cap, but households have also been witnessing sharp price rises. Mr Brearley said that conditions in the global gas market had ""worsened"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has led to concerns about potential supply issues. He warned that the price cap could rise beyond £2,800 if Russia - one of the world's largest exporters of natural gas - decided to disrupt supplies. ""We are really managing between two versions of events,"" he said. ""One where the price falls back down to where it was before, for example if there's peace in Ukraine, but one where prices could go even further if we were to see, for example, a disruptive interruption of gas from Russia."" Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, so sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising on global markets as demand in Europe increased.  ""The price changes we have seen in the gas market are genuinely a once-in-a-generation event not seen since the oil crisis of the 1970s,"" Mr Brearley told the Business select committee. But the Ofgem boss apologised for regulatory shortcomings and admitted had financial controls been in place sooner for suppliers, fewer firms would have gone bust due to being unprepared for the sharp rise in wholesale prices. We are all getting used to bill shocks when it comes to paying for gas and electricity - but this could be the biggest of all. Regulators do not usually give such early indications of the costs to come, which makes the seriousness of the situation all the more obvious. Some 23 million households have their domestic energy bill governed by the price cap. In April, they typically started paying £700 a year more. In October, according to Mr Brearley, it could be a further annual rise of £800. The trouble is, the old way of tackling this is as a billpayer was to shop around for a better tariff. That option is no longer available. Analysts say the average price of the cheapest 10 fixed tariffs on the market is £3,685 a year - clearly a poor financial choice. So that leaves people to budget and use savings as best they can, and leaves ministers under even greater pressure to offer more support, especially during the colder, darker, more expensive months ahead. Later on Tuesday, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told MPs people will have to ""wait and see what's forthcoming"" from the chancellor and the prime minister on further help on energy bills as he said economic growth was the ""time honoured way"" to help people. Mr Kwarteng said the government had put forward £9.1bn in support for energy bills, including council tax and energy bill rebates, and an extension of the Warm Home Discount. He added that the government had been waiting to see where gas prices were heading before making a decision on further assistance. ""What we see now isn't the full picture. Both the prime minister and the chancellor say there is more to do, and we have to see what is forthcoming"", Mr Kwarteng told the committee. The Labour committee chairman, Darren Jones, asked the business secretary if he thought ""bill payers are happy with that answer? Just wait and see?"". Mr Kwarteng acknowledged it was ""a difficult time"" and ""people are under huge stress"" but added that ""nobody is suggesting that the government can pay the entirety of the energy bill"".  ""What we are committed to is giving support, and that's what we're doing,"" he said. Asked by Mr Jones what he thought about the prospect of a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas companies, Mr Kwarteng said he didn't think it supported investment. In response to Ofgem's price cap forecast, Downing Street acknowledged that energy prices were a ""significant challenge"", but said the government was ""actively looking at what more could be done in this space"". Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned: ""How many more alarm bells does the chancellor need to hear before he acts? ""The government have got to get a grip on this crisis and to protect families and our economy."" Ms Reeves repeated her party's call for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits to help lower bills for households. Recently, Shell reported a record £7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made £5bn, the highest for 10 years.

economic indicators,Algeria election - what you need to know,2024-09-15,2017-05-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39773471,"Algerian voters go to the polls on 4 May to elect a new parliament amid uncertainty over the health of the country's ailing president, dwindling oil revenues, and instability on the borders with neighbouring countries. Ruling officials have been campaigning on one key slogan: Stability. But delivering on this promise will be a tall order for a number of reasons. In a political system which remains essentially presidential in nature, the poor health of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika is a major concern.  President Bouteflika has looked frail during recent public appearances While his rule has been criticised for corruption and a lack of political freedom, he has overseen a period of relative stability and prosperity following a decade-long civil war in the 1990s. But economic difficulties caused by falling oil prices have seen austerity imposed on the country.   Sectors such as construction have been hard-hit, with government infrastructure projects put on hold and imports of building materials restricted. The country has seen austerity imposed in recent years The country could be driven to cut its large military spending because of austerity measures. This comes at a time of increased security threats posed by instability and jihadist militants in neighbouring Niger and Libya, and a tense stand-off with Morocco over the status of Western Sahara. Algerian MPs are elected by direct universal suffrage for a five-year term in the 462-seat lower house.  Seats are allocated proportionally according to the number of votes obtained by party lists. Eight seats are reserved for Algerian expatriate communities in four overseas districts. ""Make your voice heard,"" says this Algiers election poster urging people to vote More than 23m people are eligible to vote for 11,334 candidates from 50 different political parties, as well as a handful of independents. The role of parliament has been gradually expanding since changes to constitutional law were introduced in 1989. Following a constitutional amendment introduced last year, parliament will for the first time be consulted before a new prime minister is named by the president. However, it cannot withdraw confidence from the nominee. The National Liberation Front (FLN) is Algeria's long-time ruling party, and draws its legitimacy from its key role in the war of independence against the French.  Djamel Ould Abbes leads the FLN Leader Djamel Ould Abbes claims to be a war hero, but some war veterans have disputed his past as a revolutionary.  In the last parliament, the FLN formed a ruling coalition with the National Democratic Rally (RND), and commanded a large majority. The two parties are almost assured of taking a large number of seats in the next parliament. Indications in recent months suggest that the authorities are seeking to coax more parties into the coalition to shore up the ruling majority in troubled times.  An Algerian National Liberation Front rally in Algiers The current opposition, comprising a mixture of reformist insiders, Islamists, and left-wing parties, is set to change. A recent ruling which allows parties to form electoral alliances may provide a path for Islamists to re-establish themselves as a potent force in parliament.  The authorities have ordered imams to call on worshippers to take part in the polls in order to boost turnout. The non-Islamist opposition has only a slim chance of success.

economic indicators,"Wine, gin and whisky prices up ahead of Christmas",2024-09-15,2022-12-14,Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63963485,"The cost of going out drinking has increased ahead of Christmas, with wine, gin and whisky prices rising. All alcohol prices rose last month at pubs, restaurants and cafes, with the cost of bitter and lager also up. The amount you pay for a night out is now increasing at its fastest rate since 1991, official figures show.  It came as overall inflation - the rate at which prices rise - eased slightly but the cost of living is still rising at its fastest pace in 40 years. Prices increased by 10.7% in the year to November, compared with 11.1% in October, leading some analysts to predict that soaring inflation may now slowly begin to fall. Inflation is a measure of the cost of living and to calculate it, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) keeps track of the prices of hundreds of everyday items. Lower inflation does not mean the prices of goods will go down, just that they will stop rising as quickly.  The fall in the overall rate of inflation in November was due to petrol prices easing from record highs, and lower prices for second hand cars. However, the price of drinking alcohol in pubs, restaurants and cafes rose between October and November, compared with falls a year ago, when some businesses offered discounts. The biggest price rise was for whisky, up 7.8% in the month, while gin, draught premium lager, draught bitter and wine by the glass were up by between 1.2% and 1.7%. The price of eating out and getting takeaways also increased slightly, while grocery bills continued to rise.  While the prices of drinks tend to be volatile, pubs and restaurants have been forced to put up prices as they struggle with soaring energy bills, higher wholesale costs and rising wages.  The boss of one pub chain has warned pubs face a ""bleak"" future as costs climb and customers rein in their spending. Kate Nicholls, the head of industry group UK Hospitality boss, said: ""While the headline rate of inflation has reduced slightly, it remains the case that hospitality businesses are seeing intense inflation in every aspect of their operations.""  This inflation ""will not disappear overnight"", she added, and prices could rise further in March if the government ends its energy bill support for hospitality businesses. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association said the last thing pubs wanted to do was put prices up, but added ""without let up in rising overheads, it's difficult to see how many will carry on"". ""Many [pubs] just managed to pull through the pandemic, but what we are facing now is crippling businesses at an unprecedented rate,"" she said. Billy Williams, who runs Reading Winter Wonderland, said he had noticed a rise in phone calls asking for group discounts on rides at the annual Christmas event. ""A lot of people are paying with credit cards now rather than debit cards,"" he added. He said entry to the event was still free and ticket prices for attractions had not gone up for three years, but that could change as his overheads rise.  ""There is going to come a time if prices keep increasing that we will have to pass that on to customers,"" he told the BBC. The dip in the overall rate of inflation in the year to November should be the start of a few months of falls. October's four-decade high now looks to have been the peak. But inflation will remain very high for months to come. Even in the latest figures, food price rises reached new 45-year highs of 16.5%, as is evident in the shops. But its not just petrol prices contributing to a slowing of the inflation rate. Other commodity prices and transport costs are on their way down. The fall in the price of used cars - one of the first indicators of the inflationary pressures last summer - is now accelerating. While households still face an historic squeeze from the cost of living, the Bank of England may feel able to slow up on rises in interest rates, especially given expectations a recession has already started.  In the absence of further shocks to the world economy, it may be that the very worst is now behind us. Is Inflation now going to start falling? Consumer prices have been rising this year as energy, fuel and food costs soar due to the war in Ukraine and Covid.  But while the inflation rate eased in November, households are still facing a ""tough winter ahead"", warned Joanna Elson, chief executive of debt charity the Money Advice Trust. She said government support for energy bills would provide some relief, but that the challenge of affording essentials such as food and heating ""isn't going away... and for many is only set to get harder with the cold weather"".  Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said tackling inflation remained his ""top priority"", and suggested November's fall did not mean it could raise public sector pay. Anger over how it has lagged behind soaring prices has led to widespread strikes. ""I know it is tough for many right now, but it is vital that we take the tough decisions needed to tackle inflation - the number one enemy that makes everyone poorer. If we make the wrong choices now, high prices will persist and prolong the pain for millions."" But shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""The question people across Britain will be asking themselves this morning is: 'Do I and my family feel better off under the Tories?' The answer will be no."" Leading economists including Paul Dales of Capital Economics and Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said that November's figure showed inflation had UK peaked and price rises would continue to slow down. But Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, told the BBC's Today programme that it was ""too early"" to tell. ""We've only one fall from a 40-year high so let's wait a few months and see how it goes,"" he said. November's fall also didn't change expectations that UK interest rates will raise interest rates again on Thursday. The Bank of England has been increasing rates to try to curb inflation. Putting up interest rates can mean people are more likely to save money, and less likely to borrow money.  In theory this means they have less money to spend so will buy fewer things, which should help stop prices rising as quickly. Interest rates are expected to increase from 3% to 3.5%."
economic indicators,Retail sales fall in February as restrictions ease,2024-09-15,2022-03-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60871594,"UK retail sales fell by 0.3% in February as online sales fell and stormy weather deterred some shoppers. Falls in alcohol and tobacco sales may have been linked to increased confidence in going out to pubs and restaurants, the Office for National Statistics said. Online sales volumes fell by 4.8% over the month following strong growth in December and January. February's unexpected sales fall followed a 1.9% rise in January. ""After a buoyant January, retail sales fell back a little last month,"" said Heather Bovill, ONS deputy director for surveys and economic indicators. ""There was a notable decline for companies that predominantly trade online, following a strong performance over the festive and new year period."" She pointed out that more consumers went out to pubs and restaurants during the month, hitting retail food sales. More socialising, as well as many of us returning to the workplace, meant it was a good month for clothing and department stores with people looking to expand their wardrobe. But household goods and many other stores reported a decrease, she said. ""Feedback suggested February's stormy weather could have had an impact, while increased travel following the lifting of England's Plan B restrictions at the end of January drove fuel sales above their pre-pandemic level for the first time,"" Ms Bovill added. While online sales volumes fell in February, that followed strong rises in December and in January. And the online sales boom helped by the Covid pandemic continues, with sales volumes in February still 33.2% above their pre-coronavirus February 2020 levels. But the proportion of retail sales that were online fell to 27.8% in February 2022, the lowest proportion since before the pandemic lockdowns in March 2020 when it stood at 22.7%. ""February's fall in retail sales certainly wasn't unexpected for the small shops on the UK's high streets,"" said government High Streets Task Force expert and ShopAppy founder, Dr Jackie Mulligan. ""Fortunately, weekly footfall on the UK high street started to pick up in March, as the weather improved, but in February the thousands of businesses we work with said it was extremely challenging and this data reflects that."" Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said that despite a strong recovery by the retail sector over the last year, ""there are already signs that the cost-of-living crisis is hitting confidence"".  ""Almost all of the slowdown in sales in February was accounted for by a decline in non-grocery sales,"" she added. And the coming months could be disruptive for retailers, said Aled Patchett, head of retail and consumer goods at Lloyds Bank.  ""The impact felt from the cost of living crisis is expected to become particularly acute quite quickly,"" he said. ""There is also the effect the conflict in Ukraine is having on certain supply chains, still struggling to recover from the strains of the last two years, and the uncertainty the situation creates for businesses. "" Struggling households are facing increased pressure from rising prices with inflation up 6.2% in the 12 months to February - the fastest rise for 30 years. Prices are outpacing wages and the Bank of England thinks inflation could hit double digits this year."
economic indicators,Inflation hits NI economy as business demand falls,2024-09-15,2022-08-15,Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62525332,"Record inflation has taken its toll on the Northern Ireland economy and caused a fall in demand last month, according to a survey by Ulster Bank. Every month it asks firms about things like staffing levels, new orders and exports. The survey is considered a reliable indicator of economic performance. In July, business activity in Northern Ireland fell at the fastest rate since February 2021, with a drop in both output and new orders. Outside of the Covid pandemic and lockdown restrictions, it was the sharpest contraction since November 2012. The drop in demand was seen across all sectors of the economy but was most marked in retail. Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank's chief economist in Northern Ireland, said: ""Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the cost-of-living crisis, retail recorded the steepest declines in sales and orders. ""Retail sales have plunged over the last three months and retailers expect sales to be broadly unchanged in 12 months' time."" The only positive in the survey was that firms were still taking on more staff.  Mr Ramsey added: ""Employment continues to be a bright spot with all four sectors increasing their staffing levels in July. ""But with the Bank of England forecasting a UK recession, a softening in the labour market will be expected going into 2023. ""That said, the labour market is likely to be much more robust this time than in previous recessions."""
economic indicators,Economy growing but inflation hitting confidence,2024-09-15,2022-04-11,John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-61065161,"Northern Ireland's private sector continued to grow in March but inflation is hitting new orders and business confidence, a survey suggests. The Ulster Bank's monthly survey of private sector activity is considered to be a reliable indicator of the economy. It suggests retail, services and manufacturing all saw growth in March. However construction, which has been most exposed to supply chain problems, reported a fall in output. The bank's chief economist Richard Ramsey said weakening new orders and persistently high inflation meant businesses were anticipating a weaker performance later in the year. ""With these inflationary pressures, combined with supply chain disruption and ongoing skills shortages, private sector firms reported a big fall in confidence regarding the year ahead,"" said the economist. Most sectors anticipate output will still rise in the next year, but their expectations have moderated. ""Manufacturing is still the most optimistic sector, followed by services,"" Mr Ramsey said. ""But construction firms expect no growth over the next year and retailers anticipate a fall in output."" This survey echoes findings from the NI Chamber of Commerce. Last week it said its members had experienced a continued recovery in the first quarter of 2022 but were less confident about the rest of the year."
economic indicators,High costs and falling confidence hit NI economy,2024-09-15,2022-07-11,John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62115257,"The Northern Ireland economy is losing momentum as high costs and falling confidence hit business performance, an Ulster Bank survey suggests. The bank's monthly survey of about 200 firms is considered to be a reliable indicator of the private sector. It suggests that manufacturing, construction, retail and other services all saw a decline in business activity during June. Business confidence also fell to its lowest level in almost two years. Ulster Bank's chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said: ""The cost-of-living crisis had already become increasingly evident in May with a slump in retail demand with this trend continuing in June."" He said June also appeared to have been a poor month for manufacturing with sharp falls in business activity and new orders. ""Anecdotal evidence indicated that the main factor underlying falls in both output and new business was sharply rising prices, with customers increasingly hesitant to commit to new projects,"" he added. Last week official data suggested that the output of the economy in Northern Ireland reached a 15-year high in the first quarter of this year. However economic conditions have deteriorated since then as businesses and consumers attempt to deal with rapidly rising prices. The Bank of England has warned the UK faces a ""sharp economic slowdown"" this year. The bank's policymakers expect the UK economy to shrink rather than expand in the final three months of the year. It also expects the economy to contract by 0.25% in 2023, down from its previous forecast of 1.25% growth."
economic indicators,"Wine, gin and whisky prices up ahead of Christmas",2024-09-15,2022-12-14,Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63963485,"The cost of going out drinking has increased ahead of Christmas, with wine, gin and whisky prices rising. All alcohol prices rose last month at pubs, restaurants and cafes, with the cost of bitter and lager also up. The amount you pay for a night out is now increasing at its fastest rate since 1991, official figures show.  It came as overall inflation - the rate at which prices rise - eased slightly but the cost of living is still rising at its fastest pace in 40 years. Prices increased by 10.7% in the year to November, compared with 11.1% in October, leading some analysts to predict that soaring inflation may now slowly begin to fall. Inflation is a measure of the cost of living and to calculate it, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) keeps track of the prices of hundreds of everyday items. Lower inflation does not mean the prices of goods will go down, just that they will stop rising as quickly.  The fall in the overall rate of inflation in November was due to petrol prices easing from record highs, and lower prices for second hand cars. However, the price of drinking alcohol in pubs, restaurants and cafes rose between October and November, compared with falls a year ago, when some businesses offered discounts. The biggest price rise was for whisky, up 7.8% in the month, while gin, draught premium lager, draught bitter and wine by the glass were up by between 1.2% and 1.7%. The price of eating out and getting takeaways also increased slightly, while grocery bills continued to rise.  While the prices of drinks tend to be volatile, pubs and restaurants have been forced to put up prices as they struggle with soaring energy bills, higher wholesale costs and rising wages.  The boss of one pub chain has warned pubs face a ""bleak"" future as costs climb and customers rein in their spending. Kate Nicholls, the head of industry group UK Hospitality boss, said: ""While the headline rate of inflation has reduced slightly, it remains the case that hospitality businesses are seeing intense inflation in every aspect of their operations.""  This inflation ""will not disappear overnight"", she added, and prices could rise further in March if the government ends its energy bill support for hospitality businesses. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association said the last thing pubs wanted to do was put prices up, but added ""without let up in rising overheads, it's difficult to see how many will carry on"". ""Many [pubs] just managed to pull through the pandemic, but what we are facing now is crippling businesses at an unprecedented rate,"" she said. Billy Williams, who runs Reading Winter Wonderland, said he had noticed a rise in phone calls asking for group discounts on rides at the annual Christmas event. ""A lot of people are paying with credit cards now rather than debit cards,"" he added. He said entry to the event was still free and ticket prices for attractions had not gone up for three years, but that could change as his overheads rise.  ""There is going to come a time if prices keep increasing that we will have to pass that on to customers,"" he told the BBC. The dip in the overall rate of inflation in the year to November should be the start of a few months of falls. October's four-decade high now looks to have been the peak. But inflation will remain very high for months to come. Even in the latest figures, food price rises reached new 45-year highs of 16.5%, as is evident in the shops. But its not just petrol prices contributing to a slowing of the inflation rate. Other commodity prices and transport costs are on their way down. The fall in the price of used cars - one of the first indicators of the inflationary pressures last summer - is now accelerating. While households still face an historic squeeze from the cost of living, the Bank of England may feel able to slow up on rises in interest rates, especially given expectations a recession has already started.  In the absence of further shocks to the world economy, it may be that the very worst is now behind us. Is Inflation now going to start falling? Consumer prices have been rising this year as energy, fuel and food costs soar due to the war in Ukraine and Covid.  But while the inflation rate eased in November, households are still facing a ""tough winter ahead"", warned Joanna Elson, chief executive of debt charity the Money Advice Trust. She said government support for energy bills would provide some relief, but that the challenge of affording essentials such as food and heating ""isn't going away... and for many is only set to get harder with the cold weather"".  Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said tackling inflation remained his ""top priority"", and suggested November's fall did not mean it could raise public sector pay. Anger over how it has lagged behind soaring prices has led to widespread strikes. ""I know it is tough for many right now, but it is vital that we take the tough decisions needed to tackle inflation - the number one enemy that makes everyone poorer. If we make the wrong choices now, high prices will persist and prolong the pain for millions."" But shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""The question people across Britain will be asking themselves this morning is: 'Do I and my family feel better off under the Tories?' The answer will be no."" Leading economists including Paul Dales of Capital Economics and Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said that November's figure showed inflation had UK peaked and price rises would continue to slow down. But Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, told the BBC's Today programme that it was ""too early"" to tell. ""We've only one fall from a 40-year high so let's wait a few months and see how it goes,"" he said. November's fall also didn't change expectations that UK interest rates will raise interest rates again on Thursday. The Bank of England has been increasing rates to try to curb inflation. Putting up interest rates can mean people are more likely to save money, and less likely to borrow money.  In theory this means they have less money to spend so will buy fewer things, which should help stop prices rising as quickly. Interest rates are expected to increase from 3% to 3.5%."
economic indicators,The surprising countries where happiness is rising,2024-09-15,2024-04-12,Lindsey Galloway,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240411-the-european-region-where-young-people-are-happiest,"Czech Republic, Lithuania and Romania are all newly high on this year's World Happiness Report – and score especially high when it comes to happiness for people aged under 30. When the annual World Happiness Report was released in March 2024, it was no surprise to see Scandinavian countries like Finland, Denmark, Iceland and Sweden continue to top the list. But in a surprising trend, a new set of countries has seen its rankings quietly, but steadily, march up the ranks. Over the past three years, Central and Eastern European countries have overtaken some of their Western European neighbours in overall happiness, according to the survey. For the first time, the Czech Republic and Lithuania have cracked the top 20 this year, placing 18th and 19th respectively, with Slovenia closely chasing behind at number 21. (For comparison, the UK is ranked 20th, Germany is 24th, Spain is 36th and Italy is 41st) What's especially interesting is that, in many of these countries, the bump is directly attributable to the growing happiness of younger residents. In fact, Lithuania ranks at number one in the report's Happiness of the Young report (as measured by respondents younger than 30), with Serbia at 3, Romania at 8, the Czech Republic at 10 and Slovenia at 15. Residents and frequent travellers to the region aren't surprised. ""There are more decent jobs at home, so [now] young people aren't moving to somewhere else in Europe to work,"" said Tim Leffel, author of The World's Cheapest Destinations. ""The first time I went to Romania and Bulgaria a decade ago, some villages were full of only old people. Now you see a lot more mix in the ages. When more young people stick around, it makes everyone feel more hopeful about the future."" With GDP per capita sharply rising since the early 2000s, many Central and Eastern Europe residents now feel like they have an equal shot at happiness – an important overall indicator of wellbeing. In fact, the report found inequality of wellbeing has an even bigger effect on overall happiness than inequality of income. Beyond economic growth, these countries are also investing in infrastructure, fostering vibrant cultural scenes and capitalising on their stunning natural beauty – from the sea-formed sand dunes of the Curonian Spit straddling Lithuania and Russia to the biodiverse Carpathian Mountains in Romania. The result is a palpable sense of optimism and excitement among locals. To better understand this newfound happiness, we spoke to residents and recent travellers about their experiences in some of these countries, and where visitors can best experience this feeling for themselves. Lithuania Ranking 19th in the index overall and the very top for residents under age 30, Lithuania has seen marked improvements in quality of life over recent decades, report residents. ""Most people in Lithuania, especially younger generations, feel really happy,"" said Jurga Rubinovaite, who is Lithuanian and is the founder & CEO of the travel blog Full Suitcase. ""Despite the war in Ukraine and constant talk on the news about the increasing possibility of war expanding to the Baltic States, people seem to be enjoying and appreciating life as never before."" She attributes this to the fact that people have been free to study, work and travel wherever they want since 1990, when Lithuania regained independence from the Soviet Union. ""My mom often says, 'My life has never been so good as it is now',"" said Rubinovaite. ""The younger generations never experienced what life was like before Lithuania regained independence, but they all know the stories from their parents and grandparents. I think that's one of the reasons why people are happier now because they appreciate what they have more than ever before."" She also credits the country's maternity/paternity policies, which are some of the longest in the world (up to 126 paid days for mothers and 30 days for fathers), and large family networks to help take care of children. Resident Raminta Lilaitė-Sbalbi finds happiness in the vibrant cultural scene of Vilnius, the country's capital. She especially likes its proximity to nature, inclusive community spirit and opportunities for creative expression and personal growth. She points to important cultural events like the Lithuanian Song Festival, a Unesco World Heritage event marking its 100th anniversary this June and July. ""It's a once-in-four-year opportunity to witness a massive concert of hundreds of choirs and thousands of people singing at once on a huge open-air stage,"" she explained. ""The festival holds deep importance to us all due to its role in preserving Lithuania's national identity during times of Soviet occupation, which is why it was dubbed the 'singing revolution'."" The country's proximity to nature also offers an easy route to happiness via a better work-life balance. ""Lithuanians love the outdoors,"" said Rubinovaite. ""They take every opportunity they have to leave the city and enjoy the forests, the lakes and the beautiful seaside."" Lilaitė-Sbalbi recommends visitors check out hiking trails near Vilnius, such as Strėva Green Trail. ""Its hill of springs [is home to streams that] don't freeze even in winter and it has a plantation of Lithuanian orchids on a small hill,"" she said. She also points to Karmazinai Nature Trail, a fascinating site of pagan rites and ancient burial grounds. Romania Though only ranking 32nd overall, Romania saw one of the world's largest jumps in happiness over the past decade, soaring from number 90 in the 2013 World Happiness Report. Again, the surge was driven primarily by young people, who put the country at number eight for respondents under 30. Some experts attribute this optimism to increased freedom and opportunity. In March 2024, Bulgaria and Romania became the newest member states to join the EU's Schengen area, which guarantees free movement for citizens and visitors without border checks. Romania has also seen large investments in infrastructure, which have been improving quality of life for residents and travellers alike. ""Major highways and every town you visit – even small places like Targu Mures – all seem to be under construction,"" said Daniel Herszberg, founder of Travel Insighter website. With an approved infrastructure budget of €17bn for 2021-2027, Romania has been systematically implementing improvements, including 1,700 km of motorway construction, all at a much faster pace than was originally expected.  But even in the midst of modern upgrades, tradition is still a draw for locals and travellers. ""Romania boasts rich cultural diversity – from Saxon and Szekler (and other Hungarian) minorities to Romani and Romanian cultures,"" said current resident Alexandra Nima. ""Transylvania, specifically, is worth considering if you are into affordable, quiet, pastoral surroundings filled with beautiful sights and art."" Herszberg agrees, and suggests taking a Transylvanian road trip to see the best of the region. Start at Cluj Napoca (the country's second-most populated city) to see its medieval castles (including Bonțida Bánffy Castle which is known as ""the Versailles of Transylvania"", located 30km to the north). Next, head 270km south to the smaller town of Brasov, surrounded by the Carpathian mountains, where you can explore its medieval Saxon walls and lively cafe culture. The Czech Republic Ranked 18th in happiness overall and 10th among respondents under 30, the Czech Republic has seen a resurgence of community and culture in recent years that has driven rising happiness levels. ""Apartments and living areas tend to be on the smaller side here, so it leads to a great importance placed on access to 'third spaces' such as parks, pubs and cafes,"" said Michael Rozenblit, founder of travel site The World Was Here First, who has lived in the nation's capital city of Prague for two years. ""After the working day is over, you'll see families, couples and groups of friends descend on the green spaces in the city as if it's a communal back garden."" Even in the cold weather, he says there is a convivial pub and cafe scene that is essential to Czech culture. More like this:  • Five standout cities making the world a better place  • Five countries with the best work-life balance  • Why does Canada have three of the world's most liveable cities? This work-life balance is backed up by governmental policies, including guaranteed vacation days, comprehensive healthcare and maternal and paternal leave. ""Most employee benefit programmes include access to sports, physical activities and even perks such as massages and wellness,"" said Mariko Amekodommo, an American who now lives in Prague and runs the culinary business Mariko Presents. ""People are so happy here because it's a great standard of living."" Both Amekodommo and Leffel recommend venturing outside Prague to get a true sense of the culture and landscape. ""Even a 30-minute train ride outside of the city can bring you to gorgeous castles, a monastery created from human bones and untouched nature,"" said Amekodommo. ""A 15-minute walk from the city centre can bring you to a more relaxed vibe of locals."" Leffel, who recently explored the Pilzen and Spa Triangle areas of the Czech Republic, recommends travellers visit smaller towns like Olomouc, Brno and Plzeň that ""offer a different insight into the Czech way of life"". For beer lovers in particular, a visit to Plzeň's Pilsner Urquell brewery is a must-see. ""It's a pilgrimage akin to a wine lover going to Bordeaux or a coffee lover making a journey to Ethiopia,"" he said. The country's long beer heritage recently received international recognition, with the town of Žatec being inscribed on the Unesco World Heritage list for its long tradition of cultivating and processing hops, an essential ingredient in today's beer brewing.

economic indicators,Ely: What do we know about the Cardiff suburb?,2024-09-15,2023-05-23,By Steve Duffy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-65683002,"Ely in Cardiff is reeling after a riot broke out on Monday following a crash in which two teenage boys died. Police have confirmed for the first time that officers were following the boys on an electric bike, just minutes before their deaths sparked a riot. The estate in Cardiff has had its fair share of bad headlines over the years. But it also has a proud reputation as a close-knit working class community, on the western edge of the city. The estate, characterised by mostly 1920 and 30s semi-detached houses, has a population of about 15,000 people. It sits on the outskirts of Cardiff and is next door to the Caerau estate. The area, which sprang up between the two world wars as the city expanded, has been characterised as having socio-economic challenges but the most recent statistics point to an ""arc of poverty"" which runs across the south and west of the city. Ely has more children eligible for free school meals - 59.1% - than any other community in Wales, while nearly three-quarters of households have at least one deprivation measure, as measured in the 2021 Census. Broken down into the smallest neighbourhoods, the two covering Snowden Road are in the top 10% in Wales for levels of deprivation in Welsh government indicators covering income, health, education and employment. Home ownership is about 34% - the 12th lowest in Wales - although it is lower in five areas of Cardiff. Crime figures can be a little patchy at best, but across Ely in the past year, we have seen about 150 crimes reported a month, with only three crimes recorded in the Snowden Road area last month and only one the month before that. Ely has had a reputation in the city, perhaps undeserved, and some of that goes back to rioting in the autumn of 1991. That too coincided with warm weather, at a time of economic difficulties - and stemmed from a local row involving a shopkeeper, who was forced to flee 100 miles. I remember covering the aftermath for the local newspaper. It was in the next street to where last night's violence took place.  There was a shock then among the vast majority of the law-abiding community that it even happened. It concentrated efforts in the next few years to look for improved community facilities and police relations.  Projects such as the Dusty Forge - converted from an abandoned and once notorious local pub - look to provide a community hub and skills and support to help mitigate against deep-seated economic problems.

economic indicators,"Without a 'distraction', who pays the bills?",2024-09-15,2022-10-04,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-63128912,"It was a 'distraction', said Kwasi Kwarteng about plans to scrap the 45p rate of income tax for higher earners.  Removing the top rate of income tax, outside of Scotland, saved those who pay it an average of £10,000, and 'the optics' - how it looks, politically - were beyond inept. This was while price inflation was heading towards 11%, the public sector is embroiled in pay battles, and a few days before domestic energy bills were to go up 27%. So what was it distracting us from? Well, the rest of the tax cutting package, of course, adding up to a whopping £43bn of the £45bn unfunded tax cuts in the chancellor's mini-budget of 23 September. The top rate brought in an extra £2bn. So it was a big and expensive political U-turn, but didn't make much difference to the underlying questions of how to pay for what remains of the plan. It also distracted us from the energy price guarantee, and its equivalent for business, costing us... we have no idea how much.  It's the blankest of blank cheques. So having been distracted, let's look again at the remaining tax cuts.  The plan for raising corporation tax on profits from 19% to 25% has been reversed, as Liz Truss said she would do during the leadership campaign in the summer. Likewise, former Chancellor Rishi Sunak's move to use higher National Insurance Contributions (1.25% more for employers as well as employees) to fund the transition to more generous social care (in England, at least) is being reversed, taking effect next month, only seven months after it was introduced. Two further measures don't affect Scotland directly: a cut in the basic rate of Westminster's income tax regime from 20 pence in the pound to 19 pence, and a deep cut in the tax take from the transactions tax on homes, known in England and Northern Ireland as Stamp Duty Land Tax. All that goes ahead, unless political pressure comes back from the Conservative Party. And there's far less reason for it to do so. Until, that is, the other side of the ledger is published. We're now told the 'medium-term fiscal plan' - the sums that show Kwasi Kwarteng has his borrowing under control - will be published earlier than planned. It was to have been on 23 November. It's now looking more like this month, with an announcement about the date expected on Tuesday.  It's going to be busy for the number-crunchers at the Office for Budget Responsibility, who normally require 10 weeks to work on such government 'fiscal events'. Publication of their rough calculations was offered but rejected by Kwasi Kwarteng ahead of his mini-budget, at enormous cost to his credibility on fiscal discipline. The figures they'll be working with are the choices the Chancellor makes to fund his tax cuts and energy support package.  These may chop and change over the next few weeks, and the OBR has to chop and change with them, until they reach a pre-agreed cut-off point. A big splurge of borrowing would make it much harder to reach the promise the new chancellor made to the Conservative conference, of getting debt down as a share of Gross Domestic Product - Britain's total economic output in a year.  It sounds technical, and it is. But it's the key performance indicator that the Treasury has chosen to be judged by.  The alternative is to take a chainsaw to public spending. To many Conservatives in Birmingham, they may like the sound of that, at least until they see the possible or likely consequences.  Paul Johnson of the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) admitted that he lacks the imagination to see how deep cuts can be made, after the sharp reductions of the past 12 years. The NHS? It's already struggling with backlogs and staff shortages, and is one of the new prime minister's top three priorities. The state pension? Sticking to the 'triple lock' means it will go up by price inflation next year, and its recipients have a tendency to vote. Indeed, they have a tendency to vote Conservative, but they are not to be taken for granted. Welfare benefits? A target that some would like in Conservative ranks, but Tory MPs who have already signalled their intentions as the backbench awkward squad - now with a licence to rebel against a weakened leadership - have indicated this is not a good time to be targeting those who are already least well off. Education? Policing? None of them are easy choices for spending cuts in order to pay for tax cuts. It comes back once more to local councils, perhaps. They have taken the brunt of the cuts, also in Scotland where Whitehall's squeeze has been passed on for Holyrood to apply, and their services have been hacked back. However, if you are Kwasi Kwarteng, you square the circle with more economic growth, bringing in more tax revenue. Simple. But there are several question marks over that. It is a gamble. It may not work. Just one of the problems is that tax cuts put the foot on the economic accelerator, meaning the Bank of England has to press on the brake all the harder, by putting up the cost of borrowing. Supposing it does work, how long will this take? And if at first it doesn't succeed, how often will Downing Street try and try again? How long can borrowing take the strain when the bond markets already think this looks risky, and price UK debt accordingly? If there is growth in the economy, Mr Kwarteng has made clear that more revenue will fuel the fire for further tax cuts. We could expect that to include the top rate for top earners.  By implication, that would mean a continuing relative squeeze on the public sector, reducing its share of national income, where pay pressure is already being stoked and where demographic pressures are rising inexorably. Mr Kwarteng's Growth Plan goes on to lean heavily on a series of measures that have not yet been announced, on de-regulating the economy to help business grow. Many of those measures may not apply in Scotland, making it more difficult to co-ordinate the flagship Downing Street policy of low-tax, low-regulation Investment Zones. But what we are yet to see is the reaction from those who like the regulations we've amassed over the years - on employment, the environment, agriculture, building on green belt land. Whether or not they were imposed by Brussels, even post-Brexit Britain has people who buy into them, and will surely fight for them. The other part of this mini-budget - from which we've been 'distracted' - is help with energy bills. Because that has widespread support, so far as it goes, across politics, business and anti-poverty campaigners, there isn't much discussion of the package we've got.  And which of us does not like government absorbing the risk of prices remaining very high and very volatile? But it might be worth taking a moment to recall what the International Monetary Fund, Moody's credit rating agency and others said last week: the flat rate cap on unit prices is not targeted at those who need help most. Instead it's most generous - in cash terms - to those, in big homes and those running gas-guzzling business. So it increases inequality, which those overseas observers already see as a weakness of the British economy. It also masks the price signal of higher energy prices, as an incentive to use less or to shift to alternative sources of heat and power. We're reminded of that by the message from energy regulator Ofgem that Britain could be heading for a gas supply emergency this winter, meaning that some industry's may have to power down or switch off, and one of those industries could be the gas-fired electricity generators. Of course, Liz Truss blithely promised, while a leadership candidate, that there would be no rationing on her watch. That's another failure to understand markets, and her lack of her control over them, that could come back and bite the Prime Minister. But as October chill, rain and wind billow in from the Atlantic, it's not too late to turn down the thermostat in Downing Street, as an example to others.  In any case, the politics of recent days have surely been generating enough renewable heat to make quite a dent in Britain's demand for natural gas."
economic indicators,Condor reports 19% increase in car passengers,2024-09-15,2022-09-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-63073802,"Ferry operator Condor has reported a rise in the number of cars being brought to Guernsey over the summer. The company said it ferried 1,400 more cars between the UK and the island on high-speed services between 1 July and 20 September this year compared with the same period in 2019. It said the figure represents a 19% rise on 2019 passenger numbers and an estimated 3,500 additional visitors. Condor boss John Napton attributed the increase to a new ferry schedule. ""These numbers would not have been possible with the 2019 schedule,"" he said. ""We have been able to offer direct sailings from the UK which allow us to carry more passengers at peak times, concentrated around weekends when most people want to travel."" Deputy Neil Inder, President of the Economic Development Committee, said the figures were a positive development after the disruption caused by the pandemic. ""Condor's assessment of the summer season is welcome news and matches our own that 2022 has been a good bounce back year for tourism,"" he said. ""The success of this summer, coupled with positive indicators for next year, offers optimism that 2023 could be a good season for the islands for UK visitors wanting to travel overseas without any Brexit uncertainty.""

economic indicators,Developing world economies hit hard by coronavirus,2024-09-15,2020-04-22,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52352395,"The world is experiencing a sharp deterioration in economic performance, due to the continuing coronavirus pandemic. Developing countries are certain to be hit hard by what the International Monetary Fund, and others, warn will be the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Almost every country on the planet is being affected. The IMF expects 170 nations - rich and poor - to experience a decline in economic activity per person this year. That means falling average living standards. Developing economies are being hit in distinctive ways by the pandemic: Many are exporters of commodities used by industry. The shutdown of many factories around the world means there is less demand for those commodities, so their prices have fallen, sharply in some cases.  Oil is the starkest example. The loss of demand has been especially severe, as the crisis has led to a massive reduction in demand for transport fuels, more than 90% of which are made from crude oil. The situation was exacerbated for a period by what was in effect a price war between the two biggest exporters, Russia and Saudi Arabia. There has been an extraordinary situation where some oil prices have been below zero. It is not a general feature of the oil market, but it does highlight the huge imbalance between supply and demand. Other commodities have also seen sharp price falls, although not generally on the scale of oil. Copper, for example, is now about 18% cheaper than it was in mid-January, and zinc's price is more than 20% lower. These price falls are hitting businesses and government revenues in countries that export these commodities. Agricultural commodities have generally have been less affected. People still need to eat after all. The World Bank has described world food markets as ""amply supplied following recent bumper harvests, especially in wheat and maize"". Its report does however warn there is a risk that if concerns about food security do spread, hoarding could result. Low income countries would be especially vulnerable in that situation.  Already a fifth of the population in sub-Saharan Africa suffers from malnutrition. Some types of non-food commodity have been affected already. The Bank reports that following the travel restrictions Kenya's exports of fresh flowers dropped by 80%. Rubber prices have also been affected. As people are driving less they don't need to replace tires so much. Prices for maize and some other crops are also vulnerable to a drop in demand for biofuels. Developing countries have also had to contend with international investors pulling money out. The IMF's chief economist Gita Gopinath says the appetite for risk among international investors has waned. This means they are more inclined to sell investments seen as relatively risky, including bonds and shares in emerging markets, and pull money back to what they regard as safer bets, such as the US, Europe or Japan. She says the result has been ""unprecedented reversals in capital flows"". In a blog published by the Brussels think thank Bruegel, Marek Dombrowski and Marta Domínguez-Jiménez set out a number of financial indicators showing the strains that have built rapidly in some emerging economies. They show how the difference between bond yields - which are a measure of borrowing costs in financial markets - in the US and in developing nations has widened in many cases. This is often a sign that investors believe there is an increased risk of borrowers, including governments, defaulting on their debts. Another sign of this is the increased cost of getting insurance against a default (that is, the price of financial instruments called credit default swaps). And then there have been sharp declines in currency values for many countries. That is another sign of investors wanting to get their money out.  That also raises another issue - foreign debt. A decline in the value of a national currency makes it more expensive to repay, or pay interest on, debts in other currencies.  At a time when developing country government budgets are under pressure to deal with the health crisis and its economic consequences, debt payments could be a serious diversion of scarce resources.  So there is a vigorous campaign to address developing countries' debt problems.  The IMF and the world's leading economies have taken some steps to ease this burden, by providing relief from the burden of debt interest and repayments over the next few months. The IMF agreed to cover the payments due from 25 countries, mostly in Africa, over the next six months, from a trust fund financed by donations from member countries, including a recent pledge of $185m (£150m) by the UK. In effect those payments have been cancelled. The G20 leading economic powers agreed to defer - not cancel - debt payments from May to the end of the year for a larger group of the poorest nations. This decision covers debt payments to G20 governments from a total of 77 countries.   It means that cash can be diverted in the coming months to dealing with the crisis rather than making those payments. But it does mean they will need to make the payments in the future. So campaigners for developing country debt relief think the G20 and others should go further.   The Jubilee Debt Campaign, for example, described the G20 move as a first step, but called for the payment obligations to be cancelled altogether. They also point out that the G20 deal does not address payments to private sector lenders. The G20 merely encouraged those creditors to offer similar payment deferral to the poorest countries. The Jubilee Debt Campaign wants the rich countries to make changes to the law to prevent private creditors using the courts to sue poor countries that miss payments. It is particularly relevant to New York and the UK whose laws govern most developing country debt contracts.   Dealing with the health issues presents particular problems in densely populated urban areas in developing countries. Social distancing is especially difficult in that context. So is staying at home for people who work in what's called the informal economy. Many need to go out to work to feed themselves and their families.  Oksana Abbouda runs StreetNet International, an organisation that represents street vendors around the world. She recently spoke to the BBC's Business Daily radio programme about what the people the organisation represents are saying about their situation. ""We have to make this horrible choice, either to put ourselves at risk [from infection] and continue our informal job, or put our families at risk because they will be starving,"" she says. ""This is the reality for billions of people around the world… informal is normal in developing countries."" Developing countries are also likely to be affected through a decline in money that migrant workers send to their families at home.  These remittances, as they are known, are often sent from rich to poorer countries, and they can be a very important support to a family's standard of living. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: A new report by the World Bank warns that they are likely to fall by as much as 20% this year due to the pandemic. Migrant workers, the bank says, tend to be particularly vulnerable to losing jobs and incomes. It adds that remittances enable people to eat better, to spend more on education and to reduce child labour. "
economic indicators,Spend Local scheme 'helps lift November retail sales',2024-09-15,2021-12-13,By Richard Morgan,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-59631460,"Retail sales in Northern Ireland rose in November for the first time in four months, according to an Ulster Bank survey.  The bank's monthly survey of private sector businesses is considered a reliable indicator of economic performance. The report also indicated employment levels continued to grow.  Supply chain problems remain and inflationary pressures were described as severe.  Ulster Bank's chief economist Richard Ramsey pointed to the High Street Voucher Scheme as one reason for the rise in retail activity.  ""Northern Ireland saw the pace of business activity accelerate in November, but this uptick was solely down to a rebound in one sector, retail,"" he said. ""Local retail sales rose in November for the first time in four months with the High Street Voucher Scheme undoubtedly contributing to the pick-up in demand."" Christmas shopping is also likely to be a factor for the rise in November trade. Mr Ramsey said that, overall, manufacturing remained the strongest performer of the four sectors monitored in the local economy, despite that industry experiencing slower rates of growth relative to October. ""Services firms, on the other hand, reported their slowest rate of expansion in business activity in eight months, and incoming orders were broadly flat, while construction firms notched up their fifth successive month of contraction in both output and orders,"" he added. ""Manufacturing aside, the near-term outlook for the private sector remains challenging.  ""Indeed, retail's pick-up in sales in November coincides with a slump in new orders, pointing to a slowdown over the months ahead."" Economy Minister Gordon Lyons has said some people still need to activate and use their Spend Local cards.  The scheme was extended until midnight on 19 December as some people were still waiting to receive their £100.  ""The scheme is boosting our economy by an extra £2m on average every single day and that is over £121m so far,"" he said.  ""The Northern Ireland Retail Consortium has credited the scheme with boosting the number of shoppers on our High Streets to their highest levels since before the pandemic.    ""While this is a clear success, it is important to me and to our businesses that every penny on every card is spent in order to maximise the impact."" The Ulster Bank survey also indicated that Northern Ireland's private sector recovery continues to lag behind other UK regions.  ""After the north east of England, Northern Ireland recorded the slowest rate of growth in business activity,"" Mr Ramsey said.  ""Northern Ireland was the only one of the 12 UK regions to record a fall in new orders in November.  ""November's decline extended the run of falling orders to 34 months.  ""Manufacturing is the only sector in Northern Ireland that appears to be outperforming the UK."""
economic indicators,Ministers quiz Treasury on post-Brexit cash,2024-09-15,2019-02-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-47246237,"Ministers from Scotland and Wales are demanding clarity on where vital funding will come from after Brexit. Scotland's Finance Secretary Derek Mackay and Welsh Finance Minister Rebecca Evans have asked the UK government to explain replacements for EU cash streams post-Brexit. These include university research grants, rural community funding and public sector pensions. The two will later meet Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss in Cardiff. The Federation of Small Business has stressed the need to avoid no-deal Brexit and to have in place replacement arrangements for EU grants to make sure neither nation is disadvantaged as a result of Brexit. Mr Mackay said: ""Today's meeting is an opportunity for the UK government to provide much needed clarity around future funding as well as details on what support will be made available to help protect Scotland's economy against the consequences of the UK's exit from the European Union. ""Funding from the EU supports jobs in Scotland, from major infrastructure projects to sustaining rural communities and delivering research funding for our world-class universities. That is why the Scottish government is determined to defend its hard-won fiscal responsibility and maintain the benefits that EU funding has provided to many sectors and individuals in Scotland.  ""With just weeks to go until the planned EU exit day, we remain deeply concerned about the lack of detail regarding replacement arrangements for EU funding streams given their importance to individuals, businesses and communities across Scotland."" Mr Mackay will ask Ms Truss to provide reassurance Scotland should not be financially worse off as a result of EU exit and to guarantee that all lost EU funding will be replaced in full. He said that Brexit uncertainty was already impacting key economic indicators and a no-deal Brexit would lead to a major dislocation to the Scottish economy. He also said the UK government ""must immediately rule out the possibility of a 'no deal' Brexit and extend the Article 50 process"".  But he added that as a responsible government, they would intensify work to prepare for all outcomes. Welsh Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said she would also push the UK administration for clarity about budgets. She said ""With the clock ticking as we approach EU exit day, it is absolutely vital we are at the heart of decision making and are able to prepare for the impact of Brexit. ""Alongside this, I will also be pressing for further clarity and assurances about the cost associated with the UK government's changes to public sector pensions and how it intends to fund it. ""Only last week, the First Minister and local government leaders wrote to the Chancellor seeking clarification. Worryingly, even as local authorities are finalising their budgets, there is still some uncertainty about funding."" Colin Borland, director of devolved nations for the Federation of Small Business, said: ""Avoiding a no-deal Brexit at the end of March is the highest priority for smaller businesses. Elected members at every level need to push hard to avoid this outcome.  ""But we would encourage local businesses from Aberystwyth to Aberdeen to check out official sources of advice to ensure they're as prepared as they can be for what could be an abrupt change in trading conditions."" A Treasury spokeswoman told the BBC: ""We are working closely with the devolved administrations so they have the resources to prepare as we leave the European Union. ""This includes allocating £55m to the Scottish government and over £30m to the Welsh government to support Brexit preparations for all scenarios in 2019-20."""
economic indicators,China economy rebounds after Covid measures lifted,2024-09-15,2023-04-18,By Monica Miller,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65307471,"China's economy grew faster than expected in the first three months of the year, as the country emerged from its tough Covid restrictions. Compared to the same period last year, gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.5%, official figures show. The key measure of economic activity was driven up by a boost in household spending and rising factory activity. Beijing pledged to boost the world's second largest economy when it lifted coronavirus measures in December. Also on Tuesday, separate data for March showed that retail sales, the main indicator of household consumption, jumped by 10.6%, compared to a year earlier. At the same time, output from the country's factories rose by 3.9%, although that slightly missed forecasts. Meanwhile, there was also evidence of a strong rebound for the country's airline industry. China Civil Aviation Administration data showed that more than 45 million air passenger trips were taken last month, an almost threefold increase on the same time last year.  The country resumed processing visa applications in March after announcing a major easing of restrictions. Investors had been eagerly waiting for the figures to get clues on the strength of China's recovery after the government lifted coronavirus measures. Beijing has also eased a three-year-long crackdown on big technology companies and property developers. However, one analyst told the BBC that, while the latest figures are strong, that pace of growth is unlikely to continue. ""What's more likely to happen in the coming months is that people might get over the initial high after the reopening,"" Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank (China) said. ""Manufacturing demand might decline, which cannot sustain a boom in exports because the global economy is slowing down rather than speeding up,"" she added. Authorities, including  the People's Bank of China, have promised to increase support for the pledged to step up support for China's economy to help curb unemployment but are limited in what measures they can take. Last year, China's GDP growth slumped to one of the lowest levels in nearly half a century due to coronavirus measures.  GDP is one of the most important tools for looking at how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It helps businesses judge when to expand and hire more people, and lets governments work out how much to tax and spend."
economic indicators,Private sector activity in NI falls again,2024-09-15,2021-01-11,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-55622546,"Activity in Northern Ireland's private sector fell again in December. It was at a softer rate than earlier in the year, according to a survey by Ulster Bank.  Every month, the bank asks firms in the private sector about staffing levels, order books and exports in what is considered to be a reliable indicator of economic performance. All four sectors of the economy reported falls in output and employment levels in December. Services - the largest sector of the economy in Northern Ireland - reported the fastest decline, in contrast to previous recessions when it was traditionally the least affected sector. Ulster Bank chief economist Richard Ramsey said: ""Northern Ireland's private sector ended 2020 the way it began the year with business activity contracting at the same pace in December as in January."" The survey showed the local economy experienced six months of contraction in the first half of 2020, including record rates of decline in the second quarter. While things picked up in the third quarter, Mr Ramsey said recovery was short-lived and faltered as renewed lockdown restrictions triggered three months of contraction in the final quarter of the year. Despite this, the survey suggested companies remain optimistic about the year ahead, with business sentiment at its highest level since February. ""The arrival of a number of vaccines has already provided a general boost to business confidence,"" Mr Ramsay said. ""Furthermore, the recent UK-EU trade deal (secured after this survey was conducted) has taken the risk and uncertainty of a 'no-deal' Brexit off the table. ""This will act as an additional boost to confidence for 2021. In the meantime, however, we can expect teething problems to emerge as firms on both sides of the Irish Sea get to grips with the new trading arrangements.  ""Even when these are mastered the reality is that trade will be more restricted, involve more bureaucracy, and therefore be more costly than before."""
economic indicators,Left behind in Ardern's 'kind' New Zealand,2024-09-15,2020-10-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54444643,"Throughout her tempestuous first term as New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern has maintained a message of kindness. But as she seeks another term in power, critics say that it will take more than kindness and charisma to get the economy on its feet and lift tens of thousands of people out of poverty, writes the BBC's Shaimaa Khalil. ""Where I come from, there's no kindness happening,"" says Agnes Magele, a Pacifica-origin single mother of three who lives in South Auckland, the poorest area in New Zealand's biggest city. The phrase ""be strong, be kind"" became a trademark of Ms Ardern's leadership at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown.  Ms Magele also says she doesn't feel like she's part of the ""team of five million""- another phrase coined by Ms Ardern when referring to the population of New Zealand. ""Is it kind when people don't have enough money to buy basic essentials, such as food, for their children? Is it kind when parents have to skip meals so their kids have a bigger portion?"" she asks. Ms Magele and her family have struggled for years. She lost her job as a TV extra two weeks before the first Covid-19 lockdown. She's now on the job-seeker benefits of 250 New Zealand dollars (£127; $164) a week. She says that doesn't even cover half her rent. Jacinda Ardern has captured the world's imagination and been widely praised for her strong and compassionate leadership as she steered the country through turbulent times including a terrorist attack in Christchurch, a natural disaster when the White Island, or Whakaari, volcano erupted, and a global pandemic.  But critics say her government has failed to tackle child poverty - one of her key promises when she came to power in 2017. An annual report card released by the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef), in early September, compared the performances of 41 high-income countries on child welfare issues, from suicide rates to childhood obesity, education and environment. New Zealand is at the bottom third in 35th place.  The prime minister countered that the Unicef report had not taken into consideration the NZ$5.5bn Families Package which she said has lifted 18,400 children out of poverty. But the government doesn't fare much better even by its own statistics. The latest data has shown only small changes. Under the Child Poverty Reduction Act, Stats NZ is required to annually report on nine different measures for child poverty. Material hardship is one of the most prominent measures which includes not eating fresh fruit and vegetables, putting off a visit to the doctor, or not being able to pay bills on time. For June 2018 to June 2019 there was no significant change to the percentage of children living in material hardship, compared to the previous year. The figure remains at about 13% - that's 151,700 or one in eight of New Zealand's children.  Poverty is remarkably high in Maori and Pacifica households, with nearly 1 in 4 (23.3%) of Maori children and nearly 1 in 3 (28.6%) of Pacific children living in material hardship. These are sobering numbers and in many ways jar with New Zealand's global image of prosperity and general stability.  ""European/white New Zealanders have a very different life experience to our Maori or Pacifica citizens,"" says Unicef NZ executive director Vivien Maidaborn. Ms Maidaborn adds that the white experience in New Zealand, which is predominantly much more financially stable, is taken as the mainstream when actually it's very different from many other parts of the population. Ms Magele, who volunteers with Auckland Action Against Poverty, an organisation that advocates for low-income families to help them navigate the welfare system, has seen this in the families she helps. She says that in her poor neighbourhood of Otara in South Auckland with a large Maori and Pacifica population, many people have been forced into homelessness because their income or benefits don't cover their rent. She said the combination of low benefits and high rent has made it impossible for thousands of families, like hers, to make ends meet. ""Sometimes my kids don't like going to school because they're not in the correct school uniform and they don't have enough lunch to go to school with. That really does a lot to children's mental well-being,"" Ms Magele says. ""New Zealand has now approached a tipping point when it comes to housing,"" says Brad Olsen, a senior economist with Infometrics, an economics analysis think tank.  Mr Olsen says that the number of people trying to get into government funded housing went from 4,000 between 2014-2016 to 20,000 in the years that followed. ""That highlights how precarious and under how much pressure these families are,"" he explains.   He adds that it's not only a lack of houses but the fact that those which already exist are substandard. ""A lot of the time the housing quality is poor. That reinforces some of the issues with poverty: people with healthcare [problems] not able to stay warm and dry or feed the kids because they're trying to put more money into heating or to take the children to the doctor."" Mr Olsen said the housing crisis adds to the complexity of poverty in New Zealand. Auckland Action Against Poverty says that another indicator of how bad things have become is the increase in demand for food parcels.  It adds that three years ago, 100,000 food grants were handed out by Work and Income (New Zealand's welfare system) in the three months of winter.  Right now that number is up to at least 500,000 - a fivefold increase in a period of three years. And that was even before Covid-19 hit.  Like many families in her area, Ms Magele gets by on food grants. She says sometimes families go without meals for days while they wait for government assistance. This has happened to her and her children repeatedly, she says. ""I've had to reach out to family and friends for a little bit of help but it's hard because they're also in the same predicament as me. It's like asking the poor to help the poor,"" she says. The situation has been exacerbated by the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. Ms Maidaborn praised the government's response to Covid-19 but said it did little to alleviate the pressure on poor families. ""The subsidies at the welfare level have been quite focused on business. What we may have done is entrench the inequality between people who are already struggling and people who have wealth or assets but in terms of cash flow now are struggling,"" she says. But Mr Olsen points out that the problem of poverty has been going on for years and will take a long time to solve, though he thinks it hasn't been tackled with enough urgency. ""I don't think there's any government in recent times that has made enough headway on poverty. I'm reluctant to say that any one has failed because as a country we have failed. This requires more than a three-year term,"" he says. He added that as the country deals with the fallout from the pandemic, the government should do more to close the gap on inequality. ""When we develop changes because of Covid-19 we need to make sure that we're not making changes back to the status quo. We need to go further than that and support a much wider body of people."" On Saturday, Jacinda Ardern is widely expected to win a second term in office - one that will have to tackle a recession, an on-going housing crisis and a nation that has lost a huge chunk of its income with tourism and trade at a standstill. ""The biggest lever that the government has, in terms of ending child poverty, is income to the poorest families… it makes the most difference the fastest,"" says Ms Maidaborn. ""It will be harder and harder to do [with the] economic recession but that is what will really change the lives of New Zealand's children,"" she explains. Meanwhile Ms Magele has a simple message for the government. ""Increase our benefits. Stop speaking of kindness and start doing something about it."" 9 November 2020 clarification: The usual benefit amount available to sole parents in New Zealand is 375 New Zealand dollars per week. "
economic indicators,UK economy slows as car sales fall,2024-09-15,2018-12-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46505692,"Growth in the UK's economy has slowed as car sales fell and the manufacturing sector stalled, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said. The economy grew by 0.4% in the three months to October, slower than the 0.6% in the three months to September. The UK's trade deficit also widened as imports grew faster than exports in October. Economists expect growth to slow in the last three months of the year. The latest three-month growth figure follows a stronger-than-expected set of data for the three months to September, when the economy grew at its fastest pace since late 2016 buoyed by consumers spending in the warm weather. ""GDP growth slowed going into the autumn after a strong summer, with a softening in services sector growth mainly due to a fall in car sales,"" said  Rob Kent-Smith, head of national accounts at the ONS. ""This was offset by a strong showing from IT and accountancy."" ""Manufacturing saw no growth at all in the latest three months, mainly due to a decline in the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry,"" he added. ""Construction, while slowing slightly, continued its recent solid performance with growth in housebuilding and infrastructure."" The services sector grew by 0.3% on the three-month rolling measure - the lowest since the three months to April 2018.  The sector's performance is closely watched as it makes up 80% of the economy. There were some negative signs in the latest economic growth figures, but on the whole they were benign, with services such as accountancy driving modest economic growth.  But here we meet the frustration of lagging economic indicators. If we want to know what effect the upheaval at Westminster over the Brexit withdrawal agreement has had, the more recent indicators tell a less benign story. In November, retail sales grew by 0.5 per cent overall (including online). But if you exclude food they were flat, and sales in shops were down. Similarly, the leading indicator of business activity, the purchasing managers' index which tracks buying decisions by business executives, recorded its worst reading in the services sector since the month after the referendum, July 2016. Activity expanded, but only just. Unfortunately we won't know the effect of Theresa May's troubles on November's economic growth (GDP) until January, by which time it will be far too late to influence decision making.    GDP grew by 0.1% in October - after being flat in both September and August. In October, the first month of the last quarter of the year, the services sector was the only major part of the economy to expand. Industrial production fell 0.6%, with manufacturing output down 0.9%. Output in the construction industry fell 0.2%. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the latest growth figures ""come on the heels of more up-to-date survey evidence which suggests the economy is approaching stall speed and could even contract as we move into 2019 unless demand revives"". In October, the UK imported more than it exported despite the weakness in the pound. The trade deficit widened to £3.1bn in October, the ONS said, as imports increased by £3.6bn, faster than the amount exported, which rose by £1.9bn.   The ONS also revised the trade data for September, which now shows a deficit of £2.3bn compared with £0.1bn. ""The widening in the UK's trade deficit is a concern and reflects a sharp rise in goods imports,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). ""Trading conditions for UK exporters are deteriorating amid moderating global growth and uncertainty over Brexit. Businesses continue to report that the persistent weakness in sterling is hurting as much as its helping, with the weakening currency raising input costs."" With October marking the start of the fourth quarter, economists said the economy's progress in remaining months of the year could be determined by Brexit negotiations. Mr Williamson said: ""The outlook for growth... very much depends on Brexit developments over the coming days, weeks and months, and the surrounding uncertainty makes forecasting extremely difficult. ""However, what's clearly evident is that the widely-expected slowing of the economy in the lead-up to the UK's separation from the EU is now upon us, leaving the big question of whether the economy will bounce back alongside a smooth Brexit process or slide into decline,"" he said. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said that surveys of the services sector were also showing weak growth which do ""not augur well"" for the last quarter of the year. Capital Economics is forecasting annual GDP growth of 1.3% for this year - the lowest since the financial crisis."
economic indicators,Chinese economy continues its pandemic bounce back,2024-09-15,2021-03-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56397602,"Key economic data in China surged dramatically in the first two months of 2021, pointing to a continued recovery for the world's second largest economy. China's industrial output grew 35.1% in January and February compared to the same months last year. The strong numbers are distorted because they are compared to 2020, when most of China's factories were in pandemic lockdown.   But Monday's slew of economic data still beat analysts' expectations. Looking back to 2019 before the pandemic hit may give a more accurate picture of what is happening to economic activity in China. Industrial output was up 16.9% compared with the first two months of 2019, highlighting the stronger output. A rebound in foreign demand has helped push export growth higher for China, often called the world's factory.   The Chinese government has set a modest annual economic growth target for 2021, at above 6%, even though analysts are tipping growth of around 8%.  China was the only major economy last year to report positive growth, with an expansion of 2.3%. A spokeswoman for China's statistics bureau Liu Aihua told reporters the economy should continue its recovery. However, she said there are still imbalances in the economic recovery and that China needs to step up support for consumption.  Retail sales, another key economic indicator, climbed 33.8% in the period, although the jobless rate was 5.5% at the end of February, up from 5.2% in December. Economists have pointed to a two-speed track for China, with strong industrial output and export demand but a lagging consumer recovery. The government imposed travel restrictions before the Chinese New Year holidays, which fell in February this year. This suppressed spending on travel, restaurants and leisure activities. However, retail sales data showed the top growth items were jewellery (up 99%) and cars (up 78%). ""These items tell us that Chinese consumers spent lavishly during the Chinese New Year holiday,"" said Iris Pang, Chief Economist for Greater China, at ING bank."
economic indicators,Trump makes new threat over border,2024-09-15,2018-10-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45905294,"US President Donald Trump has threatened to use military force to completely close the US-Mexico border. The warning, via a series of tweets on Thursday, comes as a new caravan of more than 3,000 migrants from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala heads north. Mr Trump has already threatened to cut all aid payments to the three countries over illegal immigration. The group says they are fleeing violence and poverty.  ""In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!,"" Mr Trump wrote. The president has previously threatened to cut Honduran aid. The US sent more than $175m (£130m) to the country in 2016 and 2017, according to the US Agency for International Development. The group of Central American migrants has made its intentions clear: they are heading to the US.  Since he was on the campaign trail, Mr Trump has lambasted illegal immigrants, and this latest caravan comes after a major crackdown on migrants heading over the Mexican border.  Changes to detention rules saw thousands of migrant children detained and separated from their parents earlier this year, sparking national and international condemnation. The president's threats also come just weeks before the mid-term elections on 6 November, which could see Democrats unseating Republicans on Capitol Hill. Mr Trump's recent comments are probably an effort to bolster support among his base by cracking down on migration. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News This isn't the first time President Donald Trump has used an organised group of Central American refugees heading to the US to drum up support for his border security and immigration policies. With the mid-term elections 19 days away, however, the stakes are higher and the rhetoric is sharper. It may not end up much more than rhetoric, however. Mr Trump's Twitter threats have, in the past, proven an unreliable indicator of future decisions.  There could be political benefit to the president's accusations, lobbed toward Democrats, and the warnings to Latin American leaders - but presidential action would have consequences.  Using the military to ""close"" the border would be enormously disruptive in states like Texas and Arizona (which, by the way, have two high-profile Senate races). The move would also complicate relations between the US and Mexico, as Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador prepares to assume the Mexican presidency in December. A recent Fox News poll shows that probable midterm voters are more interested in preserving healthcare protections and ""reining in Donald Trump"" than immigration or border security. The president, with his tweets, is trying to change that. If he can't, it will be an election fought on uncomfortable ground for Republicans.  The migrant caravan is currently making its way through Guatemala, mostly on foot, with several of the quickest already arriving at Mexico's southern border by Thursday. Their journey began in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, on Friday. Most migrants are carrying few belongings, taking what they can carry in backpacks, as they head out on the nearly 2,800 mile (4,500km) trek from Honduras to the US border. Thousands of people and goods legally cross the US-Mexico border daily.  While Mr Trump has sent national guard troops to the border before, it is unclear what he means by shutting it down entirely, and whether that would affect businesses or people with legitimate visas.  And according to international law, the US cannot deport asylum seekers without first determining the validity of their claim. Under pressure from the US to stop the migrants, Mexico has sent federal police to the border, though they are not officially there to stop the caravan. Mexican officials said on Wednesday that those without papers would have to apply for refugee status or turn back. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be in Mexico this Friday, and US media report that he will discuss plans to stop the caravan. ""The surreal side of this perceived crisis at the border is that the border is more under control now than it was 15 or 20 years ago,"" Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, told the BBC. Mr Selee said closing the border ""would wreak havoc on Mexican and American economies"". ""It could be a symbolic effort,"" he adds. ""A way of pressuring Mexico - but that would have a limited effect on illegal crossings and a huge effect on legal crossings."" The Associated Press reports that many migrants do not have passports and have been using national ID cards, which allow them to travel within Central America. Mexico, however, requires a passport at entry. Human rights groups have criticised the US and Mexican response to the caravan. Erika Guevara-Rosas of Amnesty International said in a statement: ""Mexican authorities should not take a Trump approach treating people like a security threat."" ""These families deserve dignity and respect to ensure that no one is illegally returned to situations where they could risk serious harm due to violence."" Mexican president-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador plans to offer work visas to Central Americans when he takes office in December. ""It is a plan that we have, that anyone who wants to work in Mexico will have a work visa,"" he said. Mr Selee told the BBC he thinks Mexico will ""try to defuse the crisis"" the same way they did with the last migrant caravan: by giving some people legal status or the chance to apply for asylum and deporting others. ""The caravan will probably diminish before it reaches the US-Mexico border, but the whole episode will harden views on immigration in the US on both sides and make Mexico more wary about cooperating with the US,"" he says. An estimated 10% of the population of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have fled danger, forced gang recruitment and dismal economic opportunities. The region has one of the highest murder rates in the world. The UN reported murder rates in 2015 in Honduras standing at 63.75 deaths per 100,000 and El Salvador at 108.64 deaths.

economic indicators,Covid-19 putting children's services 'in crisis',2024-09-15,2021-04-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-tyne-56676794,"With local elections taking place on 6 May, the pandemic has highlighted some of the pressures councils are under. One of these is children's services; the government estimated that nationally councils spent an additional £136m on child social care between March and June last year. Durham County Council said it was using part of its reserves to put an extra £1m into children's services. Hartlepool Council said it faced a children's social care budget pressure of £2.5m, with 360 children in care. It described it as ""the biggest number ever cared for by the council"" and ""broadly the number of children in a typical primary school"". However, while the additional demands of Covid have accentuated this financial squeeze, it is a problem which has been growing for some time. Spending on services councils must provide by law for safeguarding and looking after children in care has risen 29% since 2010, according to the Children's Services Funding Alliance. That group, which comprises Action for Children, National Children's Bureau, Barnardo's, The Children's Society and the NSPCC, said that means other services such as youth centres and children's centres, which do not legally have to be provided, have been cut, with 1,760 closing nationally since 2010. It added that in the North East, money available for children's services excluding schools had fallen by a third per child since 2010. Stacey Wilson, from Newcastle, gave birth to Skye-Elouise during the first lockdown. The 35-year-old single mother said she could not have managed without help from the Newcastle Parent Infant partnership. She said: ""It was amazing, just helping me mentally, helping with my anxiety, encouraging me to leave the house more, putting me in touch with people who could bring me food or help with housing and stuff. ""They were brilliant from the start, [it] changed my life."" However, the funding for that scheme, a five-year grant from central government to Newcastle City Council, is due to run out in June. Ms Wilson said that while she can now manage, Children North East, which runs the project, said others will be hard hit. Lesley Hutchinson from the charity said: ""Local authorities are in an incredibly difficult position, it's been a very, very difficult year for all of us. ""Because of the pandemic we know there is going to be increased need coming up. ""We're going to have a whole cohort of babies who haven't experienced some of the normal things that babies would experience - they haven't been able to go out and socialise in groups, they haven't met anyone outside of their immediate family. We know the need is there."" Imran Hussain, from the charity Action For Children, said that the pandemic had put extra demands on children's services departments, adding: ""All the indicators are flashing red, and have been flashing red for a while. ""We're in a crisis, and when a system is in crisis one of the things you get is rationing."" The Department for Education said it had invested millions of pounds, including helping families with pandemic pressures. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

economic indicators,Edinburgh and Aberdeen in 'UK's top cities',2024-09-15,2018-11-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-46048963,"Edinburgh and Aberdeen are among the top 10 places to live and work, according to an index of UK cities. Across the UK this year's index shows a continuing gap between the highest performing cities of Oxford and Reading and the lowest ranking, Swansea and Sunderland. The Scottish capital has slipped from fourth to sixth, as housing affordability has caused challenges. Aberdeen climbed from 11 to nine in the rankings, with Glasgow at 25. The Good Growth for Cities Index, run by PwC, measures the performance of 42 of the UK's largest towns and cities. The index aims to show there is more to life, work and general wellbeing than simply measuring GDP. The 42 cities are measured against 10 indicators based on public views of what is key to economic success and wellbeing. In UK terms, even the cities towards the bottom of the index have improved significantly with Swansea demonstrating the greatest improvements in employment and environmental factors. PwC Scotland's Lindsay Gardiner said: ""Edinburgh remains one of the best cities in the UK to live and do business.  ""The announcement of the £1.3bn City Deal for the region will help the city futureproof itself in a world being rapidly altered by technology. ""While Edinburgh continues to perform above average in fields like jobs, income and skills, this index highlights some challenges, not least of which is housing affordability. This provides evidence that Edinburgh is paying the price of its success."" Kevin Reynard, senior partner for PwC in Aberdeen, said: ""There has been much talk about Aberdeen's recovery from the downturn in the oil and gas industry, and this year's index reinforces that this recovery is gaining momentum. ""We are now beginning to see the positive effects of the higher range of oil prices. ""What is more encouraging is to see Aberdeen return to the top 10 cities in the UK. With the city the best performing in Scotland in six of 12 measures used, it is clear Aberdeen is a fantastic city with much to offer."" According to the index, employment, health, income and skills are held to be the most important factors.  Housing affordability, commuting times, environmental factors and income inequality were also included, as was the number of new business start-ups. Scotland's poorest performing variable was health, with all Scottish cities at or below the UK average. Work-life balance, as defined by the percentage of those working more than 45 hours per week, has seen an improvement. New businesses, job creation, skills development and work-life balance have been the key long-term drivers of growth in Scotland's largest cities since the financial crisis. Despite being in the bottom half of the index, Glasgow was above average in job-creation, skills and work-life balance as above average as compared to the rest of the 42 UK cities in the index. Nevertheless, the latest edition shows all three main Scottish cities outperforming the UK in terms of jobs, skills, income and environment. David Brown, head of government and public sector for PwC in Scotland, said: ""Scotland's cities are in a stronger position today than prior to the financial downturn, and that is thanks to the country having continued to invest in jobs and skills."" Mr Brown added: ""There remain challenges in our cities, however. There is a widening gap between earnings and house prices, which keeps owner occupier rates down.  ""Scotland continues to score either at or below average when it comes to health."" With 10 years of data to draw upon, the index can chart a decade of changes across Scotland's cities since the global economic downturn. Edinburgh and Glasgow have increased their index scores by 0.31 and 0.45 respectively since 2005-07, well ahead of the UK average increase of 0.29 - driven, according to the report, by an improvement in skills among 25 to 64-year-olds.  Glasgow has seen a improvement in the new businesses, jobs and health variables.  Edinburgh has also seen an improvement in new businesses compared with 10 years ago, however the city has seen a widening of the gap between house prices and earnings."
economic indicators,No 'significant easing' of Covid rules expected,2024-09-15,2021-01-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-55733768,"No ""significant easing"" of Wales' Covid restrictions should be expected when the current guidelines are reviewed this month, the health minister said. Vaughan Gething said it was ""good news"" that case rates were falling, but warned they still remained high.  He told a Welsh Government briefing the NHS remained ""under pressure"" with critical care services operating at 150% of capacity. A further 44 people have died with coronavirus, taking the total to 4,346. And another 13,800 people had their first vaccine in the past day in Wales, taking the total to 175,816, according to latest figures. Mr Gething made the comments as he was outlining the current situation with Covid in Wales, but he said he did not want to prejudge a Welsh Government decision on the review. Wales has been in a level four lockdown since before Christmas with a decision on a review of the current restrictions expected by 29 January. The seven-day rolling case rate for Wales is 285 cases per 100,000 people, which is down from a high of 636 on 17 December. A key indicator in deciding to put Wales into the strictest alert level was Covid rates exceeding more than 300 cases per 100,000 people in a seven-day period. Wrexham has the highest rate in Wales with 673 cases per 100,000 people, followed by Flintshire with 480.5. Mr Gething said: ""If we come out of level four too soon, too fast, we could well see a rebound in Covid rates. ""And we could end up doing something that overwhelms our health service with all the harm that would cause to our staff and people who need our health service. ""People shouldn't expect any significant easing at the end of this current phase."" He said the Welsh Government would make a decision following advice from its scientific advisers and the chief medical officer. Under current lockdown rules, people are required to make essential journeys only and schools have been closed to most pupils with online learning in place. Mr Gething also said there would be a ""great many more difficult choices to make"" on dealing with Covid-19 with the Senedd election due in May. Ministers are seeking Senedd members' support for emergency legislation to allow the poll to be delayed by up to six months as a last resort. Mr Gething told the briefing: ""Even by the first week of May we can be confident that there will still be a great many more difficult choices to make before we can say the pandemic is over, and before we're then into what I believe will be a full term of recovery from the economic crisis that Covid has caused, as well as the health crisis.  ""This is a piece of legislation to guard against the possibility that Covid rates are so significant that we can't have an election."""
economic indicators,China's economy grows 18.3% in post-Covid comeback,2024-09-15,2021-04-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56768663,"China's economy grew a record 18.3% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter last year.  It's the biggest jump in gross domestic product (GDP) since China started keeping quarterly records in 1992.  However, Friday's figures are below expectations, with a Reuters poll of economists predicting 19% growth.  They are also heavily skewed, and less indicative of strong growth, as they are compared to last year's huge economic contraction. In the first quarter of 2020, China's economy shrank 6.8% due to nationwide lockdowns at the peak of its Covid-19 outbreak.    ""The national economy made a good start,"" said China's National Bureau of Statistics, which released the first quarter data. But it added: ""We must be aware that the Covid-19 epidemic is still spreading globally and the international landscape is complicated with high uncertainties and instabilities."" Other key figures released by China's statistics department also point to a continuing rebound, but are also unusually strong because they are compared against extremely weak numbers from last year.   Industrial output for March rose 14.1% over a year ago, while retail sales grew 34.2%.  It's ironic that China's economic boom has been announced just as its leader wrestles with the problem of climate change - which has been caused by economic growth over the decades. Historically, that growth has been almost completely fuelled by emissions from burning coal, gas and oil. China has promised to freeze its growth in emissions by 2030 and halt them totally by 2060. But President Xi is hearing from France's President Macron and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel  that it can and should freeze emissions earlier - perhaps by 2025. Leaders of the EU and US are also urging China to stop funding new coal-fired power plants in poor nations in the so-called Belt and Road initiative. The world will suffer, they say, if African nations follow the polluting path to prosperity laid down by nations which got rich on coal. ""Promisingly, the monthly indicators suggest that industrial production, consumption and investment all gained pace in March on a sequential basis, following the weakness in the first two months,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at research and consultancy firm Oxford Economics.  However, some analysts predicted a number of sectors will slow as government fiscal and monetary support is reduced. Yue Su,  the Economist Intelligence Unit's principal economist for China, while the latest figures show that the country's economic recovery is broad-based, some production and export activity could have been ""front-loaded"" into the first quarter, suggesting slower growth ahead.  ""Trade performance and domestic industrial activities for the rest of year might not be able to maintain such strong momentum, due to lack of measures to stimulate domestic economy,"" she said.   The figures nevertheless suggest China has continued to gain economic momentum. Comparing growth for the last quarter with the last quarter of 2020, the Chinese economy grew by a far smaller 0.6%. Helped by strict virus containment measures and emergency relief for businesses, the economy has recovered steadily since the pandemic hit.  Despite a calamitous start to the year, China was the only major economy to register growth in 2020 albeit its weakest in decades, at 2.3%. China has set an economic growth target of 6% for 2021, after scrapping its target last year."
economic indicators,Why Indian children are getting fatter,2024-09-15,2022-07-29,By Geeta Pandey,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-62307784,"India has long topped the list of countries with the highest number of malnourished children in the world. It's now increasingly also reporting alarming levels of childhood obesity which, experts say, could take on the form of an epidemic if not tackled urgently. When 14-year-old Mihir Jain first rolled into Delhi's Max Hospital in 2017 in his wheelchair to consult Dr Pradeep Chowbey, the bariatric surgeon said he ""couldn't believe my eyes"". ""Mihir was super-super obese, he couldn't stand properly and he wasn't able to open his eyes as his face was fluffy. He weighed 237kg (523lbs) and his body mass index (BMI) was 92."" According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a BMI of 25 or above is considered overweight. After weeks of treatment and a gastric bypass surgery in the summer of 2018, Mihir's weight came down to 165kg.  At the time, Mihir was described as the ""world's heaviest teen"" - the label could be an exaggeration, but India is home to an estimated 18 million overweight and obese children and their number is rising daily. The latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5, conducted in 2019-21), the most comprehensive household survey of health and social indicators by the government, found that 3.4% of children under five are now overweight compared with 2.1% in 2015-16.  On the face of it, the numbers seem small, but Dr Arjan de Wagt, chief of nutrition at Unicef in India, says that ""even a very small percentage can mean very large numbers"" because of the size of the Indian population.  According to Unicef's World Obesity Atlas for 2022, India is predicted to have more than 27 million obese children, representing one in 10 children globally, by 2030. It ranks 99th on the list of 183 countries in terms of preparedness to deal with obesity and the economic impact of overweight and obesity is expected to rise from $23bn in 2109 to a whopping $479bn by 2060. ""We are staring at a massive problem of childhood obesity in India,"" says Dr de Wagt. ""And because the behaviour that starts obesity generally starts in childhood, obese children grow up to be obese adults."" And that is a major worry for health experts. According to WHO, too much body fat increases the risk of non-communicable diseases, including 13 types of cancer, type-2 diabetes, heart problems and lung conditions, leading to premature deaths. Last year, obesity accounted for 2.8 million deaths globally. India has already broken into the top five countries in terms of adult obesity in the past few years. One estimate in 2016 put 135 million Indians as overweight or obese and their numbers are growing. Dr de Wagt says that in India - where 36% children under five years are still stunted - the gains we've been making in combating undernutrition are offset by over-nutrition. ""People are under-nutritioned and over-nutritioned at the same time. Overweight and obesity are results of overnutrition, but that doesn't mean that one's getting all the nutrition they need.""  The biggest problem, he says, ""is the nutritional illiteracy"".  ""If children are given balanced meals that include carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, fruits and vegetables, then it would prevent both undernutrition and overnutrition. But people don't know what is good food, they eat to fill their bellies. they're eating more carbs, more convenience food."" Dr de Wagt says data shows that although childhood obesity is a problem among all social classes, it is more common in urban richer families where children are being fed a diet of food and drinks high in fat, sugar and salt. A 2019 survey by Max Healthcare in Delhi and its suburbs revealed that at least 40% children (5-9 year olds), teens (10-14 year olds) and adolescents (15-17 year olds) were overweight or obese. ""Youngsters sleep late and often resort to midnight binging, mostly on unhealthy snacks,"" says Dr Chowbey. ""They do not burn any calories after eating late at night as they sleep after that and during the day, they are lethargic which means they burn few calories. Moreover, children are spending a lot more time on computers and phones instead of running around and playing."" ""Obesity,"" he also warns, ""impacts not just medical, but each and every aspect of life, including psychological and social. Obese children often face prejudice and social isolation."" Dr Ravindran Kumeran, a surgeon in the southern city of Chennai (Madras) and founder of the Obesity Foundation of India, says unless we intervene with children now, we will not be able to address the problem of obesity in the country. ""If you watch TV now for half an hour, you will see many advertisements about junk food and those glorifying soft drinks. This constant false messaging about benefits of unhealthy junk food must stop, and it can only be done by the government."" Also, he says, we need to get more children into the outdoors.  ""As a country we don't invest in physical fitness. Our cities have no footpaths, there are no safe cycle tracks, and there are few playgrounds where children can play."" That's what Sportz Village, a youth sports organisation, is trying to change, its co-founder and CEO  Saumil Majumdar told the BBC. ""In our country, schools are mostly the only places that offer a safe place for children to play, so schools must play their part in combating obesity,"" he says. Their survey of more than 254,000 children showed that one in two children did not have healthy BMI; a large number of children lacked flexibility, had poor abdominal or core strength and fared poorly on upper and lower body strengths It's not a problem of policy. All schools have physical education classes, but generally only children who are good get any attention. So it's not fun for children who don't enjoy playing,"" Mr Majumdar says. ""We believe that in schools just as children have to learn the basic level of any subject, in the same manner they must be taught the basic levels of fitness.""  Over the years, he says, the schools they've worked with have shown improvements. ""In some cases we have seen fitness levels on some parameters improved from 5% to 17% and we've also managed to get more girls to play. I think play can solve all the world's problems,"" he adds.

economic indicators,NI private sector activity falls again,2024-09-15,2021-03-08,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-56266970,"Economic output in NI's private sector continued to fall in February because of the coronavirus lockdown, according to an Ulster Bank survey. It also indicated that prices rose at their fastest rate since 2008.  Each month it asks private sector firms about new orders, staffing and exports in what is considered a reliable indicator of economic performance. Chief economist at Ulster Bank, Richard Ramsey, said the main trigger for recovery would be lifting restrictions. ""The one real positive in the latest survey is that Northern Ireland businesses are more optimistic about business activity in 12 months' time than they have been since the pandemic began,"" he added. But the survey suggested conditions remain challenging. Mr Ramsey said Northern Ireland was at the ""bottom of the UK regional table as far as output, orders and employment were concerned"". ""Meanwhile, it was ranked at the top when it comes to input costs and output price inflation,"" he said. ""Once again, shipping costs, raw materials and Brexit-related costs were cited as factors."" The survey indicated that manufacturing and construction firms raised their own prices at the sharpest rate in its history (almost 19 years). Mr Ramsey said: ""Looking to the months ahead, whilst conditions will remain challenging for some time, confidence will likely continue to build as the vaccine rollout continues. ""But the key trigger for a recovery in some sectors, particularly retail and services, is going to be when the current restrictions are lifted."""
economic indicators,Can Fed chief dig himself out of a (Jackson) Hole?,2024-09-15,2019-08-22,By Russell Hotten,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49415776,"Jerome Powell may be ""clueless"" according to US President Donald Trump. But when the Federal Reserve head takes centre stage at a gathering of the banking elite this weekend there'll be plenty of people watching for his clues on restoring global economic balance. It's the annual symposium of central bankers from around the world, held in the picturesque Wyoming mountain village of Jackson Hole. Mr Powell's keynote speech is the much-anticipated highlight. According to Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities: ""The whole point [of Jackson Hole] is to get away, take a step back from what we are currently seeing in the economy, and talk about some of the longer term issues."" But will Mr Powell have that luxury? Such is the anxiety gripping financial markets, there's an expectation he needs to address immediate issues: interest rate direction, conflicting signals on Wall Street, the China trade row, stimulus, perhaps even Mr Trump's constant sniping. Mr Powell faces a balancing act: Calm jittery financial markets without antagonising further a hostile president who only this week called him a ""golfer who can't putt"". Many think it's a no-win situation. For Ms House, it's not even as if the US economy is in particularly bad shape. She told the BBC that Mr Trump perhaps has a point when he insists in his Twitter outpourings that the economy is in rude health.  She said: ""The consumer sector is very strong right now. The labour market is hot - we've got close to the lowest unemployment rate in about 50 years… Savings rates are quite high."" Should the economy turn sour, ""there's a lot of cushion to fall back on"". It's in China and Europe, specifically Germany, where many of the big economic problems lay, she said. And yet, there are fears the US economy, which has expanded each year for more than a decade, is at risk of stalling - perhaps even tipping into recession. Such is Wall Street's unease that share markets plunged 3% one day last week, only to recover almost as quickly. But it is in the bond markets - basically, the area that deals with loans to governments and companies - where recession signals have been flashing brightest.  This month it became more expensive for the US government to borrow money over two years than 10. Usually, investors want a higher rate of return for locking up money for 10 years - compensation for unforeseeable risks. When the reverse is the case - a so-called bond yield inversion - it suggests investors think the short-term economic picture is gloomy. What's more, an inversion has proved a reliable (though by no means conclusive) indicator that recession is on its way. The president has dismissed recession warnings. Yet on Tuesday, he touted tax cuts to boost the economy - only to dismiss the idea on Wednesday. Many asked, if Mr Trump thinks the economy is in good health, why contemplate a tax stimulus? There is, then, a mass of conflicting signals that analysts would like Mr Powell to cut through and clear up.  As Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell points out, when the jobs and consumer markets are healthy, you would normally expect pressure for interest rate rises, not cuts. It's ""just a little odd"", he told the BBC.  Minutes released this week from the last Fed meeting, in July, underlined the confusion. Rates were cut 25 basis points, but the minutes show some policymakers wanted to go further, while others were against a cut. At the very least, the Jackson Hole elite should ""send a signal to markets that they are attuned to the risks and at least doing what they can"", Mr Mould said. A big problem for the Fed chief, however, is that Mr Trump has painted him as an economic threat, and few people have come to the central banker's support. Populists side with the president, while Democrats and progressives think the Fed is just out to protect Wall Street and don't want to be seen as defenders. Karen Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, says Mr Trump has set up Mr Powell for blame if, or when, things go wrong. For all the president's contradictions, he's a master of political reality, she says. ""Mr Trump doesn't care what rates are. He cares about who voters think is to blame for slower growth and market turmoil, and he is determined to be sure it isn't him,"" she said. ""What's an astute politician to do? Find a fall guy distrusted by Republicans, Democrats, independents, populists, and progressives."" Some experts think it's time Mr Powell gave a more forceful response to pressure coming from the White House. Central bankers have emerged from the shadows since the global financial crisis, to be seen as economic saviours with a more powerful public voice. Joseph Song, senior economist at Bank of America, thinks Mr Powell and other Fed policymakers will at the very least defend the Fed's independence. ""They are going to try to hammer home that message again and again, and make sure that they preserve their independence,"" he told the BBC. But the Fed's task is pretty straightforward (if difficult): keep the labour market strong without causing inflation. It means the central bank alone cannot deliver what Mr Trump ultimately wants - sustained economic growth and financial stability - and Mr Powell should perhaps stand up and say so, says Mohamed El-Erian, former head of bond trading giant Pimco. But, as Mr El-Erian wrote this week in an article for Bloomberg, any push back against the president ""risks fuelling immediate market instability and aggravating White House anger"". Perhaps it would be better to say nothing at all, he ponders. ""No wonder a growing number of observers wonder whether central banks should revisit the mantra that more communication and policy transparency are always better - a traditional wisdom that led Powell to increase the frequency of press conferences,"" he said. But after all the expectation, if the Fed chief does opt for diplomacy and prudence, it could end up making Jackson Hole something an anti-climax."
economic indicators,"Levelling up: 'It's about people, not shiny new buildings'",2024-09-15,2022-02-05,By Steve Swann & Michael Buchanan,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60154310,"This week the government published its eagerly awaited White Paper, setting out plans to reduce regional inequality. Levelling up aims to revitalise communities in places like Rhyl, where BBC News has been tracking progress of this key policy.   But lessons from previous efforts are not being learnt, claim critics. And the focus should be on people rather than ""shiny new buildings"", says the former head of a flagship scheme in Newcastle.  Florist Carol Parr clips the ends of flower stems on a bouquet as she explains the dilemma she faced. ""I had a little battle with myself. Do I stay? Do I commit to Rhyl?"" she says. ""Not many people say good things about Rhyl, which I can understand based on crime, there's a lot of trouble.""  Despite that, Carol opted to move into a larger shop on the high street three years ago. ""I'm very optimistic and over the last two or three years I have seen a change in Rhyl. I think it's an up-and-coming town again.""   Such optimism is not always evident in the seaside town, which was struggling long before its economy was pounded by the pandemic. But Carol's act of faith may be repaid.   The local MP and the county council want to transform the town centre and recently prepared a £10m bid from the UK government's levelling up fund.   Money from the £4.8bn fund aims to narrow the gap between richer and poorer parts of the UK. It will allow overlooked and undervalued communities to take back control of their destiny, the levelling up minister, Michael Gove, told parliament on Wednesday. But there are concerns that vital lessons from the past are being ignored.   A generation ago, West Newcastle was undergoing a radical plan for change. It was one of 39 English communities that received funds under Labour's New Deal for Communities (NDC). Within a few years levels of deprivation fell.  Graeme Williams ran the scheme and on a freezing cold January afternoon he gives us a tour of the area. We walk in shadows cast by the tower blocks of Cruddas Park, not far from the city centre. Twenty years ago ""they looked awful"", says Mr Williams. ""They were awful."" Some of the blocks were refurbished, others demolished as part of the £55m spent in West Newcastle during a decade of regeneration. But most of the money didn't go on capital projects, such as buildings.  His team appointed eight people who knew the area well to work with residents to prioritise what changes were needed. Decisions were taken by a management board made up mostly of residents.   The emphasis was ""around training, education and supporting people to move into employment"", says Mr Williams. ""People recognised they had agency where they could actually generate change."" It gave them hope.   An independent assessment of the New Deal for Communities by academics at Sheffield Hallam University concluded ""in many respects these neighbourhoods have been transformed"". It said: ""The biggest improvements were for indicators of people's feelings about their neighbourhoods."" Mr Williams still works in the city. He is now a director of the Centre West charity. And while proud of some of his achievements, he says a lot of work was ""undone by austerity"" which ""hammered areas like the west end of Newcastle"".  ""It's massively disheartening and incredibly frustrating because we seem to take two steps forward and then two or three steps back as far as urban regeneration is concerned,"" he says. ""There's an awful lot of really good evaluation work that's been done to identify what works and how we can do things better and it's not being used. ""  Levelling up ""might produce some nice shiny new buildings. But I don't think it will necessarily improve the lives and prospects of people living in them communities"".  Supporters of what the Labour government policy achieved include a former Tory speech writer for Theresa May. Will Tanner, now director of the Onward think tank, assessed 60 years of regeneration projects by previous governments. ""This isn't a party-political point. This is just about the right policy based on the evidence,"" he says.   He said putting power in the hands of communities worked best, ""so they are pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps, rather than relying on a top-down government programme"".  He says the government is right to want to change the economic geography of the UK and is supportive of its plans. But adds: ""The most important thing for the levelling up fund to do is to let go of power from Whitehall and to empower community organisations right down at the hyper-local level.""  The White Paper acknowledges the importance of local decision-making and promises more regional mayors. It isn't yet clear what role will be played by people at a neighbourhood level.  Back in Rhyl, we stroll around the town centre with Conservative MP James Davies, walking past boarded up and shuttered shops. He agrees. ""Just building things, bricks and mortar is not the answer. It needs to be a cleverly thought through scheme that's going to boost economic activity.""  We pause outside the derelict Queen's Market, which is being bulldozed. It's hoped a new food hall with flats and offices will be developed on the site through a mix of funding from the Welsh government, Denbighshire County Council, the levelling up fund and private businesses.  The plans would also see the town reconnected to the seafront. Incredibly, though an expansive sandy beach is just yards away, you can't see it from the high street.  Dr Davies says there is local backing. A master plan went out to consultation and has ""the support of local councils, residents, businesses"". But a potential obstacle is the number of high street shops owned by absentee landlords. A sample of Land Registry documents seen by BBC News show only five out of 25 High Street properties are owned by people local to Rhyl.  ""That's a real challenge,"" Dr Davies acknowledges. ""All you can do is invest in the areas that the local authority and willing partners own as a priority. And then you hope that economic activity will encourage others to follow over time."" The BBC is tracking progress of the government's key levelling up policy in towns and cities around the UK. You can read more of our reporting from Rhyl here: How do locals out and about on a beautiful, bright winter's morning feel about their town centre and the plans to regenerate it?  ""I'm not quite sure how to put this. It's appalling,"" says a man who moved to Rhyl seven years ago. ""Shops closing, shutting arcades. Rhyl just isn't what it used to be. I don't think it will ever come back.""  But octogenarian former mayor, Diana Hannan, out on her mobility scooter, loves the town so much she moved back after emigrating to Australia. ""We've got the best seaside resort in Wales,"" she says.   ""We get all this negative press about drugs and alcohol and all the rest of it, but we've got a lovely community living here. Rhyl is going to boom. You wait until all of these stores go up.""  On the road out of town we stop off at a food bank run out of the back of the Wellspring church. Amid shelves straining under the weight of tins of baked beans, pastor Mark Jones explains how Rhyl is full of ""fabulous people"". But he says ""there's a lack of energy, a lack of enthusiasm"". ""There's this sense of hopelessness amongst the people. If you walk down the high street, you can just see it in people's eyes.""  Mr Jones, who has lived in the town for more than 40 years, supports the levelling up plans but says the proposals ""need to show the people of Rhyl that there is a hope and a future for them"".  ""It's OK to invest,"" he says. ""But you also need to inspire."" "
economic indicators,Signs of an economic recovery?,2024-09-15,2021-06-14,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-57472785,"Koslapp: in Swedish, it means the release of the cows. After a long dark winter of bovine boredom in lockdown, the ruminants run out into the fresh spring grass, a-jumpin', a-gambollin' and a-munchin', watched by picnicking Nordic families who share the sentiments. We're seeing something similar in economic figures. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) gives us our freshest indicator of what's been happening recently.  For May, the release of pent-up frustration is evident in the strongest figures we've seen, at least in the 23 years the data has been collected for Scotland. We have, collectively, been behaving a bit like frustrated but now less constrained Swedish cows. That's not to say we're at record output and record employment. The peak was in February last year, before an unprecedented slump into April, and a 2020 fall in output of around 10%.  Returning to the pre-pandemic levels will probably take until at least the end of this year or early next year, though the USA and China have got there already. Indeed, the G20, representing much of the world's economy, has collectively got back into positive territory.  The UK took an unusually big hit, so it's got a lot of catching up to do. It made good progress in April, according to the Office for National Statistics - up by 2.3%, and reaching a level 3.7% below the previous peak.  The most recent Scottish government figures tell us output grew 2.3% in March, and reached 5.7% below peak, so not much different. Compare that with the calamitous first full lockdown month of April last year, when output was down by 25% on the peak. The most recent Gross Domestic Product figures might have looked even better if April hadn't seen so many offshore oil and gas platforms having planned maintenance, with production that month down by 15%. That overall picture masks big differences in sectors. Some are ahead of the previous peak, but accommodation and food services in April was 40% below peak. Instead of total output, these PMI figures show us the rate of improvement on the early 2021 lockdown: a record acceleration in output, new orders and recruitment. Even with such records, Scotland lags the rest of the UK in the release of economic activity. Manufacturing takes the lead, and the giant services sector is not far behind. It's plain to see, from the figures and from anecdotal evidence, that parts of the hospitality sector are struggling to meet the surge in demand, with new staff, struggling to implement new rules on social distancing and table service. There are people looking for jobs and plenty of employers looking for recruits. Vacancies have been on the rise, in Scotland up to 43,000 in May.  Among the problems is a mismatch between the skills on offer and where they are: a case of ""wrong workers in the wrong place at the wrong time"". It seems many young people have taken a step off the jobs treadmill, many with the help of furlough, and either discovered they don't much like the unsocial hours of bar and restaurant work - least of all while unvaccinated - or they have found jobs that make better use of their skills. It seems the next cohort of recruits into lower-paying jobs in hospitality have yet to sign up. For that reason, The Economist this week is reporting that lower paid workers in Britain are in a strong bargaining position on pay, and for the first time in around 20 years. The ONS tells us that median pay in Scotland was up 3% in April. That is one of the factors that has economists concerned about inflationary pressures. Another is a red hot market for homes, with price inflation running at more than 10%, fuelled by a tax break coming to an end in England, but also going very strongly in much of Scotland. The pressure is growing for the Bank of England to reign in its quantitative easing and the mortgage market. Tourism is only one part of hospitality, but an important one, and we have yet more data from the Moffat Centre on Tourism at Glasgow Caledonian University. It covers 179 organisations, representing more than 300 visitor attractions. As circulated by the Scottish Tourism Alliance, it looks like visitor attractions are opening up, but far from positive about their finances: The data keeps flowing from the self-caterers' association. This is one sector which appears to be doing well, at least in the smaller operations for single families. Larger properties where several households get together struggle with the rules on households mixing. The association found a third of members are open and profitable. Nearly as many are open but with reduced occupancy. Nearly half (46%) are operating at an economically unsustainable position, with nearly three-quarters (74%) concerned about the viability of their business if restrictions persist. A further survey for the outdoor, nature and adventure sector, represented by the Wild Scotland trade group, has been doing its own survey. With 116 responses, it found: So for all that there is a feelgood factor of people getting out and about again, and bookings in some sectors are very strong, the evidence from the tourism sector is that the continuing restrictions and the outlook remain exceptionally tough."
economic indicators,How India taught the world the art of collecting data,2024-09-15,2022-06-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61870699,"Indian data is staring at a credibility crisis with official numbers on a range of subjects - from Covid deaths to jobs - being questioned by independent experts. But not too long ago, the country was seen as a world leader in data collection, writes author and historian Nikhil Menon.  Soon after India became independent from British rule, the country took inspiration from the Soviet Union to organise its economy - through centralised five-year plans. This made it imperative for policymakers to have access to accurate, granular information about India's economy.  Here, India faced a problem - as its first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru put it, ""we have no data"", because of which ""we function largely in the dark"". Setting up a vast data infrastructure was meant to turn on the lights. Perhaps the most transformative of the changes introduced was the National Sample Survey, which was established in 1950. It was intended to be a series of sprawling, nationwide surveys that captured information on all aspects of the economic life of citizens.  The idea behind this was that since it would be impossible (or prohibitively expensive) to collect statistics from every household across the nation, it was better to develop a robust and representative sample so that the whole could be calculated from a small fraction. It was, according to an assessment published by the Hindustan Times newspaper in 1953, ""the biggest and most comprehensive sampling inquiry ever undertaken in any country in the world"".  Nehru handed the responsibility of running the survey to scientist PC Mahalanobis - now called the father of Indian statistics - and the organisation he founded, the Indian Statistical Institute. They faced enormous challenges. In order to properly survey the 1,833 sample villages out of the total 560,000, the short-staffed institute needed investigators who could together negotiate 15 languages and 140 local systems of measurement.  In his diary, Mahalanobis wrote about this highly complex operation with the excitement of an adventurer. There were ""wild areas"" in Orissa where investigators had to be accompanied by armed guards through forests; sometimes they had to cross snow-clad high Himalayan passes.  His language reflected the attitudes of the times. In Assam, the surveyors met ""the most civilized people"" and also ""uncivilized naked tribes"" who didn't speak a known language. The tribals ""know not what money means,"" he wrote, and ""laugh at the word economic development"". Elsewhere, criminals harassed National Sample Survey staff. A persistent problem was the jungle; ""dense, impregnable forests with wild animals and epidemic tropical diseases"". In some parts, the danger was even starker: investigators complained of having to fight through forests ""infested with wild-beasts and man eaters"". But the results of the survey were extraordinary, delivering remarkably granular information about the daily lives of Indians. The second survey, for example, told policymakers exactly how much one Chidambaram Mudaly, his wife, three daughters, and mother-in-law - who lived in a remote village in the southern state of Tamil Nadu - spent on ghee, rice, wheat, salt, tea, chillies and other essentials. While this family's financial outlay wasn't significant on its own, when aggregated with tens of thousands of other data points, it allowed economic planners and policymakers to understand the economy in a fundamentally different way. Since then, the National Sample Survey has consistently yielded fine-grained detail about economic life in India, helping assess poverty, employment, consumption and expenditure, to mention just a few indicators.  Furthermore, it has made contributions to policymaking at a global level. The methods pioneered by it are now used by the World Bank and the United Nations. As Nobel Prize-winning economist Angus Deaton and co-author Valerie Kozel wrote in 2005: ""Where Mahalanobis and India led, the rest of the world has followed, so that today, most countries have a recent household income or expenditure survey."" ""Most countries,"" they continued, ""can only envy India in its statistical capacity"". Economists TN Srinivasan, Rohini Somanathan, Pranab Bardhan and another Nobel-winner Abhijit Banerjee have since argued that there is ""no other instance of an entirely homegrown institution in a developing country becoming a world leader in a large field of general interest"". The rise of modern India's data capacities is inseparable from the story of the enigmatic Mahalanobis (who was known as ""the Professor""). What began as a chance encounter with a journal of statistics aboard a ship - when Mahalanobis was returning from Cambridge to Calcutta during World War One - resulted in the transformation of India's data infrastructure in the decade after the country's independence.  Drawing some of the leading statisticians and economists in the world to the lush Calcutta (now known as Kolkata) campus of the Indian Statistical Institute, Mahalanobis helped elevate it to an institution of international excellence. Together, they helped calculate India's GDP, staffed the Central Statistical Organization, designed the National Sample Survey, and brought India its first-ever digital computers. Much of the institutional architecture they built holds up even today, and India marks Mahalanobis' birth date, 29 June, as ""Statistics Day"". But today, Indian data appears to be in crisis. As the world surges into the era of ""big data"", India risks being left behind. The Economist recently sounded the alarm, warning that the country's ""statistical infrastructure is crumbling"". Official figures on issues ranging from Covid mortality to education to poverty are all increasingly distrusted by independent observers and experts - which has alarming implications for policymaking and government accountability.  What makes this especially unfortunate is that India was once a trailblazer in this field. The country would do well to take pride in that inheritance and restore its lost lustre. Nikhil Menon is the author of a new book, Planning Democracy: How a Professor, An Institute, and an Idea Shaped India, published by Penguin Viking. He is an assistant professor of history at the University of Notre Dame."
economic indicators,Has Zimbabwe's economy stabilised?,2024-09-15,2019-07-21,By Reality Check team,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48993701,"The Zimbabwean authorities reintroduced the Zimbabwean dollar as the country's sole legal tender in June. Zimbabwe has not had its own independent currency for a decade, relying instead on the US dollar and a local money system pegged to the dollar. Foreign Minister Sibusiso Moyo said that reintroducing the Zimbabwe dollar has stabilised the economy. But is he right? Reality Check looked at the country's key economic indicators before and after the currency was reintroduced.  It's true the economy is no longer in the extreme inflationary spiral seen in 2008, but there continue to be severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel. The introduction of the new currency came at a sensitive time. There was understandable concern that bringing back the Zimbabwe dollar would lead to a return to the chaotic hyperinflation which destroyed savings and made wages worthless. The most recent figures suggest annual inflation has risen sharply over the last year.  In May it was 98% and by June, annual inflation stood at 176%.  This is nowhere near the spiralling inflation levels of a decade ago, but the trend has not been encouraging.   We don't have the inflation figures for July as the authorities have said they won't be publishing annual inflation data until February 2020. There's also debate about whether the official number accurately captures the increase in goods on shop floors and at petrol stations, for instance.  Leading economists say it's likely the cost of living is higher than official figures indicate. Since the introduction of the new currency on 24 June, it has fallen against the US dollar. This benefits Zimbabwe's agricultural exports, mainly its tobacco sector. But any positive effects are likely to be outweighed by more expensive imports, leading to further inflationary pressures on the economy. The weaker currency is likely to have an impact across the economy, as importers struggle to get access to foreign exchange such as the US dollar in order to buy goods from abroad. Taking a longer term view, the government has reduced spending since October last year and is now running a budget surplus, which it says is an indication of an improving economy. Independent economists are sceptical about these numbers.  Public sector workers in Zimbabwe are paid in local currency and there are fears that because of its decline against the US dollar, and because of inflation, they are now, in effect, earning less.  Zimbabwe's main public sector workers' union, Apex Council, said in a petition that the value of earnings has fallen ""from at least $475 to a mere $47 currently for the lowest paid civil servant"" since October last year.   Cecilia Alexander, Apex Council chairwoman, said the government's austerity plans had left workers mired in poverty.  Unions have, however, agreed a one-off payment of 400 Zimbabwean dollars ($45) to every worker in July, while talks on pay continue.

economic indicators,Inequality in India can be seen from outer space,2024-09-15,2018-05-26,By Soutik Biswas,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44193144,"Are night lights on earth captured by satellites from outer space a good way to measure inequality? Economists Praveen Chakravarty and Vivek Dehejia certainly believe so. They acquired images grabbed by satellites from the US Air Force Defence Meteorological Satellite Programme. These satellites circle the earth 14 times a day and record lights from the earth's surface at night with sensors. They superimposed a map depicting India's districts on their images, allowing them to develop a unique data set of luminosity values, by district and over time. Using data generated by the night lights, they studied of 387 of 640 districts in 12 states. These districts account for 85% of India's population and 80% of its GDP. Some 87% of parliamentary seats are in these districts. Using the novel methodology, the economists documented income divergence in India. Most of India is dark at night because there is little economic activity going on. But the delicate tracery of lights as seen from space also showed that the states are becoming more unequal between and within them.  Some 380 districts in 12 states were on average just a fifth as bright as the big cities of Mumbai and Bangalore.  Also, 90% of all the districts are just a third as bright in the night as the top 10% of all districts. And the ratio has worsened between 1992 - a year after India embraced economic reforms - and 2013.   While the pre-1991 years show a modest trend towards convergence of income between different states, the years after show widening divergence. By 2014, the economists found, the average person in the three richest states (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra) was three times as rich as the average person in the three poorest states (Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh).  ""What we find is that both across states and across districts with each state, this is a wide, and widening disparity in economic activity.  No, it is not that the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, but that the poor are not getting richer fast enough to close the gap with the already rich,"" says Dr Dehejia, a senior fellow at the Mumbai-based think tank IDFC Institute. In other words, less developed states are falling behind the more prosperous states. ""This is a level of regional inequality unprecedented in large federal states in contemporary world economic history.""  So why are disparities within India rising even as standards of living are going up? Some economists believe it could be due to poor governance and lack of adequate skills for jobs in poorer areas. But, in the end, it remains a puzzle. The economists find this worrying. In a large and complex country like India, they warn, this could ""easily lead to social disharmony as populous, poorer regions attempt to extract greater redistribution from less populous, richer regions - whether within or across states"". Dr Dehejia feels it would be a good idea for the government to use night lights as a proxy to measure economic activity in India. ""We have a paucity of good data in India. And no single data set is a silver bullet,"" he says.  And anyway, proxies have been used for long to measure growth. The US central bank has used electricity consumed as an indicator of economic activity. One economist estimated national income for Habsburg successor states by relating GDP per capita to letters mailed per person, among other things. Economists have even used skeletal remains to measure standard and inequality in the US.  Night lights pose their own challenges. One is accounting for the phases of the moon, which constantly varies the amount of light shining on earth. Then there's atmospheric effects due to aerosols, water vapour and ozone, and extraneous light sources such as solar illumination. But the latest sensors on satellites have been yielding richer spatial details like detecting lit roads and dimly lit sources. Scientists have been developing new software and algorithms to make night lights imagery clearer, more accurate and readily available. Over time researchers have used night lights captured from space to find out how cities expand, and track land-use changes. They have monitored light intensity to estimate use of energy during festive seasons. Night lights have been used to track conditions in conflict-affected areas, and help in disaster response. They have have helped explain seasonal fluctuations in infectious diseases, mapped carbon emissions and light pollution, among other things.  ""In other words,"" says Bhartendu Pandey of Yale University who works on the subject, ""night lights observed from more than 800km (497 miles) above the surface of the earth tell us a story about human activities and dynamism that no other data source does."""
economic indicators,Smallest September deficit for 10 years,2024-09-15,2017-10-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41691656,"Britain saw its smallest budget deficit for any September in the last 10 years, according to official figures. Last month's deficit stood at £5.902bn, down almost 11% compared with the same month last year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. With many economists having forecast a deficit of about £6.5bn, the news will be a boost for Chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of next month's Budget. The deficit for August was also revised down by about £1bn to £4.716bn  September's figures marked the third straight month in which UK public finances were better than analysts had forecast. The ONS said public sector net debt, excluding state-owned banks, had increased by £145.2bn since September last year to £1,785.3bn, equivalent to 87.2% of gross domestic product. A Treasury spokesman said: ""Whilst we've made great progress getting the deficit down by over two thirds, government borrowing is still far too high at over £150m a day. ""We will continue to take a balanced approach that deals with our debts and allows us to invest in our public services."" For at least eight years, the central preoccupation of government has been how much the chancellor is having to borrow. If austerity means reducing public spending overall, it isn't happening, and in fact has rarely happened since the government started talking about it seven years ago. In the April-to-September period, central government spent £360bn, about 3% more than in the same period in the previous financial year. What redeems the public finances is the fact that in spite of all the other economic indicators pointing to a slowdown, the amount of tax collected - VAT, income tax, national insurance, stamp duty - grew faster.  What about the total debt? That's now £1,637.8bn, up £44.9bn compared with the same time last year. Surely that's scary? Well, actually if you look at it as a proportion of the overall economy it's 80% of GDP - down 0.4 percentage points. So debt is growing - but slower than the economy.  Before the chancellor completely puts his feet up, though, he may have to think about productivity. Much of the growth in the economy and the tax receipts is because more of us are working and therefore paying more tax.  What hasn't grown is the amount we each individually produce - productivity. And if that's flat, it will put a brake on any improvement in the public finances.  The ONS said the lower borrowing in September was helped by stronger receipts from VAT, income and the stamp duty property tax, although corporation tax revenues were down slightly on a year ago. However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said lower borrowing was still predominantly driven by spending cuts, not a rebound in tax receipts. He said government spending rose by just 2.2% year-on-year in September, half the 4.4% increase anticipated by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which provides independent analysis on the UK's public finances. ""By contrast, tax receipts increased by just 3.4% year-over-year in September, only a touch above the OBR's 2.7% full-year expectation and below the 3.8% average of the first five months of the fiscal year,"" Mr Tombs said. ""The chancellor, therefore, is unlikely to soften the existing plans in next month's Budget enough to prevent the fiscal consolidation from intensifying next year,"" he said. The borrowing data would, however, bring ""some cheer"" for the chancellor ahead of the Budget, said John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC. He said: ""Both the half year borrowing total and the deficit in September alone were the lowest since before the financial crisis in 2007. ""The 'black hole' that opened up in the UK public finances after the crisis has largely been filled, albeit at the cost of a much higher accumulated public debt stock."" He said it should mean the chancellor can ""find some extra money for priorities like housing and the NHS, but any giveaways are likely to be offset to a significant degree by fiscal take-backs""."
economic indicators,Essex youngster Das excited by Bangladesh challenge,2024-09-15,2023-01-16,Tawhid Qureshi,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/64212265,"Robin Das has made 10 appearances for Essex Most 20-year-olds studying for a degree in history are likely to be thinking about a new term of lectures and essay deadlines. But for Robin Das, the young Essex batter, a totally different experience awaits. ""I couldn't be more excited, not only to play in my first franchise tournament, but also for it to be in Bangladesh,"" he enthuses. Das is one of a tiny number of professionals in the English game who has Bangladeshi heritage. In common with the majority of British Bangladeshis, Robin's family originate from the Sylhet region. When the chance to play in Bangladesh came along, inevitably he grabbed it with both hands.  ""It's obviously of great personal significance to me and my family,"" says Das, whose brother Jonathan played for Cambridge University and Essex second XI. ""My dad is definitely very proud, it means a lot to him. ""I don't travel to Bangladesh very often so it will be great to see my family who live there, and hopefully for them to watch me play."" Despite only a handful of T20 Blast appearances, Das has been signed by the Dhaka Dominators in the Bangladesh Premier League, which means he'll be juggling his studies during a hectic few weeks.  ""It's very challenging,"" he says. ""I think even if I wasn't going away, it would still be challenging because as a professional, you want to be training all the time. ""Fitting in training with having to study can be mentally fatiguing. Sometimes you may not have as much free time as other people but by the end of my degree I'll not only have a sporting career but something else to fall back on."" The east Londoner, who had a small taste of international cricket last year when he appeared as a substitute fielder for England against New Zealand at Lord's, has the full backing of his county. ""Essex were very pleased to hear about this opportunity,"" said Das. ""They definitely encourage young players to go away and get as many experiences as they can, especially early in their careers. ""They know that by going away to a franchise, you'll pick things up from being around great players and playing in new conditions."" The Bangladesh Premier League is an established franchise tournament, although arguably it's been overtaken in prominence by a batch of newer competitions. One of the virtues of playing in franchise cricket is rubbing shoulders with international stars and garnering advice. The BPL still attracts its fair share of big names and Das is eager to meet them. ""Shan Masood is an incredible player, he had an unbelievable year playing county cricket and he's very experienced in all formats, so it would be great to tap into his knowledge,"" said Das. ""There are definitely a lot of high-profile players from other teams that it would be great to learn from too; Mohammad Rizwan, Dawid Malan, Shakib Al Hasan are all incredible cricketers."" Das' progress has highlighted the chronic lack of British Bangladeshi cricketers who make it into the professional game. His own journey towards representing Essex offers an insight into the possible reasons for this. ""The Bangladeshi community is very active in cricket circles, especially where I'm from in east London. But compared to other Asian communities, there aren't as many Bangladeshis making it through to county pathways,"" explains Das. ""Cricket is probably one of the more difficult sports to get into because there's a lot of travelling involved. Parents need to be very supportive and very committed. I'm very grateful that my parents have been able to do that from my childhood."" Social and economic indicators suggest the average Bangladeshi household is worse off than most other groups. Navigating seemingly impenetrable cricket pathways also compounds the issue.  The racism crisis that continues to engulf English cricket is another vivid illustration of the work required to gain the trust of excluded communities. By blazing his own unique trail, Das has become a torchbearer for better things to come.

economic indicators,#Instaperfect: Is inequality fuelling the rise of the sexy selfie?,2024-09-15,2018-09-04,Pablo Uchoa,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-45407983,"Just as pictures are said to be worth a thousand words - it appears there is more to the humble selfie than is on the image. The online obsession of our times has been equated with vanity and sometimes with gender oppression. But could it also be a behaviour driven by economics? Asma Elbadawi is a British-Sudanese visual artist who thinks modern capitalism drives women to portray themselves as desirable objects. She recently posted a selfie on Instagram with facial drawings resembling the markings a patient is given before plastic surgery. Over the picture, she quoted a line from her latest poem, Shades, about ""a world that creates insecurities then feeds them to its people"". Elbadawi, who is also a high-profile advocate for the empowerment of young Muslim girls, said she intended to use the language of billboards advertisements - an irony contrasting with the poem's anti-consumerist message. ""I noticed over the years that with the rise of social media and a drop in cosmetic surgery prices, women across the world have been changing their facial features to look more European as well as getting implants to extenuate their curves and chests,"" she told the BBC. ""I was constantly bombarded with images of 'perfect' sexy women and adverts trying to sell me slimming products and cosmetics,"" she says. ""Seeing this made me realise that in many ways capitalism is about creating insecurities through advertising in order to make profit from consumers - as well as making women dress and look a particular way for a male audience."" Elbadawi's work raises an interesting question. Decades of feminist achievements have enabled women to denounce anything that objectifies them, from anonymous catcalling to Hollywood's so-called casting-couch culture. Yet the dissemination of social media, if anything, has meant we are more than ever bombarded with sexualised images of women seemingly happy to objectify themselves online. Why? Dr Khandis Blake is a psychologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, researching what female sexualisation can tell us about societies. She tells the BBC that selfies are often taken as a sign of gender discrimination (women are taking them because they feel the need to appear attractive to men). But her latest research has also found an economic link. In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) journal, Dr Blake describes her findings after an analysis of hundreds of thousands of selfies taken in 113 countries - which were then narrowed down to 68,562 ""sexy"" selfies. The phenomenon of the sexy selfie is most prevalent in educated, developed countries, she says - the very societies where female empowerment has been greater. ""[They are ] the very same societies that have spent decades battling the sexual objectification of women and girls - and that are currently calling a string of powerful men to account for their behaviour to women."" To explain this apparent contradiction, her team looked at gender and economic indicators in those countries. They found that women are more likely to invest time and effort into posting sexy selfies in places where economic inequality is on the rise. That would explain why the US, the UK and Singapore - where income gaps are widening - are among the most addicted to selfies, together with a pocket of less developed, but much more economically unequal countries, like Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. People in development countries with lower income inequality - like Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Denmark - took fewer ""sexy"" selfies. Dr Blake says these conclusions are consistent with data from the real economy. Women in areas of high income inequality in the US spend more in beauty salons and clothing stores, for example. Elsewhere in emerging nations such as Brazil, Mexico and South Africa, the business of beauty exploded during the noughties economic boom. But women investing more time and money in physical appearance doesn't correlate with female subordination, Dr Blake says. Instead, she suggests, ""sexualisation may be a marker of social climbing"" and female competition. It is a strategy that may suit some individuals. Kim Kardashian, the self-made reality TV star and cosmetic magnate, is now worth $350m according to Forbes. She has been called the most photographed woman in history. Dr Blake says that looking attractive or sexy today ""can generate large returns, economically, socially, and personally"".  ""Telling young women to stop posting sexy selfies is like asking them to forgo the pot of 'capital' youth bestows on them."" The problems arise when women are pressured into looking a certain way - the lack of choice is always disempowering, she says. Asma Elbadawi, who also coaches, mentors and advises young girls playing basketball, worries about other effects as well. She fears her pupils and their peers may never learn to ""love themselves and their bodies"". ""Young girls express the fear of growing muscles if they play a sport. In fact, some of their boyfriends tell them to stop playing so they don't hench (bulk) up. They feel this will make them less feminine and attractive."" It is a shame, Elbadawi says, because girls could learn a lot from an environment that is ""about self-development and being in tune with your mind and body to perform at your best"". ""But all these things are overlooked. Fitness instructors, fashion bloggers and make-up artists are followed in the millions because their focus is on getting the perfect bodies and looks."""
economic indicators,Details of NI lockdown exit plan revealed,2024-09-15,2021-03-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-56242985,"Northern Ireland's plan for easing the coronavirus lockdown is ""cautious and hopeful"", Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said. Unlike plans announced in England, NI's blueprint does not include a timetable. Ms O'Neill said the executive's plan, published on Tuesday, would be an ""underpinning insurance policy"" to help protect the health service. First Minister Arlene Foster said the plan was ""not perfect"" but added she wanted to prevent any future lockdowns.  Mrs Foster acknowledged that there is ""a lot of frustration"" among the public who want to know when restrictions will be lifted. She said the executive had faced the similar questions about setting out a timetable when they lifted previous lockdowns last year, but added they had learned a lot about the virus over the past year.  Earlier on Tuesday, two more coronavirus-related deaths were recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.  The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 has dropped by 13 to 289 - the lowest number since October 2020. Thirty-four people with Covid-19 are being treated in intensive care. A further 149 cases have been diagnosed.  In the Republic of Ireland, 359 new cases were confirmed on Tuesday and 14 additional Covid-related deaths were added to the overall death toll, which now stands at 4,333. Speaking in the NI Assembly, Ms O'Neill said: ""We must do everything we can to try to make this one the last lockdown."" Mrs Foster said the public needed to work with the executive. ""What we've set out today is a pathway. It's not perfect, nobody is pretending it is, but I think it gives the direction of travel in terms of where we hope to get to because people do need to have optimism,"" Mrs Foster said.  ""That's what I'm focused on, because we certainly cannot go back into a lockdown again.""  ""Data, not dates"" was the mantra when Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill first announced they were preparing a plan to help Northern Ireland exit lockdown. But a read of the document leaves questions as to why the data ministers will base their decisions on seems largely absent from the plan. All of this is ultimately aimed at giving the executive maximum flexibility - a pick-and-mix that will allow them to move when they believe the relevant health indicators are in the right place, assessing that with ""economic and community trends"". All executive ministers know the risks - and consequences - of lifting lockdown too soon, given past experience.   For now, both the public and businesses are facing more uncertainty.  The challenge is getting people to buy into another plan that has no dates to circle in our calendars, when we are not much clearer as to when we can start looking to a future with more freedoms again. The framework has been broadly welcomed, but the absence of dates has been criticised by many industry bodies. Colin Neill from Hospitality Ulster said it was ""disappointing to see that parts of hospitality have been earmarked to reopen after non-essential retail"". Belfast Chamber Chief Executive Simon Hamilton said not only were there no dates, ""but there is no clarity about where certain health indicators need to be to move us through each of the steps"". Dr David Bruce, moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, said he hoped there could be some return to services in places of worship from Easter. Outlining the details of the recovery document, Ms O'Neill said ministers recognised there was still a ""huge risk"" with the virus, given the potential for new variants.  The deputy first minister said that time would be used carefully to assess the data before deciding whether the next restrictions could be eased.  ""Each week, departments will meet as a collective to discuss the available information and to proactively consider which next steps can be proposed to the executive,"" she said. ""After each step we take, we will pause and reflect, look at the data and the impacts, engage with key sectors and enable them to reopen only if it is the right thing to do."" However, Ms O'Neill added that the executive was committed to getting all children back into classrooms as ""quickly as possible"". Mrs Foster said: ""I very much hope that on 16 March we can give clarity for the rest of the school years and I would hope that, given the data, everybody can return after Easter.  ""We will not be able to take that decision until we review what's happening on 16 March."" Ministers are also working on a separate recovery strategy through the executive's Covid-19 taskforce that would ""jumpstart economic and societal recovery"". ""We ask everyone to take time to read and digest, to think about the need for caution in our approach, to continue to follow the public health advice, and most certainly to take the vaccine when it is offered,"" said Ms O'Neill.  ""We have hope for this year, and we will get there together."" Step one of the recovery plan represents the current lockdown restrictions in place, with steps two to four allowing an easing of the rules and the final step entitled preparing for the future. The first easements will allow changes to rules on people meeting others outdoors at their homes, changes to restrictions in places of worship and a partial return to classroom teaching. The executive says the steps do not have to align, and the executive said it is possible ""we may be in different phases across the nine pathways at any given time"". There are nine pathways set out by the executive: The document then sets out the five-step sequencing of the executive plans to gradually lift restrictions on each of those sectors. The factors for easing the lockdown include the infection rate of the virus, known as the R number, the number of people in hospital, vaccine rollout and progress in testing and tracing positive cases. Read the full pathway-to-recovery plan here. There will also be a rolling review every four weeks, in line with how the regulations are currently reviewed. The next review is scheduled for 16 March. Ministers have said they must ensure any easing is gradual, to avoid moving out of lockdown too quickly and potentially leading to another rise in cases. The plan will also state that keeping the R-number under one and ""as low as possible"" is the best way to suppress the virus. Northern Ireland has been in lockdown since 26 December in a bid to curb cases of Covid-19, with measures already having been extended a number of times.

economic indicators,Who's leaving Africa's largest economy?,2024-09-15,2019-02-13,By Jack Goodman,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47061561,"The job market for young Nigerians is causing people to leave, says one of the leading contenders to become Nigeria's next president.  ""Young Nigerians aren't just leaving Nigeria because of bad pay and working conditions - they are leaving because there is no hope,"" opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar wrote on Twitter. The flight of Nigeria's trained professionals - especially doctors - is also a regular complaint.  What do we know know about the scale of people leaving Nigeria?  Does the perception stand up to the statistics? As one Nigerian news outlet wrote, the high rate of Nigerians leaving the country, legally and illegally, has hit worrying levels. Many of the migrants taking the central Mediterranean route into Europe come from Nigeria - frequently by boat from the coast of Libya to Italy. In 2016, almost 40,000 Nigerians arrived in Italy, more than any other nationality. About 18,000 made the trip in 2017.  But the latest data shows that there has been a significant decline. Just 1,250 Nigerians arrived in Italy by sea in 2018.  This fall reflects the wider trend - fewer migrants crossed the Mediterranean last year.  The UN says that routes used by human traffickers are constantly changing and are dependent on a number of factors, but the drop in numbers reaching Italy is attributed mainly to closer co-operation with the Libyan coastguard. And this closer monitoring of Libya's coast has made illegal crossings much harder. Testimony from those coming back to Nigeria after failed attempts bears this out, says Jorge Galindo of the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Returning migrants, he says, are alerting people to the huge risks involved in the dangerous journey.  UN data suggests that Nigerians are not trying to get to Europe through Spain, which is now the main entry point for other migrants across the Mediterranean.  One reason might be that Nigeria has well-established links to people smugglers along the route between Libya and Italy. Those connections haven't been forged along the path to Spain.  The migration figures, however, don't include Nigerians who have left their homes but not managed to cross into Europe - many thousands are thought to be held in detention centres in Libya or along the way in other African countries.  About 11,500 Nigerians have returned home, assisted by the IOM, since 2017.  Out of this scheme, a pattern has emerged revealing from where in Nigeria the migrants have started their journeys. The IOM says about half the total are from the southern Edo state - with a further quarter from neighbouring Delta state.  Nigeria is a huge country with a large population, but this data suggests that the people migrating come from a relatively small area.  Edo state is the most established base for people smugglers, says Esohe Aghatise, who runs the anti-trafficking organisation Iroko. Some leave in search of economic opportunities but fall into the hands of traffickers, she says. But many others, especially women and girls, she says, are trafficked against their will or at least without any idea of what they are getting themselves into.  ""People with an idea of a better life in Europe, finish school, and are promised paradise.""  Many Nigerians with professional qualifications seek to travel abroad, applying for visas to do so legally. There are also those planning to study abroad or join other family members already there. Some will stay for long periods, others will return at the end of their contracts or studies. There are no official government statistics available, so one way to look at legal migration is through the numbers undergoing medical assessments as a requirement for visa applications. These are carried out by the IOM's migration health assessment centres in Lagos and Abuja. In 2018, there were 21,000 examinations - a higher figure than in previous years. As for medical doctors leaving Nigeria and contributing to the country's ""brain drain, this is hard to quantify. We do know that more Nigerian-trained doctors are now working in the UK, for example. About 5,300, according to the British General Medical Council. That's the highest after India and Pakistan, and it's been going up steadily since 2006. The former president of the National Association of Resident Doctors told Africa Check that more doctors are migrating because of poor working conditions and low pay.   A final indicator for those leaving to work or study abroad is the number of visas granted to Nigerians. From a low point in 2010, skilled worker visas to the UK have steadily increased - 620 issued in 2017. However, the number of study visas, excluding short term study, has been declining. The largest Nigerian diaspora is in the US, according to UN figures. That population roughly doubled between 2007 and 2017.  An upside to migration are the remittances feeding back into the Nigerian economy.  Nigeria received $22bn in remittances in 2017, the 5th highest in the world, according to the World Bank.  It's more difficult to get exact figures for people moving to Nigeria because there is free movement of people in the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) region.  The total number of migrants in Nigeria is estimated at 1.2 million, most of them coming from Benin, Ghana and Mali, according to the UN.

economic indicators,What next for Afghanistan's economy?,2024-09-15,2021-08-16,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58235185,"Afghanistan's economy is ""shaped by fragility and aid dependence"".  That is the troubling overview set out by the World Bank several months before the Taliban takeover.  Economic prospects look even more precarious now, as future financial assistance is under a cloud of uncertainty.  Afghanistan does have substantial mineral resources, but the political situation has impeded their exploitation.    The aid dependency is striking. In 2019, World Bank figures show development aid was equivalent to 22% of gross national income (which is not the same as GDP, but close to it).  That is a high figure, but it is down a long way from the 49% the World Bank reported 10 years earlier.  Now those aid flows are under a cloud of profound uncertainty. German Foreign Minister Heike Maas told the broadcaster ZDF last week: ""We will not give another cent if the Taliban takes over the country and introduces Sharia law."" Other aid donors are sure to be watching developments closely.    The fragility the World Bank refers to is illustrated by the very high levels of spending on security before the Taliban takeover: 29% of GDP, compared with an average of 3% for low-income countries.  Security and severe problems with corruption are behind another persistent problem in Afghanistan: very weak foreign business investment.   According to United Nations data, there were no announcements in the last two years of new ""greenfield"" investments, which involve a foreign business setting up an operation from scratch. Since 2014, there have been a total of four.  To take two other countries from the South Asia region, both with somewhat smaller populations, Nepal has managed 10 times as many and Sri Lanka 50 times more over the same period.   The World Bank describes Afghanistan's private sector as narrow. Employment is concentrated in low-productivity agriculture: 60% of households get some income from farming.   The country also has a large illicit economy. There is illegal mining and, of course, opium production and related activities such as smuggling. The drugs trade has been an important source of revenue for the Taliban.  All that said, the Afghan economy has grown since the US invasion in 2001.  The figures for Afghanistan are not reliable, but what they show, according to the World Bank, is average annual growth of more than 9% in the 10 years from 2003.  After that, it slowed (which may well reflect the lower levels of aid) to an average rate of 2.5% between 2015 and 2020.   The country does have significant natural resources, which would, in the context of better security and less corruption, be attractive to international business.   There are several types of mineral available in substantial quantities, including copper, cobalt, coal and iron ore. There is also oil and gas and precious stones.  One with particularly striking potential is lithium, a metal that is used in batteries for mobile devices and electric cars. The latter application is going to be especially important as the motor industry makes the transition to zero-carbon forms of transport.   Back in 2010, a top US general told the New York Times that Afghanistan's mineral potential was ""stunning"" - with ""a lot of ifs, of course"".   The paper also reported that an internal US Defence Department memo had said the country could become ""the Saudi Arabia of lithium"".   Yet this undoubted potential is nowhere near being exploited - and the Afghan people have seen very little, if any, benefit from it.   There have been many reports that China is keen to be involved. It seems to have better relations with the Taliban than Western powers do, so may have an advantage if the new regime does hold on to power.  However, Chinese firms did win contracts to develop operations in copper and oil. But little happened.   It is to be expected that China would be interested. The opportunities appear to be very substantial and the two countries do share a short border.   But any Chinese agency - official or a business - would want to be confident of succeeding. They will be reluctant to commit unless they feel the security and corruption problems will be well enough contained to enable them to extract worthwhile quantities of these industrial commodities.  A key question for any hard-nosed potential investors - from China or anywhere else - will be whether the Taliban is likely to be any more able than the previous Afghan government to create the kind of environment they need.   Another factor likely to affect the economy is women's employment. In the past decade the percentage of the female population over 15 years of age in employment has risen dramatically, though at 22% in 2019 it was still low by international standards. Under the Taliban the change is likely to be reversed, further damaging economic prospects.   In the immediate future, there is also a great deal of uncertainty about financial stability. Crowds of people have been trying to withdraw their money from the banks.  The Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press reported a Taliban spokesman as offering assurances to bank owners, money changers, traders and shopkeepers that their lives and property would be protected.   That there are even questions about the physical safety of financial operators is shocking. They do need to be confident if Afghanistan's financial system is to function.  But it also needs customers to feel their money is safe. That won't happen quickly.     "
economic indicators,How have things changed in Afghanistan?,2024-09-15,2021-04-22,By Reality Check team,https://www.bbc.com/news/56779160,"With the withdrawal of US and Nato troops nearing completion, direct foreign intervention in Afghanistan is ending after nearly 20 years. US President Joe Biden has said that Afghans are going to have decide their own future. We look at the current situation, and at what has changed since foreign troops entered the country in late 2001. Fighting has intensified in recent weeks. The Taliban have been on the offensive, taking territory and there have been reports of Afghan government personnel in some areas fleeing their advance. The UN warned in June that the conflict could escalate as foreign forces pull out. The first three months of this year were already more violent than the same period in 2020, going by US and UN data. The US body which oversees reconstruction efforts in the country says that from the start of January to the end of March this year, enemy attacks were up by 37%. In the first three months of this year, the UN says the number of civilians killed and injured was significantly higher than the same period a year ago, with increasing numbers of women and children among them. The majority of these were attributed to insurgent groups such as the Taliban. In 2020, more than 3,000 civilians died - the seventh year in a row this had happened. The UN also noted a spate of targeted killings last year, often of figures from civil society, the media, the judiciary and the civilian administration. However, the total number of civilian casualties in 2020 - deaths and injuries - was down on the totals for 2019 and 2018. Data from the country's national statistics agency shows that although the majority working in government departments and major public bodies are still men, the number of women working has grown in the past two decades. The figures show that in 2004, there were just over 51,200 women working in these sectors. That had risen to nearly 87,000 by 2018 (the last year for which data is available). And the percentage rise in the number of women employees was higher than for men (69% compared with about 41%). A recent US official report on gender equality said there were now ""unprecedented"" numbers of women in public office, with legal minimum quotas set for women in the national parliament, as well as in provincial and district councils. It also pointed to a big increase in women police personnel - from only 180 in 2005 to 3,560 by 2019 - as well as an increase in the proportion of women judges from 5% to 13% between 2007 and 2018.  Human Rights Watch says that the number of children in school at all levels has increased from 0.9 million in 2001 to 9.2 million in 2017 - with 39% of them girls. UN data shows that by 2012, the figure for girls enrolled in primary education had grown to more than 40%, although it's come down slightly since then. The UN agency responsible for providing humanitarian aid to children, Unicef, said in a 2019 report that ""girls in Afghanistan were significantly less likely to attend school than boys across all ages, but the gender gap widens from age 10 and peaks at 14"". Unicef also says that in large parts of Afghanistan, especially in areas controlled by the Taliban and other insurgent groups, school enrolment rates for girls were very low.  There are more women working in the education sector. By 2018, about one-third of Afghanistan's teachers were women, and literacy rates among girls have risen. The number of female students at government universities has increased nearly seven times between 2002 and 201, more than the increase in that period for male students, according to Afghan government figures. It is worth noting that US officials have pointed to issues with government data, saying that student enrolment figures may have been inflated for a number of reasons. Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, but after the US invasion in 2001, there was fairly rapid economic growth with international aid pouring in. This was reflected in GDP figures which averaged 9.4% between 2003 and 2012, according to the World Bank.  But growth has slowed as aid flows have decreased, and the security situation has worsened. In addition, growing numbers of Afghans have returned from abroad since 2015, swelling the population. A government survey of living conditions for 2016-17 found that more than 54% of the population were living below the national poverty line of 2,064 Afghanis per person per month (equivalent to about $31 or £25 as of 1 January 2017). This percentage had gone up from around 38% in poverty between 2011 and 2012. A more recent survey by Gallup in August 2019 pointed to severe droughts in the last few years affecting food security. It said that nearly six out of every 10 Afghans told them they had struggled to afford food at times in the previous year. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions"
economic indicators,A look at the tech behind your coffee,2024-09-15,2022-07-24,By Luana Ferreira,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62235741,"For an estimated one billion people around the world drinking coffee is a daily regime. Yet what many coffee lovers might not know is that they are often drinking a brew made, at least in part, from Brazilian beans. ""Brazilian beans have popular characteristics, and are known for their body and sweetness,"" says Christiano Borges, boss of the country's largest grower, Ipanema Coffees. ""Therefore, many coffee blends in the world use our coffee as a base."" Brazil is far and away the world's largest grower of coffee beans. It accounts for more than one third of all global supplies, or 37% in 2020, to be exact. In second place is Vietnam with 17% of supplies. Some 70% of Brazil's coffee plants are the highly-priced arabica species, used in fresh coffee. The remaining 30% are robusta, which is used primarily for instant coffee.  The problem for Brazil, and world coffee supplies in general, is that last year the country's annual crop plummeted by almost a quarter due to a drought across its main coffee growing region, which centres on the south-eastern states of Minas Gerais, São Paulo and Paraná. The knock-on affect has been a global reduction in coffee beans supplies, and a subsequent doubling in wholesale prices since this time last year. To try to alleviate any future falls in production, Brazil's largest coffee producers are increasingly turning towards technology to help them successfully grow and process the best possible crop, both in terms of size and quality. New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. One such firm, Okuyama, says it is now investing at least 10% of its revenues in technology. Based in Minas Gerais, it has coffee plantations covering 1,100 hectares (2,718 acres).  Its staff use a computer app called Cropwise Protector, which is made by Swiss-Chinese agricultural tech firm, Syngenta. Linked to ground sensors and satellite imagery, the tool gives the farm workers a visual analysis of the farm, or plantation, on a tablet device or laptop. They can then quickly apply such things as drip-irrigation, or pest-control, to a very specific area that might need it, rather than a whole field or the entire farm. The idea is that this far more targeted approach is far faster, and kinder on the environment. ""Every year there is a new challenge, and these technologies help us to overcome those barriers,"" says Bruno Hiroiti, coffee beans manager at Okuyama. ""We have also invested in technologies for the coffee drying process, where we can monitor the temperature, which is defined by the type of coffee we are drying."" Okuyama dries some of its coffee beans in drum heaters after harvesting, to prevent them from spoiling while they are stored ahead of being roasted. Getting the temperature and timing correct is essential to avoid wastage, both in terms of the beans and the energy used to power the heaters. At Ipanema Coffees, which has 4,300 hectares of plantations across three sites in Minas Gerais, Mr Borges says it has also very much gone down the tech route in recent years. ""We have made a huge investment on semi-automated irrigation, where the system measures the water deficit and weather conditions - giving us recommendations for each area."" He adds that the investments are helping the firm to reduce the impact of climate change. ""We have climate problems such as droughts, and global temperature increases. ""The irrigation system has helped us to improve our productivity... and it has become a climate insurance for us."" Ipanema says it also has trackers on all its tractors to measure productivity, and is another user of Cropwise Protector. ""It helps us monitor agricultural pests, by only using a tablet,"" says Gustavo Michalski, the firm's agricultural coordinator. ""It allows us to manage the problem and make more assertive decisions, and more sustainable ones, as we can monitor the indicators that give us the location and intensity [of a particular problem] in each areas."" After its beans are harvested, Ipanema has, for a number of years, been using automated selection machines, which only pick the ripe ones, which are yellow and red. ""We set the machine by programming the colours we need,"" says Rodrigo Ferreira, the firm's industrial director. ""Once we put the beans in the conveyor belt the beans that are not the colour we defined will be expelled by a compressed air jet."" Flora Viana, global marketing manager for digital agriculture at Syngenta, says that Brazil's coffee producers can ""no longer increase their productivity just by buying more land"".  ""We are reaching the limit of areas available,"" she adds, ""producers need to instead optimise their production process."" Yet, Mr Borges adds that the technology is reliant upon having trained staff. ""It is pointless to have great tool if we don't have a team motivated and prepared for them."" He adds that Ipanema has 800 employees, and often they go to college for training. However, this increased use of technology is not universal across Brazil's coffee producers. While it has been adopted by the big players in industry, such as Ipanema and Okuyama, the myriad of small producers that produce 66% of the country's crop are lagging behind. But the hope is that the roll out of 5G mobile phone networks will improve internet connections in rural areas, making technology such as Cropwise Protector more prevalent."
economic indicators,NI economy sees growth but Ukraine changes outlook,2024-09-15,2022-03-14,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-60735468,"NI's economy reported improved growth last month, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has changed the economic outlook, according to a survey. Every month the Ulster Bank surveys businesses across the private sector. They are asked about staffing levels, exports and new orders in what is considered a reliable indicator of economic performance.  February suggested improved growth, with firms reporting the sharpest pick up in new orders in seven years.  Despite this, firms were only able to raise employment reporting difficulties finding staff.   Rates of inflation remained high but showed further signs of easing.  The survey looks at services, manufacturing, retail, and construction.  Last month, was the first time all four sectors recorded growth since last June.  Manufacturing was the best performing by ""a significant margin"". New orders rose at their fastest pace in seven-and-a-half years.  Only construction failed to record an uplift in new orders last month.  Ulster Bank chief economist Northern Ireland Richard Ramsey said: ""With concerns over Covid-19 fading fast, Northern Ireland's private sector posted a surge in activity in February. ""February's PMI report was therefore very encouraging across a number of levels. However, the economic outlook has changed drastically with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  ""Commodity prices have rocketed, and an unprecedented array of sanctions have been imposed on Russia. ""Businesses, therefore, face a new source of supply chain disruption."" He said the primary concern was with the people of Ukraine but warned that businesses and households in Northern Ireland were also set to be affected by the situation ""most particularly through the rampant inflation in energy and food prices, as well as the general uncertainty""."
economic indicators,Indians set to send home a record $100bn in 2022,2024-09-15,2022-12-01,By Nayana Mena ,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-63822514,"Indians are set to receive $100bn in remittances this year, according to a World Bank report - the first time a single country has reached that number. The increase was led by wage rises and strong labour markets in the US and other developed countries. In total, the amount of money sent back home by migrants around the world has grown by 5% in 2022.  The money is a crucial source of household income in low and middle-income countries, the World Bank says.  Remittances are associated with improved health and social indicators, for example increased birth weight and higher school enrolment figures.  Other top recipient countries for remittances include Mexico, China, Egypt and the Philippines. In recent years, many Indians have moved to well-paid jobs in high-income countries, such as the US, UK and Singapore - enabling them to send more money home. The payments account for around 3% of India's gross domestic product (GDP) - a measure of the size of a country's economy.  While India and Nepal have experienced an increase in remittances, other countries in South Asia have seen a decline of more than 10% in the last year, due to the end of government incentives introduced during the pandemic. Overall, remittances to low and middle-income countries have grown by 5% in 2022 to around $626bn (£510bn) - around half the rate of growth seen in 2021. Next year is expected to be more challenging because of rising prices and slower economic growth around the world. "
economic indicators,InterContinental Hotels sales rise,2024-09-15,2017-10-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41691615,"InterContinental Hotels Group said sales rose as the effect of terror attacks in key markets wore off. Revenues per available room, a key indicator for the hotel industry, increased by 2.3% in the third quarter.  The Holiday Inn owner expanded its hotel offerings by the fastest rate in almost a decade, it said, as it ramped up international expansion.  Sales in Europe rose by 7.1%, while those in the US increased just 0.8% as hurricanes battered the region.   ""Hurricanes Harvey and Irma had a mixed impact,"" the group said in  a trading update.  ""Displacement activity, together with the relief and reconstruction efforts, benefited our franchise business; but performance across the managed estate was negatively impacted by the cancellation of group bookings at some hotels."" Markets previously hit by terror attacks, such as France, Belgium and Turkey, enjoyed strong growth. Southern Europe was also boosted by higher demand during the summer months.  Revenues from China increased 7.8%, buoyed by stronger demand for leisure services in Macau.  ""Despite macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties around the world, we remain confident in the outlook for the remainder of the year,"" said group chief executive Keith Barr.  InterContinental has expanded its room offering by 20,000, bringing the number available up to 235,000.  The results were ""reasonable"" and had put the company on track to meet full-year earnings forecasts, said Anna Barnfather, an analyst at Liberum."

He and his family joined a throng of people leaving the city soon after the lockdown announcement was made. Public transport systems were stopped, leaving people with no choice but to walk.  Mr Kumar, his wife, and their 10-year-old daughter had already walked more than 40km (24 miles) when we spoke to him. ""There is no work here, that is why we are running away. There are no buses, I have to walk another 260km to get to my village,"" he said. India has announced a $23bn (£18bn) relief package to help people like Mr Alam and Mr Kumar who are part of India's unorganised, informal industry which employs 94% of the population and contributes 45% to its overall output.  This industry is already bearing the brunt of the lockdown with thousands finding themselves unemployed overnight.  ""No-one will be allowed to go hungry,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said while announcing the package - a combination of direct cash transfer benefits and food security measures. But the economic fallout of this unprecedented lockdown has been dire. Businesses have closed, unemployment has risen and productivity has fallen.  India's growth engine was actually sputtering well before the threat of outbreak arrived. Once one of the fastest growing economies in the world, its growth slowed to 4.7% last year - the slowest level in six years.  Unemployment was at a 45-year high last year. Industrial output from the eight core sectors at the end of last year fell by 5.2% - the worst in 14 years. Small businesses had only just begun to recover from the controversial 2016 currency ban that came as a body blow to the cash-consuming informal economy. Now, experts say the coronavirus outbreak is likely to further cripple the already frail economy. So while most welcome the government's measures, they feel much more needs to be done to minimise the economic impact.  ""While free extra rations have been sanctioned, how will the poor access what is due to them?"" wonders economist Arun Kumar.  ""The government should devise a way of using the army and state machinery to physically distribute food to the poor."" With thousands of migrant workers stuck miles away from their homes, the seamless distribution of cash and food needs to be the government's top priority, he adds. And it's not just migrant workers at risk. Farmers are also vulnerable to a potential economic shock from the lockdown - the agriculture industry contributes nearly $265bn to GDP. The government says it will give farmers 2,000 rupees ($30) in April as an advance payment from an $80 annual pay-out to tide over the situation.  ""This money will be inadequate because exports have stopped. Prices in cities will rise because of profiteering and in rural areas they will drop because farmers won't be able to sell their crop,"" says economist Arun Kumar.  The outbreak has happened at a critical farming time - the new crop is ready, waiting to be sold.  Economists warn India's challenge will be in transporting this food from villages to cities in the midst of the lockdown.  If supply chains don't work properly, a lot of food will be wasted and lead to massive losses for Indian farmers.  Experts warn that India is also at the brink of a major unemployment crisis.  Economist Vivek Kaul says people who work for small businesses may end up with job and salary losses. ""I know of places where companies are actively discussing how many people they need to fire,"" he says. And that's not all.  With flights suspended until mid-April, the shutdown is also bound to push India's fast-growing aviation industry into peril. The Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) has assessed that the Indian aviation industry will post losses worth nearly $4bn this year.  This will likely have a cascading effect, affecting the hospitality and tourism industries. Hotels and restaurant chains across the country are empty and are likely to remain so for several months, sparking worries of large-scale layoffs.  The automobile industry, a key indicator of a country's economic growth, has also been forced to hit the brakes - experts are estimating losses of nearly $2bn. So, is India's relief package enough?  Experts say it's a drop in the ocean compared to bailouts in countries such as the US, China and Singapore.  They say India now also needs a larger stimulus package soon to help businesses weather this extraordinary crisis."
economic indicators,Index aims to boost productivity in Scotland,2024-09-15,2019-09-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-49627041," A new index has been created to measure the productivity levels of Scottish businesses. The first Scottish Productivity Index suggests some progress in productivity, but says that Scotland is ""lagging behind"" its competition. The report will be published annually and will look at 15 key indicators. It will track performance in four areas: business practices, skills and training, health and wellbeing and infrastructure and connectivity. The index is being compiled by CBI Scotland and KPMG and contains a number of straightforward recommendations for government and businesses to approach together. One of its main suggestions is that bosses are urged to treat mental health with the same priority as physical health, to boost productivity of the economy. With evidence of Scotland falling behind on in-work training, it also recommends that everyone in the workforce should be given basic digital training by 2025. It was proposed that a ""Productivity Data Bank"" should be compiled for Scotland to provide access to and improve productivity tracking data across the public and private sectors. And it said prioritising investment in management and leadership skills should ensure businesses were rooted in great people practices and building capabilities across the business. Tracy Black, CBI Scotland director, said: ""We're proud to launch the first edition of the Scottish Productivity Index, something we think can bring fresh insights and urgency to the debate about how to get Scotland's economy firing once again. Brexit aside, boosting weak productivity has been the main focus of CBI Scotland's work over the past few years. ""While these findings show that Scotland starts some way behind when it comes to certain productivity measures, we also know that progress is being made. I'm confident that by benchmarking progress in this way, we can find solutions to deliver the step-change Scotland desperately needs."" Jenny Stewart from KPMG said: ""Amid growing geopolitical and economic uncertainty, improving productivity is fundamental to how much we earn; how fast our wages grow; and how much of a contribution every individual in Scotland pays in taxes to support good quality public services and a vibrant, sustainable economy. ""Tackling the productivity challenge could unlock thousands of pounds in higher annual earnings for the average worker and create a more competitive country that can thrive in the international marketplace. ""Our report highlights some of the challenges we face right now, but it also identifies a number of key, straightforward actions that we can all take to unlock future growth. ""Now, more than ever, we need to address productivity in Scotland, and build a more, successful, prosperous and inclusive nation."""
economic indicators,The video game prescribed by doctors to treat ADHD,2024-09-15,2022-07-10,By Kitti Palmai,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62060542,"While many parents worry that their children spend too much time playing computer games, Kelcey Sihanourath is pleased to see her son Owain pick up his tablet. Now aged 13, he was diagnosed with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) in pre-school. Since then, the family, who live in the US city of Savannah, Georgia, have taken Owain to see occupational therapists to help him better cope with everyday life tasks. They also tried the medication route, but had to stop after the prescribed drugs exacerbated the boy's regular migraines, and made him sick. With ADHD continuing to affect Owain's school performance over the years, Kelcey says she was ""hoping for something more, for any other option"". ""I could see him struggling to understand why he was not able to focus, and the frustration he had when he tried so hard and would still get distracted,"" she says. ""It broke my heart, but I felt trapped and completely useless."" Help came in the end from what initially seems very incongruous - a computer game called EndeavorRx. In 2020 it became the first such game to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of ADHD in children. Currently only available on prescription from doctors in the US, EndeavorRx at first glance looks very similar to countless other  games. You control a little alien that races on a spaceship through different worlds having to collect things. But the app-based game was developed in conjunction with neuroscientists, and is designed to stimulate and improve areas of the brain that play a key role in attention function. The idea is that it trains a child with ADHD to both better multitask and ignore distractions, with a computer algorithm measuring his or her performance and customising the difficulty of the game in real time.  When doctors prescribe it, the child's parents get sent an activation link that is needed before the game will play. Kelcey says she was ""a little sceptical"", but at the end of 2020 Owain started a three-month programme, playing the game for 25 minutes a day. He then did another round last year. ""He admitted it was a little harder than he expected,"" she says. ""But he understood that he was doing it to help improve his focus. He remained super motivated despite the difficulties and frustrations that came along with it."" After each of Owain's sessions she noted his daily behaviour in the app, and tracked his progress. Soon she started to see small, positive changes in his behaviour. For example, getting ready for school had become smoother, and there were no negative messages from teachers. And after failing third grade, Owain subsequently shot up to getting As and Bs for his work. ""It has been amazing to see my son so successful, but more so, seeing him have confidence in himself,"" Kelcey says. ""He is no longer upset and confused about why he just does not get it."" Eddie Martucci, chief executive of Akili, the Boston-based tech firm behind EndeavorRx, says the game has been designed to boost cognitive progressing. ""It is something that's very difficult to get through molecular means, like taking a pill. But it turns out that sensory stimuli can actually directly stimulate parts of the brain controlling cognitive function."" His company now plans to launch the game in Europe in the next few years.  In London, UK app Thymia is using computer games to help doctors and other medical professionals detect and diagnose mental health issues, particularly depression. One game sees the user have to try to memorise moving objects, while another is a card game that also tests his or her memory. In addition to how well the patient performs in the game, their comments and facial expressions are also monitored and evaluated by the app, which accesses their computer or mobile phone's camera and microphone. Thymia has been launched by Dr Emilia Molimpakis, who has a doctorate in linguistics, cognitive neuroscience and experimental psychology from University College London (UCL). She runs the business with co-founder Dr Stefano Goria, who has a doctorate in theoretical physics from the University of Turin. Dr Goria says the app ""gathers and extracts biomarkers that are relevant for understanding depression symptoms... in a useable and engaging way"". Both Akili and Thymia say that their apps should be used in addition to existing doctor-led monitoring and treatments, and not as a replacement. UK-based adolescent psychologist Angela Karanja agrees. ""While these are... effective inventions, they should be used alongside current existing [patient evaluation] questionnaires, which have been tested and accepted for reliability and validity, as well as doctors' input, and also alongside other treatments, not in isolation,"" says Ms Karanja. New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. Fellow UK psychologist Lee Chambers says that while the use of such video games in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of mental health conditions is still in the early stages, it appears to have ""potential"". ""Engaging with a game has the ability to remove aspects of feeling like we are being tested and measured,"" he says. ""These types of mental health games have an ability to widen access, and track variations in the baseline data that they collect over time. ""Given this, it has the potential to be an early indicator and show patterns in a way we don't currently have access to."""
economic indicators,Iceland puts well-being ahead of GDP in budget,2024-09-15,2019-12-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50650155,"Iceland's prime minister has urged governments to adopt green and family-friendly priorities, instead of just focusing on economic growth figures. Katrin Jakobsdottir has teamed up with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and New Zealand's PM Jacinda Ardern to promote a ""well-being"" agenda. Ms Jakobsdottir called for ""an alternative future based on well-being and inclusive growth"". She said new social indicators were needed besides traditional GDP data. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz is among several economists arguing that gross domestic product - measuring a country's production in goods and services - fails to capture the impact of climate change, inequality, digital services and other phenomena shaping modern societies. In a Guardian article last month, Prof Stiglitz said the 2008 global financial crisis ""was the ultimate illustration of the deficiencies in commonly used metrics"".  GDP failed to reveal distortions in the bloated US housing market which triggered the crisis. Ms Jakobsdottir said environmental devastation was a key factor driving Iceland to incorporate new social indicators besides GDP in its budget planning. She began a speech at London's Chatham House think-tank by highlighting the disappearance of Iceland's Okjokull glacier. Scientists say the retreat of glaciers is clear evidence of global warming, which is blamed largely on CO2 pollution. Read more on related topics: Asked if a ""well-being"" budget was equally appropriate for developed and developing nations, she said: ""It's about how you prioritise in the public budget - you can always have an emphasis on well-being."" Developing countries ""need to take a leap"" to embrace renewable energy, she said, rather than repeat the developed world's carbon-based industrialisation. GDP's focus on economic performance means it tends to undervalue quality of life and the social damage caused by inequality. Ms Jakobsdottir said an Icelandic poet had joked that ""having sex with your wife doesn't count in GDP, but with a prostitute it does"".    A Left-Green politician, Ms Jakobsdottir formed a coalition government in 2017 with the conservative Independence Party and centre-right Progressive Party. While acknowledging Iceland's progress in family-friendly policies, she said her nation - with a population of just 350,000 - still had big challenges, such as improving public transport and tackling depression. ""Iceland uses more anti-depressants than neighbouring countries,"" she said. ""We need to strengthen prevention [of depression], through sports and the arts."" In a TED talk in August, Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon made a similar plea for modern economies to put more resources into mental health, childcare and parental leave, and green energy. Ms Jakobsdottir said Iceland's adoption of universal childcare and shared parental leave was the product of grassroots women's activism, regardless of political differences. She said the ""well-being"" initiative promoted by herself, Ms Sturgeon and Ms Ardern should not be seen as a gender-based backlash against populism. ""It's very important to have all genders at the table - it affects the way you think, and then different decisions are made,"" she said."
economic indicators,Trump makes new threat over border,2024-09-15,2018-10-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45905294,"US President Donald Trump has threatened to use military force to completely close the US-Mexico border. The warning, via a series of tweets on Thursday, comes as a new caravan of more than 3,000 migrants from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala heads north. Mr Trump has already threatened to cut all aid payments to the three countries over illegal immigration. The group says they are fleeing violence and poverty.  ""In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!,"" Mr Trump wrote. The president has previously threatened to cut Honduran aid. The US sent more than $175m (£130m) to the country in 2016 and 2017, according to the US Agency for International Development. The group of Central American migrants has made its intentions clear: they are heading to the US.  Since he was on the campaign trail, Mr Trump has lambasted illegal immigrants, and this latest caravan comes after a major crackdown on migrants heading over the Mexican border.  Changes to detention rules saw thousands of migrant children detained and separated from their parents earlier this year, sparking national and international condemnation. The president's threats also come just weeks before the mid-term elections on 6 November, which could see Democrats unseating Republicans on Capitol Hill. Mr Trump's recent comments are probably an effort to bolster support among his base by cracking down on migration. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News This isn't the first time President Donald Trump has used an organised group of Central American refugees heading to the US to drum up support for his border security and immigration policies. With the mid-term elections 19 days away, however, the stakes are higher and the rhetoric is sharper. It may not end up much more than rhetoric, however. Mr Trump's Twitter threats have, in the past, proven an unreliable indicator of future decisions.  There could be political benefit to the president's accusations, lobbed toward Democrats, and the warnings to Latin American leaders - but presidential action would have consequences.  Using the military to ""close"" the border would be enormously disruptive in states like Texas and Arizona (which, by the way, have two high-profile Senate races). The move would also complicate relations between the US and Mexico, as Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador prepares to assume the Mexican presidency in December. A recent Fox News poll shows that probable midterm voters are more interested in preserving healthcare protections and ""reining in Donald Trump"" than immigration or border security. The president, with his tweets, is trying to change that. If he can't, it will be an election fought on uncomfortable ground for Republicans.  The migrant caravan is currently making its way through Guatemala, mostly on foot, with several of the quickest already arriving at Mexico's southern border by Thursday. Their journey began in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, on Friday. Most migrants are carrying few belongings, taking what they can carry in backpacks, as they head out on the nearly 2,800 mile (4,500km) trek from Honduras to the US border. Thousands of people and goods legally cross the US-Mexico border daily.  While Mr Trump has sent national guard troops to the border before, it is unclear what he means by shutting it down entirely, and whether that would affect businesses or people with legitimate visas.  And according to international law, the US cannot deport asylum seekers without first determining the validity of their claim. Under pressure from the US to stop the migrants, Mexico has sent federal police to the border, though they are not officially there to stop the caravan. Mexican officials said on Wednesday that those without papers would have to apply for refugee status or turn back. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be in Mexico this Friday, and US media report that he will discuss plans to stop the caravan. ""The surreal side of this perceived crisis at the border is that the border is more under control now than it was 15 or 20 years ago,"" Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, told the BBC. Mr Selee said closing the border ""would wreak havoc on Mexican and American economies"". ""It could be a symbolic effort,"" he adds. ""A way of pressuring Mexico - but that would have a limited effect on illegal crossings and a huge effect on legal crossings."" The Associated Press reports that many migrants do not have passports and have been using national ID cards, which allow them to travel within Central America. Mexico, however, requires a passport at entry. Human rights groups have criticised the US and Mexican response to the caravan. Erika Guevara-Rosas of Amnesty International said in a statement: ""Mexican authorities should not take a Trump approach treating people like a security threat."" ""These families deserve dignity and respect to ensure that no one is illegally returned to situations where they could risk serious harm due to violence."" Mexican president-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador plans to offer work visas to Central Americans when he takes office in December. ""It is a plan that we have, that anyone who wants to work in Mexico will have a work visa,"" he said. Mr Selee told the BBC he thinks Mexico will ""try to defuse the crisis"" the same way they did with the last migrant caravan: by giving some people legal status or the chance to apply for asylum and deporting others. ""The caravan will probably diminish before it reaches the US-Mexico border, but the whole episode will harden views on immigration in the US on both sides and make Mexico more wary about cooperating with the US,"" he says. An estimated 10% of the population of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have fled danger, forced gang recruitment and dismal economic opportunities. The region has one of the highest murder rates in the world. The UN reported murder rates in 2015 in Honduras standing at 63.75 deaths per 100,000 and El Salvador at 108.64 deaths. Jari Dixon, an opposition politician in Honduras, tweeted on Monday that the caravan was not ""seeking the American dream"" but ""fleeing the Honduras nightmare"". In a statement on Tuesday, Honduras' foreign ministry urged its citizens to ""not let themselves be used by a movement that is clearly political and seeks to disrupt the governability, stability and peace""."
economic indicators,Developing world economies hit hard by coronavirus,2024-09-15,2020-04-22,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52352395,"The world is experiencing a sharp deterioration in economic performance, due to the continuing coronavirus pandemic. Developing countries are certain to be hit hard by what the International Monetary Fund, and others, warn will be the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Almost every country on the planet is being affected. The IMF expects 170 nations - rich and poor - to experience a decline in economic activity per person this year. That means falling average living standards. Developing economies are being hit in distinctive ways by the pandemic: Many are exporters of commodities used by industry. The shutdown of many factories around the world means there is less demand for those commodities, so their prices have fallen, sharply in some cases.  Oil is the starkest example. The loss of demand has been especially severe, as the crisis has led to a massive reduction in demand for transport fuels, more than 90% of which are made from crude oil. The situation was exacerbated for a period by what was in effect a price war between the two biggest exporters, Russia and Saudi Arabia. There has been an extraordinary situation where some oil prices have been below zero. It is not a general feature of the oil market, but it does highlight the huge imbalance between supply and demand. Other commodities have also seen sharp price falls, although not generally on the scale of oil. Copper, for example, is now about 18% cheaper than it was in mid-January, and zinc's price is more than 20% lower. These price falls are hitting businesses and government revenues in countries that export these commodities. Agricultural commodities have generally have been less affected. People still need to eat after all. The World Bank has described world food markets as ""amply supplied following recent bumper harvests, especially in wheat and maize"". Its report does however warn there is a risk that if concerns about food security do spread, hoarding could result. Low income countries would be especially vulnerable in that situation.  Already a fifth of the population in sub-Saharan Africa suffers from malnutrition. Some types of non-food commodity have been affected already. The Bank reports that following the travel restrictions Kenya's exports of fresh flowers dropped by 80%. Rubber prices have also been affected. As people are driving less they don't need to replace tires so much. Prices for maize and some other crops are also vulnerable to a drop in demand for biofuels. Developing countries have also had to contend with international investors pulling money out. The IMF's chief economist Gita Gopinath says the appetite for risk among international investors has waned. This means they are more inclined to sell investments seen as relatively risky, including bonds and shares in emerging markets, and pull money back to what they regard as safer bets, such as the US, Europe or Japan. She says the result has been ""unprecedented reversals in capital flows"". In a blog published by the Brussels think thank Bruegel, Marek Dombrowski and Marta Domínguez-Jiménez set out a number of financial indicators showing the strains that have built rapidly in some emerging economies. They show how the difference between bond yields - which are a measure of borrowing costs in financial markets - in the US and in developing nations has widened in many cases. This is often a sign that investors believe there is an increased risk of borrowers, including governments, defaulting on their debts. Another sign of this is the increased cost of getting insurance against a default (that is, the price of financial instruments called credit default swaps). And then there have been sharp declines in currency values for many countries. That is another sign of investors wanting to get their money out.  That also raises another issue - foreign debt. A decline in the value of a national currency makes it more expensive to repay, or pay interest on, debts in other currencies.  At a time when developing country government budgets are under pressure to deal with the health crisis and its economic consequences, debt payments could be a serious diversion of scarce resources.  So there is a vigorous campaign to address developing countries' debt problems.  The IMF and the world's leading economies have taken some steps to ease this burden, by providing relief from the burden of debt interest and repayments over the next few months. The IMF agreed to cover the payments due from 25 countries, mostly in Africa, over the next six months, from a trust fund financed by donations from member countries, including a recent pledge of $185m (£150m) by the UK. In effect those payments have been cancelled. The G20 leading economic powers agreed to defer - not cancel - debt payments from May to the end of the year for a larger group of the poorest nations. This decision covers debt payments to G20 governments from a total of 77 countries.   It means that cash can be diverted in the coming months to dealing with the crisis rather than making those payments. But it does mean they will need to make the payments in the future. So campaigners for developing country debt relief think the G20 and others should go further.   The Jubilee Debt Campaign, for example, described the G20 move as a first step, but called for the payment obligations to be cancelled altogether. They also point out that the G20 deal does not address payments to private sector lenders. The G20 merely encouraged those creditors to offer similar payment deferral to the poorest countries. The Jubilee Debt Campaign wants the rich countries to make changes to the law to prevent private creditors using the courts to sue poor countries that miss payments. It is particularly relevant to New York and the UK whose laws govern most developing country debt contracts.   Dealing with the health issues presents particular problems in densely populated urban areas in developing countries. Social distancing is especially difficult in that context. So is staying at home for people who work in what's called the informal economy. Many need to go out to work to feed themselves and their families.  Oksana Abbouda runs StreetNet International, an organisation that represents street vendors around the world. She recently spoke to the BBC's Business Daily radio programme about what the people the organisation represents are saying about their situation. ""We have to make this horrible choice, either to put ourselves at risk [from infection] and continue our informal job, or put our families at risk because they will be starving,"" she says. ""This is the reality for billions of people around the world… informal is normal in developing countries."" Developing countries are also likely to be affected through a decline in money that migrant workers send to their families at home.  These remittances, as they are known, are often sent from rich to poorer countries, and they can be a very important support to a family's standard of living. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: A new report by the World Bank warns that they are likely to fall by as much as 20% this year due to the pandemic. Migrant workers, the bank says, tend to be particularly vulnerable to losing jobs and incomes. It adds that remittances enable people to eat better, to spend more on education and to reduce child labour. "
economic indicators,India's Covid crisis delivers a blow to brand Modi,2024-09-15,2021-05-08,By Aparna Alluri,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56970569,"""Modi leads India out of a lockdown and into a Covid apocalypse,"" declared a recent headline in the UK Sunday Times.  The Australian newspaper re-published the story with a scathing summary: ""Arrogance, hyper-nationalism and bureaucratic incompetence have combined to create a crisis of epic proportions, critics say, as India's crowd-loving PM basks while citizens literally suffocate."" It earned a rebuke from India, but there's no denying the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cherished image has taken a bad hit.  Stories from India's punishing second wave have dominated global news and social media feeds - people gasping to stay alive as they wait for critical care beds and treatment; desperate families scrambling for everything, from oxygen cylinders to a doctor's appointment; mass funeral pyres and parking lots turning into crematoriums to accommodate the rising number of dead.  Coverage the world over has pinned the blame on Mr Modi - a man who has often presented himself as an able administrator with an eye for detail, who is now floundering as India's daily cases break records.    ""If competence was his calling card, many people are calling that into question,"" political scientist Milan Vaishnav says. ""It's not just that the government seems to be fumbling or absent, it's that they actively contributed to exacerbating the situation.""  Mr Modi is far from being the only leader to have bungled his Covid response. But his fall from grace is so pronounced, Mr Vaishnav says, because, unlike former US President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, he was not a ""Covid denier"". And yet he failed to prevent what happened, despite the warning signs.  Mr Modi allowed a Hindu festival where millions gathered on the banks of the Ganges river over several weeks for a holy dip. He insisted on a month-long election in West Bengal state and campaigned unmasked at massive rallies, marvelling at the size the crowds. ""These displays of negligence or defiance were shocking to see from parts of the world which had seen lockdowns recently,"" says Alex Travelli, The Economist's India correspondent.  They were also a vivid reminder of Mr Modi's brand - a strong, popular leader of an overwhelmingly Hindu country - and the Indian exceptionalism that he touted to the world in January.  ""For foreign observers, his nationalist impulses were always paired with a sense of technocratic competence. But technocratic competence has been entirely missing from the [Covid] response,"" says Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the State University of New York.  Mr Modi's reputation as a both a populist leader and a vigilant administrator started to fray in 2016 when a disastrous currency ban knocked down millions of Indians who largely relied on cash. Then, last year, he shut down the country overnight to stop the spread of Covid - but again, millions lost jobs and many lost their lives. India's economy is still reeling from all of this.  Mr Modi's defence was that there was a greater good at stake, be it flushing out illegal cash or beating Covid. But this latest misstep cannot be explained away easily, says Ravi Agrawal, editor-in-chief of Foreign Policy.  ""You can explain away numbers like GDP, but you can't explain away a brother's death,"" he says. ""Indians have always believed that although Modi makes mistakes, he still fights for them, he believes in them."" But this time, he says, they are questioning his intent. ""There is a crack, a very visible crack in the edifice, the facade that is Modi."" ""Modi means business"" declared a Time magazine cover in 2012.  Back in 2002, more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, died in riots that erupted in Gujarat state after 60 Hindus were killed in a train fire. Mr Modi, who was then the chief minister of the state, was accused of allowing the riots. He denied any wrongdoing and came out unscathed. By 2012, the Gujarat chief minister was ""a paragon of good governance and effective administration"" for his supporters. Other coverage dubbed him an ""autocratic loner"" and ""a poor delegator"", but a ""refreshing"" change under whom ""Gujarat bloomed"" and ""business flourished"". His bid for PM, after a 13-year stint heading Gujarat, was seen as an opportunity to ""revitalise"" India's economy. The BJP was taking a risk on the ""polarising"" Mr Modi, but his reputation as a ""no-nonsense administrator"" was part of his appeal. ""We got taken in by the relatively easy way it was to govern Gujarat,"" says Nilanjan Mukopadhyay, a journalist and Mr Modi's biographer.  Brand new roads, power lines, lesser red tape and increased private investment in Gujarat impressed middle-class and wealthy voters. But Mr Mukhopadhyay says it wasn't a great feat to achieve in a prosperous state with a small population. And Gujarat's social indicators didn't improve much.   ""We were all taken by this great aura of Modi. I made this error too. He once said we have a red carpet, not red tape. Where is the red carpet for the aid that is coming?"" (The aid has been stuck in customs, according to a series of damaging news reports.)   The current crisis, observers say, has exposed the chinks in Mr Modi's armour. They say his centralised style of leadership seemed reassuring last year but proved hollow this time as he passed the buck to states. A generous vaccine strategy, which saw him donate doses to countries, now appears like careless grandstanding since India has forced its largest vaccine marker to renege on international commitments, which brought it funding. His strident majoritarianism, which so many voters admired, stops him from reaching out across the aisle for bipartisan solutions, experts say.  ""He put his name and his stamp on everything. So when something goes wrong he has to take the fall. You can't have it both ways,"" Mr Agrawal says.  Mr Modi built an impressive brand abroad too - ""He is at his best outside India,"" wrote one newspaper. He drew a ""roaring crowd"" at the iconic Madison Square Gardens and overshadowed former US President Donald Trump at the Howdy, Modi! gathering in Texas.    ""He deployed this imagery of himself so aggressively,"" Mr Agrawal says. He was even called the ""most physically demonstrative Indian leader in years."" His muscular nationalism was a balm for Indians at home and overseas, and promised the emergence of a superpower. Now, Mr Agrawal says, it is ""galling"" for Indians everywhere to see how their economic peers - Thailand, Vietnam, Bangladesh - have fared better against Covid.  ""There's embarrassment among the diaspora that the country which they have got used to describing to their friends as a rising power is now being shown the way it is.""  ""He has proven to be an exceptionally resilient politician and political leader,"" Mr Vaishnav says. ""The man has recovered from some incredible nadirs already, I wouldn't count him out,"" Mr Travelli adds.  The government is already in damage-control mode. It has taken offence to the bad press, sparred with opposition leaders and fumed at tweeters critical of its response.  It has suggested a ""foreign conspiracy"" is afoot to discredit India, asked Twitter to take down posts it didn't like and then took to Twitter to thank and defend Mr Modi's leadership. But Mr Modi himself has been conspicuously absent, barring a tame address on 20 April.  ""At the start of the pandemic, Modi knew how he wanted to look to India and the world,"" Mr Travelli says. ""He was styling himself as a general leading his people. But no equivalent posture is available to him at the moment. He doesn't have any interest in apologising or asking for help."" Mr Modi has only been interviewed a handful of times since he became PM. He has never addressed a press conference, even during Covid.  ""He doesn't want to be questioned,"" Mr Mukhopadhyay says.   But questions are all anyone has - the poor, a traumatised middle class and the rich Indians who couldn't escape the huge gaps in healthcare, and even loyal party workers who can't quite grasp how the prime minister let this happen.

economic indicators,'Progress' towards well-being goals,2024-09-15,2017-09-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-41386999,"Good health and work prospects are improving in Wales, but inequality remains, according to the nation's first annual report on well-being.   In-work poverty and obesity were named as two of the main ongoing challenges. Ethnic minorities were less likely feel they belonged to their local area, while women were less likely than men to say they felt safe. Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said the report would help the public sector make ""more informed decisions"". The Well-being of Wales 2016-17 report gives an overview of progress towards the seven goals set out in the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015.   The act insists on more joined-up thinking by authorities to boost the prospects for all people and communities in Wales.  The annual report is intended to measure progress towards the well-being goals using a range of 46 ""national indicators"".   Among the findings are that while fewer people are smoking and drinking, obesity is rising. People are more likely to be in work than ever before, but the report warns that increasing numbers are in poorly paid jobs. Against a background of ""little improvement"" in earnings, the report said the gender pay gap had reduced and educational attainment was increasing.  But it added that people's prospects were still affected by their social, economic or ethnic background. On the environment, the report said water and air quality were improving, but air pollution was still a ""significant"" health issue.  And while renewable energy generation was on the rise, key natural resources were being ""depleted faster than they can be replenished"".    Wales' chief statistician Glyn Jones said: ""This is an important report bringing together a range of statistics on a wide range of topics, which I hope will become a useful benchmark over the coming years to mark our collective progress on the well-being goals."" Mr Drakeford said: ""This extensive report provides information about a whole range of issues affecting Wales' economy, society, environment and culture.   ""This will help the public sector make more informed decisions for current and future generations."""
economic indicators,"Scottish unemployment falls by 7,000",2024-09-15,2017-09-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-41252778,"Scotland's jobless total fell by 7,000 in the three months to July, to stand at 102,000. The unemployment rate fell by 0.3% from the previous quarter to reach 3.8% - below the UK figure of 4.3%. The number of people in work rose by 60,000 to 2,587,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. Meanwhile, wages in the period were 2.1% higher than a year earlier, little changed from previous months' growth rates. With inflation hitting 2.9% in August, wages are failing to keep up. In real terms, wages dropped by 0.4%. Scotland's Employability Minister Jamie Hepburn described the latest labour market statistics as ""encouraging"". He said: ""There are now 109,000 more people in employment compared to the pre-recession peak and Scotland now has the highest employment rate in the UK. ""Our unemployment rate remains a success story, showing that the labour market remains resilient and robust. ""With the most recent GDP figures showing the Scottish economy grew nearly four times that of the UK in the first quarter of this year, today's labour market figures are further proof that the fundamentals of Scotland's economy remain strong, despite the challenges posed by Brexit."" Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: ""It is very encouraging that Scotland's employment has reached a record high and that unemployment remains at a historic low.  ""More people in work means more money in people's pockets and that's good news.  ""However, we cannot afford to be complacent. With Scotland's overall economic performance continuing to lag behind that of the UK, it is imperative that our two governments work together.   ""I also urge the Scottish government to use their extensive powers to boost Scotland's prosperity."" Scotland has never had it so good.  Exceptionally low unemployment. Record high employment. Jobs growth motoring nicely. Only the south-east and south west regions of England have lower unemployment rates. The concerning rise in economic inactivity - those not counting themselves as available for work - has diminished since the start of the year. That's before we were able to find out why it was. Why is this happening? Judging by other indicators published in recent months, it has to do with a buoyant manufacturing and export market, helped by the fall in the value of sterling. Tourism is an export, even if it doesn't look like one. And it has had a bumper year, from foreigners and staycationers. Read more from Douglas Stuart McIntyre, from the Fraser of Allander economic research institute, said that on headline indicators, the Scottish labour market continued to look ""in good health"".  He added: ""Unemployment is at 3.8%, lower than the UK rate of 4.3%, and among the lowest of any part of the UK. ""Meanwhile the rate of economic inactivity, which had been a cause for concern through much of the past 18 months, is now back at the same rate as the UK as a whole (21.2%).  ""While these headline indicators remain healthy, the outlook for people in work remains mixed.  ""Earnings growth has been weak for some time, and with inflation at 2.9%, this means that while headline indicators of the labour market may look strong, family budgets will be feeling the squeeze."" Stuart Mackinnon, from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Scotland, said: ""Low unemployment is great for Scotland and good for firms that serve our local communities.  ""While we know that some firms are concerned about skills and labour shortages, that shouldn't detract from what is good news for the country."" "
economic indicators,Record rise in workers on payrolls in May,2024-09-15,2021-06-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57480167,"There was a record rise in the number of workers on payrolls in May as the jobs market continued to recover. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there were 197,000 more people in payrolled employment last month compared with April, the highest rise since records began in 2014. It came as the unemployment rate fell again to 4.7% in the three months to April, down from 4.8% previously. But unemployment remained high among the young and those in based in London. Sam Beckett, ONS head of economic statistics, said: ""The number of employees on payroll grew strongly in May, up by almost 200,000, although it is still over half a million down since the pandemic struck. ""Job vacancies continued to recover in the spring, and our early estimates suggest that by May the total had surpassed its pre-pandemic level, with strong growth in sectors such as hospitality. ""Meanwhile the redundancy rate remains subdued, while the number of employees on furlough has continued to decline.""  Unemployment rose sharply last year as the UK went through successive lockdowns, but it has gradually fallen in 2021 as restrictions are eased.  Firms appear to be expanding again, with the number of job vacancies in most industries above pre-pandemic levels in May, according to the ONS. Similarly, the redundancy rate is back to levels seen before the spread of coronavirus. However, the number of workers on company payrolls in the accommodation and food services sector, aged under 25, or living in London remains ""well below"" pre-pandemic levels, the ONS said.  After a long hiatus, DJ and music producer Sean Dakin will be playing a few socially distanced gigs during the Euro football championships.  He has also started freelancing again in sales and as an editor after the best part of a year with no proper income. His fear now is that the job opportunities will dry up again because of the delay to unlocking Covid restrictions. ""If we are pushing things back we need urgent help for those in hospitality, theatre, nightclubs, other late night venues,"" he told the BBC.   ""It's absolutely a disgrace that dates are moved with what feels like little thought for the consequences with a complete disregard for peoples' mental health and incomes."" He says he understands the need to protect public health, but that the UK ""cannot afford to stumble every time there's a variant and cases rise a little"". Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, told the BBC's Today programme that the figures showed the labour market was ""starting to turn in a good way after quite a painful year"". ""It is pretty much all down to the furlough scheme,"" he said. ""That has been a huge success and quite frankly one of the best government policies I think that the modern economy has ever seen. Without that I do think we would have had unemployment rates of 8-9%, similar to the peaks we saw during the global financial crisis."" Mr Dales noted there were still 3.4 million people on furlough but said the ""way the wind is blowing"" meant many would end up returning to their jobs. If they did not, he said it ""wouldn't be too long until they found another one"". There are fears the four-week delay to fully unlocking Covid restrictions will harm many firms, and the government has said it will not extend the furlough scheme (due to end in September) or other financial support. Hospitality, wedding and night-time entertainment businesses have all reacted with dismay.  However, Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, said she expected the labour market to improve despite the delay, and that employers may struggle to fill gaps.  ""Sharp declines in furloughed employees in those sectors that reopened on 12 April... coupled with anecdotal evidence of significant difficulties to fill vacancies in some sectors, point at increasing challenges to add staff in the coming months."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Our Plan for Jobs is working - the latest forecasts for unemployment are around half of what was previously feared and the number of employees on payroll is at its highest level since April last year."" But Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the government needed to do more for businesses affected by the delay to removing restrictions.  ""Many businesses have financial pinch points coming up but are still struggling to turn a profit. ""If businesses have to stay closed or operate at massively reduced capacity they're not going to be able to pay staff, rents and loans back. Government support must recognise that."" There are a number of upbeat indicators in today's jobs figures. Granted the latest estimate of the number on employers' payrolls remains over half a million below its pre-pandemic level. The living standards think-tank the Resolution Foundation also estimates there are still 2.8 million people who remain on furlough and self-employed income support schemes who need to find work as support is withdrawn.  But that's down from 6.2 million in March. And the number of job vacancies, at 758,000, is now back up to pre-pandemic levels. What's unlike any other economic crisis of the past 50 years is that in this one, it's London that's been hardest hit by unemployment.  With financial sector employees continuing to work from home in large numbers, there's less demand for the restaurants, coffee shops and shops that cater for the City of London's much-reduced army of commuters. London alone still has fewer employees than it did in May last year and it now has the highest unemployment rate, at 6.5%, of any region. "
economic indicators,Davos: Trump arrival looms over meeting,2024-09-15,2018-01-24,By Kamal Ahmed,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42803041,"The snowploughs here at Davos do a very good - if loud - job. They scoop up the drifts - often feet deep - and deposit their icy loads in the ever-attendant snow lorries which follow behind. The political equivalent of the biggest snowplough here in the Alps arrives at the World Economic Forum tomorrow. US President Donald Trump will helicopter in and is likely to drive all before him. Delegates are certainly waiting with bated breath to hear the message the president will deliver in his keynote address on Friday. And during the huge business reception the White House is planning tomorrow evening. An invite to that will certainly confer WEF bragging rights. Yesterday, the president said his key point would be a clear one: ""it's time to invest in America."" His policies are working and the economy is booming, he will say. Whether he will offer a more conciliatory tone on global trade - yesterday, America announced new, protectionist tariff barriers on the import of solar panels and washing machines - is open to question. Before the plough arrives from Washington, Europe is seeking to have its one day in the limelight. And their message will be very different from the president's. Emmanuel Macron of France, Angela Merkel of Germany and Paolo Gentiloni of Italy will all talk up globalisation, free trade and the need for multilateral approaches to the world's economic problems. Only by working together and not in isolation will the world prosper, they will argue. The leaders of Greece, Sweden and Poland are also here today - Europe day for the World Economic Forum. In their support for globalisation, they have firm backers in the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and the Canadian leader, Justin Trudeau, who both spoke yesterday. The divide between the ""globalists"" and the ""protectionists"" is one of the big dividing lines here in the mountains. The other is between ""the rock stars"" and ""the rest"" - those leaders that all the business and political leaders want to meet, and those that are simply not creating so much energy. President Trump will certainly garner a huge amount of interest, both from supporters and detractors. The level of fascination is even more intense than that generated by President Xi Jinping of China, who came here last year. The other ""rock star"" of 2018 is certainly Mr Macron. Last week, he hosted business leaders at Versailles ahead of his visit here. All of those who went, and it included the biggest names in the corporate world, have spoken here of how impressed they were - and are - by the French leader's efforts both to woo them and to reform the French economy. If mood music were a GDP indicator, Mr Macron would be shooting out the lights. Tomorrow, on the day Mr Trump and his sizeable entourage arrive (the president is bringing 13 ministers and senior officials), Theresa May will give her address here in Davos. Its tone will be fascinating. On which side of the divide, globalisation versus protectionism, will she sit? And, as the great and the good of politics crane their necks to glimpse the leaders of America and France, how will the British prime minister combat the sense among some here that the UK now makes its bed with ""the rest"" rather than ""the rock stars""?"
economic indicators,Five things about Nigeria: The superpower with no power,2024-09-15,2019-02-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47217557,"More than 84 million Nigerians are registered to vote, but what do you know about Africa's most-populous nation and largest economy? Nigerian musicians are touring the world and picking up awards at the forefront of the global craze for Afrobeats. This is not to be confused with the late, great Fela Kuti's Afrobeat (without the s) - Nigeria's soundtrack to the 1970s and 1980s, which mixed traditional rhythms with funk and jazz. These new stars, including Wizkid, Davido, Tiwa Savage and Jidenna, are proving to be some of Nigeria's biggest exports - so much so that global music giants such as Universal Music Group and Sony have set up offices in the country. Davido's Fall, released in 2017, is the most popular Nigerian music video ever - clocking up more than 100 million views and counting on YouTube. ""This West African phenomenon is not only dominating the sound of the continent, it has flown into club festivals and radio playlists across the globe,"" DJ Rita Ray told the BBC. ""Afrobeats is also influencing genres from grime to RnB and music makers from Ed Sheeran to rappers Drake and Stefflon Don, who have all embraced Afrobeats in recent releases. And that's not to forget British-Nigerian singer, songwriter MNEK, whose writing and production credits include Beyoncé, Dua Lipa, Madonna, Diplo and countless more. Add up all the hits and he'd have more than a billion views on YouTube."" The sound evolved from Nigerian and Ghanaian Afro-pop music, incorporating genres like hiplife, azonto and dancehall - and it was D'banj's track Oliver Twist that launched the Afrobeats bandwagon in 2012, getting to number nine in the UK charts, she says. Other Nigerian talent to look out for include Afrobeats musicians such as Yemi Alade, Tekno, Falz, Olamide, Simi, Mr Eazi, Mologo and Patoranking. ""What makes Afrobeats so compelling is rhythm - Nigerians have always been hot on rhythms, it's the driving force of their music. Afrobeats takes this forward by stripping back to one of the component parts of their rich polyrhythms,"" says Rita Ray. It's not just music where Nigeria packs a cultural punch - it also boasts some of the world's greatest writers. Top of the list comes the late Chinua Achebe, whose debut novel, Things Fall Apart, has become a classic of post-colonial literature selling more than 20 million copies since its publication in 1958. It has also been translated into 57 languages. Wole Soyinka became the first African to be awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 1986 and Ben Okri's The Famished Road won the coveted Man Booker Prize in 1991. And contemporary writers like Chigozie Obioma, Helon Habila, Chibundu Onuzo  Sefi Atta and Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani are keeping up the tradition, to name just a few of those scooping up prizes. ""Nigerians love to be seen and heard. There are probably hundreds of Africans telling amazing stories all over the continent, but Nigerians are getting most of the attention because we are bold and loud,"" Nwaubani told the BBC. ""We aim to be at the top in everything we do. We make sure that everyone knows whenever we enter the building. Even those of us based in our home country, where there is a dearth of adequate publishing structures, are succeeding in commanding the attention of publishers and readers across the globe."" Given that Nigerians have a proverb to hand for every occasion, it is no surprise they are such fantastic storytellers, while the country's thriving multi-million dollar film industry, known as Nollywood, is testament to their love of a dramatic plot. Nigeria's multitude of ethnicities also adds to the creative mix. Arguably the face of feminism in the 21st Century is award-winning writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, who neatly summed up the feminist cause in her book Dear Ijeawele: ""The knowledge of cooking does not come pre-installed in a vagina."" You're into dangerous territory in Nigeria if you try to establish which ethnic or religious group has the biggest population as it brings to the fore a multitude of rivalries - and tensions over money as the larger a state's population, the greater the budget allocated by the central government. Yet there is no denying that Nigeria's population is growing at a dizzying speed. By 2047 it will have overtaken the US to become the world's third-largest nation with 387 million people, according to UN projections. It is also a very young nation with more than 40% of the population of 196 million under the age of 14. And young people are set to play a huge role in this election with more than half of registered voters under the age of 35. The huge growth presents an opportunity for the country with its entrepreneurial spirit as it could in theory take advantage of the economic dividend that a young dynamic population can bring. This is especially true as the workforce in more developed nations is getting older. But it is also a challenge for policy makers. Young graduates can frequently be heard complaining that there are not enough high-quality jobs available, and many speak about hoping to leave the country. Looking at population growth in Africa in general, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has warned that without proper planning it could become a political catastrophe.  Some would argue that the real soundtrack of Nigeria is not Afrobeats, but the din of diesel generators as most Nigerians, even if they are connected to mains electricity, have to rely on them because power cuts are common. Some areas can go without power for weeks. This is despite the fact that Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer and currently pumps out around two million barrels a day. The tax revenue the government receives from the industry and the foreign exchange it gets from its export are vital to the economy. Though many Nigerians would be quick to remind you that much of its oil wealth has been squandered over the years. At one stage Nigerians used to joke that the old state-run power provider Nepa stood for ""Never Expect Power Always"". In a bid to overhaul the industry, the state firm was split up and privatised - a process that was completed in November 2013. Yet complaints about unfair billing and blackouts remain constant. Electricity production has steadily increased since 2000 but it has struggled to keep up with population growth, according to the International Energy Agency. Electricity supply per Nigerian has barely changed since 2005 because the population has grown in that time by approximately 57 million, which is the current population of South Africa. Just more than half of all Nigerian homes have mains electricity, but there is a big urban-rural divide. More than four out of every five homes in towns and cities have mains power while only a third of homes in the countryside do, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. As well as being the continent's biggest oil producer, it is also its largest economy, but its power problems have hampered growth. The hashtag #BringBackOurGirls brought the world's attention to an Islamist insurgency led by Boko Haram militants. Their kidnapping in 2014 of more than 200 girls from a school in Chibok, in north-eastern Nigeria, underlined the heart of their cause - opposition to Western-style education. The group was founded in 2002 in the north-eastern city of Maiduguri, where local residents dubbed it Boko Haram, which loosely translated from the region's Hausa language as ""Western education is forbidden"". Historically, the Muslim rulers of northern Nigeria had resisted direct British colonial rule. But Andrew Walker, author of a book about Boko Haram, ""Eat the Heart of the Infidel"", says it has even deeper roots. ""There is a long history of Islamic radicalism in northern Nigeria, where two caliphates preceded colonialism,"" he told the BBC. ""More recently, the notion that corrupt politicians were not Islamic became the springboard for Muslim cleric Mohammed Yusuf to found Boko Haram. ""The political culture of northern Nigeria, where local politicians court groups like Yusuf's hoping they can aid them in their political ends, incubated the group in its early days. Even before Yusuf and his followers turned to violence, the Maiduguri establishment worried about the mixing in of a charismatic preacher and his poverty-bound devotees to the pot of corrupt electoral politics."" Mr Yusuf's death in police custody nearly a decade ago led the group to launch military operations to create an Islamic state. Many thousands of people were kidnapped and recruited into its ranks, and at one stage the group controlled swathes of territory across three states, imposing strict Sharia. At its peak, in 2015, Boko Haram was ranked the world's deadliest terror group by the Institute for Economics and Peace. But in the last four years, the military, with international support, has managed to take back control of much of this land and rescued many of those taken hostage. Yet the militants are still proving deadly, with fighters from a Boko Haram faction loyal to Islamic State being behind an upsurge in violence ahead of the elections. And 112 of the Chibok schoolgirls are still missing. "
economic indicators,UK rates held as economy shows signs of picking up,2024-09-15,2020-01-30,By Szu Ping Chan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51309256,"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 0.75% amid early signs of a pick-up in the UK and global economies. In Mark Carney's final interest rate meeting as governor, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 7-2 to keep rates unchanged. Recent weak economic data had led to speculation rates could be cut, but Mr Carney said ""the most recent signs are that global growth has stabilised"". But the MPC said it was poised to cut interest rates if necessary. Fewer companies in the UK are worried about Brexit, Mr Carney told a news conference following the rate decision. He added that survey data suggested UK growth will improve. But he said: ""To be clear these are still early days and it's less of a case of so far so good than so far good enough,"" he said, again referring to the UK economy. ""Although the global economy looks to be recovering, caution is warranted,"" he said. ""Evidence of a pick-up in growth is not yet widespread."" He said the coronavirus outbreak was a ""reminder of the need to be vigilant"" when it comes to bumps in economic growth around the world. The nine MPC members have been split on rates since November. Lower interest rates are good news for borrowers and bad news for savers because High Street banks use the Bank of England base rate as a reference point for many mortgages and savings accounts. In a closely-watched decision, policymakers said they would monitor whether a recent improvement in business sentiment would lead to stronger economic growth. The MPC said it stood ready to cut rates if there were signs that growth would remain subdued. ""Policy might need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth, should the more positive signals from recent indicators of global and domestic activity not be sustained,"" the MPC said. Two members, Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders, argued that past business surveys of economic growth had not been reliable. They continued to call for an immediate interest rate cut to 0.5%. The Bank's latest economic estimates suggest the economy did not grow at all in the final three months of last year. Weaker growth at the turn of the year is also expected to drag overall economic growth down to just 0.75% in 2020. This is down from a projection of 1.25% last November. The UK economy is expected to expand by 0.2% in the first three months of this year. The Bank said a trade deal between the US and China that lowers some tariffs would provide a boost to the global economy. An expected rise in spending by the government in the March Budget could provide a further boost to growth, policymakers said. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said she also expected stronger growth ahead. ""Admittedly, the MPC left the door open to a rate cut in the coming months, but with the economy turning a corner and a big fiscal stimulus approaching, we suspect the next move in interest rates will be up not down, albeit not until next year."" The Bank said Brexit-related uncertainty had ""weighed on investment"" over the past few years. Policymakers said companies' Brexit plans had diverted money towards preparing for the UK's departure from the EU that would otherwise be invested elsewhere. This has reduced the UK's long-term growth prospects by limiting the space in which the economy can grow without the risk of overheating. This would force the Bank to raise interest rates, which would in turn slow the UK economy. Policymakers now believe the UK's potential growth has been reduced to 1.1%. This is down from 2.9% before the financial crisis and 1.6% over most of the past decade."
economic indicators,Teen subjected to coercive control before death,2024-09-15,2021-11-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-wiltshire-59420588,"A 17-year-old girl who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend after she ended their relationship was subjected to ""coercive control"" before her death, a review has found.  Thomas Griffiths tried to disrupt Ellie Gould's studies, a form of behaviour known as ""educational sabotage"", the Domestic Homicide Review ruled. He admitted murder and was jailed for 12 and a half years in November 2019. The independent review found no agency failings or shortcomings. It said it was ""alarming"" how quickly their separation escalated to murder after she ended their relationship. Ellie, a keen horse rider, attempted to fight off Griffiths after he attacked her with a kitchen knife at her family home in Calne, Wiltshire, in May 2019. He later staged the scene to make it look like a suicide and returned to school. The review stated: ""In this case, the perpetrator appeared to be disrupting Ellie's studying during an important period of revision, displayed insecurities and appeared to be inducing guilt. ""Ellie sought a break from the perpetrator during their revision for mock A-level exams, but the perpetrator appeared not to accept this. ""His disruption of her studies thereafter should be seen within the context of educational sabotage."" It described educational sabotage as ""a less known form of coercive control and economic abuse which disrupts a victim's ability to gain educational qualifications and furthers a perpetrator's power and control over them"". It said Ellie would have been able to use ""the full range of specialist domestic abuse services"" within Wiltshire had she wanted or felt the need to. The independent multi-agency report's recommendations included promoting the support available for young people in Wiltshire concerned about domestic abuse or controlling behaviour. Additional recommendations included further raising awareness of indicators of abuse in young people's relationships for agencies, as well as families and friends. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Cooper, chairman of the Wiltshire Community Safety Partnership, said: ""Tackling domestic abuse and violence, in all its forms, is every agency's responsibility and we will continue to work together to ensure we are doing all we can to support victims and educate everyone on this issue."" Ellie's friends have since campaigned for self-defence classes to be part of the school curriculum."
economic indicators,ECB says no quick end to stimulus,2024-09-15,2017-07-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40666236,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has insisted there is still a long way to go before it can call a halt to its economic stimulus programme. ECB president Mario Draghi threw cold water on speculation that the bank might wind the programme down soon. The bank is still buying 60bn euros (£53bn) of bonds a month as part of its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The ECB also kept the key interest rate for the countries that use the euro currency unchanged at 0%. Mr Draghi said: ""After a long time we are finally experiencing a robust recovery, where we only have to wait for wages and prices to follow a course towards our objective.  ""The last thing the governing council wants is an unwanted tightening and for conditions that may either slow down this process or even jeopardise it."" Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The comment on inflation which is sticking in our head is Mr Draghi's notice to markets that: 'We are not there yet.'"" However, the euro did move sharply to a 14-month high against the dollar when at one point Mr Draghi hinted that the governing council of the ECB might start discussing reducing QE in the autumn. Neil Wilson from ETX Capital commented: ""It wasn't much but the market is super-sensitive to anything from Draghi at the moment."" Last month, Mr Draghi's speech in Sintra in Portugal was interpreted by many economists as meaning the eurozone's economic recovery would allow QE to end and for interest rates to rise. Patrick O'Donnell, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said: ""This is a well-choreographed attempt by Mr Draghi to make sure that financial markets don't get ahead of themselves after his more hawkish comments of late."" The QE bond-buying programme, together with ultra-low interest rates, was designed to encourage lending and fend off the threat of deflation in the eurozone. Mr Draghi said the policy had been a success: ""We have created in the last three years six million jobs, much more than any time before the crisis in the same amount of time. ""All the economic sentiment indicators and survey indicators are either at all time highs or close to them so the policies have been successful."" However, the inflation rate in the eurozone was 1.3% in June, down slightly from 1.4% in May, some way below the ECB's target of close to, but below, 2%. Mr Draghi said: ""Measures of underlying inflation remain low and have yet to show convincing signs of a pick-up, as domestic cost pressures, including wage growth, are still subdued. Underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to rise only gradually over the medium term."" Aberdeen Asset Management's Mr O'Donnell said: ""We probably won't hear anything significant out of the ECB until September, which is plenty of time for investors to digest Mr Draghi's caveat laden hawkishness. ""Mr Draghi will be hoping that today's performance is enough to give him a quiet summer."""
economic indicators,US jobless claims at lowest level since 1969,2024-09-15,2022-03-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60864890,"Fewer workers sought jobless benefits in the US last week than at any time since 1969. Just 187,000 people filed for unemployment, the Labor Department reported. That was down roughly 28,000 from the previous week. The figures show a stark turnaround in the job market in the US since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The news sparked several historic comparisons on social media, with some sharing photos of Woodstock music fest. ""The last time jobless claims fell this low was the same year we landed folks on the moon,"" said Rep Ted Lieu, Democrat from California.  ""The last time weekly jobless claims were this low The Beatles were still together,"" added Rep Don Beyer, Democrat of Virginia.  The US economy has many looking back to the past at the moment, but it hasn't been easy for economists and analysts to settle on the right historic analogies. When lockdowns hit two years ago, the weekly jobless report hit record highs, with claims eventually exceeding six million. But the economy, helped along by a massive government stimulus programme, has since roared back with a strength that surprised most analysts. Growth jumped 5.7% last year, while payrolls have been expanding at a healthy clip, increasing by more than 600,000 last month, helping to cut the jobless rate to 3.8%. Thursday's report highlighted the tight labour market, analysts said. President Joe Biden has sought to claim credit for the gains, pointing to Democratic spending plans and progress controlling coronavirus under his watch. He celebrated Thursday's report, citing it as another sign of a ""historic economic recovery"". But surveys show the public remains worried about the economy, reflecting prices that are increasing at a pace not seen in 40 years. Many in the business world are haunted by comparisons to the 1970s, when the US was hit by so-called stagflation - when growth slowed even as price increases spiralled, driven in part by oil shocks. David Rosenberg, head of the Toronto-based economic research firm Rosenberg Research, said economic indicators - including low jobless claims - suggest that America's economy is headed for a recession - as it was at the end of 1969.  But that doesn't mean the US economy is in for a repeat of 1970s-style problems, he added. He said inflation pressures driven by supply shocks from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine will eventually abate.  And he expects productivity gains to drive growth, pointing to investments companies have accelerated in areas like automation since the pandemic. ""That is where the comparison to the 1970s really falls flat on its face,"" he said. He thinks a better comparison is the temporary inflation seen after World War One. Brad DeLong, economics professor at the University of California, said the US should try to avoid that example. To control price increases, the US central bank at that time doubled interest rates from 3.75% to 7% - a move prominent economists have since judged as moving too late and too far, he noted. He favours comparisons from the late 1940s and early 1950s, as the economy shifted in response to World War Two and the Korean and Cold Wars.  ""I could be wrong. Uncertainty is rife. Everyone right now is reaching into the past and seeking for their favourite past historical inflationary episode as an analogy,"" he said.  ""Maybe we will see something completely new."""
economic indicators,Reality Check: Have the Greek bailouts worked?,2024-09-15,2017-06-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40288065,"As eurozone finance ministers meet in Brussels for crucial talks on Greece, Reality Check looks at whether the bailouts the country has received have secured Greece's economic survival or just created unsustainable debt. Neither Greece nor its creditors would say they are happy with how it has worked out.  In 2010, when the Greek debt crisis started, Greece received €110bn (£96bn) in bailout money. And in 2012, the country received a second bailout of €130bn. These loans, from the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), were deemed necessary to stop Greece going bankrupt. In exchange, Greece was required to make deep public spending cuts, raise taxes and introduce fundamental changes to the public sector and labour legislation. In August 2015, the eurozone countries agreed to give Greece a third bailout, of up to €86bn, on the condition of further changes.  The next tranche of that bailout, which Greece needs in order to honour repayments due in July, is being discussed at the eurozone finance ministers' meeting on Thursday.  In 2010, they managed to keep Greece in the euro and prevented the collapse of the common currency.  So, from the perspective of the eurozone as a whole, a chaotic ""Grexit"" did not happen. But seven years on, and many more billions of euros later, was this price worth paying, both from the point of view of Greece's creditors and of the Greek people? It is impossible to know what the situation would be like now had Greece not received the bailouts, but the consequences of receiving them have been painful. For the Greek people, the bailouts and the austerity measures implemented with them have come at a huge cost.  Greece's creditors, strongly influenced by Germany, demanded that Greece start spending less than it earned. In 2016, for the first time, Greece achieved this. The surplus is small, at €1.3bn or 0.7% of GDP. But this can hardly be seen as a success - the economy has shrunk and the overall debt pile is still going up, not down. What to do about the debt is the main stumbling block between Greece's creditors, the eurozone countries and the IMF.  Some countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, do not want to release any more money unless the IMF agrees to be part of the third rescue programme for Greece. They think that, without the IMF, the EU institutions would be too soft on Greece in their demands for changes. The IMF has so far refused to get involved because it says Greece's debts are unsustainable and need restructuring.  It says that Greece cannot be expected to grow out of its debt problem, even with the full implementation of changes.  The talks on Thursday will determine whether Greece will be able to make the repayments due in July.  But the key question is whether the creditors can reach any agreement on restructuring Greek debt. French President Emmanuel Macron said he would ""lead the fight"" for debt relief because ""there's no chance of returning to a stable economy and society in the eurozone with the current level of debt"". Germany is much more reluctant to allow any debt relief, ahead of elections there in September. Bailouts for Greece may have dropped from the headlines, but have they worked? Not yet.

economic indicators,Level 4 move could 'ease' Christmas rules for Scots,2024-09-15,2020-11-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-54960028,"Introducing tougher Covid restrictions in the west of Scotland now could help pave the way to easing the rules over Christmas, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The first minister believed it was ""likely"" but ""not inevitable"" that some areas would be moved into level four. She said infection rates were still ""stubbornly high"" in some areas. And that could lead to ""less flexibility"" for some limited easing of restrictions over the Christmas period - something she was ""very keen to do"". She said the rates of infection also meant that the Scottish government ""do not have as much assurance as we would want"" that hospitals and intensive care facilities would be able to cope over the winter. Ms Sturgeon said that moving to level four restrictions ""for a limited period in some areas"" would address both of those concerns. She explained: ""Where we have stubbornly high prevalence, if we want to protect our NHS and if we want to get to a point at Christmas where we might be able to have a bit of easing of restrictions, albeit that will be very careful, then we need to get that prevalence down more right now."" Questioned at her daily briefing, she said: ""I don't want to get ahead of ourselves here - because there is lots of consideration and discussions, not least across the four nations of the UK right now - before we get to a settled point before Christmas. ""But if you are asking me my priority for Christmas it is to allow families some ability to get together.  ""That should be the priority, and if we do go to level four for any areas tomorrow then part of it, not the whole reason, is to try to get prevalence down to the point where we think we can have some limited easing around that."" Ms Sturgeon said the council areas in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, with the possible exception of Inverclyde, were causing the most concern, along with North and South Lanarkshire. Level four may well be coming for the west of Scotland. All the government indicators suggest it should be, but the reluctance until now can perhaps be explained by more than just economic consequences. The effects of loneliness and isolation on people's mental health are already at alarming levels, doctors tell me.  Closing cafes where people who live on their own at least have a chance to meet someone will exacerbate that.  It will likely put even more pressure onto GPs, with community support services unable to operate in the same way. And then for shielders. The governments strategic framework says that level four would see the chief medical officer write an automatic two week fit note for those in the shielding category.  That could affect staffing in the NHS or in schools and other vital services. Later, she added: ""I think it is likely that we will see some areas go to level four this week. ""But is it inevitable? Until we have taken that final decision, no of course it's not."" The next decision about restriction levels will be made on Tuesday, with any changes taking effect from Friday. In level four bars and restaurants, non-essential shops, gyms and indoor sports facilities would close - but schools would remain open. Prof Linda Bauld, an expert in public health at the University of Edinburgh, said she thought it was ""highly likely"" that large parts of central Scotland would be placed in level four. She said the rolling average of cases per 100,00 people was about 143 in Scotland. ""For Greater Glasgow and Clyde it is up to 247. That is very high - and Lanarkshire is just below that at 241. ""So action clearly does need to be taken,"" she said. The latest figures show that a further 717 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in Scotland, and six more deaths have been recorded. Ms Sturgeon added that an era was ""firmly on the horizon"" where better therapies, vaccines, testing and treatments would be available. ""The end is not quite with us, but we can see hope on the horizon now that we couldn't see just a few weeks ago,"" she added."
economic indicators,'We wish we could go back': Life in a war-torn Myanmar,2024-09-15,2023-04-16,By Jonathan Head,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-65248242,"Out on the crystal-clear water of Inle Lake, the boats putter back and forth, some piled high with water weeds they use on their gardens, others throwing out fishing cages.  The Shan hills, made blue by the hazy air, form the stunning backdrop to a lake which has been a tourist magnet for as long as there have been tourists in Myanmar. But there are almost no tourists now. First the Covid pandemic, then the violence since the military coup two years ago, have driven them away.  Our boatman, a member of the local Intha ethnic group, tells us we are the first foreign customers he has had for more than three years. It is difficult even feeding his family, he says. Other boatmen complain that without the tourists, there are now too many people fishing on the lake, and catches are small. The civil war, which broke out after the military used lethal force to put down mass protests in the weeks following the coup, is getting closer. About 100km to the south, ethnic Karenni insurgents, who have put up the most ferocious armed resistance to the coup, have crossed into Shan State. They have joined forces with local militia groups known as People's Defence Forces (PDFs), formed mainly by young men from the area.  In January there was a clash just three kilometres from the lakeside, involving an ethnic Intha PDF. Our boatman was really worried. ""We used to have freedom,"" he says. ""Then it all ended, so suddenly. Now the young people have become angry about the coup."" We travelled to Inle Lake because it was one of only two places the military government would permit us to visit, outside of the main cities of Yangon and Naypyidaw, which are relatively insulated from the civil war.  This was the first visa the BBC had been given since the coup, officially to cover the huge military parade on Armed Forces Day. The letter authorising our visas also warned that we were not allowed to speak to any proscribed groups, these days a large category of people. With new laws criminalising any negative comment about the military government, who was it safe to talk to, and what could they say?  It is impossible not to sense how on edge Myanmar is, even in the places the military believes are safest for its troops. Police officers on the streets nearly all carry automatic weapons. They mainly stay behind their sandbag fortifications, well aware of the danger from drive-by shootings or assassination attempts. And longer road journeys now run the lottery of military checkpoints. You might get waved through, or you might not.  At one well-sandbagged post near Inle our driver was warned by the soldiers not to bring any more foreigners there. It is too dangerous for them, he was told.  We spent two days in Inle, talking to people as discreetly as we could. There were almost no other obviously foreign visitors there; inevitably we stood out. The collapse of tourism has been catastrophic for the local economy. Our hotel was nearly empty. So were many others in the main town of Nyaungshwe. There was no mains power in the town while we were there - the hotel turned the generator on when guests were back there at night. We stopped in Than Taung, where the January clash had happened. It was market day. No-one wanted to talk about the clash. Mostly they complained about rising prices, and about the scarcity of shoppers. ""It's bad here and it's all his fault,"" one group of old men told us, pointing their fingers to the sky - a reference to the coup leader General Min Aung Hlaing. At a silversmith's workshop on the lake, rows of glass display cases lay empty. They were using only one end of the long wooden building for the occasional tourists who showed up. But they had also kept a painted portrait of Aung San Suu Kyi hanging prominently right in the centre of the room, where you could not miss it. Loyalty to ""The Lady"" on Inle Lake runs deep, and in the days when it was possible the locals organised a series of boat protests against the coup that deposed her.  ""We still love her,"" said the workshop manager. ""We are all so sorry about what happened to her."" How much does all this economic distress and quiet defiance trouble the military government? Safe in his fortress-like army enclave in the capital Naypyidaw, it is not clear how much the coup leader Min Aung Hlaing even knows about it.  This strange city, constructed on a vast scale in secret less than 20 years ago, symbolises the siege mentality of Myanmar's military rulers. The cost was immense. The purpose appears to have been to build an impregnable citadel, able to withstand foreign invasions or popular uprisings. In the speech he gave at the Armed Forces Day parade, one of the big set-piece political events of the year, Min Aung Hlaing gave no hint of any doubts he might have over his disastrous decision to seize power.  What we got instead was a recital of familiar old tropes from the army's own mythologised history, in which it alone holds Myanmar together. It was as though nothing had changed since the 1980s and 90s, when the military last ruled supreme, and when it ran the economy down so badly Myanmar's human development indicators were among the lowest in Asia.  Min Aung Hlaing is already showing a fondness for the kinds of vanity projects pursued by some of his predecessors, promoting nuclear power and electric vehicles in a country which can't even provide electricity in its commercial hub Yangon; expensive and polluting generators can be heard running noisily outside every shop. There is an air of sullen normality in Yangon, where there is at least still a functioning economy, but it is one operating at a much lower level than before the coup. Many restaurants and bars have shut. Even the Shangri-La and Strand Hotels, which stayed open throughout the previous period of military rule, are now shuttered and barricaded.  The banking system barely functions. The local currency is trading on the black market at a steep discount to the official rate. And there are still occasional attacks. On the day we arrived in Yangon a lawyer working for the military junta was gunned down and killed. Do the generals really believe they have time to refashion a pseudo-democratic system, as they tried to do 20 years ago, keeping their hands on the levers of power even after an election, and this time without the wild card of the wildly popular Ms Suu Kyi to contend with? It took 24 years, from the last, violent power seizure by the army in 1988, to the final release of Aung San Suu Kyi, and then her agreement to take part in the military-led transition to democracy in 2012. That ushered in the first period of relative political freedom enjoyed by Myanmar since the 1950s.  Min Aung Hlaing seems to understand that he no longer has the luxury of time, even as he dusts off much of the old repressive playbook. He badly needs an election to claim some legitimacy. That that may win him a bit more support from Asian neighbours like Thailand and China, which are less squeamish about his barbaric methods.  At the start of the year he talked about holding one in August, but his regime's failure to control large swathes of Myanmar have made that impossible. The extensive use of air power this year, culminating in the devastating air strike on the village of Pa Zi Gyi last week which killed 168 people, suggests he is in a hurry to crush the resistance to allow some kind of election to be held next year.  The opposition is much stronger and better armed now, driven by a younger generation infuriated by being robbed of freedoms and aspirations they had got used to during the 10-year democratic interlude. Yet the military is sticking to its mission, regardless of the cost, ignoring the promise it gave to neighbouring states to negotiate with its opponents. Outside one of the military bases you see in every town in Myanmar I spotted a large red banner, with the words in English and Burmese, ""Never hesitating. Always ready to sacrifice blood and sweat"".  In their own minds the generals are still fighting a war for national unity that started with Burmese independence in 1948. Everything else comes second. On the day we went there the crowds which used to come to the Phaung Daw Oo pagoda on Inle Lake had diminished, to just two small groups praying for good fortune.  Photographs of Aung San Suu Kyi taken on her visits still have pride of place on the wall, though they hang next to other photos of the military men who deposed her.  A woman who said she was a tour guide struck up a conversation with me. She was dressed immaculately, though there seemed no prospect of customers that day. What did I think of Myanmar, she asked? Wasn't I afraid to come, when it was so dangerous now?  I asked her how people living by the lake felt about the coup. Were they unhappy? She flinched. Look at me, she said, her eyes glistening with tears. Do I look happy? We only wish we could go back to how it was before the coup.  It is impossible to know how many others feel as she does, but it is probably a great many. It will make little difference to the calculation of their military rulers, who appear set to march stubbornly on along the bloody path they have laid down for their country.  Burmese wits like to say that while most countries have an army, in Myanmar the army has a country. And it is not letting go."
economic indicators,Osama's death: What next for al-Qaeda?,2024-09-15,2011-05-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-13257441,"The killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden is a huge blow to the organisation but as guest columnist Ahmed Rashid reports, its decentralised nature means it has the potential to carry out attacks on any number of targets. There have been cheers and jubilation in the US and elsewhere in the West, but capital cities around the world are already bracing for the repercussions of Bin Laden's killing. Hundreds of dedicated and would-be jihadis will be mourning and swearing to give their lives in revenge for his death at the hands of US special forces in the city of Abbottabad.  There is little doubt that the death of Bin Laden is a huge blow to al-Qaeda. But at the same time the network has moved over the years from a highly centralised hierarchy - with recruiting, training and orders all scrutinised by its top leaders - to something much more loose and amorphous.  Today al-Qaeda's philosophy is one man, one bomb. It does not need another 9/11 to make its mark.  One bomb in Times Square in New York placed by a dedicated suicide bomber or a bomb in a New York subway - both attacks were attempted in in recent years -  are big enough indicators that al-Qaeda is alive and kicking.  Al-Qaeda has been a franchise for many years.  Anyone can join it by planting a bomb somewhere. Almost anyone can come to Pakistan or Afghanistan and be offered training with key al-Qaeda allies such as the Pakistani Taliban or the Afghan group headed by Jalaluddin Haqqani.  The facilitator in Pakistan's cities has been Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) - a banned militant group which previously fought in Kashmir but now attacks many different targets and helps al-Qaeda.  After 9/11 it helped hide many senior al-Qaeda figures and it may well have played a major role in hiding Bin Laden.  Pakistan has refused to go up against al-Qaeda allies like Haqqani because they were operating in Afghanistan not Pakistan.  Likewise, allies like LeT are close to Pakistan's intelligence services because their main target is Kashmir and India. Thus the threat is there.  Before 9/11 there were no known al-Qaeda cells in Europe except for the one in Hamburg which launched those attacks.  However, today every single European country has an al-Qaeda cell. Hundreds of Muslims with European passports have travelled to Pakistan's tribal areas for training and returned to Europe.  This video can not be played Frank Gardner on how Bin Laden's death will affect al-Qaeda After the arrest of three Moroccans in Germany last week for planning to plant bombs in public places, German authorities admit that over 200 German citizens have had training in the tribal areas and many of them have returned to Germany.  The same is the case in Britain, Scandinavia, France, Spain and Italy. The fear now of random suicide bombings in subway or train stations in the US or Europe is particularly high.  So is the threat of plane hijackings and bombings of Western military targets and embassies in the Middle East, where they are already a frequent target.  There is also the possibility of the amateur jihadi placing a bomb in a supermarket.  Other kinds of attacks are also likely.  Some may be carried out by dedicated long-term jihadis who have been placed amid Western societies and who now may spring into action with a plot and target that they have been working on for years.  Such lone attackers have been found in the US before, with individuals travelling to the tribal areas for training and then returning to a major US city and trying to carry out an attack. These have usually been foiled by law enforcement agencies at the last moment.  Afghanistan, Pakistan and India are also particularly at risk from more organised attacks. In the former, the al-Qaeda influence among dedicated jihadis like the Haqqani group is still strong.  Pakistan is also extremely vulnerable to attack. Despite a constant spate of denials from the Pakistani authorities - which have now been proven wrong - al-Qaeda recently had its base in Pakistan. Al-Qaeda and its affiliated Pakistani groups will be determined to launch a bombing campaign in Pakistan in memory of Bin Laden. This will heighten tensions in a country that is already beset with power shortages and an economic crisis.  Finally al-Qaeda and its allies may find this the right moment to create major divisions between India and Pakistan by launching another Mumbai-style attack on Indian territory.  This would aim to take the heat off the hunt for al-Qaeda members in Pakistan. The Middle East also remains a big vacuum for al-Qaeda because of the ongoing Arab revolt. It is still a prime target for al-Qaeda as it seeks to gain influence and clout among the new generation of leaders who have emerged in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria and the Gulf states. But this task will be much more difficult after Bin Laden's death. Clearly Bin Laden's death will give intelligence agencies around the world many clues and leads to catch other leaders, but al-Qaeda will not disappear overnight. Ahmed Rashid's book, Taliban, was updated and reissued recently on the 10th anniversary of its publication. His latest book is Descent into Chaos - The US and the Disaster in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia."
economic indicators,GM shares jump on market return,2024-09-15,2010-11-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-11782261,"This video can not be played The New York exchange opened to the sound of a car engine Shares in General Motors (GM) have risen 3.6% on the first day of trading following the carmaker's record public share offering. Shares closed at $34.19 in New York from a start of $33, although they did reach a high of $35.60 during the day. GM raised $20.1bn through its offering, making it the largest share sale in the US to date. President Barack Obama said the firm was on track to recover the government money spent on bailing it out. The amount raised could rise to a world record $23.1bn if underwriters exercise an option to sell more shares. Surprisingly strong investor demand had allowed the carmaker to lift the price of the shares on offer to $33, external from the $26 it had initially hoped for. GM is returning to the market after a $50bn government bail-out. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 173 points at 11,183, a rise of 1.6%. Mr Obama said: ""Today, one of the toughest tales of the recession took another big step toward becoming a success story. ""American taxpayers are now positioned to recover more than my administration invested in GM, and that's a good thing."" Canada, which pumped in $10bn and owns 12% of the stock, said it too would seek to recover some of its investment by selling part of its stake. The day's trading began on Wall Street when GM chief executive Dan Akerson rang the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange. ""There's a lot of work to do, but today is the beginning of the new company,"" said Mark Reuss, GM's North American president. Government officials said the company's strong market debut showed they had made the right choice in rescuing the carmaker. ""This is a bit better than people had been projecting. As to a year ago, it's not even in the same ballpark,"" Ron Bloom, the Treasury official in charge of the GM investment told Reuters.  ""A year ago, people said, 'You have no exit, you have no strategy. This company is not fixed'."" The carmaker has raised $20.1bn from the sale of the shares. However, an over-allotment option, which will be settled over the next 30 days, would add $3bn to that figure, taking GM beyond the $22.1bn raised by the Agricultural Bank of China's market launch. The share sale, known as an initial public offering (IPO), will allow the US government reduce its current 61% stake in the company to as low as 33%. GM returned to profit this year for the first time since 2004. The company made $5bn during the first nine months of this year. Scott Painter from the US car comparison site Truecar.com believes the IPO is a sign of how well the economic recovery is going. ""I think GM having a strong IPO and pricing it at the high end of the range certainly speaks well of America and confidence in America, and GM is a really good indicator of everything that we've been through over the last couple of years and how the recovery is working out,"" he said.

economic indicators,NI economy continues to contract says Ulster Bank,2024-09-15,2022-10-10,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-63176368,"The Northern Ireland economy continued to contract in September, according to a survey by the Ulster Bank. Every month the bank asks firms across the private sector about issues such as staffing levels and order books. The survey is considered a reliable indicator of economic performance and last month NI firms reported a sharper fall in activity. This was before any turbulence caused by the chancellor's ""mini budget"". All sectors reported a fall in activity for the fifth month in a row. The one positive was that employment continued to rise, but the rate of job creation was only marginal. Survey respondents said worsening economic conditions, falling consumer confidence and rising prices were reasons for the decline. The bank's chief economist in Northern Ireland, Richard Ramsey, said: ""Services firms reported the sharpest increases in their cost base, with wages and energy costs now increasingly at the forefront of inflationary pressures."" ""The one positive in the latest report is employment with firms notching up their 19th consecutive monthly rise in staffing levels. However, the expected further reductions in business activity will no doubt weigh more on hiring intentions in the months ahead,"" he added. The latest survey was carried out before the chancellor's mini-budget announcement.  Mr Ramsey said the plan was unlikely to have the desired outcome.  He said: ""Firms may be relieved to see energy cost pressures easing, accompanied by much-needed government support. But borrowing costs have now moved rapidly in the opposite direction."" ""It's hard to see the chancellor's much-desired growth coming any time soon,"" he added."
economic indicators,How the US power grid is a target for the far-right,2024-09-15,2023-03-10,By Mike Wendling,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64832129,"Far-right groups are increasingly talking about attacking the US power grid to cause chaos and advance their cause, terrorism experts say.  The warnings come as the founder of a neo-Nazi group and a woman appeared in court on Friday charged with plotting to attack power installations around Baltimore.  Brandon Russell, 27, and Sarah Clendaniel, 34, both pleaded not guilty. They face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. In messages revealed in court filings, Ms Clendaniel described their alleged plot as ""legendary"" and hoped it ""would completely destroy the whole city"". The pair were arrested before the alleged attack was carried out. Prosecutors said thousands would have been left without power if it had gone ahead. Attacks against infrastructure are a long-standing obsession of far-right and white nationalist groups, and they are increasingly being discussed in extremist spaces online. Veryan Khan, president and CEO of the Terrorism Research & Analysis Consortium (Trac) says attacks are ""not a matter of if, it's when"".  In addition to the alleged Baltimore plot, investigators are looking into several recent attacks on power installations, including incidents in North Carolina, Oregon and Washington state.  The North Carolina attack, in Moore County in early December, knocked out power to 35,000 people for several days. Nobody has been arrested and the investigation is ongoing.  Authorities say there's no known connection between the alleged Baltimore plot and the North Carolina attack, and the motive for most of the other attacks is unknown. Mr Russell is the founder of Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi group that has been linked to murders, bombings and plots in the United States and other countries. It is banned in the UK and Canada. He spent time in prison on explosive charges, and while locked up met Ms Clendaniel, who was convicted of armed robbery, according to an indictment. Once they were released, the pair allegedly began planning to attack electricity substations in the Baltimore area, looking at openly available material about power stations and attempting to obtain a gun. But - prosecutors claim - a person who they thought was a potential co-conspirator was actually an FBI source. In 2020, five men, including three former US Marines, were indicted on weapons and conspiracy charges. Authorities said they had plotted to attack the power grid during a meeting in Ohio. The following year, three white nationalists pleaded guilty to plotting to attack power installations.  Atomwaffen and many other white nationalist groups subscribe to a philosophy known as accelerationism, which experts believe may have motivated the attacks - and may drive plots for additional ones. Accelerationism is a belief that society is inherently unstable and that individuals and groups should aim to increase that instability and push for collapse in order to revolutionise society. It's not exclusive to far-right groups, and does not necessarily involve violence, but it is used with particular motivational effect in white supremacist circles, says Ms Khan of Trac.  ""Their main point is to collapse society so they can rebuild for the white man,"" she says.  Bennett Clifford, of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, co-wrote a paper last year that analysed jihadist and white nationalist attacks, and concluded that since 2016, ""white supremacist plots targeting energy systems dramatically increased in frequency"". The report tallied 11 cases of white nationalists arrested and charged in federal court with planning attacks on the energy sector after 2020.  ""The chance that someone is able to pull off an attack of this nature is substantial,"" Mr Bennett says, ""and more substantial than it has been in recent years."" One key indicator is that online chatter has been rising sharply.  ""In terms of noise level, the pounding of the drum is almost deafening,"" Ms Khan said.  Last summer a loosely organised white nationalist, eco-fascist group called Terrorgram issued a document called The Hard Reset. The BBC has obtained a copy. The title is a direct reference to The Great Reset, a World Economic Forum post-pandemic economic recovery plan. The documents combines violent propaganda and instructions on how to carry out attacks. It includes prominent sections on power installations, rail and roads, and other infrastructure. ""Even before the publication came out, we were seeing memes about critical infrastructure, including how to identify what to attack, and how to carry out an attack,"" says Stacey Casas, specialty teams manager at The Counterterrorism Group, a security firm. ""We're at a high level of concern."" There were about 170 instances of attacks, vandalism or suspicious activity around US power installations in 2022, a rise from about 100 the previous year, according to Department of Energy records.  Those figures include vandalism, criminal activity unrelated to extremism, and other motives, according to a department spokesperson, adding that the department works with utility companies to help assess threats against the country's 75,000 electricity substations. Deliberate attacks against the power grid are just one threat the authorities are focused on along with the possibility of cyber-attacks, natural disasters and climate change.  Government and law enforcement officials have repeatedly issued warnings, including in a Department of Homeland Security advisory issued shortly before the North Carolina attack."
economic indicators,What's driving Chile's protests?,2024-09-15,2019-10-21,By Reality Check,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-50123494,"Demonstrators across Chile have been expressing their anger at high levels of inequality and the cost of living. So, we've taken a look at whether the difference between rich and poor in Chile is actually rising and how this inequality compares with other countries. First, let's compare Chile's inequality with other countries. We've looked at the Gini index, the most widely used international measure of inequality - for which the higher the number, the greater the inequality. This shows Chile ranks as one of the most unequal country among a group of 30 of the world's wealthiest nations.  ""It has been a highly unequal country for years,"" says Javier Sajuria, a senior lecturer in politics at Queen Mary University. He says the data indicates inequality has actually been falling but possibly ""not fast enough"", which could in part explain the outpouring of anger. Another way to consider inequality is by looking at the incomes of the richest and poorest.  In 2006, the richest 20% earned 10 times more than the poorest 20%, according to a government survey.  In 2017, that figure had fallen to 8.9 - indicating the income gap between rich and poor had in fact narrowed slightly. ""This isn't about political parties"" one protestor, Constanza Gonzalez, told BBC News. ""People are angry and this was a thing that had been coming for quite a long time."" The Chilean government conducts a national household survey every two years and provides a measure of how many in the country are facing poverty. This includes people who struggle to buy enough food to survive as well as those spending a large proportion of their family income on food.  These figures suggest a consistent and significant fall in poverty over the past decade. Real wages (adjusted for inflation) have been increasing by about 4% over the last five years, according to government statistics. The median (middle) monthly wage in 2018 was 400,000 Chilean pesos, about $550. Close to half the country earns this much. The economic indicators we've looked at here suggest improving economic conditions for many in Chile over the past decade. But it's also a country with one of the highest levels of inequality among the world's industrialised countries.  Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter"
economic indicators,US stocks suffer worst week in a decade,2024-09-15,2018-12-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46654064,"US stocks suffered one of the worst weekly falls in a decade as trade tensions with China, interest rate rises and a possible government shutdown rattled markets. All three indexes closed lower, with the technology-focused Nasdaq down 20% since its peak, placing it in so-called ""bear market"" territory.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded its biggest weekly drop in percentage terms since 2008. The S&P 500 fell 7% for the week. It is the biggest weekly percentage drop since August 2011 while the Nasdaq's 8.36% decline is the sharpest since November 2008. The Dow Jones fell 6.8% during the week. After years of gains, US investors are fleeing stocks, worried about a range of factors likely to hit corporate profits, including slowing economic growth domestically and abroad. Earlier this week, the US Federal Reserve lifted the interest rate and signalled that it would continue to rise next year, albeit at a slower pace. The Fed also cut its forecasts for economic growth in 2019 to 2.3%, down from the 2.5% predicted in September. Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets, said: ""China is cooling and the eurozone is slowing down, and some of the economic indicators from the US have been a bit soft recently, but yet the Fed hiked rates and suggested that two more interest rate hikes were lined up for 2019.""  Elliot Clarke, economist at Westpac, the banking group, added: ""Political brinkmanship in Washington is further heightening market uncertainty."" Markets were also unnerved by comments from President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro who told the Nikkei newspaper that it would be ""difficult"" for the US and China to reach a long lasting trade agreement that would end the tensions between the two. Share trading started Friday on an upswing, boosted by stronger-than-expected quarterly sales at sportswear giant Nike. Investors also appeared soothed after John Williams, president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said the central bank would consider market turmoil as it weighs future interest rate decisions. However, selling set in by afternoon with some of the major technology firms - that led the market's rally earlier this year - experiencing some of the most bruising falls. Facebook and Twitter both tumbled more than 6%, Amazon dropped more than 5%, and Apple and Microsoft slipped more than 3%. For the day,  the Nasdaq index fell almost 3%, the S&P 500 tumbled more than 2%, and the Dow slid 1.8%. Some economists argue that the steep Wall Street sell-off does not reflect conditions in the wider economy, which grew at an annual pace of 3.4% in the most recent quarter. Consumer sentiment also remains strong, according to the most recent data. However, the fears on Wall Street could spread in the event of a prolonged downturn, analysts warned. ""If these expectations begin to shift, then we would expect to see more downward pressure on sentiment and spending patterns in early 2019,""  Oxford Economics said."
economic indicators,Kenya's election: Your questions answered,2024-09-15,2017-05-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39810869,"Ahead of Kenya's elections in 8 August, we asked you what questions you wanted us to report on.  We put some of them to our expert guests on BBC Africa's Kenya Election Watch podcast.  It's a 15-minute show with three segments: Main interview, fact-checking, and audience questions.   Listen to the final episode: Kenya Election Watch special: Everything you need to know about the elections. Here are some of the questions we have already answered:   Kenya's political leaders have always relied on the backing of members of their ethnic group and it will be no different this time around. It is therefore not surprising that some political analysts have been looking at the voter registration in the candidates' ethnic strongholds as an indicator of who may have an upper hand. Kenya's five major ethnic groups make up about 70% of the population. In order to win the presidential race a candidate needs to forge ethnic alliances to get a majority of that vote. Ethnicity also plays a role in the MP, senate and local votes. However, President Uhuru Kenyatta told the Financial Times that he expects this election to be fought on economic issue, externals, particularly the rising cost of food. The opposition has accused the government for failing to anticipate food shortages resulting from the ongoing drought. It has also accused the government of creating an artificial food shortage to allow affiliated businessmen to use the emergency period to import maize, a staple food, duty-free into the country.  The government has denied the allegations and has since moved to subsidise maize flour.  Mr Kenyatta could have a point about voters being motivated by issues other than  ethnic affiliation.  A poll in April found that 28% of voters were undecided.   President Kenyatta has said that Kenyan troops will remain in Somalia as part of its peacekeeping mission until peace and stability are restored. Kenyan troops are in Somalia as part of a regional force Kenya has 3,600 troops serving under the UN mission in Somalia (Amisom), having been deployed in 2011 in pursuit of Islamist militants al-Shabab after a series of cross-border attacks.  But opposition coalition Nasa has said it would withdraw Kenyan troops from Somalia, saying they were needed back home.  Since the 2011 intervention, al-Shabab militants have perpetrated several attacks in Kenya, including the high-profile attacks in Westgate mall in the capital, Nairobi in 2013 and the killing of 148 students at Garissa University.  In January last year, some 150 troops were reportedly killed after al-Shabab militants overran a Kenyan military base. Others were captured and have appeared on the militants' propaganda videos.  The Kenyan government has not officially acknowledged the number of soldiers killed or kidnapped in the attack.  A new team of election officials took office in January after the previous team was accused of mismanaging the 2013 election.  The judgement on the credibility of the election will have to be passed after 8 August.  Mr Chebukati says his team has prepared well to overseee the election The electoral commission says it is working on some of the challenges that characterised the 2013 elections, such as a lack of staff training on using the voting technology and delays in getting election materials.    The commission has acquired a system known at the Kenya Integrated Election Management System (KIEMS) which is currently being used to verify voters' registration and will be used on election day to verify the eligibility of voters, tally results and transmit them to a national tallying centre.  Electoral commission chairman Wafula Chebukati told a press briefing in May that the staff were interacting with the KIEMS machine months ahead of the election, unlike the previous election when staff were not given time to familiarise themselves with the new technology.  In February, 65% of those polled said they had confidence in the electoral body.  Social media is playing a bigger role in this election than in the past.  Kenya has a very active and loosely connected Twitter community who identity as #KOT (Kenyans on Twitter). Their influence can be seen during the campaign period where they push the agenda of their political favourites.  Political parties have also hired social media influencers who have big followings to push their messages.  Others have a dedicated team of ""social media ninjas"" whose role is to create a positive narrative and obfuscate any discussion that is deemed as damaging the campaign they are backing.  The parties and candidates are also creating short video explainers for their campaign talking points, memes and hashtags to push their agendas and attack their opponents. Some politicians are also using Twitter bots to exaggerate the numbers of their followers.  The mainstream media is also using Facebook, You Tube and Twitter to broadcast political rallies and special programming.  The leading presidential candidates have been especially busy. President Kenyatta has been sharing messages of unity and development: While opposition leader Raila Odinga has been saying that he has the backing of 10 million voters. Mr Odinga's campaign is essentially saying they are favourites to win the election because there are 19 million eligible voters.  The minister for internal security has been critical of the opposition's rhetoric, saying it was creating anxiety in the country, but Mr Kenyatta's party has also been pushing the message that it will win the election by garnering 70% of the vote. Thousands of candidates are competing for various seats but not all are getting much coverage on mainstream media, a situation that has led some of them, especially independent candidates, to use social media platforms like Facebook Live to engage with voters directly.  Kenya does not have an election campaign funding law. An attempt by the electoral commission to introduce one last year was defeated by MPs.  The commission had proposed caps for different seats:  President: $50m Governors: $4m   Members of National Assembly ( MPs and Senators): $290,000 Members of County Assembly: $97,000  The absence of the law means candidates are currently free to spend as much as they want. According to the privately owned Daily Nation, ""most of the money is spent on logistics and advertisements but many candidates and parties also bribe voters"".  It reports that in the 2013 election, then opposition coalition Cord spent in excess of $50m (£40m) while the governing Jubilee Party spent more than $100m to run its presidential campaign.  Politicians raise money from businessmen and some hold fundraisers. Opposition parties however accuse the ruling party of using state resources in its campaigns. Ken Opalo, from Georgetown University in the US, says that while there is likely to be some trouble, it will not be on the scale seen 10 years ago, which left more than 1,000 people dead and about 600,000 displaced from their homes. ""I am not too worried about the national elections. The real action will likely be at the county level,"" he said.  ""There will most certainly be violence. But again, that will be more a reflection of what is at stake, rather than some descent into complete chaos and state failure."" This is a view shared by Nic Cheeseman, professor of democracy at the UK's University of Birmingham and a commentator on Kenyan politics. He says ""disorderly party primaries are a reason to be concerned, but that they may not lead to greater conflict come election day"". What chaotic primaries tell us about election Kenya has maintained steady economic growth rate in the past five years, averaging 5% per year.  However, rising prices of basic goods like milk, bread and maize flour have pushed inflation up to 12%, and many Kenyan families say they are now struggling to get by.  Kenyans have been using the hashtag #CostOfLivingKe, external to share the costs of basic items and how they are adjusting their lifestyles.  ""Every election year, the economy also experiences a shrinkage and that's no different this year as investors wait out on the election period,"" Kwame Owino, CEO of the Institute of Economic Affairs told the BBC.  ""Some companies are currently cutting down employment, but not in big numbers, and the informal sector remains the biggest employer,"" he added.   Kenya got $1bn in new investments in 2014 following some reforms like reducing the costs of doing business and bureaucracy, investment in infrastructure and lowering visa costs which has encouraged tourism.  The economy has however been strained by corruption, heightened political tension and state-controlled bank interest rates - a measure meant to reduce borrowing costs that has failed to deliver.  The UN's development agency (UNDP) says Kenya has the highest unemployment rate in the region, with four out of 10 Kenyans out of work.   Mr Owino says that dispassionate voters may be guided by who they think will best serve their economic interests.  In its 2016 report Transparency International ranked Kenya at position 145 out of 176 countries. It blamed Kenya's low ranking on the incompetence and ineffectiveness of anti-corruption agencies, saying that the failure to punish individuals implicated in graft had been a major stumbling block. Anti-corruption campaigner John Githongo has called President Uhuru Kenyatta's administration ""the most corrupt in Kenya's history"". Mr Kenyatta has, however, said his anti-corruption efforts were being undermined by the courts, who were slowing prosecutions and the anti-corruption agency, who he said were ""sluggish"". Mr Githongo cites several reported scandals involving alleged inflation of costs of projects and payments to phantom companies.  In 2015, Mr Kenyatta suspended and eventually removed five ministers and other high-ranking officials on corruption allegations. Another minister resigned after public pressure.  Opposition members have also been named in several scandals but some have accused the government of scapegoating.  Constitutional bodies set up to fight corruption have been accused of being partisan and lacking independence.  Kenyan political analyst Barrack Muluka blames ordinary Kenyans for the corruption problem, saying that they are blinded by their ethnicity: ""A government can steal as much as it wants and Kenyans will be happy as long as it's 'our thieves'.""  He points at the April party primaries where candidates of questionable integrity and those accused of being involved in corruption won their races.  Mr Githongo, calls it ""normalisation of the absurdity"".  He says that theft has become normal: ""Those we used to call thieves are now hustlers,"" he says.

economic indicators,The untold good news story of America today,2024-09-15,2018-06-17,By Tom Geoghegan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44349211,"Political bickering has long been a roadblock to getting big things done in the US but a grassroots movement getting few headlines could yet herald a new American age of change. A green giant in a loin cloth would seem an unlikely indicator for what some describe as a revolution under way in the heart of America. But the Jolly Green Giant statue on Highway 169 in rural Minnesota wears a 48-inch (1.2m) smile for a reason. Accompanied by the slogan Dream Big, he typifies a sense of hope and renewal in the nearby city of Blue Earth that is quietly being echoed across parts of the US. As the country continues its long recovery from recession, there are signs that a much deeper shift is happening at a local level, the seeds of which were sown years ago. Indicators far more subtle than job numbers suggest a flourishing of entrepreneurship, collaboration and problem-solving, away from the gaze of national media. After five years spent visiting dozens of towns, The Atlantic writer James Fallows and his wife Deborah have written a book Our Towns which paints a portrait of renewal, a story at odds with the well-documented gridlock of higher levels of government.  Fallows says that in several areas - civic engagement, returning talent, growth of tech start-ups, downtown revitalisation, an openness to immigrants and thriving libraries - local America seems to be flourishing. He's not alone. Another book called The New Localism says a growing number of US cities are addressing the problems of post-industrial America in increasingly imaginative and flexible ways - succeeding where bigger government fails.  There is also optimism from the world of tech. After visiting communities in the heart of the country, in a huge drive to help entrepreneurs, internet pioneer Steve Case, co-founder of AOL, says the future looks bright. ""I believe that we are entering the Third Wave of the internet, a period in which entrepreneurs will leverage technology to revolutionise major sectors of the economy - healthcare, financial services, agriculture and others,"" he says. These deep, structural changes and bursts of creativity appear to be especially evident in cities and towns in the Midwest, long derided as ""flyover country"".  Now it's more like ""flying back home country"" as thousands of people return to their hometowns from bigger coastal cities, bringing with them new ideas and a drive to succeed.  Let's take a closer look. While the prairies that surround it are characteristically flat, Blue Earth - population 3,300 - has experienced more than a few bumps in the road. The agricultural crisis of the 1980s caused by ballooning debt and falling incomes led to bankruptcies and an exodus from rural communities. This was especially felt in the Midwest and Blue Earth. Then out-of-town superstores and online shopping came along. It was a succession of body blows for Blue Earth, which is named after the traces of blue residue found in the banks of its river. The town lost a fifth of its population. But the feeling now on Main Street, where boarded up premises are slowly being replaced by new businesses, is that it is bouncing back. College graduates are coming home again in their 20s and 30s, rather than heading to the big cities, reversing the years-long talent exodus. And some are returning with new business ideas and a determination to revive the fortunes of the town. What's happening where you live? This story came about because of reader response to our Ask America newsletter - where BBC readers are sharing stories and asking questions about America. Interested in receiving the newsletter? Send us an email at  AskAmerica@bbc.co.uk One resident who never went away is Blue Earth's green and famous 60ft (18m) landmark. The town has long had a Green Giant canning factory producing the famous tins of peas and corn, and the giant was erected in the 1970s to entice drivers into the town from the interstate highway.  It worked - the visitors' book near the statue suggests people from all over the world have dropped by for a photo. But very few drove a further five minutes into the city centre. So the change about to be wrought at the giant's feet could be a portent for the exciting future of the town itself.  A few yards from the giant's size 78 shoes is a construction site where a welcome centre is being built to showcase the town. The hope is that in future people will do more than stop for a selfie.  And like a trail of breadcrumbs in a Brothers Grimm fairytale, 16 smaller statues of the giant's younger sidekick Little Green Sprout are being designed and made by local artists, and placed around town. Main Street is fresh from a facelift - the council reconfigured the street and offered grants to businesses to improve their shopfronts. There is a new police station, a new water tower and swimming pool. In the works is a housing development targeting young families and a new sewage plant. The new ""British"" roundabouts on the highway right under the giant's nose are another sign of investment, this time by the state of Minnesota. But they stoked such confusion at first that ""there wasn't three days when there wasn't a truck stuck on the top of it"", according to one local. No such disorientation about the most ambitious plan to invigorate Main Street. If one woman's vision comes to fruition, three abandoned buildings known as The Three Sisters will be converted into a space for artists, tech entrepreneurs, a coffee shop, wine bar, Italian restaurant and bakery.  Janie Hanson, 36, grew up on a nearby farm, and her family instilled in her the benefit of hard work and philanthropy. She left the area to pursue three degrees, including an Ivy League university education in New York. But she has returned to Minnesota and wants to help transform her hometown, using her non-profit organisation Connect The Grey. ""I hope this project will be a catalyst to invigorate the community,"" she says. ""I want to provide the platform for people with undiscovered talent the opportunity to pursue it."" The council agreed on Monday to give Hanson's $2.5m (£1.9m) plan the go-ahead, and to sell the site to her for $1.  There are many others brimming with ideas in Blue Earth, many of whom came back from elsewhere with a determination to reinvent and survive. There's John, a construction manager who bought a derelict building on Main Street and made it into a Norwegian brewery, after teaching himself how to do it. Graphic designer Becki opened a new studio and art gallery that also sells high-end wool yarn and she holds weekly ""stitch and bitch"" nights for women. Food blogger Stacie left Blue Earth to study nutrition and returned to live two blocks from Main Street, but now wants to start healthy living classes for local people. Dietician Brooke married a professional ice hockey player and lived in Czech Republic, Germany and France, but has moved back and set up her own business. And Bruce has his furniture store at the northern end of Main Street, with a cafe adjoining. If you're wondering why his vast space has some strangely curved walls, it's because it used to be a skating rink and a bowling alley, another change borne of survival as the town's population shrank. Their qualities could not be more at odds with the image conveyed by national politics. Year after year, the US government fights over how to fix the immigration system or overhaul the ailing healthcare system. It is unable to repair the country's decrepit roads and bridges. And it has to shut down when it can't agree on a budget. Surveys suggest Americans believe political gridlock in Washington has even hurt the US economy. And economists don't disagree. But two books published in the last few weeks say American cities, big and small, are filling the gap, getting things done in a way the authors believe could spark a new economic resurgence. You may also like: Fallows is convinced the country at a local level is in a state of renewal that defies the predominant narrative of political dysfunction and inaction. His book reveals a proliferation of experiments and adaptations in cities like Holland in Michigan and Sioux Falls in South Dakota that cause him to think America has become ""more like itself again"". Serious though the country's problems are, he says, the future is brighter than you would ever guess from national news coverage which fixates on the ""trench warfare"" of politics. Parts of the nation are flourishing, he says, as distinctly American qualities come to the fore.  ""The fundamental American bargain, for better and worse, has been a belief in fluidity, mobility, departure from convention, a willingness to overturn tradition,"" he says. ""This bias in American history is why the American countryside and cityscape looks less elegant than the long-protected pastureland of England or the villages of France. It's also been a crucial part of the openness and opportunity of the society, in cultural ways as well as economic."" He recognises that his country has fallen short of - and even contradicted - these ideals at times in its history, and the country still has immense challenges to overcome.  But the vibrancy of local America is an untold story, says Fallows, partly because there is a natural scepticism in the media and an inclination when visiting towns to always ask people about the national political drama. In Blue Earth, the city council members do not even govern as Democrats or Republicans. And political parties were never mentioned in conversation.  People seemed to be universally happy about where the town is heading, while pointing out the things they think it desperately needs - healthy food options, more things to do at night, more ""life"" on Main Street. ""I really do feel that there's a resurgence right now,"" says Chuck Hunt, managing editor of the weekly newspaper, the Faribault County Register. ""I can't pinpoint one thing but the city council has helped, it's progressive and aggressive."" The renewal of town and city centres across the US is accelerating now, says Patrice Frey of Main Street America, a programme which helps to breathe life into commercial areas. It says it has generated $75bn in public and private investment since 1980. How cities are rolling up their sleeves and getting things done is the subject of New Localism, a book co-authored by Bruce Katz of the Brookings Institution. ""For the past 40 years, we have seen an evolution of urban problem-solving that's becoming more sophisticated and more impactful with every passing year,"" he says. This ""localism"" first emerged in the 1980s, he says, when cities began to realise that the ""cavalry wasn't coming"" from federal and state government, and they were going to have to tackle their problems on their own. City leaders are discovering that problem-solving from the bottom up - in partnerships with others from the worlds of business, technology and education - is more democratic and effective, says Katz. The 20th Century was very much about hierarchical systems that were segmented and bureaucratic, he says, while the 21st Century is going to be ""networked, distributed and led by cities"". Instead of a decision made in Washington and delivered by a government department in the form of a one-size-fits-all policy, there might be a list of possible solutions from - for example - a collaboration between a mayor's office, a university and a local enterprise group.  This trend is accelerating and moving outside the US, says Katz. In his book, Copenhagen, Hamburg and Kings Cross in London are held up as good examples. It comes at a time when a new generation of leaders - with the retirement of baby boomers - is coming to the fore, according to Pete Peterson of the school of public policy at Pepperdine University in California. These millennials are more collaborative, he says, and want to create a new narrative from what they see at the national level. Blue Earth does not have to look to Copenhagen for inspiration.  Kansas City, 380 miles (611km) south in Missouri, has seen a tech boom, a massive investment in the downtown and the installation of high-speed internet, courtesy of Google Fiber.  The story of the city's reinvention began 20 years ago with a huge cash injection in the downtown, says Mike Mayer of Cushman & Wakefield, who has negotiated leases in the city worth nearly $2bn. First Fridays began as a monthly attraction to showcase the city's growing arts scene, and that now brings 10,000 people to the city. The $100m KC Streetcar, a light rail system, opened in 2016 and that gave the city a sense of pride and helped to attract millennials. A new $323m convention centre with 800 hotel rooms is due to open in 2020. Six years later, this sports-mad city could be hosting World Cup soccer matches. More and more outside money is pouring in, and the city's success is finally getting attention nationwide. ""There's still some pleasant surprise about the momentum here. It's a tad under the radar. They [investors] think it's a city of barbecues and jazz, and they come here and see it's got more legs,"" says Mayer. One of the driving forces has been the Kauffman Foundation, which focuses on projects that encourage entrepreneurship and support education.  Matt Bramlette left a career in advertising to set up his own company three years ago - Mid Coast Modern sells handmade and home goods, with the support of local artists. The name is a pointed reference - typically, people get all their cool stuff from the east and west coasts, he says.  Having lived in Kansas City nearly all his life, Bramlette has seen it go from a ""ghost-town"" to one that's heading in the same direction as Portland, Oregon, or Austin, Texas.  He says the city has fostered an environment that is hugely supportive of local entrepreneurs, with lots of networking opportunities and a university six-week class for start-ups.  ""Because there are so many entrepreneurs here, there is a sense of community that a bigger city may lack. We even support stores that are competitors and hope they do the same for us."" It helps that there is so much enthusiasm for locally made goods. ""I'm not sure we could have survived without the local pride."" Helped no end by the Royals winning baseball's World Series three years ago, he adds. There is no doubt there's a boom going on in small and midsized cities, especially away from the coasts, says leading investor and entrepreneur Steve Case. He has visited 38 cities across the US with his company Revolution as it helps people with bright ideas to build their businesses, and he's seen ""exciting progress"" in each one.  The return of individuals from coastal cities to places where they grew up - the boomerang effect - is part of that, he says.  ""Due to the renaissance occurring in rising cities, tech talent that previously saw Palo Alto or New York City as the only places where they could be successful are instead finding that they're able to launch and scale their companies with less overhead and a lower cost of living between the coasts.""  How far can this go? A new book by photographer Niko Kallianiotis about communities in Pennsylvania provides a sharp reminder that the recovery is leaving many behind. But Bruce Katz sees an enormous opportunity in the growing strength of progressively minded cities to lower the achievement gap across racial, ethnic and class lines. An ""opportunity zone"" tax incentive in the new tax law will entice investors and focus minds on upgrading the skills of young adults in deprived neighbourhoods, he says. The move enables states to designate low-income neighbourhoods and qualify them for favourable capital gains treatment. ""Mayors and their allies will leverage these private investments for dramatic effect, not just on economic growth but on economic growth that brings more and more lower-income residents into the labour force.  ""So we are about to see a burst of institutional innovation and private investment in the US which will take New Localism to a whole other level.""  Exciting times.  There is very little trace of revolution on Main Street in Blue Earth, however, where the only movement one Thursday afternoon is the flutter of the American flags. But the seeds of change are here, and in the town's cafe, Brooke Ziegler Hussey explains how. ""In small-town America you find the opposite of the problems of big government. They want to work together and help each other here. That's a huge difference."" Yes, Blue Earth has a long way to go on a path back to prosperity but like America, baby steps can lead to giant strides."
economic indicators,Low wind speeds and Covid slow economic growth,2024-09-15,2021-11-24,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-59402132,"Low wind speeds powering wind turbines and Covid absences from school contributed to a slowdown of economic growth in September. The latest estimated Scottish government figures show output across the economy rose by 0.4% across the month. That was helped upwards by the dominant services sector, which accounts for around three-quarters of the economy. It was up 0.5%, while construction also returned to growth.  However, the production sector fell 0.9% - and 3.7% over the July to September quarter, much of that due to lower electricity generation. Total output in September remained 1.1% percentage points below the peak pre-pandemic output level. Scottish economic recovery to September was slightly weaker than the UK's, which saw September growth of 0.6%, putting it 0.6 percentage points behind the peak reached in February 2020. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes and Scottish Secretary Alister Jack welcomed the figures. Ms Forbes said: ""These latest GDP figures underscore Scotland's continuing economic recovery from coronavirus."" She pledged the forthcoming Scottish budget would help households and businesses across the country, and would also see the launch of a strategy to create green, fair and sustainable jobs over the next decade.   The finance secretary added: ""Challenges remain, but the indicators show we are in a strong position from which to drive Scotland's economic recovery and renewal."" Mr Jack said: ""Economic activity levels in Scotland and the UK more widely are moving in the right direction but there is much more to be done as we recover from the pandemic. ""That's why we are levelling up right across the UK."" He said this will be helped by the announcement of £41bn per year for the Scottish government in the autumn budget. Mr Jack added: ""We remain focussed on a sustained recovery."" Estimates for Scottish output, or Gross Domestic Product, during July and August were revised downwards by government statisticians. That means the third quarter of the year saw only modest growth of 0.8%.  That was a sharp fall in growth since the second quarter - April to June, at 5.6% - when businesses and education were reopening as the winter lockdown was eased. The September figures are so far classified as ""experimental"", meaning they are the first estimate.  The Scottish figures do not include offshore oil and gas production."
economic indicators,How have things changed in Afghanistan?,2024-09-15,2021-04-22,By Reality Check team,https://www.bbc.com/news/56779160,"With the withdrawal of US and Nato troops nearing completion, direct foreign intervention in Afghanistan is ending after nearly 20 years. US President Joe Biden has said that Afghans are going to have decide their own future. We look at the current situation, and at what has changed since foreign troops entered the country in late 2001. Fighting has intensified in recent weeks. The Taliban have been on the offensive, taking territory and there have been reports of Afghan government personnel in some areas fleeing their advance. The UN warned in June that the conflict could escalate as foreign forces pull out. The first three months of this year were already more violent than the same period in 2020, going by US and UN data. The US body which oversees reconstruction efforts in the country says that from the start of January to the end of March this year, enemy attacks were up by 37%. In the first three months of this year, the UN says the number of civilians killed and injured was significantly higher than the same period a year ago, with increasing numbers of women and children among them. The majority of these were attributed to insurgent groups such as the Taliban. In 2020, more than 3,000 civilians died - the seventh year in a row this had happened. The UN also noted a spate of targeted killings last year, often of figures from civil society, the media, the judiciary and the civilian administration. However, the total number of civilian casualties in 2020 - deaths and injuries - was down on the totals for 2019 and 2018. Data from the country's national statistics agency shows that although the majority working in government departments and major public bodies are still men, the number of women working has grown in the past two decades. The figures show that in 2004, there were just over 51,200 women working in these sectors. That had risen to nearly 87,000 by 2018 (the last year for which data is available). And the percentage rise in the number of women employees was higher than for men (69% compared with about 41%). A recent US official report on gender equality said there were now ""unprecedented"" numbers of women in public office, with legal minimum quotas set for women in the national parliament, as well as in provincial and district councils. It also pointed to a big increase in women police personnel - from only 180 in 2005 to 3,560 by 2019 - as well as an increase in the proportion of women judges from 5% to 13% between 2007 and 2018.  Human Rights Watch says that the number of children in school at all levels has increased from 0.9 million in 2001 to 9.2 million in 2017 - with 39% of them girls. UN data shows that by 2012, the figure for girls enrolled in primary education had grown to more than 40%, although it's come down slightly since then. The UN agency responsible for providing humanitarian aid to children, Unicef, said in a 2019 report that ""girls in Afghanistan were significantly less likely to attend school than boys across all ages, but the gender gap widens from age 10 and peaks at 14"". Unicef also says that in large parts of Afghanistan, especially in areas controlled by the Taliban and other insurgent groups, school enrolment rates for girls were very low.  There are more women working in the education sector. By 2018, about one-third of Afghanistan's teachers were women, and literacy rates among girls have risen. The number of female students at government universities has increased nearly seven times between 2002 and 201, more than the increase in that period for male students, according to Afghan government figures. It is worth noting that US officials have pointed to issues with government data, saying that student enrolment figures may have been inflated for a number of reasons. Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, but after the US invasion in 2001, there was fairly rapid economic growth with international aid pouring in. This was reflected in GDP figures which averaged 9.4% between 2003 and 2012, according to the World Bank.  But growth has slowed as aid flows have decreased, and the security situation has worsened. In addition, growing numbers of Afghans have returned from abroad since 2015, swelling the population. A government survey of living conditions for 2016-17 found that more than 54% of the population were living below the national poverty line of 2,064 Afghanis per person per month (equivalent to about $31 or £25 as of 1 January 2017). This percentage had gone up from around 38% in poverty between 2011 and 2012. A more recent survey by Gallup in August 2019 pointed to severe droughts in the last few years affecting food security. It said that nearly six out of every 10 Afghans told them they had struggled to afford food at times in the previous year. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions"
economic indicators,A look at the tech behind your coffee,2024-09-15,2022-07-24,By Luana Ferreira,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62235741,"For an estimated one billion people around the world drinking coffee is a daily regime. Yet what many coffee lovers might not know is that they are often drinking a brew made, at least in part, from Brazilian beans. ""Brazilian beans have popular characteristics, and are known for their body and sweetness,"" says Christiano Borges, boss of the country's largest grower, Ipanema Coffees. ""Therefore, many coffee blends in the world use our coffee as a base."" Brazil is far and away the world's largest grower of coffee beans. It accounts for more than one third of all global supplies, or 37% in 2020, to be exact. In second place is Vietnam with 17% of supplies. Some 70% of Brazil's coffee plants are the highly-priced arabica species, used in fresh coffee. The remaining 30% are robusta, which is used primarily for instant coffee.  The problem for Brazil, and world coffee supplies in general, is that last year the country's annual crop plummeted by almost a quarter due to a drought across its main coffee growing region, which centres on the south-eastern states of Minas Gerais, São Paulo and Paraná. The knock-on affect has been a global reduction in coffee beans supplies, and a subsequent doubling in wholesale prices since this time last year. To try to alleviate any future falls in production, Brazil's largest coffee producers are increasingly turning towards technology to help them successfully grow and process the best possible crop, both in terms of size and quality. New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. One such firm, Okuyama, says it is now investing at least 10% of its revenues in technology. Based in Minas Gerais, it has coffee plantations covering 1,100 hectares (2,718 acres).  Its staff use a computer app called Cropwise Protector, which is made by Swiss-Chinese agricultural tech firm, Syngenta. Linked to ground sensors and satellite imagery, the tool gives the farm workers a visual analysis of the farm, or plantation, on a tablet device or laptop. They can then quickly apply such things as drip-irrigation, or pest-control, to a very specific area that might need it, rather than a whole field or the entire farm. The idea is that this far more targeted approach is far faster, and kinder on the environment. ""Every year there is a new challenge, and these technologies help us to overcome those barriers,"" says Bruno Hiroiti, coffee beans manager at Okuyama. ""We have also invested in technologies for the coffee drying process, where we can monitor the temperature, which is defined by the type of coffee we are drying."" Okuyama dries some of its coffee beans in drum heaters after harvesting, to prevent them from spoiling while they are stored ahead of being roasted. Getting the temperature and timing correct is essential to avoid wastage, both in terms of the beans and the energy used to power the heaters. At Ipanema Coffees, which has 4,300 hectares of plantations across three sites in Minas Gerais, Mr Borges says it has also very much gone down the tech route in recent years. ""We have made a huge investment on semi-automated irrigation, where the system measures the water deficit and weather conditions - giving us recommendations for each area."" He adds that the investments are helping the firm to reduce the impact of climate change. ""We have climate problems such as droughts, and global temperature increases. ""The irrigation system has helped us to improve our productivity... and it has become a climate insurance for us."" Ipanema says it also has trackers on all its tractors to measure productivity, and is another user of Cropwise Protector. ""It helps us monitor agricultural pests, by only using a tablet,"" says Gustavo Michalski, the firm's agricultural coordinator. ""It allows us to manage the problem and make more assertive decisions, and more sustainable ones, as we can monitor the indicators that give us the location and intensity [of a particular problem] in each areas."" After its beans are harvested, Ipanema has, for a number of years, been using automated selection machines, which only pick the ripe ones, which are yellow and red. ""We set the machine by programming the colours we need,"" says Rodrigo Ferreira, the firm's industrial director. ""Once we put the beans in the conveyor belt the beans that are not the colour we defined will be expelled by a compressed air jet."" Flora Viana, global marketing manager for digital agriculture at Syngenta, says that Brazil's coffee producers can ""no longer increase their productivity just by buying more land"".  ""We are reaching the limit of areas available,"" she adds, ""producers need to instead optimise their production process."" Yet, Mr Borges adds that the technology is reliant upon having trained staff. ""It is pointless to have great tool if we don't have a team motivated and prepared for them."" He adds that Ipanema has 800 employees, and often they go to college for training. However, this increased use of technology is not universal across Brazil's coffee producers. While it has been adopted by the big players in industry, such as Ipanema and Okuyama, the myriad of small producers that produce 66% of the country's crop are lagging behind. But the hope is that the roll out of 5G mobile phone networks will improve internet connections in rural areas, making technology such as Cropwise Protector more prevalent."
economic indicators,Week ahead in the European Parliament,2024-09-15,2018-10-22,By Paul Seddon,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-45921224,"MEPs will get a chance to react to last week's inconclusive EU summit when they meet in Strasbourg this week.  The second plenary sitting of the month will allow them to react formally to the idea that the UK's post-Brexit transition period could be extended.  An extension for a ""few months"" has been suggested by Theresa May as an option to break the impasse over a backstop deal for the Irish border.  It has riled Brexit-backing Conservative MPs - but although MEPs are likely to find the idea less offensive, they might not be wild about it either.  Any extension beyond the current end date of December 2020  would reach into the timescale of the EU's next long-term budget - in which MEPs have previously called for ""all rebates"", including the UK's, to be abolished.  A key question to be answered now is whether an extension would incur additional budget contributions from the UK - and if so, how much? MEPs will also debate and vote on a report from one of the assembly's committees into the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal.  The lengthy draft contains a number of recommendations for future regulation of social media platforms and combating 'fake news' online.   And on Tuesday, MEPs will decide whether to push for an EU-wide ban on certain single-use plastics to be widened.  Here's what's coming up this week...  First up is a debate on the forthcoming summits in Poland and Egypt on climate change and biological diversity.  After this MEPs will debate their position on next year's EU budget, ahead of negotiations with national ministers later this year.   As they normally do, they have so far called for cuts proposed by national governments to the European Commission's draft to be reversed.  The exact position they will take into talks will be decided on Tuesday, with a vote on a motion from the budgets committee.  The final deal hammered out behind closed doors will have to be ratified by the whole assembly before it can come into force.  Then they will discuss new EU-wide limits on the amount of lead and other chemicals in tap water, to be put to a vote on Tuesday.  The day's main legislating will be on the European Commission's proposed ban on single-use plastics such as straws.  On Wednesday, they will decide whether to back amendments to extend the ban to lightweight carrier bags and polystyrene takeaway boxes. The environment committee also wants to see new labelling requirements for products such as cigarette filters and drinks cups.  The day begins with a debate on the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal, which has been investigated by MEPs on the civil liberties committee.  Their report, to be put to vote on Thursday, contains a number of policy recommendations on the subjects of data protection, 'fake news' and the use of information online for political profiling - of which more later.  One key question for MEPs to consider is whether their calls will be heard at the European Commission, responsible for new EU regulations.  Another issue which is bound to get an airing is how best to tackle misinformation online ahead of next year's European elections.  After this, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis will make a speech on the future of the EU - the eleventh leader to do so in a planned series.  After the lunchtime voting session, the European Commission will announce its legislative agenda for next year.  The scope for pushing through new legislation is more limited than usual next year is more limited due to European elections in May.  After this, MEPs will debate the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The case has led to calls for Western nations to re-examine their relationship with Saudi Arabia, which is accused of being behind his disappearance.  After this they will debate the growing tensions between Ukraine and Russia in the Sea of Azov, and the economic crisis in Venezuela.  More than two million Venezuelans have fled their country since 2014. They have topped the list of asylum requests in Spain for three years. Later they will debate three regulations to update the information sharing system used by police forces in the passport-free Schengen area.  Under the changes, facial images will be able to be shared to identify people, as well as fingerprints discovered at the scene of serious crimes or terror attacks.  A provisional deal on the changes MEPs agreed with EU governments in June faces a final vote on Wednesday.  The overhaul has been proposed as part of a bid to tighten up the EU's external borders.  Discussion of last week's EU summit is first up from 08.00 BST - European Council President Donald Tusk is due to speak at the start of the debate.  Aside from Brexit, MEPs may want to highlight progress - or lack of it - in the fields of migration policy, security and climate change.  At the voting session they may vote to sign off spending during 2016 by the EU's asylum support office.  They refused to do this in April, partially because an investigation into several of the agency's managers from the EU's anti-fraud watchdog was ongoing.  The Malta-based agency appointed an interim boss in June after its previous executive director resigned amid procurement and bullying scandals.  After lunch, things will get a bit institutional, with a ""topical"" debate on the future of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty.  Among other changes, the treaty handed greater powers to the European Parliament and introduced a new system for 'qualified majority' voting.  Treaty change is not exactly imminent, although some believe a constitutional refresh is needed as the EU grapples with new political challenges.  After this there is the traditional autumn debate on the annual report from the EU's main auditing authority, released earlier this month.   The European Court of Auditors (ECA) has found that 2.4% of EU funds were mis-spent during 2017. That's a drop on the 3.1% figure recorded for spending in 2016, but still above the ECA's 2% target. Then MEPs will debate new EU-wide import rules and licensing requirements for artefacts. They will take an initial position on the proposals on Thursday.  The European Commission announced the new rules last year to stop the trade in looted artefacts being used to fund terrorist and criminal groups.  Aside from specific measures covering Iraq and Syria, the EU currently lacks common procedures for licensing the import of artefacts from outside the bloc.  Some art dealers' associations have expressed concern that the new regulations will harm the art trade.  In the evening they will also discuss new restrictions on the use of antibiotics on groups of farm animals.  Under new legislation, treating an entire group of animals with antibiotics when only one has shown signs of infection will require prior authorisation from a vet.   They will also discuss legislation to phase in a ban on time-based road toll charges.  Operators would have to switch to distance-based charging for trucks and buses from 2023.  There will be no debates on topical human rights motions, with the month's batch already having been voted on during the plenary sitting earlier this month.  Instead there will be debates on three ""own initiative"" reports from committees with policy recommendations for the European Commission.  This includes one calling for EU funds not be transferred outside the bloc through banks operating in ""non-transparent and uncooperative jurisdictions"". The move is recommended as part of a report on tackling fraudulent spending of EU money by organisations around the world.   At the voting session MEPs will adopt motions on the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, Sea of Azov tensions and situation in Venezuela.  They will also vote on the final report into the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, likely to be an indicator of the future direction in which regulatory winds many blow for the platform and social media companies more generally.  The headline accusation in the draft version is that Facebook breached EU law during the scandal due to its role as a data ""controller"".  The report itself does not have a legal effect but will undoubtedly ratchet up the political pressure on the website over privacy issues.  It says that in future, users should have to consent specifically to their data being used for different purposes - and calls for new transparency measures for political adverts Facebook has introduced in the US to be rolled out in Europe.  In addition, it urges a ban on profiling socio-economic or demographic data online for political or electoral purposes.  Again - these ideas are only recommendations at this stage. But will it provide a taste of what is to come?  Please note: This agenda is subject to modification at the opening of the session on Monday afternoon. A guide to the European Parliament's plenary sessions can be found here. "
economic indicators,Irish economic growth 'boosts NI firms',2024-09-15,2017-09-11,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-41220501,"Northern Ireland firms are benefiting from the strong growth in the Republic of Ireland's economy, an Ulster Bank survey has suggested. The bank conducts a monthly survey of private sector business activity. It is considered a reliable indicator of Northern Ireland's private sector economy. The August survey showed the strongest rate of growth this year, with exports to the Republic of Ireland reportedly supporting rises in workloads. The bank's chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said: ""NI firms are taking advantage of having one of the fastest growing economies in Europe on their doorstep. ""Throw a weak currency into the mix and the conditions are ideal for local firms selling into the Republic of Ireland/Eurozone market."" The Republic of Ireland, which is Northern Ireland's single biggest export market, is continuing to experience a robust economic recovery. Unemployment is at lowest levels since the summer of 2008 and the country's central bank is forecasting economic growth of 4.5% this year and 3.6% in 2018. Some Northern Ireland firms are also likely to be benefiting from the weakening of sterling against the euro. A weaker pound makes UK-produced goods cheaper in Eurozone markets."
economic indicators,Spend Local scheme 'helps lift November retail sales',2024-09-15,2021-12-13,By Richard Morgan,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-59631460,"Retail sales in Northern Ireland rose in November for the first time in four months, according to an Ulster Bank survey.  The bank's monthly survey of private sector businesses is considered a reliable indicator of economic performance. The report also indicated employment levels continued to grow.  Supply chain problems remain and inflationary pressures were described as severe.  Ulster Bank's chief economist Richard Ramsey pointed to the High Street Voucher Scheme as one reason for the rise in retail activity.  ""Northern Ireland saw the pace of business activity accelerate in November, but this uptick was solely down to a rebound in one sector, retail,"" he said. ""Local retail sales rose in November for the first time in four months with the High Street Voucher Scheme undoubtedly contributing to the pick-up in demand."" Christmas shopping is also likely to be a factor for the rise in November trade. Mr Ramsey said that, overall, manufacturing remained the strongest performer of the four sectors monitored in the local economy, despite that industry experiencing slower rates of growth relative to October. ""Services firms, on the other hand, reported their slowest rate of expansion in business activity in eight months, and incoming orders were broadly flat, while construction firms notched up their fifth successive month of contraction in both output and orders,"" he added. ""Manufacturing aside, the near-term outlook for the private sector remains challenging.  ""Indeed, retail's pick-up in sales in November coincides with a slump in new orders, pointing to a slowdown over the months ahead."" Economy Minister Gordon Lyons has said some people still need to activate and use their Spend Local cards.  The scheme was extended until midnight on 19 December as some people were still waiting to receive their £100.  ""The scheme is boosting our economy by an extra £2m on average every single day and that is over £121m so far,"" he said.  ""The Northern Ireland Retail Consortium has credited the scheme with boosting the number of shoppers on our High Streets to their highest levels since before the pandemic.    ""While this is a clear success, it is important to me and to our businesses that every penny on every card is spent in order to maximise the impact."" The Ulster Bank survey also indicated that Northern Ireland's private sector recovery continues to lag behind other UK regions.  ""After the north east of England, Northern Ireland recorded the slowest rate of growth in business activity,"" Mr Ramsey said.  ""Northern Ireland was the only one of the 12 UK regions to record a fall in new orders in November.  ""November's decline extended the run of falling orders to 34 months.  ""Manufacturing is the only sector in Northern Ireland that appears to be outperforming the UK."""
economic indicators,It was one of the darkest moments in Brazilian football,2024-09-15,2021-10-04,Marcus Alves,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/58739115,"Fans in Salvador reacted dramatically - it went further than football It took Charles Fabian a good few minutes to get the full picture. The young forward had just finished dinner at Brazil's team hotel in the north-eastern city of Salvador when the president of local side Bahia stormed in.  ""You can pack your bags because you are not staying here,"" yelled Paulo Maracaja as he grabbed Charles by the arm. It was June 1989. A home Copa America was about to begin and Charles, then 21 and a Bahia player, had not long since broken into the national set-up. He didn't know what to do. Unable to find anybody from the Brazilian FA, he ended up following the order to leave.  As it turned out, Maracaja had taken matters into his own hands after being told that Charles was among three to be cut from the final 20-man squad. He was furious his player had been dropped.  The omission would have dramatic consequences. What happened next lives on in the national consciousness as one of the darkest moments in Brazilian sporting history. It felt like just another betrayal to a people who had long felt marginalised - and who continue to feel so today. Brazil's opening match was the following day, in that same north-eastern city - Salvador.  Charles was a local icon, and it had been years since a player from one of the region's teams had been picked for the national side.  Only 13,000 fans turned up for the 3-1 win over Venezuela - less than half capacity - but the message sent could not have been clearer. Supporters burned the Brazilian flag, booed the national anthem and forced coaching staff to flee from the dugout by throwing flares in their direction. Outrage spilled out from the stands. ""I had mixed feelings that day,"" Charles says. ""On one hand I was happy with the support I received, but on the other I was sad because of what happened. No-one wants to see your country's flag in flames. ""The protest was valid, although, in my opinion, it could have been done differently."" Clearly, this wasn't just about football. Charles ended up being dragged into a debate that has been around for decades, the Brazilian divide between its two major population centres - the wealthy south-east and the impoverished north-east, which trails behind in every social and economic indicator. This is a part of the country where millions earn less than £20 a month, where millions suffer from hunger, where unemployment has soared over 50%, external during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is such hardship that forces many north-easterners to migrate to places like the south-eastern cities of Sao Paulo or Rio de Janeiro. But once there, often life doesn't get much easier - among the obstacles that still persist is prejudice.  For almost his entire career, Barcelona legend Rivaldo complained about not being treated by the media in the same way as other Brazil superstars such as Romario and Ronaldo. According to him, there was only one reason for that: he was from the north-east. When he officially retired in 2015, the general feeling was that his talent had never been truly appreciated. O Globo newspaper's report on Charles Fabian's (left in the photo) omission from the Brazil squad in 1989 In Rio de Janeiro, people from Brazil's north-east are stereotyped and universally referred to as ""paraibas"" (someone from Paraiba state) regardless of where they're actually from. To some extent, the same happens in Sao Paulo, where they're called ""baianos"" (from Bahia state). One episode is particularly famous in Brazil - the reaction of former international Edmundo, who is from Rio state, to being sent off in a match in 1997.  He said: ""We come to play in Paraiba [the game actually took place in another north-eastern state, Rio Grande do Norte] and you put a 'paraiba' [the official was in fact from the north-eastern state of Ceara] to referee the game. It could have never worked out.""  There are examples from the country's highest office, too - in 2019, Brazil's far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, born in Sao Paulo state, was caught referring to the governors of the north-east states as ""paraiba governors"" in a leaked audio recording. In the south, people from the north-east are often considered socially or intellectually inferior. It's not unusual to see their local accents mocked and laughed at. Former Porto and Zenit St Petersburg star Hulk, who is from the state of Paraiba, went through that at a national team news conference before the 2014 World Cup. The 35-year-old forward was asked by a journalist, referring to people from the north-east, whether ""it's their accent that makes them funny"". As a passionate son of the region, he couldn't believe his ears. ""Unfortunately, we know that prejudice is still around, no matter your area of work or profession,"" says Hulk, who is now back in Brazilian football with Atletico Mineiro.  ""But the north-easterner is a fighter, a winner, and can overcome all this. I am proud of being from the north-east, carrying our banner and defending our people anywhere in the world. I am very grateful for all the love and support I've always received."" Firmino, born in the north-eastern city of Maceio, moved on to Figueirense, in Florianopolis, aged 17 Despite being the country's second most populous region, with approximately 57 million people, 27% of the national population, the nine-state area has never seen a footballer from a local side represent Brazil in the World Cup. Over the past 15 years, just two players from clubs in the north-east have been called up by the national team - Sport Recife forward Diego Souza in 2017 and Nautico left-back Douglas Santos in 2013. Part of the problem is that talented players usually don't stay around at these clubs for long, often heading south after the first lucrative offer, sometimes without even making their senior debuts. Rivaldo, Bebeto, Juninho Pernambucano, Dida and Roberto Firmino all took similar paths. With much smaller budgets, it's simply impossible for local outfits to compete financially with powerhouses like Flamengo, Palmeiras and Gremio. So they lose their best players. One way to fight this would be to sell their young talents directly to Europe, but although the situation has improved in recent years, that very rarely happens. The vast majority still go to the south-east first and then on to other leagues. The French-Algerian agent Franck Henouda believes there is a reason for that.  Henouda has worked as Shakhtar Donetsk's emissary in Brazil for almost two decades, overseeing the arrivals of Fernandinho, Willian, Fred, Douglas Costa and many others. Of the 13 Brazilian footballers he recruited for the Ukrainian side, none came from the north-east.  ""If a club comes to me and says I've got a boy from the north-east and another from the south, I'll advise them to sign the latter. He may be more expensive, but the risks are lower,"" Henouda says. ""Brazil is a continental country, so only after moving there in the 2000s, I noticed the differences between the places. And Rio Grande do Sul, Parana, Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais stood out for me - they produced more footballers capable of thriving in Europe. ""Players from these areas are physically stronger and don't struggle with hunger growing up. They have those colonial breakfasts in the south. It's totally different in the north-east.  ""The other day, I was watching an Atletico Goianiense forward from there - I like him a lot, but he has a short stature and small bones, because they didn't develop properly due to a lack of calcium in childhood. He will be more susceptible to injuries. ""When you are closing a deal, you have to pay attention to all these details, even the kind of studs the athlete wears. If he's from the north-east, he will probably have worn rubber studs his whole life, even on wet, heavy surfaces, so when he moves to Europe, he will require some time to get used to boots with metal ones. Not every team is willing to wait for it after paying 10m euros."" Fortaleza supporters cheer their team - the surprise package of the season It is still very rare to see anything that occurs outside the Sao Paulo-Rio de Janeiro-Belo Horizonte-Porto Alegre axis getting nationwide coverage in Brazil. In a scenario where clubs rely on commercial ventures and TV revenue, not benefiting from this exposure makes it more difficult for north-eastern teams to flourish in the top flight. For the north-eastern sides, a top-10 finish remains the main goal - and only three times in the past decade has that been achieved - but things are beginning to change for the better.  Fortaleza increased their revenues 10-fold between 2014 and 2019. They are currently fourth in the table and are into the Brazilian Cup semi-finals - for the first time in 102 years. Meanwhile, Ceara have recorded the lowest debt in the Brazilian league and Bahia, too, have dramatically transformed themselves.  They had hit rock bottom in 2006, finding themselves in the third tier. Such was the outrage among fans that 50,000 took to the streets of Salvador to protest against the board. Things did not move quickly from there, but in 2013 season ticket holders were finally given the chance to vote for the club's president - which is very rare in Brazilian football.   The team's 1959 and 1988 league title trophies had been found discarded in rubbish bags. Now they are a model club. They have paid off some of the debt that was crippling them and introduced a new transparency policy. ""I have no doubt that there was a very strong system that disadvantaged footballers from north-eastern sides until the 1990s,"" says Bahia vice-president Vitor Ferraz. ""When you have a side that won the Brazilian league, like we did in 1988, and you see that the players were only given occasional chances, you realise they would have got more opportunities wearing a different shirt. What happened to Charles in 1989 illustrates that. ""We are now the country's most democratic team. It has drawn some attention from the national media, but we know that if a club from the south had done the same, the impact would have been much bigger. ""We credit this to the prejudice that still exists. But I'm sure that we find ourselves in a much better position than we were 10, 15 years ago.  ""From now, what happens on the pitch will change this reality."""

Many of the pledges relate to issues, such as education or health, which are devolved to the Scottish Parliament. This means the party would either need to the win the support of the Scottish government or win the next Holyrood election in 2021 before the policy could be introduced.

economic indicators,How much longer will Scotland be in lockdown?,2024-09-15,2021-02-02,By Christopher Sleight,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-55901991,"The first minister has confirmed that Scotland will be in full lockdown until ""at least"" the end of February. Nicola Sturgeon said the current restrictions were working, but added the level of Covid infections clearly remained ""too high"". How much progress does Scotland need to make before lockdown can begin to be eased? Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, has talked about using World Health Organisation (WHO) indicators when calculating the level of Covid-19 transmission in the country. He told BBC Scotland this week that the Scottish government was aiming to get the number of cases below 50 per 100,000 people and the percentage of people testing positive under 5% before it would consider relaxing restrictions. Doing both of these things would put Scotland in the WHO's ""level 2"" category of community transmission, where it's judged there is a ""moderate incidence"" of locally acquired infections. The WHO's seven categories range from ""no active cases"" to ""level 4"" community transmission, when the general population is at high risk of being infected. In the organisation's guidance on implementing measures to control Covid-19, the WHO also lists two other ways of calculating the levels of Covid in a population: hospital admissions and death rates. Governments using this guidance will balance these indicators against the other health harms and economic impacts caused by lockdown measures. It's also likely the Scottish government would want to see rates remain below the WHO thresholds for sustained periods, rather than briefly dipping below the line. The WHO advises governments to look at their weekly confirmed cases per 100,000 people and then average the figure out over a 14-day period. By this measure, Scotland had a rate of 165 cases per 100,000 people on 2 February. There's been a sustained decline in this figure since the middle of January, but the rate is still well above the WHO's level 2 threshold of 50. The last time Scotland was below 50 cases per 100,000 was at the beginning of October. It's difficult to compare this rate with the first outbreak in the spring as there was no mass testing earlier in the pandemic. The Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive tests per day by the total number of tests carried out. The figure it's aiming for is 5%, which again would put Scotland in the WHO's ""level 2"" of community transmission. Like infection rates, the number is declining, but there's still some way to go. The WHO says governments should look at the number of weekly deaths ""attributed"" to Covid-19 per 100,000 people and average them out over 14 days. A death rate of two per 100,000 people or less needs to be achieved to indicate ""level 2"" community transmission, according to the WHO. This chart counts deaths in Scotland within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19. If the wider definition of all death certificates mentioning the virus were used, the rate would be slightly higher. The rate in Scotland is currently just over seven and has not yet begun to decline. The full lockdown in the spring ended on 28 May, although the easing of restrictions was phased over several weeks during the summer. Figures on Covid-19 hospital admissions are currently available up to 22 January, when the 14-day average of weekly admissions was 22. The WHO threshold in this instance is 10 cases per 100,000. The 14-day average has not yet begun to decline significantly, but daily admissions appear to have peaked on 11 January, according to Public Health Scotland figures. In the spring, the decline in infection rates was followed by a decline in hospital admissions and finally a fall death rates. If this pattern is repeated, then a corner may have been turned in this second wave - but there is still a long way to go before the rates of infections, hospital admissions and deaths are where the Scottish government would like them to be. In the world race to vaccinate, Israel is out in front after giving first jabs to more than half its adult population. So, what are we learning from their mass vaccination programme? Assessments by the Israeli Ministry of Health (MoH) report signs that infection and illness in the over-60s is being driven down. The fall appears to be most pronounced in older people and areas furthest ahead in their immunisation efforts. This suggests it is the vaccine, and not just the country's current lockdown, taking effect. The MoH data suggests infections and illnesses fell consistently from 14 days after receiving a first jab onwards. In Scotland just under 14% of those aged over 16 have had an injection with England at more than 18%; Wales at nearly 17% and Northern Ireland at 15.59%. Infectious disease specialist Dr Susan Hopkins told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme on Sunday that the UK should see its vaccination programme, which began on 8 December, reducing Covid illness within the next fortnight. While the current vaccines are said to be highly effective in preventing severe sickness in individuals there had been less assurance over whether they could prevent virus transmissibility. However, early research on the Oxford-AstraZenenca vaccine points to good news.  The results of a study, which has not yet been formally published, suggest that the vaccine may have a ""substantial"" effect on transmission of the virus. It means the jab could have a greater impact on the pandemic, as each person who receives it will indirectly protect others too. As well as showing an effect on transmission, the study found the vaccine offered 76% effective protection from a single dose for three months.

economic indicators,Reality Check: What is the Norway model?,2024-09-15,2018-10-30,By Chris Morris,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46024649,"The Prime Minister Theresa May is in Norway for a day of meetings with her Scandinavian counterparts at the Northern Future Forum in Oslo.  Brexit is bound to come up in conversation, so it feels like a good day to remind ourselves what the Norway model is.  Since the referendum, Norway has been discussed as one possible Brexit solution because a) it is not a member of the European Union, but b) it is in the European Economic Area (EEA), which means that it's also part of the single market.  So it's about as close to the EU as you can get without being a member state. And, if the UK followed this example, that would mean its trade relations with its nearest neighbours could remain pretty much as they are now.   Alphabet soup alert. You have to join EFTA - the European Free Trade Association, which groups four countries together: Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.   Just to complicate things further, Switzerland has chosen not to join the EEA, and relies on a series of complex agreements with the EU instead.     It means Norway has full access to the single market, and very limited barriers to trade with the EU.   In return it makes substantial contributions to the EU budget, and has to follow most EU rules and laws.   These include the so-called four freedoms - the freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and people.    That means people from across the EU are free to live and work in Norway, and Norwegians can live and work across the EU.   But Norway has no formal say in making EU rules, because it has no representation in any of the main European institutions.  Norway is not part of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) or the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). So it can set its own policies in those areas.    It is also exempt from EU rules on justice and home affairs.   Yes. That sounds familiar doesn't it? Of course it helps when you have one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world, thanks to huge investments generated by oil and gas revenues. Fishing and agriculture are also big issues in rural Norway (fishing is one of the biggest industries in the country) so being outside the CFP and the CAP are important indicators of national sovereignty.  No, it's not.   That means it does need to take some additional administrative steps in order to trade with the EU. But it also means it can sign its own trade deals with other countries around the world.  However, being outside the EU customs union means a relationship like Norway's would not solve the thorny Brexit problem of avoiding a hard border in Ireland.  To keep the Irish border as open as it is now, you would need to add a new customs union (or equivalent arrangement) with the EU - a ""Norway plus"" solution, if you like.   She has. And she has pledged to leave both the single market and the customs union.  Some MPs, though, have recently argued in favour of a short-term 'Norway for Now' option.   Instead of a transition period after Brexit, it would see the UK joining the EEA (via EFTA) for three years, and agreeing a temporary customs union with the EU.  That would, the theory goes, give the UK time to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU for the future.  Good point.   EEA membership would certainly be on offer as a long-term solution after Brexit. But it's unlikely that Norway and friends would want to be used as a waiting room on the UK's route out of the EU.  ""I don't think it's easy to think that you can enter into an organisation you are preparing to leave at the same time,"" Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg told the Northern Future Forum. ""It is also a little bit difficult for the rest of us."" Logistics and the law would pose a problem as well.  There is neither time nor legal authority before 29 March 2019 for the UK to apply to join EFTA and then rejoin the EEA.   As things stand, EFTA states are also not allowed to be in a customs union with the EU.  In the government's mind it is.  Theresa May said in Oslo today that Norway's existing relationship with the EU ""has elements that wouldn't deliver on the vote of the British people."" But these are uncertain times.  If a Brexit deal were to be agreed with the EU, and then voted down in the House of Commons, all bets would be off. And all options (including some version of Norway) could be up for debate.

economic indicators,White working class pupils left behind,2024-09-15,2010-07-15,Mukul Devichand,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-10528359,"This video can not be played Chloe and her mother Julie talk about life as a minority at the school A primary school near Waterloo Station in south London has helped to uncover a national trend: that the poorest white children are falling behind ethnic minority groups  at school. ""How many of you have got another flag?"" asks head teacher Di Morgan.   Over 200 young faces stare excitedly back at her during morning assembly at Johanna Primary School, near Central London's Waterloo Station. ""Morocco!"" shouts a student, whose parents are Moroccan. ""China!"" says another.  ""Iran,"" pipes up a third.   This school is diverse - the children speak 40 languages between them.   But Di Morgan is worried about one of the smaller ethnic groups in her school: The old white working class who once dominated this inner London neighbourhood. ""White working class children were underachieveing,"" she says.   ""The truth is a lot of our white children in nursery have fewer words of English than bilingual children."" She and the school staff have tried to turn around their fortunes by engaging their parents in the school's activities. Reversing the trend Chloe, aged 11, is an aspiring actress and one of the school's several white working class success stories. But it wasn't always this way.  ""Schools weren't looking at what was really happening with British children,"" says her grandmother Anne, who works at Johanna school.   ""They assumed being British you knew how to read and write."" ""A lot of the British have just lost motivation,"" admits Chloe's mother, Julie.  She blames a perception that schools aren't interested in these children. But she's pleased that Chloe now has friends from all over the world, and encourages fellow white parents to take a leaf from the ethnic minorities' book.  ""I think a lot of the ethnic minorities have higher aspirations for their children,"" she says. ""They've come from war-torn countries and they want to push as hard as they can."" National Study Forty languages are spoken at the Johanna School Such concerns over the poor achievement of white pupils led the local council, Lambeth, to research what was happening. They found that the poorest white children weren't just struggling in schools in diverse cities like London. The story was the same across England.   ""We've found that our own indigenous, white core people have become this group of low achievers,"" says Kirstin Lewis, one of the researchers at Lambeth. Her study isolated those children whose parents who had listed ""White British"" for their ethnic group, and who were on free school meals - the best indicator of social class they could find. They looked at results in primary school and at GCSE and found that in many cases the poorest white students achieved lower results than any other major group, both locally and across England.      She says when all white children are grouped together, the success of middle class white children brought up the achievement rate for the group as a whole, and was ""hiding"" the fact that the poorest were falling behind.  ""The shock for us really was that this group were the lowest achieving group,"" says Lewis.   ""Because we've been concentrating a lot nationally, and as a local authority, on the groups that have come into the country and celebrating their cultures."" Sensitive subject I spoke to several white families in the Lambeth area, but most would not speak out on the record. Diners at a Lambeth eel and pie shop speak to the BBC in 1943 There's a widespread fear that to even speak about these issues would be construed as racist or bigoted.  But areas like this part of London have seen enormous and sometimes unsettling change.    The world of old market stalls and working men, captured in songs like ""The Lambeth Walk"" from the musical Me and My Girl, has been replaced by a knowledge economy, gentrified coffee shops and a vibrant mix of immigrant groups. ""Fruit and veg stalls, flower stalls, everything you could wish for were in this market,"" says Nicola Church - a teaching assistant at Johanna, whose family lived here. She feels there has been a breakdown in prospects, especially for older teenagers like her own son.  ""They hang around on street corners, not in education,"" she says. She says the older values of the area have been lost.  ""You had to work until you were old. That was what you were brought up to do, you had to get out and work, education wasn't important."" Changing World Academic experts say that in London and many other parts of Britain, the old white working class is still adapting to a changed economy. ""There are undoubtedly a large number of families who haven't been able to grapple with the new world,"" says Kate Gavron of the Young Foundation, an East End think tank.  ""It's quite difficult to change your thinking about education,"" she says.  ""You have to encourage kids to do well at school.""  The profound shift in the economy makes it all the more vital that students are reached early on by schools. That's certainly what head teacher Di Morgan has in mind. ""Some of these families thought, well, what's the matter with my life? Why would my child want anything more than I've got?"" she says.   ""It is do to with a lack of aspiration, I believe."" In other words, economic background and support at home can often make as much difference as what colour you are.

economic indicators,House prices fall again in August,2024-09-15,2010-09-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-11161166,"This video can not be played Martin Gahbauer: ""More sellers have returned to the market."" House prices fell for the second month in a row in August, according to the Nationwide building society. Prices fell 0.9% last month, following a 0.5% decline in July, Nationwide said, adding that it was the first time that prices had fallen for two consecutive months since February 2009. The average house price now stands at just over £166,500. Nationwide said house prices had ""essentially stagnated over the summer"". The quarter-on-quarter rate of change - generally seen as a smoother indicator of recent price trends - fell from 1.2% in July to 0% in August. ""As more sellers have returned to the market, buyers have a greater selection of properties to choose from and more bargaining power with which to bid down asking prices,"" said Martin Gahbauer, Nationwide's chief economist. But he added: ""Given that the price increases of the last year had gotten ahead of the recovery in the wider economy, the current correction is not an unhealthy development."" The annual rate of house price inflation fell sharply from 6.6% in July to 3.9% in August. The figures reflect the general levelling-out of the housing market shown in data recently. Mr Gahbauer said that more sellers had returned to the market, giving buyers more choice and more bargaining power. Others in the industry suggest that the market had been accelerating at the end of last year, despite the economic downturn. ""There was a major disconnect between the property market and the economy. House prices rose at a rate that was simply unsustainable and a degree of correction was always on the cards,"" said Richard Hatch, of property consultancy Carter Jonas. ""At the higher end, however, prices are proving far more resilient and demand continues to be strong, more evidence of the formation of a two-tier market. ""We do not expect two months of consecutive declines to be the beginning of a sharper downward price trend. The market is simply readjusting after getting ahead of itself. The market is stabilising, not collapsing."" Although falling prices would be welcomed by first-time buyers, their attempts at getting on the property ladder are being challenged at present by large deposits being demanded by lenders.  Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said he expected prices to fall by between 3% and 5% in the second half of 2010, followed by a 5% drop next year. Nationwide"
economic indicators,US Fed sees no rate rise for rest of 2019,2024-09-15,2019-03-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47644267,"The US Federal Reserve does not expect to raise interest rates for the rest of 2019 amid slower economic growth. After a two-day meeting, monetary policymakers voted unanimously to keep the US interest rate range between 2.25%-2.5%. Fed members changed their outlook for 2019 from the two increases predicted in December to no movement. The central bank warned that ""growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter"". It said: ""Recent indicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter.""  Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions, said: ""The Fed did a big about-face on policy. ""The fact that the Fed threw in the towel on a 2019 rate hike was particularly dovish."" Fed chairman Jerome Powell maintained his stance that the central bank would continue to be ""patient"", telling a press conference: ""It may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation calls clearly for a change in policy."" The Nasdaq turned positive, up 0.35% at 7,750.7 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 trimmed earlier falls. Bank stocks were among the biggest losers, and finance firms tend to make bigger profits when interest rates are higher. The dollar fell against the Japanese yen and the euro, but was higher against the pound which was trading lower as tensions heightened over the UK's exit from the European Union next week. Analysis of the so-called ""dot plot - where members of the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee indicate where they expect interest rates to move to - also revealed that they anticipate only one increase in 2020. Mr Powell said that there was a positive outlook for the rest of the year, with the unemployment rate under 4% and inflation below the central bank's 2% target. But he said that ""we are also very mindful of what the risks are"", which include slower global growth and no resolution on either Brexit or US-China trade talks. The Fed also said that is will slow the monthly reduction of US Treasury bonds it holds from $30bn to $15bn from May onwards ending in September. During the financial crisis, the Fed spent heavily to help kick-start the US economy. It has been reducing its a $4.2trn portfolio of US Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities since 2017. The Fed is getting just a little more wary about economic prospects. For sure, these developments are nothing like as dramatic as a cut in interest rates would have been. Nobody expected that and we didn't get one.  But the hint that we should no longer think in terms of any rise at all this year and only one in 2020 is consistent with the picture of a softening economic outlook.  There is also a striking contrast between the growth that Feds policymakers think the US can sustain - about 2% - and what President Trump's administration believes is achievable, which is more like 3%.  That difference matters. If at some stage in the future the Fed thinks the economy is overheating it will raise rates. President Trump has criticised the Fed for rate rises it has already made, and he won't like it any more if they resume.  "
economic indicators,Federal Reserve raises interest rates,2024-09-15,2018-06-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44473148,"The US Federal Reserve has voted to raise the target for its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, citing solid economic expansion and job gains. The widely-anticipated decision will lift the target for the central bank's benchmark rate to 1.75%-2%, the highest level since 2008. A majority of Fed officials also forecast two more rate rises this year, one more than previously predicted. The rise is part of the US recovery following the global financial crisis. It is the seventh time the bank has raised rates since 2015. The tighter policy reflects expectations that US growth and inflation will prove stronger than officials anticipated in March, while the unemployment rate continues to fall. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome ""Jay"" Powell said job gains are boosting income and confidence, while foreign expansion and tax cuts support additional growth. ""The main takeaway is that the economy is doing well,"" he said. Projections released after the Fed's two-day meeting in Washington show policymakers expect the US economy will grow 2.8% this year, while unemployment falls to 3.6%. They expect the core inflation rate to rise to roughly 2% this year.  Mr Powell said concerns about trade are rising and the bank has received anecdotal reports that the uncertainties are leading companies to hold off on investment and hiring. But, he added, ""We really don't see it in the numbers."" Analysis: BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker This is another step on the road back to normal after the emergency measures taken following the financial crisis of 2008. The US has gone further down this path than the other largest developed economies. The central banks in Japan and the Eurozone still have their main rates at or close to zero.  Both are still actively undertaking quantitative easing, a policy of creating new money to buy financial assets in an effort to boost economic activity. The Fed stopped that in 2014 and has made a start on reducing its holdings of trillions of dollars' worth of assets.  That reflects the fact that the US recovery after the crisis has been stronger, and inflation is getting closer to the Fed's target. All three central banks (and the Bank of England) aim for inflation of about 2%, but in Japan and the Eurozone prices are rising substantially more slowly. In the UK, the Bank has stopped actively buying financial assets and interest rates are up a little from their lows. The British position has however been complicated by the referendum on membership of the European Union and a spike in inflation that followed the decline in the pound after the vote. The decision to raise rates comes as the US unemployment rate hovers at 3.8% - the lowest rate in nearly two decades - and inflation, which lagged the Fed's 2% target for years, shows signs of starting to pick up. The bank's preferred indicator of inflation, consumer spending figures, showed annual inflation rose 2% in April or 1.8% if energy and food were excluded. Mr Powell called the figures ""encouraging"" but said the bank wants to see the economy sustain that rate of inflation before it declares victory. Overall, he noted, the economy is in a much improved position than it was just a few years ago, as the US slowly emerged from the financial crisis and recession. ""The decision you see today is another sign that the US economy is in great shape,"" he said, adding that the bank continues to favour a gradual approach to raising rates. The higher rates should be a boon for savers, but they will increase borrowing costs for households and businesses throughout the economy.  Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for the interest rate website Bankrate.com, said that could ""squeeze"" families if wage growth remains sluggish. Analysts say the higher rates have also contributed to turmoil in some emerging markets. Low rates had prompted investors to pour money into riskier overseas markets in recent years in search of returns."
economic indicators,Will the US stock market boom continue?,2024-09-15,2018-08-25,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45288830,"America's benchmark stock index, the S&P 500, hit a major milestone this week, marking nearly nine and a half years of gains and closing at a new high.  By many counts, it was the longest period without a 20% or more drop in index history, surpassing the previous record set in the 1990s. US President Donald Trump and others celebrated the lengthy rally, known as a bull market in Wall Street jargon. Should we all break out the champagne? The US and global economies have come a long way over the last nine years. But the rise in the US outstrips global market performance - and many economic indicators in the US. The S&P index, the broadest measure of the US stock market, has increased more than 300% since 9 March 2009, when it hit a low in the aftermath of the financial crisis. In that same period, US economic output has increased by about 40%, while wages are up just 23%, not adjusting for inflation. Meanwhile, median household wealth in the US - which factors in assets such as homes - has actually declined, falling by more than 30% between 2007 and 2016, if you adjust for inflation. That's a reminder that many families have not benefited from the stock market gains. About 55% of US families have money in the market, whether directly or through retirement accounts, according to a Gallup poll in April.  But the richest 10% of households own about 84% of shares, according to a 2017 study by New York University Professor Edward Wolff. Outside the US, estimates of household stock market participation are even lower. There are still a lot of reasons for shares to have done well. Factors such as low inflation, lacklustre wage growth and last year's corporate tax cut have boosted company profits. Interest rates, which central banks cut during the financial crisis, remain low by historic standards, which has kept stocks attractive to investors. The growth of the technology sector - think of companies such as Apple and Microsoft - has also played a role. Technology firms accounted for more than 20% of the bull market gains, according to analysis by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for the S&P Dow Jones Indices. Public companies - especially a subset of ""supersize"" firms - have also accrued greater market power, especially in the US, contributing to corporate profits, according to IMF analysis.  And companies are directing more of those gains to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks, which tend to boost share prices. Between 2007 and 2016, companies in the S&P 500 spent 54% of their profits on buybacks - more than double the share in the 1980s, according to analysis by William Lazonick, a professor at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. In the short-term - say roughly the next 12 months or so - most analysts expect the market to rise, at least modestly. But the investment climate has shifted a bit since last year's blockbuster gains. In the US, the S&P 500 has increased more than 6% so far this year, closing at a record 2,874.76 on Friday.  The Dow has risen about 4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up more than 13%. Elsewhere, stock markets have slumped, as economic data weakens and risks grow. The Global Dow is off about 1% so far this year, while the Nikkei 225 has slumped about 4%. In China, the Shanghai Composite has tumbled about 18%, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong is down about 8%. In Europe, Germany's Dax index is down almost 4%, while the FTSE 100 in the UK has fallen about 1%.  The UK and the European Union remain locked in negotiations over Brexit, which has torn an economic relationship built over decades. Growth is slowing in China, an issue exacerbated by a widening trade fight with the US. Even in America, economic data has been mixed. Job creation has been strong and unemployment remains near record lows, but some metrics watched closely by economists, such as housing starts and home sales, have slipped. Inflation and wage costs have also showed signs of an uptick, which could eat at corporate profits and have pushed the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The rising rates have already played a role in strengthening the US dollar, which has hurt US exporters and intensified financial woes in emerging markets with high levels of debt in dollars. Higher rates also threaten to make stocks less attractive and dampen economic activity. Meanwhile, forecasters are trying to figure out the fallout from White House trade fights, including tariffs that have raised the cost of raw materials such as steel and aluminium and led to retaliation against US exporters including farmers. All of this means many people will be watching the market closely in coming months."
economic indicators,Reality Check: Is Wales worse off after devolution?,2024-09-15,2017-09-21,By Sarah Dickins,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41338397,"Claim: ""A more responsive body will be better placed to promote economic prosperity and quality of life across Wales,"" stated the White Paper before the devolution vote. Reality Check verdict: In the twenty years since the vote for devolution Wales has fallen behind in terms of productivity, wages and household income when compared with the UK has a whole. Of course, no one knows if Wales would have fared even worse without devolution. One way of measuring economic success is to look at how productive a nation is. In the UK, the productivity of devolved nations and the regions of England can be compared by looking at what's called Gross Value Added (GVA). Like Gross Domestic Product (GDP) it measures the value of goods and services produced, but GVA is calculated before tax is applied. Between 2014 and 2015 (the latest figures available), only the north west of England experienced stronger productivity growth than Wales. But this has bucked the longer-term trend. In 1997, Wales was the least productive region of the UK, and since then it has has fallen from 86.8% to 80.6%. So is devolution a factor? Well, in Scotland which also had powers devolved, productivity has risen from 94.8% to 98.3%. The good news for Wales is that there's a higher proportion of people working than 20 years ago. And the unemployment rate - which was was nearly twice the UK rate - is now equal at 4.3%. Scotland's unemployment rate is slightly lower, at 3.8%. With more people in Wales working than in 1997, you might wonder why productivity levels haven't reflected that. It's because the value of what's produced in Wales has fallen relative to the UK, suggesting that a larger proportion of Welsh jobs are lower skilled. And that is reflected in wages. Welsh earnings have fallen relatively since devolution. Whereas average wages were equal in Scotland and Wales in 1997, earnings in Scotland are now £42 a week higher than in Wales. Only in the east Midlands do middle earners now have lower wages than in Wales.  But wages don't tell the whole story. Whether people feel more prosperous is better calculated by looking at household income (Gross Disposable Household Income). This also includes income which doesn't come from working - like pensions, investments and benefits. In 1997 household income in Wales was 87% of the UK average. It has now fallen to 85.5%. The area of Wales where households are living on the smallest incomes has not changed in twenty years, and remains the Gwent Valleys. There, heavy industry declined in the 1980s and early 1990s and has not been replaced .  In 1997 the highest average household incomes were found along the North Wales coast in Conwy and Denbighshire, where many people had chosen to retire. In contrast the latest figures show that the area with the highest average household income is in and around Newport in south east Wales.  This area has seen strong economic growth but is also attractive to people who work across the border in Bristol, but can't afford the higher house prices there. So, several indicators suggest that Wales has fallen further behind the UK average in the last twenty years. It is often argued that London and the south east of England push up the UK averages.  So perhaps it's fairer to compare Wales with Scotland, which voted for devolution at the same time, albeit for a different model. But on these key economic factors at least, Scotland has fared better."
economic indicators,NI unemployment rates back to pre-pandemic levels,2024-09-15,2022-04-12,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-61077671,"The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland fell back to its pre-pandemic level at the start of this year, official figures suggest. The rate in the period December-February was 2.5%, a significant fall of 1 percentage point over the year and 0.6 percentage points over the quarter. It is just slightly above the all-time low of 2.3% recorded in 2019. Other figures also suggest that the jobs market continued to recover in the first quarter of 2022. HMRC figures suggest 775,000 people were on company payrolls in March, a 0.1% increase on February and 4.8% higher than March 2021. That is the 10th consecutive month that employee numbers have been above pre-Covid levels. All regions of the UK saw payrolls increase over the year to March 2022, with London recording the largest increase (7%) and the Scotland recording the smallest (4.1%).  Northern Ireland recorded a similar increase to the UK average (4.8% and 4.9% respectively). On a longer timeframe from March 2020 to March 2022, all regions of the UK also recorded an average 2% increase in payrolled employees. Northern Ireland recorded the largest increase (3%). However, the recovery is not complete. Total hours worked, self-employment and the overall employment rate are still below pre-pandemic levels in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) said: ""Employee indicators remain positive with the number of payrolled employees and level of payroll earnings above the pre-pandemic level, while the latest unemployment rate marks a return to the pre-pandemic rate.  ""Employment levels (which includes self-employment) and total hours worked have yet to return to pre-pandemic levels and similarly claimant count and economic inactivity both remain above."""
economic indicators,Inquiry into city children's mental health started,2024-09-15,2023-09-07,By Nigel Slater & Greig Watson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-66733818,"An investigation into the state of children's mental health has been announced by Derby City Council. It has been prompted by concerns over the impact of Covid-19 and other social factors, like falling family incomes. Mental health charity Young Minds reported 67% of 13-25 year olds felt the pandemic would have a long-term negative effect on their mental health. The investigation is due to report to the city council's cabinet in February 2024. In a report to the children, young people and skills scrutiny review board, councillors were presented with the Young Minds survey, as well as NHS data showing in England, the percentage of children aged between seven and 16 with a probable mental disorder had risen from 12.1% in 2017 to 18% in 2022.  For young people aged between 17 and 19 there was also a significant increase - from 10% in 2017 to 25.7% in 2022. While there was no direct statistical comparison, other indicators showed similar issues in Derby, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The number of children in low income families jumped from 17.7% in 2020-21 to 28.4% a year later - against a national average of 15.3%, the report said. A city survey found 58% of 18 to 24-year-olds felt lonely often or some of the time, with 43% of the group saying their mental health was ""poor"" or ""somewhat poor"". Contact between under-18s in Derby and NHS mental health, learning disabilities and autism services rose from 19.4% in 2019-20 to 27.3% in 2021-22. Factors contributing to poor mental health for school pupils include physical illness, academic failure, socio-economic disadvantages and breakdown in family relationships. City health bosses told the meeting these kind of of indicators showed a ""worsening picture"" when compared to the national average. Councillors said they wanted a ""deep dive"" into children's mental health across the city, examining ""if the way of managing schools is conducive to children's mental health and wellbeing"". The investigation will see a number of headteachers and leading figures within the local education sector interviewed. The meeting heard it will ""look at the structures of Derby's school systems and educational establishments and analyse what efforts are being made to improve the existing systems with the objective of improving mental health outcomes for pupils and students"".

economic indicators,Russian economists propose 'homebrew index',2024-09-15,2019-09-30,By News from Elsewhere...,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-49858798,"A group of economists in Russia have suggested that the answer to forecasting future economic crises could lie in the country's cherished samogon, or illegal homebrew.  A team led by Alexei Zubets, a researcher at Moscow's Financial University, carried out a nationwide poll about drinking habits earlier this year, and discovered that people feeling the financial pinch tend to switch to homemade spirits or bootleg booze.  This shows that the introduction of a ""samogon index"" could provide the government with another way of monitoring economic performance, he told the official newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta, adding that the latest findings suggest things are already looking up. ""Our research shows that production of home-made alcohol and its trade volume in Russia have not increased in the last year. And there are a number of signs they are in decline. We'll most likely see real incomes grow in the coming months,"" Mr Zubets said. The proposal has made waves among analysts of the sector. Some, like Vadim Drobiz of the Centre for Research of Federal and Regional Alcohol Markets, agree that alcohol could be used as a ""barometer of economic prosperity"".  But he suggests that an index based on the quantity of legal spirits sold in shops would be more useful.  ""If people have money to spend, they buy good-quality alcohol. In 2018-2019, sales of legal spirits increased, and that is proof that things aren't so bad in Russia,"" he told Rossiyskaya Gazeta. But others, like leading sociologist Lev Gudkov, think the moonshine indicator would not predict anything not already known from existing methods. ""It is the same as many other social indicators, starting with socially-driven illnesses like alcoholism, heart diseases,"" he told the official RIA Novosti news agency.  Economist Oleg Chernozub describes the idea as ""self-contradictory"", and suggests that the relationship between samogon and economic prosperity is far more nuanced.  In advanced nations, he told RIA Novosti, homebrew production can be a sign of increased wealth, as people ""have the time, desire and knowledge to do it"". You may also be interested in: The ultra-conservative Tsargrad news site put its usual nationalist spin on the samogon index, dubbing it yet another example of ""institutional Russophobia"".  ""These people really inhabit the classic myth of the eternal Russian drunkard unable to work to a high standard or understand proper language,"" it complained. Tsagrad also agrees with Oleg Chernozub's argument from affluence, saying that ""in wealthy Moscow, demand for equipment to make samogon and brew beer is very high"".  Indeed, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev is said to be a homebrew aficionado who likes to give bottles of his own produce as presents to colleagues and foreign leaders, according to the Proyekt investigative website. The criticism appears to have given Mr Zubets cold feet. He later recast his proposal as a matter of ""scientists having fun"".  But despite conceding that the idea was a ""scientific joke"", he insists that it could have some genuine uses, like helping the state budget to calculate revenue losses from the illegal production and sales of alcohol.

economic indicators,Italy's far right cash in on cost of living crisis,2024-09-15,2022-09-22,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62991601,"Pay for two coffees, drink only one. That's the community-minded tradition known as the caffè sospeso. Those who cannot afford breakfast, pop into their local bar to eat and drink - thanks to the bar owner, plus the kind soul who earlier purchased the sospeso, or ""suspended coffee"". The sospeso initiative is said to have started more than 200 years ago in Naples and is now spreading across Italy, where an eye-wateringly strong coffee and accompanying croissant (known in Italy as a cornetto) are viewed as a basic human right of a morning. Italians, like many others in Europe, are feeling the pinch. Spiralling energy bills compound already existing economic difficulties - hangovers from Covid lockdown measures and the euro crisis. ""Italians feel abandoned. Especially here in the south,"" Pino de Stasio told me. His family have owned Bar Settebello in downtown Naples for decades.  ""Unlike the UK, our government hasn't lent us enough of a helping hand. My energy bills have quadrupled. We're forced to switch off our coffee machine at 4pm every day when energy prices spike. So many businesses and families are going under. That's why, unfortunately, people are looking to the [political] right. Because they haven't yet sat in government to disappoint us."" This Sunday, 100 years after Mussolini's March on Rome, Italy is poised to opt for a leader from the hard right, whose Brothers of Italy party has its roots in neo-fascism.  Polls in Italy are seen as very reliable indicators. Their key uncertainty appears to be the size of the nationalists' victory. Famous for being small of stature but very loud of voice, Giorgia Meloni was addressing a campaign rally just outside Naples, in the working town of Caserta. She bellowed her economic promises at the nodding, cheering crowd. She would change Italy, she promised, investing in its strengths, standing up for its interests in Brussels, cracking down on uncontrolled immigration, protecting Italian families and the disadvantaged, while forcing those who can work off benefits.  Her supporters say ""she makes sense"". While critics fret about her political roots, Ms Meloni knows the money in their pocket - or lack of it - is what Italians care most about right now.  Last election her party got 4% of the vote, now she's angling for her country's premiership. To attract more moderate voters, she's tried to curate a conservative mainstream image. In an interview with Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper, Ms Meloni insisted there were no ""nostalgic fascists, racists or anti-Semites in the Brothers of Italy DNA"", and that she had always got rid of ""ambiguous people"" from her party. With her backstreet Roman twang, dressed in slacks and a baggy jumper, her long blonde hair flying as she strode up and down the stage, her intended message was ""I'm one of you"". ""Don't be afraid,"" she told the people of Caserta. But that's exactly what voters should be, according to her political opponents. Caterina Cerroni, 31, is the youngest candidate standing in this election for the left-wing Democratic Party. She said Giorgia Meloni threatened to erode the rights of young people to get a stable job, LGBTQ+ rights and the rights of women - making it harder to get an abortion. Ms Cerroni also described the right wing's proposal for a flat tax rate as an ""injustice, promoting inequality"". ""I'd rather have a feminist male prime minister than Italy's first female leader, if she's Giorgia Meloni,"" she told the BBC. But bearing in mind the fast-revolving door of Italian governments, many voters we spoke to said their main priority was the durability of Italy's next government. ""What we Italians desperately need is stability,"" bleary-eyed Marco Brozzi told me. The boss of a small ceramics factory, Ceramiche Noi, in the central region of Umbria, he is tired because he and his workers come in well before dawn these days - to benefit from cheaper energy prices at that time. Ceramics factories are massively energy intensive and he told me his gas and electricity bills had shot up 1000% over the last year. Unless the new government formed after this election acted fast to help businesses, he said, his factory could face closure within months. Italy's political system is all about coalition-building and the stability of a Meloni government will depend on how her coalition partners fare in Sunday's vote. She plans to link arms with centre-right former prime minister and business tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, and with her frenemy and former political rival, the far-right populist Matteo Salvini.  Both men have historically close ties to Russia. Berlusconi once gave Vladimir Putin a bedcover emblazoned with a huge photo of them both. They have even gone skiing together. This makes Italy's allies in Nato and in Brussels jumpy.  But Stefano Stefanini, Italy's former ambassador to Nato, told me that where foreign policy was concerned, Italy had been consistent for the past 70 years. The international community should keep an eye on the new government, but also give it a chance, he said. He pointed out that Ms Meloni was a keen Atlanticist who consistently voted in favour of sanctions against Russia while in opposition: ""There's no reason that she'll do different things in government than she's done in opposition.""  According to the director of the institute for foreign affairs in Rome, Nathalie Tocci, Ms Meloni is no populist either. Meaning that even if polls indicated Italians wanted their government to drop sanctions against Russia, in response to energy price hikes, she would be unlikely to U-turn on her position.  Italy's post-war, post-Mussolini constitution also contains a number of checks and balances on those in power. President Sergio Matarella will, for example, be able to influence Ms Meloni's choice of government ministers. If, indeed, she does become prime minister."
economic indicators,Iran reins in family planning as population ages,2024-09-15,2020-06-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-53048719,"Iran has limited the provision of family planning services at state-run hospitals as it tries to boost its population size.  Vasectomies will no longer be carried out at state-run medical centres and contraceptives will only be offered to women whose health might be at risk.  Such services will, however, still be provided at private hospitals.  The government has become concerned about fewer births and an increasingly ageing population. Annual population growth has dropped below 1% and, if no action is taken, Iran could become one of the world's oldest countries in the next 30 years, the health ministry says. Just two years ago, the country was recorded as having population growth of 1.4%. The rate in neighbouring Iraq was 2.3% and 1.8% in Saudi Arabia, according to World Bank data. Marriage and children within marriage are both in decline, Iran's state-run news agency Irna reports, largely because of economic hardship. Last month, Deputy Health Minister Seyed Hamed Barakati reported that the marriage rate had dropped by 40% in a decade. ""With this trend, we will be one of the oldest countries in the world in the next 30 years,"" he said.  Iran enjoyed a population boom after the Islamic Revolution in 1979 but went to on implement an effective population control policy. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been calling for people to have more children, saying he wants the current population population of 80 million to grow to 150 million. "
economic indicators,Banks bow to pressure to axe investor payouts,2024-09-15,2020-03-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52114410,"Some of the UK's biggest banks have agreed to scrap dividend payments and hold onto the cash, which may be needed during the coronavirus crisis. The Bank of England welcomed the decision to suspend the payments to shareholders and urged the banks not to pay bonuses to senior staff either. The banks, which include NatWest, Santander and Barclays, were due to pay out billions to shareholders. But in recent days they have come under pressure to hold onto the money. The deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sam Woods, wrote to some banking bosses asking them to suspend dividend payments. He asked them to confirm their decision by Tuesday evening. In a statement, the Prudential Regulation Authority, which is part of the Bank of England, said: ""Although the decisions taken today will result in shareholders not receiving dividends, they are a sensible precautionary step given the unique role that banks need to play in supporting the wider economy through a period of economic disruption."" Between them, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered were expected to pay a total of £15.6bn to shareholders, according to analysis from investment firm AJ Bell. But they will now retain those funds and not pay out any money to shareholders until at least the end of the year, which the Bank of England said ""should help the banks support the economy through 2020"". Many economists are predicting that the UK, in common with other large economies, will enter a recession this year, with output set to plummet. Last week, a closely-watched early indicator of economic activity fell to its lowest ever reading. That led economists at Capital Economics to predict a 15% contraction in the UK's economy during the second quarter of the year. Stephen Jones, chief executive for UK finance, the trade body for banks and finance companies, told the Today programme that banks were considering scrapping dividends before the Bank of England mandated it.  ""It's very prudent for banks to be retaining capital rather than distributing it in the current environment,"" he said. Losses will increase on existing loans, he said, meaning lenders need a bigger buffer to protect deposits and keep the bank running. ""It's important that the banks are given as much firepower as they can to support the economy,"" he added. However, the Bank said it did not expect the cash to be needed, noting that the banks had more than enough money in reserve to deal with both a global recession and a shock in the financial markets. Banks were criticised during the financial crisis 12 years ago when they paid dividends months before needing the biggest bailouts in history.  Since then, banks have been forced to hold more capital to prevent the need for more public money to be spent on them, although not all banks have fully recovered.  The government still owns 62% of Royal Bank of Scotland, for example. Barclays' investors will be the first to be affected by the halting of dividends. Its shareholders had been due to share a payment of more than £1bn on Friday. Barclays chairman Nigel Higgins said suspending the payment was a ""difficult decision"". ""The bank has a strong capital base, but we think it is right and prudent, for the many businesses and people that we support, to take these steps now, and ensure that Barclays is well placed to continue doing what we can to help through this crisis,"" he added. UK consumers are protected up to £85,000 per bank under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.  In other words, if a bank collapses, savers will get any money in these accounts up to £85,000 paid back in compensation. Joint accounts have a protection level of £170,000. This is a significant move from the commercial banks. They decided not to pay shareholders several billion pounds worth of dividends after receiving a firmly-worded letter from the Bank of England, which wants the banks to hold on to the money to support lending in the economy. And, with some of the payments due to be made in just days, the impact will be felt almost immediately by some shareholders. The Bank of England's watchdog, the Prudential Regulation Authority, also made clear that it does not expect any of the UK commercial banks to pay cash bonuses either, although that is yet to be agreed.  The logic here is to preserve cash for where it is needed, but the regulator has also been making the point that this crisis is a moment of potential redemption for the sector. The banks have the opportunity to distance themselves from the financial crisis, which they created, to become the economic saviours of the coronavirus crisis. But that depends on them preserving cashflow, overdrafts and funding lines to businesses that will become viable again once the pandemic passes.  For example, the chancellor's freelance worker scheme will result in substantial cash sums being deposited in bank accounts, but not until June, and much depends on banks keeping workers financially afloat until then. The cancellation of dividends also piles on the pressure for other sectors that have received money for furloughing workers - or even more direct government backing - to also consider scrapping their dividend payouts. ""These are difficult decisions, not least in terms of the immediate impact they will have on shareholders,"" said Barclays chairman Nigel Higgins. ""The bank has a strong capital base, but we think it is right and prudent, for the many businesses and people that we support, to take these steps now, and ensure that Barclays is well placed to continue doing what we can to help through this crisis."""
economic indicators,Putin's show: Which African leaders will have star role?,2024-09-15,2023-07-27,By Paul Melly,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-66300962,"When President Vladimir Putin opens the Russia-Africa summit in St Petersburg on Thursday, the attendance cast list will be closely scrutinised - in Paris, Washington, London, and at United Nations headquarters in New York. But Africans will view the event quite differently. For Western foreign ministries fretting about the Kremlin's declared ambition to expand its political, military and economic footprint south of the Sahara, the gathering is an indicator of how far Russia's influence could now extend and where it will meet a friendly welcome. Unlike the previous Russia-Africa summit in 2019, attended by 43 African leaders, this time only 17 are expected in St Petersburg. But which of them will take prominent speaking roles in the summit? What deals will be struck with Mr Putin? European and US policymakers until recently saw China as their main competitor in Africa - but now find themselves observing with deep unease Russia's assertive return, epitomised by the presence of Wagner mercenaries in Mali, the Central African Republic (CAR), Libya and, briefly, northern Mozambique. And of course, the invasion of Ukraine has dramatically heightened Western mistrust of Russia's ambitions around the world. Yet little suggests that African leaders share this perspective. Most countries on the continent, even those that have regularly voted at the UN to condemn the attack on Ukraine and its impact, do not want to get drawn into taking sides in a new ""Cold War"" or become pawns in a tussle for global influence and powerplays. In any case, Russia is just one of several major actors now stepping up efforts to court political and economic influence in Africa - alongside not only China, but also India, Turkey, the Gulf states, South Korea and, of course, Western nations and Japan. Having sometimes struggled in the past to mobilise international assistance in tackling their development and security challenges, African governments are not spurning these overtures.  And Russia knows this. In the run-up to the summit, its officials promised a new programme of support for the continent.  The summit agenda includes an ""economic and humanitarian forum"" and African business figures have been invited; the Kremlin promises a raft of agreements on trade, investment, scientific and technical cooperation.  In pursuing this agenda, Russia may be able to build on the academic and research ties developed during the Cold War era, when many Africans studied at Soviet universities.  But that does not mean most participants will approach St Petersburg with an uncritical mindset - even if diplomatic politeness prevents them from speaking frankly. Last month's African leaders' peace mission to Russia and Ukraine was blunt in telling Mr Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky that the war should be ended, for the sake of the rest of the world. And Moscow will hardly have bolstered goodwill by its decision to abandon the agreement for the safe export of both Ukrainian and Russian grain through Black Sea ports, even if Mr Putin has pledged to make up that shortfall. That promises to drive up food prices in numerous African countries, potentially fuelling urban protest and political pressure on the leaders. Mali - a loyal ally these days, its ruling junta partially reliant on Wagner's men to keep jihadist forces at bay - claims to be receiving a special shipment of Russian grain. But it is hard to imagine that Mr Putin could provide such hefty bilateral help to more than a clutch of close allies. Most African grain consumers will have to continue relying on the open world market - where supplies are now tightening and prices are on the rise. Mr Putin is well aware of this diplomatic fallout. Could he be waiting for the summit to perhaps offer a supposedly magnanimously return to the grain deal, on slightly tweaked terms? That's not the only delicate issue on the agenda. Displaced from Russia after his recent mutiny, Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin recently promised his men an expanded focus on African operations.  Despite his apparent falling out with Mr Putin, this would certainly help the Kremlin's drive to extend its capacity to influence African events, particularly in the hugely fragile Sahel region - where Niger's democratically elected President Mohamed Bazoum has been detained by soldiers in a coup bid that could have a major regional impact if it ultimately succeeds.  When Wagner moved into the CAR after President Faustin Archange Touadéra sought Russian help to overcome a UN arms embargo and rebuild his army in 2017-18, this at first looked like a bid for attention, aimed to send the message that ""Moscow is back"" after more than two decades of a low profile after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But by the time Wagner arrived in Mali in 2021, at the invitation of the soldiers who had seized power the year before, the role played by this private military contractor in Russia's security agenda, was viewed with a good deal more mistrust. Most other West African governments saw it as a direct threat to the security of their region. Their relations with Mali soured dramatically. And the coups that followed in Guinea and Burkina Faso, with pro-Russian youths cheering in the streets of the latter's capital Ouagadougou, have only deepened elected African governments' wariness of Moscow's strategy. But that does not mean they will disregard this week's summit. Instead, they will probably try to nudge the Kremlin towards a more conventional path of cooperative engagement, and away from support for the destabilisation of constitutional government and towards more conventional military partnerships through training and the supply of equipment and weapons. And Russia will try to secure their goodwill through a continuation of its economic diplomacy. While it lacks the resources to compete with the US, France, Germany and Japan or China as a bilateral development donor, Moscow does have some cards to play. Last year it was probably Africa's largest source of fertiliser, supplying 500,000 tonnes. It is also of course a significant power in oil, gas and mining. But the critically urgent trade sector right now remains grain. And it will be difficult for Russia to significantly help Africa with desperately needed extra supplies - and thus demonstrate its reliability as a partner - unless there is a restored Black Sea deal that also allows Ukrainian shipments to flow.  Earlier this week, Mr Putin claimed Russia had shipped close to 10 million tonnes of grain to Africa in the first half of this year and insisted that it was able to continue supplying the continent on both a commercial basis and free of charge.  A major boost in food aid would mark a sharp change of stance from a country that has been only a marginal humanitarian donor up to now.  However, even if arrangements to ship out safely from Black Sea ports are restored, there is little to suggest Moscow is really willing and organised to become a major food aid donor on a scale to compare with the likes of the European Union or the US. The political context has dramatically changed since African leaders flew to Sochi for the first Russia-Africa summit back in 2019. Over the past three years, apparently fuelled by a desire to unsettle France and other Western actors, the Kremlin has appeared at least tacitly sympathetic towards the military men who have seized power in Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea and who are viewed by the leaders of neighbouring states as a threat to regional stability.  The Malian regime's insistence that the UN withdraw its peacekeeping force, weakening the defence against spreading jihadist violence, has only deepened regional leaders' concern - and their consequent wariness of Russian policy. So even with a hefty goodwill boost to Russia grain shipments, Mr Putin may struggle to allay widespread West African mistrust, although his guests will be too discreet to express it.

economic indicators,Warm welcome for dollars and euros,2024-09-15,2023-06-19,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-65948190,"One of the more powerful motors of the Scottish economy continues to generate jobs. Inward investment by foreign companies is creating and sustaining jobs. The annual survey of such activity, by business consultancy EY, has found that Scotland remains the most attractive place in the UK for foreign direct investment (FDI) outside London. It's quite a distant second place, but a fairly consistent one - expanding its share for four consecutive years and second to London in nine of the past 10 surveys. EY totted up 126 inward investment projects, with nearly 14% of FDI projects, the highest yet. Some 11% of those polled among those who operate in the FDI field said Scotland was their top choice in the UK - again, a long way behind London, and down on last year's 15.8% showing, but a strong second place. While Scottish FDI project numbers grew, the UK registered overall decline of 6%, and growth in the European Union was only 1%. Do positive attitudes mean further investment will come this way?  The signs are good. A record high 19.2% of global inward investors - yet again, second to London - are planning to establish or expand operations in Scotland. Looking at this from city level, Scotland scores again, with Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen in the top five UK cities outside London. More than half the projects come from four countries - Germany, Ireland and Canada, while the USA accounts for nearly a third. And of those American commitments, a healthy proportion are looking to Scottish research and development expertise, or Scotland's digital technology skills. The EY 'attractiveness' survey is heavily and widely deployed by the Scottish government and its agencies,  and by the UK government, both to defend the country's economic record and to attract more investment. According to Adrian Gillespie, chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, the results are ""testament to the dynamic business environment that Scotland offers to investors, including our enviable skills base, world-class universities, vibrant innovation districts, ambitious entrepreneurial communities, and the outstanding quality of life on offer. At Highlands and Islands Enterprise, head of international trade Vicky Grant explains: ""We work closely with companies looking to invest here. We help them identify the ideal location, find premises, help with recruitment and training, and can often also help financially.  Beyond that, we continue working with them to make sure they have access to the full range of support they need to prosper."" But there's a warning in the small print.  Such projects come in many shapes and sizes - they can be small but high-value and strategically significant: they can bring lots of low-skill jobs to areas with poor work opportunities.  The jobs attached vary widely. In 2021, Scotland's tally of jobs attracted hit 10,000, up from 4,500 the year before. Last year, it halved, to 5,000. And many such projects either publish projected recruitment which doesn't work out as planned, or they don't give a headcount number at all. A further way of looking at this was recently published by Scottish Development International. Jointly controlled by the Scottish government and its agency Scottish Enterprise, this co-ordinates efforts to attract funds and build trade, and tells us it can claim credit for 8,500 jobs created or secured through its efforts last year.  The ones highlighted by deputy first minister Shona Robison earlier this month were 90 roles in Cumbernauld, printing labels for Scotch whisky bottles. The business goes back to Glasgow in the 1840s, but it is now part of Italian firm Eurostampa, with a new plant and a big increase in jobs. Much bigger numbers are being generated in aerospace and biotech. At the end of last month, pharma giant Merck announced it plans to create 500 jobs in Glasgow and Stirling for drug testing.  That will bring its Scottish workforce to 1200. That pattern is not unusual. Companies that try out some inward investment in Scotland can be persuaded to step up their presence. Across agencies, often co-ordinated by Scottish Development International, there is a well-oiled machine for building those relationships. Similarly, companies that commit first to London and the South-East - the first point of arrival, in many cases - look to the next best place to expand, where costs are lower.   That is where Team Scotland is ready with a package of incentives, including the hard financial ones, but often getting deals over the line by deploying Scotland's soft power; a round of golf, a nearby whisky distillery tour, its history and environment, more affordable property and its private schools for the kids of inbound senior executives. Many of the success stories these days are, unlike Merck, not big plants or manufacturing, but smaller scale operations tapping into Scotland's skills base for research labs. The labour pool and its flexibility is one of the attractions. There are clusters of industries in Scotland that mean a ready labour pool when a recruiter arrives in town; in finance, for instance, in financial technology, high and low-carbon energy and aerospace.  There are also areas of weakness. Inward investors struggle to find the scale of steel fabrication and engineering expertise to commit to large-scale manufacturing for the the renewable energy boom.  Without that well-lubricated and efficient business eco-system, they may struggle to live up to their commitments of local content when all those offshore wind turbines are installed. It's also no surprise that companies are buying British assets while sterling is so much weaker than it was. It's not just American tourists who find Britain very good value these days. And while FDI 'attractiveness' appears to be a welcome sign, the consequent effect on the economy is not entirely welcome. Where companies are taken over by foreign buyers, that can strip out the corporate base from which to grow internationally competitive firms based in Scotland. There is also the argument that dependence on foreign investment, orienting government agencies towards attracting more of it each year, is a poor substitute for a home-grown, self-confident economic strategy of company growth and export orientation from a Scottish base.  That relative weakening of sterling was accelerated by Brexit. Literally overnight as referendum results came in, the value of sterling fell, and it has remained much weaker than it previously was against the US dollar, falling close to parity during last year's market meltdown provoked by the Liz Truss/Kwasi Kwarteng mini-budget. On the plus side, there has not so far been the exodus of foreign investors who can no longer use the UK as a welcoming and relatively business-friendly base with which to exploit seamless links through Europe's single market.  Through exiting the single market, some inward investment has come into the UK to set up separate entities and distribution bases. More often, it has forced British companies to set up separate entities and distribution bases in the European Union, to avoid the delays and disruption to trade, and - particularly for finance - to trade within EU rules and regulations. That process has added cost to international trade. Twinned with the shock to the system from Brexit has been the UK government's push to 'level up'. And that's where Scotland's success with FDI highlights the broader picture from the annual EY figures, showing how much London is the magnet for inward investment and how much other parts of England are not. There may be signs in this year's EY 'attractiveness' survey of that shifting.  London's dominance over the rest of the UK has fallen away sharply, from 49% of inward investment projects at its peak in 2019 to 32% last year. There was a fall from 394 projects in 2021 to 299 last year. South-east and south-west England saw decline, while there was growth elsewhere. Across the north of England, that growth was by 24%, weighted heavily to the North-West, with 88 projects. That could signal a rebalancing of economic activity, but lots of other indicators will have to move in the same direction.  A committee of MPs, with a Conservative majority, last month tore into the UK government for the shortcomings of its efforts to level up. They see it as far too short-term, driven by competitive bidding rather than strategy, undermined by the politicised way in which funding was allocated, and failing to mesh with any of the devolved administrations, including Holyrood. The current occupants of Downing Street are reported to see it as a legacy of the Boris Johnson era, suffering from too much muddle over what it is trying to achieve and how to go about it, but with the north of England politically in play, it's not a policy Rishi Sunak could kill off. The flipside to Scotland's success in this is England's weakness. There is always the possibility that English regions get more powers and get their act together, drawing on the lessons of inward investment from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  A charismatic mayor may help. Freeports ought to attract more investment of all sorts, though they may not add to the total for the country. But England is still waiting for the catalyst and political commitment that will make the economy in much of the country any more than merely London's hinterland."
economic indicators,Investment by Scottish firms 'rising',2024-09-15,2018-04-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-43816967,"Levels of investment are rising across Scottish businesses amid growing expectations of a strong year, according to a new economic survey. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) found that many firms were looking to invest in capital and training to improve their prospects. This was despite some sectors remaining ""fragile"" in terms of overall business confidence.  A total of 385 firms responded to SCC's latest quarterly economic indicator. The survey, produced in collaboration with Strathclyde University's Fraser of Allander Institute, covers construction, tourism, retail and wholesale, manufacturing and financial services. It suggested that every sector expected to see sales revenues increase in the second quarter, with firms anticipating that investment will gain rapid returns. While many construction firms reported lower sales revenue in the first quarter, the report suggested there were ""encouraging signs"" for the sector, with private commercial orders up significantly, and cash flow and profitability improving.    Meanwhile, retail and tourism business said they continued to face ""challenging domestic conditions"". Neil Amner, chairman of the SCC economic advisory group, said: ""The results of SCC's first quarterly economic indicator of 2018 show that while the economy has not been without challenges, most sectors are reporting increasing levels of investment across capital and training. ""It is clear that businesses are adapting to the changing economic environment and have positive expectations for the quarter ahead."" Prof Graeme Roy, of the Fraser of Allander Institute, said there were ""notable reasons to be positive"", including increased investment. However, he warned that the construction sector, which had been a ""major drag on growth"", continued to remain ""fragile"" in the face of falling public sector orders. Prof Roy added: ""Overall, the survey finds that Scottish businesses are remaining resilient to uncertain trading conditions."""
economic indicators,The week ahead in Parliament,2024-09-15,2020-03-09,By Mark D'Arcy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-51775687,"It's Budget week - in fact, the first Budget week for more than a year.  The last time a chancellor posed with his red box on the steps of 11 Downing Street, for the traditional photo-op, was when Philip Hammond summoned up a grin back on 29 October 2018.  Since then, a combination of a lack of a majority and a general election have delayed the next exciting episode of UK fiscal policy - resulting in the longest gap between budgets since the 19th Century.  The simple fact of that interval will mean there is a lot in the package Rishi Sunak will lay before MPs, particularly the implementation of some promised changes to National Insurance thresholds, targeted at lower income earners. And there is chatter about a big new policy initiative on skills. But this will be a Budget delivered under the shadow of the cornonavirus and the economic uncertainty which has caused stock markets and US interest rates to drop, which suggests the new chancellor may have to keep at least some of his powder dry.  So, while he may be able to set out the spending envelope for the coming year, the announcement of big ticket infrastructure investments might, prudently, be delayed until the effect of any epidemic is clearer. Even the usual blizzard of economic forecasts that come with a Budget are a little devalued, because they will have been compiled before the virus became a factor - so what are expected to be quite anaemic growth predictions (UK growth at maybe 0.8% according to the last Bank of England forecast) may be discounted even further by the commentators.  But this will not be the only big parliamentary economic event of the year - there's a major spending review in progress, which could provide the opportunity for big positive announcements later on and, for those who remember the halcyon days of Denis Healey, there's always the possibility of a mini-budget.  Beyond that, this will be an important test for Mr Sunak. His quantum leap up the political pecking order, from new MP in 2015 to the second most important job in the government in under five years, means he is pretty untested as a cabinet-level parliamentarian - and he will be expected to display both substance and style in what are clearly going to be rather awkward circumstances.  But it's also worth remembering he was Boris Johnson's stand-in for one of the TV debates in the election, so his colleagues clearly believe he can handle high-profile challenges.  Behind the scenes on Monday, the House of Commons Commission - the administrative arm of the House - will be meeting their Lords opposite numbers - with Parliament's response to the coronavirus on the agenda.  There's a swirling internal debate about banning tourists and school parties from visiting as an initial precaution - with the thought that if the virus really takes hold, the work of Parliament could be limited to emergency business, although talk of Parliament being suspended until September is being played down by the Speaker and Lord Speaker.  In practice, any decision on that would come from the government, not the parliamentary authorities. There would have to be cross-party agreement, allowing laws to be passed by a quorum of MPs - the legal minimum is 40 MPs, plus the speaker and deputy, but it's more likely there would be 100 of the 650 MPs present at Westminster. The commission will also be meeting to look at the issues around the plan to move Parliament out of its Victorian home for the multi-billion pound Restoration and Renewal project (R&R for short). This is happening amidst rising chatter of ditching the whole scheme in favour of a patch and mend approach, which would keep the parliamentarians in situ while different sections of the building were closed off - although many others believe this would be impractical. The Northern Estate Project is the vehicle for the attack. This is the scheme to upgrade parliamentary offices across the road from the palace of Westminster and to rebuild Richmond House, the old Department of Health HQ, to house a temporary Commons chamber and provide more office space. If that is halted then MPs will not be able to move out and the whole R&R project will be derailed. Here's my rundown of the rest of the week ahead.  The Commons week begins (14:30 GMT) with questions to the Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey and her team.  That may well be followed by some post-weekend ministerial statements and urgent questions.  Then the Lib Dem Wera Hobhouse will present a bill to make misogyny an aggravating factor in criminal sentencing, and the Conservative Philip Hollobone will present a rival bill to make misogyny and misandry - dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against the male sex - aggravating factors.  Neither bill will be debated, but it's clear some Conservative MPs at least are reacting against the stream of presentation bills put down by Lib Dem women. Next is the second reading of the Birmingham Commonwealth Games Bill, which enacts the kind of necessary temporary measures seen around previous major sporting events. It covers matters like unauthorised tickets sales, commercial rights and transport around games locations.  In Westminster Hall (16:30) there's the first Petitions Committee debate of the new Parliament on an e-petition calling for the government to provide 15 hours free childcare to working parents for children over nine-months-old, which attracted 146,397 signatures. In the Lords (14:30), questions to ministers cover the gender pay gap, Sport England's ""This Girl Can"" campaign and ensuring the government will have ""the most ambitious environmental programme of any country on Earth"" in time for COP26 - as promised in the 2019 Conservative Party manifesto. Then peers turn to their third day of committee stage scrutiny of the Fisheries Bill. The Commons opens (11:30) with an hour of health and social care questions - which will certainly include the latest coronavirus update. Conservative Gareth Johnson has a Ten Minute Rule Bill to allow the courts to ban disruptive passengers from flying.  Then MPs turn to the report and third reading debate on the Telecommunications Infrastructure (Leasehold Property) Bill - and there may well be a significant backbench Conservative rebellion on what had seemed a pretty humdrum measure to allow 5G communications infrastructure to be installed in buildings with uncooperative owners. Conservative backbenchers, headed by the former party leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, have put down an amendment to restrict the ability of ""high risk vendors"" to provide this vital new infrastructure - in particular the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei, which they argue is controlled by the Chinese state.  This is serious because it is a direct policy challenge to the government.  It is not a done deal that this amendment will be selected for debate, despite a long list of heavyweight backers, including former cabinet ministers Damian Green, David Davis and Owen Paterson, Foreign Affairs Select Committee chair Tom Tugendhat, and the lurking presence in support of 1922 Committee chair Sir Graham Brady.  And it's worth pointing out that Labour, in the form of shadow minister Chi Onwurah, proposed a not dissimilar amendment at committee stage, where DCMS minister Matt Warman promised there would be new controls on high-risk vendors, who would be excluded from all safety-related and safety-critical networks in critical national infrastructure, excluded from the security-critical core network functions and limited to a minority presence of up to 35% in the other parts of the network, as well as being subject to tight restrictions, including exclusions from sensitive locations.  He also said the government's decision on high-risk vendors was evidence-based and taken on a comprehensive security assessment, as well as noting the realities of the telecoms market - which I think means Huawei is the only credible supplier in the government's view. The debate is followed by the first Backbench Business Committee debate of the new Parliament, on lesbian, bisexual and trans women's health inequalities, led by the Conservative ex-minister Crispin Blunt, and the SNP's Hannah Bardell. More and more select committee inquiries are under way: the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee will take evidence (09:30) from Britain's top civil servant, the Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, and Sir John Manzoni, Civil Service chief executive and permanent secretary to the Cabinet Office.  Following the spectacular resignation of the permanent secretary to the Home Office, Sir Philip Rutnam, and his allegation of constructive dismissal and bullying against the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, the committee will examine the working relationships between government ministers and officials, and also look at the appointment, terms of employment and accountability of special advisers. Bring popcorn. Elsewhere, the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee holds the first hearing (10:30) in its inquiry on issues emerging from the Horizon IT Court cases, looking at the impact on sub-postmasters and its effect on the future viability of the Post Office, and examining the lessons the government and Post Office Ltd have learned from a scandal which saw hundreds of sub-postmasters accused and, in some cases, wrongly convicted of fraud.  In the Lords (14:30), questions have an International Women's Day flavour, covering the financial sustainability of women's refuges, equal pay legislation and gender equality education, before peers move on to their annual International Women's Day debate. A big day in the Commons opens (11:30) with half an hour of Women and Equalities questions, with International Trade Secretary Liz Truss answering for the government. Then comes Prime Minister's Questions, as an appetiser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, and the Budget.   A series of themed days of debate on the Budget will follow - although there will be a brief interlude between PMQs and the Budget, in which Lib Dem Sarah Olney will present a bill to ban anti-abortion protests within 150 meters of abortion clinics (but this will be a very brief parliamentary ritual, without debate). My pick of the day's Westminster Hall debates is the one on the mental health of veterans (11:00).  Lib Dem Jamie Stone has a private members bill to ring fence a section of the NHS budget for the care of military veterans and will ask the government to provide debating time to ensure it makes it into law. He will also highlight the disturbing rise in veteran suicides and argue that the country owes veterans lifelong support.  In the Lords (15:00), questions to ministers cover the economic crisis and food emergency in Zimbabwe, gender segregation in publicly funded apprenticeships, and the increase in the number of people with dementia admitted to A&E departments. Then peers move on to their fourth day of committee stage scrutiny of the Fisheries Bill.  The Commons opens (09:30) with Transport Questions, followed by the weekly Commons Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Jacob Rees-Mogg. Look out for notice of any coronavirus-related emergency legislation.  After that, the Budget debate continues - but we won't know the themes allotted to each day of the debate until the Budget is delivered. My committee corridor pick is the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport hearing (09:45) on the work of the BBC, with the new committee chair, Julian Knight leading the questioning of the BBC Director General, Lord Tony Hall, and BBC Chairman Sir David Clementi. In the Lords (11:00), questions range from the results of the Republic of Ireland general election and the eradication of Japanese Knotweed to arrangements for the climate change conference COP26.  The main debates are on subjects raised by backbench peers - on the case for the government to use wellbeing as a key indicator of national performance when setting budgets, and on investing in, and embracing, the green economy. It's the Commons' first Private Members Bill Friday of the new Parliament (from 09:30) starting with the Second Reading of the Education (Guidance about Costs of School Uniforms) Bill from Labour's Mike Amesbury. He aims to make school uniforms affordable by changing the law so schools and governing bodies must make affordability a key consideration when setting their uniform policies.  The idea is to stop large proportions of the uniforms from being branded items or only exclusively available from school shops or at high-priced retailers.  If passed, the bill would allow parents to buy uniforms from supermarkets and other cheaper suppliers, and then school identities could be sewn on later. Then comes the Second Reading of the Conservative Bim Afolami's British Library Board (Power to Borrow) Bill.   At the moment the British Library is banned by law from borrowing money, but removing the ban would allow it to strengthen its traditional offering by borrowing to extend the advice and guidance services it already provides to people starting up small businesses.  This is mostly done in London and a couple of big cities at the moment, and the aim of the bill is to allow those services to be extended to more of the country Third on the agenda, and therefore unlikely to have all that much time for debate, is the Second Reading of the Education and Training (Welfare of Children) Bill, proposed by Labour's Mary Kelly Foy. This seeks to put a statutory duty on all providers of post-16 education and training to safeguard and promote the welfare of children.  At the moment, this duty falls on schools, further education colleges and sixth form colleges, but not on 16-19 academies or independent training providers, and the bill seeks to end that anomaly. Next on the agenda - although it's unlikely MPs will have much, if any, time to debate them - comes a series of bills proposed by Conservative awkward squaddie, and frequent Friday flyer, Sir Christopher Chope, namely the Public Sector Exit Payments (Limitation) Bill, the Green Belt Protection Bill and the Bat Habitats Regulation Bill.  If he's lucky, he may get a few minutes to make the case for one of them.  There are also Private Members Bills in the Lords (10:00) - the Second Reading of Labour's Lord Grocott's umpteenth version of the House of Lords (Hereditary Peers) (Abolition of By-Elections) Bill should provide some entertainment, because the minister likely to be responding for the government is Lord True. He is now at the Cabinet Office, but was previously one of the peers who had attempted to talk out previous incarnations of this measure.  The bill would have the effect of allowing the hereditary component of the House to wither away, by blocking the process by which hereditary peers who die or retire are replaced. Another popcorn moment. Next comes the second reading of the Big Issue founder Lord Bird's Wellbeing of Future Generations Bill, which aims to create a ""future generations test"" for all new policy changes.  The idea is to revolutionise how laws and policies are made by requiring them to enhance the environmental, economic, social and cultural well-being of current and future generations, making life better for all people in the UK.  It mirrors the Welsh Assembly's Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, which had at its heart a duty on all public bodies, including Welsh ministers, to act in accordance with a sustainable development principle."
economic indicators,What's driving Chile's protests?,2024-09-15,2019-10-21,By Reality Check,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-50123494,"Demonstrators across Chile have been expressing their anger at high levels of inequality and the cost of living. So, we've taken a look at whether the difference between rich and poor in Chile is actually rising and how this inequality compares with other countries. First, let's compare Chile's inequality with other countries. We've looked at the Gini index, the most widely used international measure of inequality - for which the higher the number, the greater the inequality. This shows Chile ranks as one of the most unequal country among a group of 30 of the world's wealthiest nations.  ""It has been a highly unequal country for years,"" says Javier Sajuria, a senior lecturer in politics at Queen Mary University. He says the data indicates inequality has actually been falling but possibly ""not fast enough"", which could in part explain the outpouring of anger. Another way to consider inequality is by looking at the incomes of the richest and poorest.  In 2006, the richest 20% earned 10 times more than the poorest 20%, according to a government survey.  In 2017, that figure had fallen to 8.9 - indicating the income gap between rich and poor had in fact narrowed slightly. ""This isn't about political parties"" one protestor, Constanza Gonzalez, told BBC News. ""People are angry and this was a thing that had been coming for quite a long time."" The Chilean government conducts a national household survey every two years and provides a measure of how many in the country are facing poverty. This includes people who struggle to buy enough food to survive as well as those spending a large proportion of their family income on food.  These figures suggest a consistent and significant fall in poverty over the past decade. Real wages (adjusted for inflation) have been increasing by about 4% over the last five years, according to government statistics. The median (middle) monthly wage in 2018 was 400,000 Chilean pesos, about $550. Close to half the country earns this much. The economic indicators we've looked at here suggest improving economic conditions for many in Chile over the past decade. But it's also a country with one of the highest levels of inequality among the world's industrialised countries.  Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter"
economic indicators,"Irish economy grew by 3% last year, FDD suggests",2024-09-15,2020-03-06,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51769585,"Ireland's domestic economy grew by 3% in 2019, official figures suggest. The economic performance was assessed using the final domestic demand (FDD) measure - a way of stripping out some of the effects of multinational firms. Ireland's national accounts tend to be distorted by the activities of global companies which use Dublin as a centre for financing and taxation operations. FDD includes personal and government consumption and investment but excludes things like aircraft leasing. Gross domestic product (GDP), an increasingly unreliable way of assessing the Irish economy, grew by 5.5%. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said it was clear the domestic economy is ""growing at a robust rate"". ""These figures are very much in line with a range of other indicators such as employment growth and taxation receipts,"" he added. ""For instance, the level of employment increased by 2.9% last year, the seventh straight year of employment growth of that rate or higher."" However, Mr Donohoe cautioned that Ireland was now entering ""a precarious trading environment as a result of the spread of coronavirus""."
economic indicators,China economy rebounds after Covid measures lifted,2024-09-15,2023-04-18,By Monica Miller,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65307471,"China's economy grew faster than expected in the first three months of the year, as the country emerged from its tough Covid restrictions. Compared to the same period last year, gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.5%, official figures show. The key measure of economic activity was driven up by a boost in household spending and rising factory activity. Beijing pledged to boost the world's second largest economy when it lifted coronavirus measures in December. Also on Tuesday, separate data for March showed that retail sales, the main indicator of household consumption, jumped by 10.6%, compared to a year earlier. At the same time, output from the country's factories rose by 3.9%, although that slightly missed forecasts. Meanwhile, there was also evidence of a strong rebound for the country's airline industry. China Civil Aviation Administration data showed that more than 45 million air passenger trips were taken last month, an almost threefold increase on the same time last year.  The country resumed processing visa applications in March after announcing a major easing of restrictions. Investors had been eagerly waiting for the figures to get clues on the strength of China's recovery after the government lifted coronavirus measures. Beijing has also eased a three-year-long crackdown on big technology companies and property developers. However, one analyst told the BBC that, while the latest figures are strong, that pace of growth is unlikely to continue. ""What's more likely to happen in the coming months is that people might get over the initial high after the reopening,"" Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank (China) said. ""Manufacturing demand might decline, which cannot sustain a boom in exports because the global economy is slowing down rather than speeding up,"" she added. Authorities, including  the People's Bank of China, have promised to increase support for the pledged to step up support for China's economy to help curb unemployment but are limited in what measures they can take. Last year, China's GDP growth slumped to one of the lowest levels in nearly half a century due to coronavirus measures.  GDP is one of the most important tools for looking at how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It helps businesses judge when to expand and hire more people, and lets governments work out how much to tax and spend."
economic indicators,UK economy slows as car sales fall,2024-09-15,2018-12-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46505692,"Growth in the UK's economy has slowed as car sales fell and the manufacturing sector stalled, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said. The economy grew by 0.4% in the three months to October, slower than the 0.6% in the three months to September. The UK's trade deficit also widened as imports grew faster than exports in October. Economists expect growth to slow in the last three months of the year. The latest three-month growth figure follows a stronger-than-expected set of data for the three months to September, when the economy grew at its fastest pace since late 2016 buoyed by consumers spending in the warm weather. ""GDP growth slowed going into the autumn after a strong summer, with a softening in services sector growth mainly due to a fall in car sales,"" said  Rob Kent-Smith, head of national accounts at the ONS. ""This was offset by a strong showing from IT and accountancy."" ""Manufacturing saw no growth at all in the latest three months, mainly due to a decline in the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry,"" he added. ""Construction, while slowing slightly, continued its recent solid performance with growth in housebuilding and infrastructure."" The services sector grew by 0.3% on the three-month rolling measure - the lowest since the three months to April 2018.  The sector's performance is closely watched as it makes up 80% of the economy. There were some negative signs in the latest economic growth figures, but on the whole they were benign, with services such as accountancy driving modest economic growth.  But here we meet the frustration of lagging economic indicators. If we want to know what effect the upheaval at Westminster over the Brexit withdrawal agreement has had, the more recent indicators tell a less benign story. In November, retail sales grew by 0.5 per cent overall (including online). But if you exclude food they were flat, and sales in shops were down. Similarly, the leading indicator of business activity, the purchasing managers' index which tracks buying decisions by business executives, recorded its worst reading in the services sector since the month after the referendum, July 2016. Activity expanded, but only just. Unfortunately we won't know the effect of Theresa May's troubles on November's economic growth (GDP) until January, by which time it will be far too late to influence decision making.    GDP grew by 0.1% in October - after being flat in both September and August. In October, the first month of the last quarter of the year, the services sector was the only major part of the economy to expand. Industrial production fell 0.6%, with manufacturing output down 0.9%. Output in the construction industry fell 0.2%. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the latest growth figures ""come on the heels of more up-to-date survey evidence which suggests the economy is approaching stall speed and could even contract as we move into 2019 unless demand revives"". In October, the UK imported more than it exported despite the weakness in the pound. The trade deficit widened to £3.1bn in October, the ONS said, as imports increased by £3.6bn, faster than the amount exported, which rose by £1.9bn.   The ONS also revised the trade data for September, which now shows a deficit of £2.3bn compared with £0.1bn. ""The widening in the UK's trade deficit is a concern and reflects a sharp rise in goods imports,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). ""Trading conditions for UK exporters are deteriorating amid moderating global growth and uncertainty over Brexit. Businesses continue to report that the persistent weakness in sterling is hurting as much as its helping, with the weakening currency raising input costs."" With October marking the start of the fourth quarter, economists said the economy's progress in remaining months of the year could be determined by Brexit negotiations. Mr Williamson said: ""The outlook for growth... very much depends on Brexit developments over the coming days, weeks and months, and the surrounding uncertainty makes forecasting extremely difficult. ""However, what's clearly evident is that the widely-expected slowing of the economy in the lead-up to the UK's separation from the EU is now upon us, leaving the big question of whether the economy will bounce back alongside a smooth Brexit process or slide into decline,"" he said. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said that surveys of the services sector were also showing weak growth which do ""not augur well"" for the last quarter of the year. Capital Economics is forecasting annual GDP growth of 1.3% for this year - the lowest since the financial crisis."
economic indicators,Chinese economy continues its pandemic bounce back,2024-09-15,2021-03-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56397602,"Key economic data in China surged dramatically in the first two months of 2021, pointing to a continued recovery for the world's second largest economy. China's industrial output grew 35.1% in January and February compared to the same months last year. The strong numbers are distorted because they are compared to 2020, when most of China's factories were in pandemic lockdown.   But Monday's slew of economic data still beat analysts' expectations. Looking back to 2019 before the pandemic hit may give a more accurate picture of what is happening to economic activity in China. Industrial output was up 16.9% compared with the first two months of 2019, highlighting the stronger output. A rebound in foreign demand has helped push export growth higher for China, often called the world's factory.   The Chinese government has set a modest annual economic growth target for 2021, at above 6%, even though analysts are tipping growth of around 8%.  China was the only major economy last year to report positive growth, with an expansion of 2.3%. A spokeswoman for China's statistics bureau Liu Aihua told reporters the economy should continue its recovery. However, she said there are still imbalances in the economic recovery and that China needs to step up support for consumption.  Retail sales, another key economic indicator, climbed 33.8% in the period, although the jobless rate was 5.5% at the end of February, up from 5.2% in December. Economists have pointed to a two-speed track for China, with strong industrial output and export demand but a lagging consumer recovery. The government imposed travel restrictions before the Chinese New Year holidays, which fell in February this year. This suppressed spending on travel, restaurants and leisure activities. However, retail sales data showed the top growth items were jewellery (up 99%) and cars (up 78%). ""These items tell us that Chinese consumers spent lavishly during the Chinese New Year holiday,"" said Iris Pang, Chief Economist for Greater China, at ING bank."
economic indicators,Spain faces local election shake-up,2024-09-15,2015-05-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32863176,"Voting is taking place in more than 8,000 towns and cities Spaniards are voting in regional and municipal elections that could challenge the grip of the country's two main parties. Seats in all of the local councils are at stake, as well as places in 13 of the 17 regional parliaments. Opinion polls suggest that the ruling party and its main rival could both be punished by voters.  Sunday's vote is seen as an important barometer of opinion ahead of national elections later this year. ""There is no doubt that a majority of Spaniards want change. What they want now are governments that make pacts and engage in dialogue,"" Jose Pablo Ferrandiz, from pollster Metroscopia, told the AFP news agency. Disenchantment about the main parties weighed heavily among voters - one man described them as the ""usual parties always doing the same thing"".  More than 35m people are registered to vote The economy is a major factor in the elections Casting his ballot, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy urged all Spaniards to vote for ""whoever they see fit"". Spain's economic crisis and a series of corruption scandals have damaged the reputations of both Mr Rajoy's conservative Popular Party (PP) and the leading opposition, the Socialists (PSOE) party.  Analysts say that the PP could lose its majority in almost all of the 10 regions it currently controls. The vote could open the door for newer parties such as the centre-right Ciudadanos and the radical anti-austerity party Podemos.  Podemos - meaning ""We can"" - came third in Andalusia's regional election in March.  The PSOE, who have governed Andalusia for more than 30 years, were left short of a majority.  The elections are seen as a key indicator for the national vote later this year Upstart parties Ciudadanos and Podemos could do well ""Tonight our city halls and regions will begin to change and Spain will also begin to change,"" Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias said while voting in Madrid. Ciudadanos (meaning ""Citizens"") has a pro-business agenda and is seen as a threat to the PP. ""We have to vote and change things,"" said Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera. ""The power is in our hands, in the hands of citizens. So I ask Spaniards to take part so that we won't regret it tomorrow and so that those we don't like are not allowed to stay in power.""

economic indicators,German economy barely grows at end of 2019,2024-09-15,2020-02-14,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51503542,"The German economy had another very weak three months at the end of last year, according to official figures. Gross domestic product (GDP), the total production of goods and services, was almost unchanged from the previous quarter. Germany is very exposed to the tensions in international trade, and the weak new figures partly reflect a fall in overseas exports. Compared with the same period in 2018, GDP was higher by just 0.4%.  Although there was some expansion, growth was reported at 0.0%  when rounded to one decimal place by the German statistics office. The sluggish performance was down partly to a decline in exports.  Investment in machinery and equipment was also ""down considerably"" between October and December. The statistics office doesn't offer an explanation, but it is certainly possible that that reflects the uncertain outlook for international trade.  One factor that is likely to weigh on manufacturing firms when considering whether to invest is what sort of barriers they will face which could make it more difficult to sell their goods abroad.  Exporting really matters to German industry. The country is the third-largest exporter of goods after the United States and China, which are both much larger economies.   Manufacturing accounts for a larger share of German economic activity than it does for most other developed economies: 20% compared with 9% for the UK, for example, and 10% for the US.  Germany is very exposed to the tensions in international trade that have arisen, or at least become more intense, since US President Donald Trump took office.  That related directly to new tariffs that his administration has applied to aluminium and steel tariffs, and indirectly to the trade war between the US and China. Because both countries are important markets for German industry, any damage they inflict on one another can affect sales of German goods. Germany would also be vulnerable if President Donald Trump was to act on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports of cars from the European Union. Economic growth in Germany has been relatively weak over the last two years.  There have been two quarters when GDP has declined. These have not taken place consecutively though, so there has been no recession as the term is often defined - two back-to-back quarters of negative growth. The wider eurozone more widely has also been affected and that was underlined by new figures published by the EU's office for statistics, Eurostat. It confirmed its earlier estimate that the eurozone managed growth of just 0.1% in the last quarter of 2019.  Germany is the area's largest economy, so the eurozone's figures are, as a matter of arithmetic, dragged down when Germany has a weak period.  But the next two largest economies also had a bad end to last year. Both Italy and France saw their national economies shrink.  There are some bright spots in the eurozone, though. Ireland has stood out with strong growth for some time, although there are no figures available yet for the most recent period.  While Germany and the eurozone may have had a downbeat period in terms of growth, employment has been more encouraging.  New figures show an increase of 0.3% in the number of people who do have jobs in the eurozone.   Germany has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the world.  The eurozone as whole is higher, and some countries notably Spain and Greece still have a serious problem.  But for both the eurozone and those nations, unemployment has fallen far from the highs it reached in the last decade. "
economic indicators,Covid-19 putting children's services 'in crisis',2024-09-15,2021-04-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-tyne-56676794,"With local elections taking place on 6 May, the pandemic has highlighted some of the pressures councils are under. One of these is children's services; the government estimated that nationally councils spent an additional £136m on child social care between March and June last year. Durham County Council said it was using part of its reserves to put an extra £1m into children's services. Hartlepool Council said it faced a children's social care budget pressure of £2.5m, with 360 children in care. It described it as ""the biggest number ever cared for by the council"" and ""broadly the number of children in a typical primary school"". However, while the additional demands of Covid have accentuated this financial squeeze, it is a problem which has been growing for some time. Spending on services councils must provide by law for safeguarding and looking after children in care has risen 29% since 2010, according to the Children's Services Funding Alliance. That group, which comprises Action for Children, National Children's Bureau, Barnardo's, The Children's Society and the NSPCC, said that means other services such as youth centres and children's centres, which do not legally have to be provided, have been cut, with 1,760 closing nationally since 2010. It added that in the North East, money available for children's services excluding schools had fallen by a third per child since 2010. Stacey Wilson, from Newcastle, gave birth to Skye-Elouise during the first lockdown. The 35-year-old single mother said she could not have managed without help from the Newcastle Parent Infant partnership. She said: ""It was amazing, just helping me mentally, helping with my anxiety, encouraging me to leave the house more, putting me in touch with people who could bring me food or help with housing and stuff. ""They were brilliant from the start, [it] changed my life."" However, the funding for that scheme, a five-year grant from central government to Newcastle City Council, is due to run out in June. Ms Wilson said that while she can now manage, Children North East, which runs the project, said others will be hard hit. Lesley Hutchinson from the charity said: ""Local authorities are in an incredibly difficult position, it's been a very, very difficult year for all of us. ""Because of the pandemic we know there is going to be increased need coming up. ""We're going to have a whole cohort of babies who haven't experienced some of the normal things that babies would experience - they haven't been able to go out and socialise in groups, they haven't met anyone outside of their immediate family. We know the need is there."" Imran Hussain, from the charity Action For Children, said that the pandemic had put extra demands on children's services departments, adding: ""All the indicators are flashing red, and have been flashing red for a while. ""We're in a crisis, and when a system is in crisis one of the things you get is rationing."" The Department for Education said it had invested millions of pounds, including helping families with pandemic pressures. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

economic indicators,Huge falls in production and services output,2024-09-15,2020-09-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-54190464,"Between April and July this year, two parts of the Northern Ireland economy saw their biggest fall since 2005.  Official figures show services - the largest sector of the NI economy - reported an almost 18% fall in output. The decrease was caused by declines in retail, food service and accommodation, as well as information and communications services.  Figures also show the production sector reported a 15% fall in output between April and June. Production is made up of manufacturing, water, electricity and mining.  On Thursday afternoon, a County Down printing company became the latest casualty of the downturn as it announced it had gone into administration with the loss of 40 jobs. Newtownards firm Peninsula Print and Design, which had been trading for more than 30 years, said it had experienced ""sudden and catastrophic"" losses over the past six months. While staff members had been on the government furlough scheme, a major slump in new orders meant the business had no other option but to close, it said. While these are huge falls in both services and production, they are not surprising given the number of businesses which effectively had to close overnight.  Ulster Bank chief economist Richard Ramsey suggests the figures are actually better than some had predicted. In a tweet, Mr Ramsey the ""economic indicator freak show continues"". ""These record rates of decline are arguably better than expected. But like a game of snakes and ladders, services output is now below 2005 levels,"" he posted.  If we take a look at the breakdown of different services, for example, hospitality output fell by less in Northern Ireland than the rest of the UK.  The biggest fall was in ""other"" services, which includes everything from beauty salons to dentists, as well as leisure, arts and entertainment.  Activity fell by almost 40% but many of these services were restricted during lockdown.  What will be important is the speed at which each of these sectors can recover as lockdown is eased.  The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) said both the services and production sectors reported the biggest quarterly fall since their records began 15 years ago. It said the statistical release captured the direct effects of the coronavirus pandemic and measures taken to reduce transmission of the virus. ""The most significant was the introduction of restrictions in movement, which began on 23 March 2020,"" the agency said. ""Quarter 2 (April to June) 2020 is the first quarter that has been affected from start to finish."""
economic indicators,Decline in export orders for NI firms,2024-09-15,2019-03-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-47496453,"Northern Ireland firms saw their steepest decline in new export orders in more than five years during February, Ulster Bank research has suggested. The bank provides a monthly survey of private sector activity. Its research is considered to be a reliable indicator of the economy. The latest survey also suggests companies reduced their staffing levels for the second month running. The bank's chief economist suggests the February performance reflects ""peak uncertainty"" over Brexit.  Richard Ramsey said: ""Private sector firms saw a marked deterioration in business conditions. ""We saw output growth almost grinding to a halt, employment falling, new orders decreasing, and export orders falling at their fastest pace in 69 months."" The services sector, which is the largest part of the economy, continued to expand; manufacturing was flat with falls in activity for construction and retail. The data also suggests that manufacturing firms have been stockpiling both inputs and finished goods over the past three months. Mr Ramsey said the weakening performance cannot be solely attributed to Brexit-related uncertainty. ""There are other factors at play, including the wider economic slowdown across Europe, concerns over global trade, and the ongoing restructuring of the retail sector."" Meanwhile, Intertrade Ireland, the cross-border trade promotion body, has reported a surge in applications for its Brexit planning vouchers. The vouchers provide up to £2,000 towards professional advice and up to £2,500 towards implementing critical business changes. The scheme was launched in 2017, but a third of all applications have come since the start of this year. Aidan Gough from Intertrade Ireland said: ""As we move closer to the March 29th deadline, the message is that it's still not too late to make preparations."""
economic indicators,'Deeply worrying' economic divergence,2024-09-15,2022-01-25,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-60090797,"Evidence of Scotland's economic under-performance is ""deeply worrying"".  The official forecast for the impact of low wages, poor productivity and changing demographics on income tax receipts could ""if they come to pass, put Scotland's fiscal sustainability at risk"". It's not the habitual doom-mongers saying this (amongst whom, I admit, I can sometimes be found).  This is the finance and public administration committee of the Scottish Parliament, convened by an MSP from the governing party, Kenny Gibson, with Ross Greer of the Scottish Greens effectively assuring the government a majority. While journalists write and talk of parliamentary committees being ""powerful"", mainly to big up their stories, this grouping is just that - or ought to be - and particularly in scrutinising budgets. It's been reflecting on the budget plans for the year starting in April this year.  It has published its findings. They go to a debate of the Parliament on Wednesday afternoon this week, and a vote on Thursday at stage one of the Budget Bill. Finance secretary Kate Forbes has no worries this year about getting a majority. That's what two Greens are in ministerial offices to guarantee. She has much more to worry her in the content of the committee's report, feeding through from an alarming set of forecasts from the Scottish Fiscal Commission.  To jog your memory, that's the official body that provides ministers with the forecasts for tax revenue on which they must base their arithmetic. As I wrote when the draft budget was published last month, that has been downgraded. And some. This year means a continuing squeeze on councils, once they take on board the additional requirements placed on them by central government.  Beyond that, it'll be another year of muddling through and making ends meet, with some pain and a lot of inflating prices and wages, along with an uncertain trajectory for the health budget depending on the Covid-19 virus. It's the longer term that has MSPs most worried. The finance committee's report reflects on advice that Scotland suffers from low productivity feeding lower earnings, poor business investment, and more adults both young and old who are not working and paying income tax. That means declining income tax revenue and growing expectations of newly-devolved welfare payments. These expectations and hopes will have become further raised by two reports this week highlighting the mountain to be climbed if Scotland is to hit its statutory target on ending child poverty. One was from the Fraser of Allander Institute, demonstrating a number of factors in tackling child poverty, the most obvious being its complexity. ""Difficult decisions"" lie ahead, it concluded. A more generous offer of childcare could be aimed at getting more parents into the workforce, but at a high cost. And that is modelled as having a lower impact than a big boost to the new Scottish Child Payment. That is due to be raised from £10 weekly to £20, and extended to a wider age range by the end of the year. But the modelling from these Strathclyde economists suggests a weekly payment of £160 is the level at which a big impact on child poverty can be seen. It went on to say that putting more money into family budgets would boost the economy by 2% to 4%, as they go out and spend that money.  But when you factor in the tax required to fund it, sucking funds out of the economy (and such assumptions are highly uncertain), the net effect is a decline in economic output of 2% to 3%. I digress. This is just one example of the expectations being loaded on to the Scottish budget in the medium to long term without thinking through the costs of big ambitions. And where the finance committee is ""deeply worried"" is in the falling tax revenue from income tax. Having had that devolved, it provided an incentive for the Scottish government to boost economic growth and draw in more revenue, with which to meet those ambitions for more generous social provision. However, it also brought the risk of lower tax revenue. And what the Scottish Fiscal Commission showed us is a medium term future in which higher take from income tax, loaded on to higher earners, with a lower threshold for starting to pay the 41% rate, is not providing more revenue than the Scottish government would have had if income tax had not been devolved.  In other words: more tax powers and higher tax rates are bringing Holyrood lower revenues. The net gap next financial year is forecast at £190m, rising to a shortfall of £417m in 2026-27. The trends become clearer still when Holyrood's more generous welfare benefits are factored in. Expert evidence to the committee offered little reassurance about the economic and fiscal trends. The demographics are pointing in the wrong direction. Productivity feeding lower wage growth and lower income tax receipts is a long-running problem, to which there's no easy answer. The committee report points to talk, within government, of a 'demographic commission' or the less grand 'population taskforce'.  It reminds ministers that they promised a ten-year plan for 'economic transformation', drawing on yet another panel of expert advice, but its publication is now behind schedule. Their work on revisiting the fiscal framework that determines how money is allocated to take account of devolved taxes is also well behind schedule. The answers MSPs got from Kate Forbes were of initiatives that are at an early stage, to address problems that have been seen a long time off. And such initiatives as are under way are seen by MSPs, and by academic commentators with an inside track from having recently been in government, as being overly complex. ""We called on the Scottish government to outline how it could streamline and link up its various strategies and plans,"" the MSPs on the finance committee said of their pre-budget report, noting that their call had been ignored. They still want it answered. It is on economic performance and fiscal viability that they have their sternest warning from ministers, which will be hard to ignore:  ""We consider that evidence showing that Scotland is lagging behind almost all other areas of the rest of the UK in key indicators of economic performance is deeply worrying.  ""We are particularly concerned to note the latest Scottish Fiscal Commission forecasts showing Scotland's income tax receipts falling behind the Block Grant Adjustment (the deduction by the Treasury in lieu of Scottish income tax powers), which we consider could, if they come to pass, put Scotland's future fiscal sustainability at risk."" That's the challenge laid down by MSPs to Kate Forbes. Now, over to the cabinet secretary."
economic indicators,Skilled workforce is vital say businesses,2024-09-15,2022-10-15,By Ben Schofield and Nic Rigby,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-63177519,"Investment to provide a skilled workforce is vital to boost growth in the East of England, business leaders have told BBC Politics East. In the last 10 years, productivity in the region has fallen behind other areas of the UK, according to research by the Bennett Institute in Cambridge. The government said it aimed to boost productivity with investment zones providing tax breaks for firms. On Friday, applications for zones across East of England were submitted. The Bennett Institute for Public Policy's study found between 2008 and 2019 productivity in the East of England rose by 0.7% compared to the UK average of 4%, while in Wales productivity rose by 6%.  Matthew Agarwala, a project leader at the Bennett Institute, said: ""Productivity growth is the best economic indicator of whether or not living standards are rising over time. ""The UK has seen anaemic productivity growth since the 2008 financial crisis, but it is even slower growth in the East of England."" Martin Lawrence, director of Metalcraft in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, which produces large stainless steel vessels for industries such as nuclear power, said: ""Recruitment has been a challenge for a while. Finding skilled people, particularly in the north Cambridgeshire fens, is really, really challenging."" Metalcraft has been involved in building a training facility at its plant. ""Chatteris is a really cold spot for vocational training. It's really 20 miles in any direction with no training until this one was built,"" said Mr Lawrence. Charlotte Horobin, East of England and Midlands region director of manufacturer organisation Make UK, said: ""Not being able to access [trained] people is really a huge issue, especially if you're a smaller business where losing one person could be a catastrophe. ""Making sure you have skilled, talented people delivers prosperity."" Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire, Anthony Browne, said one way of boosting investment and training was the government's plans for investment zones. ""The key to growth was raising productivity. If you have tax breaks, for example, on business investment, which is one of the tax breaks in investment zones, there is a lot of evidence that it encourages investment by businesses in plant and machinery,"" he said. ""One of the problems we have in the UK is that our tax relief that we give for investment isn't as generous as that offered by other countries.""

economic indicators,"Business output in NI growing again, says bank",2024-09-15,2021-05-17,By Richard Morgan,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-57143391,"Business output returned to growth at the start of the second quarter of this year, an Ulster Bank survey suggests. Business confidence among Northern Ireland firms is at a 14-month high but rising costs continue to cause concern. Every month the bank surveys private sector firms about various issues and the result is regarded as a reliable indicator of economic performance. The bank's chief economist Richard Ramsey said that April's survey had indicated the most optimism for months. ""It's the first time Northern Ireland's private sector has recorded expansion of business activity since last September,"" he told BBC News NI. ""We are seeing a big improvement in business conditions and overall we are seeing a significant rebound in April."" That was linked to strong growth in the UK and an easing of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, said Mr Ramsey. ""The worst is behind us in terms of the slump or the collapse in demand that we saw last year under full lockdowns,"" he said. ""We are going to see a pickup in unemployment later in the year."" New orders rose but exports posted what has been described as ""another sizeable fall"". Firms also reported supply chain disruption and an increase in costs. Mr Ramsey said: ""Adapting to the Northern Ireland Protocol is one aspect of the increasing cost of doing business. ""However, it isn't the only source of disruption. ""Economies around the world have seen a lengthening in suppliers' delivery times due to the pandemic and worldwide shipping issues such as a shortage of shipping containers. ""Linked to this, Northern Ireland firms once again reported a record rise in input costs stemming from higher prices for raw materials and fuel coupled with increased shipping costs. ""In turn, companies are also passing these increased costs onto their customers at a record rate."""
economic indicators,The six key election takeaways in maps and charts,2024-09-15,2021-05-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-57031010,"As the dust settles on a bumper crop of elections, a chance to sit back and try and work out exactly what happened. From fresh questions about Scottish independence to the lingering impact of the Brexit vote, what do we know now that we didn't on Thursday? In Scotland, the SNP held on to power for an historic fourth term, but fell just one seat short of an overall majority. That means, together with the Scottish Greens, there is now a majority of 15 in favour of independence in the Scottish Parliament. But analysis by Professor Sir John Curtice suggests this is not the whole story.  In Scotland, people have two votes - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot, where additional MSPs are allocated from party lists depending on how many votes the parties get. In the constituency vote 49.0% backed pro-independence parties, and in the list vote it was 50.1%. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said her focus in government would be on leading the country through the pandemic and keeping people safe from Covid. But she added that ""when the crisis has passed, it is to give people in Scotland the right to choose their future"" in a referendum. But the UK government is fighting this, with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove saying the SNP could not expect one to be approved as the party did not secure a majority in the Scottish Parliament. Traditionally, voters use Westminster by-elections and other polls between general elections, to give the sitting government a kicking, particularly when they've been in power a while.  But the performance of the Conservatives in England means we might need to re-think that idea. One of the first results to come in was the by-election to select the new Hartlepool MP. Conservative Jill Mortimer won a seat that had been in Labour hands since its creation in 1974, and by a significant margin as well - 23.2%, or nearly 7,000 votes. This was only the second by-election gain for a governing party since Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives won amid the backdrop of the Falklands War in 1982. And things didn't get much better for Labour in the council elections. The Conservatives took Harlow council in Essex - sometimes seen as indicator of the national mood - and continued to make gains in both councils and council seats across the rest of England throughout the weekend. They now control over a dozen more councils than they did before and there are more than 200 extra Tory councillors. In contrast, Labour lost control of eight councils and more than 300 seats. One of the councils the party lost, County Durham, had been under Labour control for more than 100 years, since 1919. It was the first council the Labour Party ever ran. The only areas where there may be some cause for Conservative concern is among their traditional heartlands of the shire councils in the south - lots of the areas coloured white on the map above because they lost seats or failed to gain any. It hasn't been damaging enough yet to actually lose control in many councils - only Cambridgeshire, the Isle of Wight and Tunbridge Wells - but something to keep an eye on perhaps. As well as the Conservatives in England and the SNP in Scotland, Labour in Wales bucked the trend of long-standing parties of power struggling at election time, in the context of handling a massive international crisis and the immediate boost of a world-leading vaccine programme. Welsh Labour equalled their record of securing 30 out of the 60 Senedd seats. First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford, whose profile has been prominent as part of the Welsh Covid response, increased his personal majority by more than 10,000 votes, from 3.7 percentage points to 30.7. Labour also gained the seat of former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood in Rhondda, but they lost Vale of Clwyd to the Conservatives, by fewer than 500 votes. This left them just short of an outright majority - a feat no party has yet achieved in Wales. Another area Labour supporters can look to for positives are the mayoral elections in some of England's biggest city regions. Labour's success here gives an idea where their new heartlands might be, as the political map is still being redrawn following the Brexit vote of 2016. Sadiq Khan won again in London, from second preference votes after a first round that was closer than expected. Tory candidate Shaun Bailey came second. Andy Burnham won easily in Manchester with an increased majority, and Labour took control of the West of England and Cambridgeshire & Peterborough from the Conservatives. They also held on to the combined authority mayoralties in Liverpool, the West of England and won all five single authority mayors that were up for grabs. The party also won the newly created Mayor of West Yorkshire. The Conservatives did win two mayoral elections. Andy Street won in the West Midlands and Ben Houchen got a whopping 73% of the vote in the Tees Valley. They also won 30 of the 39 Police and Crime Commissioner elections declared so far, including ten gains. There have now been two general elections since the June 2016 EU referendum, both of which saw the Conservatives' support increase among Leave voters while Labour performed better with Remainers, according to analysis from Professor Curtice. But for some council wards Thursday's vote was the first new election since May 2016, one month before Britain voted to leave the EU. If we look just at those areas, there was a swing from Labour to the Conservatives of six percentage points overall. But the swing was just one point in areas that voted Remain, compared to 11 points in the most heavily pro-Leave places. In pro-Remain places which last voted in 2017, there was a swing to Labour of three points. In Leave areas there was a two-point move in the Conservatives' direction. As well as the Scottish Greens gaining two seats, the Greens in England increased their presence in every region. In total they won more than 80 seats -  but were unable to control any individual council. They also finished ahead of the Lib Dems in London as the third party. Professor Curtice says they are now the fourth party in the UK. For the Lib Dems on the whole it was more of a muted success. They took control of St Albans Council and held on to the six they were defending. They lost a seat in Scotland but won one in the London Assembly. And in terms of councillors, their gains and losses in different areas more or less balanced each other out.

economic indicators,China's economy grows at slowest pace since 1990s,2024-09-15,2019-07-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48985789,"China's economy grew at its slowest pace since the early 1990s in the second quarter, official figures showed.  In the three months to June, the economy grew 6.2% from a year earlier. The result was in line with forecasts. China has moved to stimulate its economy this year by boosting spending and delivering tax cuts. The country is also fighting a trade war with the US which has hurt businesses and weighed on growth. The data released on Monday showed China's economic growth rate slowed from 6.4% in the first three months of the year.  US President Donald Trump tweeted that US trade tariffs were having ""a major effect"" on the Chinese economy. China's national statistics bureau said the figures pointed to a ""complex environment"" both at home and abroad. It said the economy had ""performed within the reasonable range"" in the first half of 2019, but that it faced ""new downward pressure"". Andrew Walker, business correspondent The figures do show some impact from the trade conflict with the US. Growth has probably slowed a little more than it would have done had China been facing a more tranquil international commercial environment. The longer-term picture, though, is one of an economy continuing a reasonably orderly and intended slowdown in growth.  The average growth rate over the three decades to 2010 was 10%. The Chinese leadership - and every economist I have ever heard expressing a view on this - did not regard that as sustainable for the long term. The aim was to see the economy less dependent on investment and exports and an increased role for spending by consumers.   There has been some progress, though the rates of saving and investment remain very high. There are dangers, however, notably the high level of company debt. The authorities encouraged strong credit growth in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. That has helped prevent a more rapid and potentially disruptive slowdown, but at the price of creating additional financial risks.  While China-watchers advise caution with Beijing's official gross domestic product numbers, the data is seen as a useful indicator of the country's growth trajectory. Other data showed some signs of improvement in the world's second-largest economy. Industrial production rose 6.3% in June from a year earlier, while retail sales rose 9.8% year-on-year - both above forecasts in Reuters polls. Slowing growth in China has raised concerns about the potential knock-on effect on the global economy.  Earlier this year Beijing announced plans to boost spending and cut billions of dollars in taxes in an effort to support the economy.  It has also moved to provide a liquidity boost by reducing the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve. Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said the latest economic data ""shows the slowdown remains intact and markets should expect further stimulus"" from China's central bank later this year. The US-led trade war is another factor weighing on growth.   ""The trade war is having a huge impact on the Chinese economy, and with no end sight as trade negotiations struggle for meaningful progress, we are probably not near the bottom for China's economy,"" he said. While both sides  agreed to resume trade talks at a recent G20 summit in Japan, they have already placed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods, hurting businesses and casting a shadow over the world economy.

economic indicators,NI jobs market still strong with payrolls rising,2024-09-15,2023-01-17,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-64301514,"Northern Ireland's jobs market has remained reasonably strong despite the economy entering recession in the third quarter of 2022. The latest figures suggest company payrolls were still rising in December and that the employment rate increased in the September-November quarter. The only negative indicator was a fourth consecutive monthly increase in people claiming unemployment benefits. Experimental data suggests the typical employee saw a pay rise of 6.3%. This compared to inflation of about 10%. The employment rate, which is the proportion of people aged 16 to 64 in work, increased by 1.4 percentage points over the quarter and by 3.3 percentage points over the year to 71.3%, according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra). The annual change was statistically significant.  The economic inactivity rate, the proportion of people aged 16 to 64 who were not working and not seeking or available to work, fell by 1.2 percentage points over the quarter and by 2.8 percentage points over the year to 26.6%.  The annual change was statistically significant.  The unemployment rate also saw marginal quarterly and annual declines to 2.8%. The number of people on company payrolls stood at an estimated 783,800, a monthly increase of 0.2%. Payroll numbers are the only major indicator which has surpassed pre-pandemic levels. A much weaker recovery in self-employment means that the overall employment rate remains 1.2 percentage points below level recorded in December-February 2020. The unemployment rate remains 0.3 percentage points above the pre-pandemic position and the economic inactivity rate 1 percentage point above the pre-pandemic rate.  The total numbers of hours worked has almost recovered to pre-pandemic levels: in September-November 2022 it was 0.6% below the position recorded in December-February 2020."
economic indicators,UK house price growth 'slowing',2024-09-15,2017-12-07,By Brian Milligan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42263597,"The growth in UK house prices is continuing to slow, according to the country's largest lender, the Halifax. It said average prices rose by 3.9% in the year to the end of November, down from 4.5% in October. And it warned that growth is likely to ease further in the longer term, as wages fail to keep pace with inflation. Some commentators also said that the Halifax figures were out of kilter with other indicators, which suggest prices rises are even more modest. Last week, rival lender Nationwide said prices had risen by just 2.5% over the past year, which is lower than the rate of general inflation. According to the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), the cost of living rose by 3% in the year to October. The average house or flat in the UK is now selling for £226,821, the Halifax said. ""The imbalance between supply and demand continues to support house prices, which doesn't look like changing in the near future,"" said Russell Galley, the managing director of Halifax Community Bank.  However, he added that house price growth was likely to slow in the long term. ""Further ahead, increasing affordability issues, as price increases continue to outstrip wage growth, are likely to curb housing demand and cause price growth to ease."" The Halifax said that the changes to Stamp Duty for first-time buyers announced in last month's Budget would help to stimulate demand in London and the South East. For properties costing up to £500,000, first-time buyers will now pay no stamp duty on the first £300,000. However, other data points to a continuing slowdown in the market. In October, the number of home buyers being granted mortgages fell to its lowest for over a year, according to figures from the Bank of England. ""Housing market activity is currently muted and faltering,"" said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the Halifax figures were at odds with other indicators, such as surveys from Nationwide and Rightmove. ""Halifax's suggestion that house prices are surging again conflicts with virtually every other indicator we track,"" he said.  Where can I afford to live?"
economic indicators,The week ahead in Parliament,2024-09-15,2020-03-09,By Mark D'Arcy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-51775687,"It's Budget week - in fact, the first Budget week for more than a year.  The last time a chancellor posed with his red box on the steps of 11 Downing Street, for the traditional photo-op, was when Philip Hammond summoned up a grin back on 29 October 2018.  Since then, a combination of a lack of a majority and a general election have delayed the next exciting episode of UK fiscal policy - resulting in the longest gap between budgets since the 19th Century.  The simple fact of that interval will mean there is a lot in the package Rishi Sunak will lay before MPs, particularly the implementation of some promised changes to National Insurance thresholds, targeted at lower income earners. And there is chatter about a big new policy initiative on skills. But this will be a Budget delivered under the shadow of the cornonavirus and the economic uncertainty which has caused stock markets and US interest rates to drop, which suggests the new chancellor may have to keep at least some of his powder dry.  So, while he may be able to set out the spending envelope for the coming year, the announcement of big ticket infrastructure investments might, prudently, be delayed until the effect of any epidemic is clearer. Even the usual blizzard of economic forecasts that come with a Budget are a little devalued, because they will have been compiled before the virus became a factor - so what are expected to be quite anaemic growth predictions (UK growth at maybe 0.8% according to the last Bank of England forecast) may be discounted even further by the commentators.  But this will not be the only big parliamentary economic event of the year - there's a major spending review in progress, which could provide the opportunity for big positive announcements later on and, for those who remember the halcyon days of Denis Healey, there's always the possibility of a mini-budget.  Beyond that, this will be an important test for Mr Sunak. His quantum leap up the political pecking order, from new MP in 2015 to the second most important job in the government in under five years, means he is pretty untested as a cabinet-level parliamentarian - and he will be expected to display both substance and style in what are clearly going to be rather awkward circumstances.  But it's also worth remembering he was Boris Johnson's stand-in for one of the TV debates in the election, so his colleagues clearly believe he can handle high-profile challenges.  Behind the scenes on Monday, the House of Commons Commission - the administrative arm of the House - will be meeting their Lords opposite numbers - with Parliament's response to the coronavirus on the agenda.  There's a swirling internal debate about banning tourists and school parties from visiting as an initial precaution - with the thought that if the virus really takes hold, the work of Parliament could be limited to emergency business, although talk of Parliament being suspended until September is being played down by the Speaker and Lord Speaker.  In practice, any decision on that would come from the government, not the parliamentary authorities. There would have to be cross-party agreement, allowing laws to be passed by a quorum of MPs - the legal minimum is 40 MPs, plus the speaker and deputy, but it's more likely there would be 100 of the 650 MPs present at Westminster. The commission will also be meeting to look at the issues around the plan to move Parliament out of its Victorian home for the multi-billion pound Restoration and Renewal project (R&R for short). This is happening amidst rising chatter of ditching the whole scheme in favour of a patch and mend approach, which would keep the parliamentarians in situ while different sections of the building were closed off - although many others believe this would be impractical. The Northern Estate Project is the vehicle for the attack. This is the scheme to upgrade parliamentary offices across the road from the palace of Westminster and to rebuild Richmond House, the old Department of Health HQ, to house a temporary Commons chamber and provide more office space. If that is halted then MPs will not be able to move out and the whole R&R project will be derailed. Here's my rundown of the rest of the week ahead.  The Commons week begins (14:30 GMT) with questions to the Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey and her team.  That may well be followed by some post-weekend ministerial statements and urgent questions.  Then the Lib Dem Wera Hobhouse will present a bill to make misogyny an aggravating factor in criminal sentencing, and the Conservative Philip Hollobone will present a rival bill to make misogyny and misandry - dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against the male sex - aggravating factors.  Neither bill will be debated, but it's clear some Conservative MPs at least are reacting against the stream of presentation bills put down by Lib Dem women. Next is the second reading of the Birmingham Commonwealth Games Bill, which enacts the kind of necessary temporary measures seen around previous major sporting events. It covers matters like unauthorised tickets sales, commercial rights and transport around games locations.  In Westminster Hall (16:30) there's the first Petitions Committee debate of the new Parliament on an e-petition calling for the government to provide 15 hours free childcare to working parents for children over nine-months-old, which attracted 146,397 signatures. In the Lords (14:30), questions to ministers cover the gender pay gap, Sport England's ""This Girl Can"" campaign and ensuring the government will have ""the most ambitious environmental programme of any country on Earth"" in time for COP26 - as promised in the 2019 Conservative Party manifesto. Then peers turn to their third day of committee stage scrutiny of the Fisheries Bill. The Commons opens (11:30) with an hour of health and social care questions - which will certainly include the latest coronavirus update. Conservative Gareth Johnson has a Ten Minute Rule Bill to allow the courts to ban disruptive passengers from flying.  Then MPs turn to the report and third reading debate on the Telecommunications Infrastructure (Leasehold Property) Bill - and there may well be a significant backbench Conservative rebellion on what had seemed a pretty humdrum measure to allow 5G communications infrastructure to be installed in buildings with uncooperative owners. Conservative backbenchers, headed by the former party leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, have put down an amendment to restrict the ability of ""high risk vendors"" to provide this vital new infrastructure - in particular the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei, which they argue is controlled by the Chinese state.  This is serious because it is a direct policy challenge to the government.  It is not a done deal that this amendment will be selected for debate, despite a long list of heavyweight backers, including former cabinet ministers Damian Green, David Davis and Owen Paterson, Foreign Affairs Select Committee chair Tom Tugendhat, and the lurking presence in support of 1922 Committee chair Sir Graham Brady.  And it's worth pointing out that Labour, in the form of shadow minister Chi Onwurah, proposed a not dissimilar amendment at committee stage, where DCMS minister Matt Warman promised there would be new controls on high-risk vendors, who would be excluded from all safety-related and safety-critical networks in critical national infrastructure, excluded from the security-critical core network functions and limited to a minority presence of up to 35% in the other parts of the network, as well as being subject to tight restrictions, including exclusions from sensitive locations.  He also said the government's decision on high-risk vendors was evidence-based and taken on a comprehensive security assessment, as well as noting the realities of the telecoms market - which I think means Huawei is the only credible supplier in the government's view. The debate is followed by the first Backbench Business Committee debate of the new Parliament, on lesbian, bisexual and trans women's health inequalities, led by the Conservative ex-minister Crispin Blunt, and the SNP's Hannah Bardell. More and more select committee inquiries are under way: the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee will take evidence (09:30) from Britain's top civil servant, the Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, and Sir John Manzoni, Civil Service chief executive and permanent secretary to the Cabinet Office.  Following the spectacular resignation of the permanent secretary to the Home Office, Sir Philip Rutnam, and his allegation of constructive dismissal and bullying against the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, the committee will examine the working relationships between government ministers and officials, and also look at the appointment, terms of employment and accountability of special advisers. Bring popcorn. Elsewhere, the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee holds the first hearing (10:30) in its inquiry on issues emerging from the Horizon IT Court cases, looking at the impact on sub-postmasters and its effect on the future viability of the Post Office, and examining the lessons the government and Post Office Ltd have learned from a scandal which saw hundreds of sub-postmasters accused and, in some cases, wrongly convicted of fraud.  In the Lords (14:30), questions have an International Women's Day flavour, covering the financial sustainability of women's refuges, equal pay legislation and gender equality education, before peers move on to their annual International Women's Day debate. A big day in the Commons opens (11:30) with half an hour of Women and Equalities questions, with International Trade Secretary Liz Truss answering for the government. Then comes Prime Minister's Questions, as an appetiser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, and the Budget.   A series of themed days of debate on the Budget will follow - although there will be a brief interlude between PMQs and the Budget, in which Lib Dem Sarah Olney will present a bill to ban anti-abortion protests within 150 meters of abortion clinics (but this will be a very brief parliamentary ritual, without debate). My pick of the day's Westminster Hall debates is the one on the mental health of veterans (11:00).  Lib Dem Jamie Stone has a private members bill to ring fence a section of the NHS budget for the care of military veterans and will ask the government to provide debating time to ensure it makes it into law. He will also highlight the disturbing rise in veteran suicides and argue that the country owes veterans lifelong support.  In the Lords (15:00), questions to ministers cover the economic crisis and food emergency in Zimbabwe, gender segregation in publicly funded apprenticeships, and the increase in the number of people with dementia admitted to A&E departments. Then peers move on to their fourth day of committee stage scrutiny of the Fisheries Bill.  The Commons opens (09:30) with Transport Questions, followed by the weekly Commons Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Jacob Rees-Mogg. Look out for notice of any coronavirus-related emergency legislation.  After that, the Budget debate continues - but we won't know the themes allotted to each day of the debate until the Budget is delivered. My committee corridor pick is the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport hearing (09:45) on the work of the BBC, with the new committee chair, Julian Knight leading the questioning of the BBC Director General, Lord Tony Hall, and BBC Chairman Sir David Clementi. In the Lords (11:00), questions range from the results of the Republic of Ireland general election and the eradication of Japanese Knotweed to arrangements for the climate change conference COP26.  The main debates are on subjects raised by backbench peers - on the case for the government to use wellbeing as a key indicator of national performance when setting budgets, and on investing in, and embracing, the green economy. It's the Commons' first Private Members Bill Friday of the new Parliament (from 09:30) starting with the Second Reading of the Education (Guidance about Costs of School Uniforms) Bill from Labour's Mike Amesbury. He aims to make school uniforms affordable by changing the law so schools and governing bodies must make affordability a key consideration when setting their uniform policies.  The idea is to stop large proportions of the uniforms from being branded items or only exclusively available from school shops or at high-priced retailers.  If passed, the bill would allow parents to buy uniforms from supermarkets and other cheaper suppliers, and then school identities could be sewn on later. Then comes the Second Reading of the Conservative Bim Afolami's British Library Board (Power to Borrow) Bill.   At the moment the British Library is banned by law from borrowing money, but removing the ban would allow it to strengthen its traditional offering by borrowing to extend the advice and guidance services it already provides to people starting up small businesses.  This is mostly done in London and a couple of big cities at the moment, and the aim of the bill is to allow those services to be extended to more of the country Third on the agenda, and therefore unlikely to have all that much time for debate, is the Second Reading of the Education and Training (Welfare of Children) Bill, proposed by Labour's Mary Kelly Foy. This seeks to put a statutory duty on all providers of post-16 education and training to safeguard and promote the welfare of children.  At the moment, this duty falls on schools, further education colleges and sixth form colleges, but not on 16-19 academies or independent training providers, and the bill seeks to end that anomaly. Next on the agenda - although it's unlikely MPs will have much, if any, time to debate them - comes a series of bills proposed by Conservative awkward squaddie, and frequent Friday flyer, Sir Christopher Chope, namely the Public Sector Exit Payments (Limitation) Bill, the Green Belt Protection Bill and the Bat Habitats Regulation Bill.  If he's lucky, he may get a few minutes to make the case for one of them.  There are also Private Members Bills in the Lords (10:00) - the Second Reading of Labour's Lord Grocott's umpteenth version of the House of Lords (Hereditary Peers) (Abolition of By-Elections) Bill should provide some entertainment, because the minister likely to be responding for the government is Lord True. He is now at the Cabinet Office, but was previously one of the peers who had attempted to talk out previous incarnations of this measure.  The bill would have the effect of allowing the hereditary component of the House to wither away, by blocking the process by which hereditary peers who die or retire are replaced. Another popcorn moment. Next comes the second reading of the Big Issue founder Lord Bird's Wellbeing of Future Generations Bill, which aims to create a ""future generations test"" for all new policy changes.  The idea is to revolutionise how laws and policies are made by requiring them to enhance the environmental, economic, social and cultural well-being of current and future generations, making life better for all people in the UK.  It mirrors the Welsh Assembly's Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, which had at its heart a duty on all public bodies, including Welsh ministers, to act in accordance with a sustainable development principle."
economic indicators,Row over 'murder hotel' road name,2024-09-15,2018-01-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-42690378,"A row has broken out over what to call a street which is informally named after the site of one of Wales's most notorious murders. Red Gables Viaduct, as it is commonly known in Penmaenmawr, Conwy county, took its name from the Red Gables Hotel which used to stand on the road. The hotel was demolished in 2016, 40 years after four people were murdered by a gardener who then shot himself. The town council wants to call the road Ffordd Darbishire after a local family. The road links Bangor Road to the promenade and the A55, which it passes over. A Conwy council report said it had no formal name but was known by the indicator Red Gables Viaduct by the council's environment, roads and facilities service. Penmaenmawr town council wants the 30-year-old road to be officially named. In a letter to the county council, it said: ""The Darbishire family owned Penmaenmawr Quarries for many years and were well known for their contribution to the development of the community. ""As no memorial to the family exists, Penmaenmawr town council thought it would be appropriate to name a road after them."" However local councillor Ken Stevens objected to the proposal, saying the road had been named after an ""iconic building"" and known as Red Gables Viaduct for nearly 30 years and was named as such on tourism brochures. He added the town did not have a history of naming its roads after families or dynasties. But Dennis Roberts, from the Penmaenmawr Historical Society, supported the town council's request. He said: ""The naming of the road 'Red Gables' has little historic significance and has the unfortunate association with the murder of five people [four were murdered, one killed himself] at the house of the same name."" He argued the house had been known for nearly 100 years as Gwyl Annedd and had only became known as Red Gables in the 1970s on a change of use. Mr Roberts said the Darbishire family had owned and managed local quarries for more than 70 years and had been prominent in the social, religious and economic life of the town. He added: ""It is a disgrace that there is no building, street etc which honours their name as once the leading citizens here in the town."" An alternative to Ffordd Darbishire if that was ""too much of a mouthful"" could be Plas Mawr, named after the Darbishires' house which stood on Bangor Road, he said. Conwy council's licensing and regulation committee will make a decision on the name at its meeting on Monday evening."
economic indicators,Things US has got wrong - and got right,2024-09-15,2020-07-08,By Anthony Zurcher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53337483,"So much for a summer lull in the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, the US has seen a resurgence of the disease in numerous states, particularly across the south and west.  The US nation as a whole has topped 60,000 recorded daily new cases this week. Did it have to be this way, though?  Other industrialised nations, in Europe and Asia, pursued more rigorous mitigation plans, ramped up testing and contact tracing earlier, and eased restrictions in a slower and more co-ordinated fashion. They have not, at least so far, seen a resurgence of the virus similar to the one the US is currently experiencing.  The US state of Arizona, for instance, is currently registering as many new cases of coronavirus as the entire European Union, which has a population 60 times greater. It makes for a gloomy review of what's gone right and (mostly) wrong, as the US enters its fifth full month of a pandemic that has no end in sight. A month ago, the coronavirus numbers in the US appeared, at the very least, stable. The spread of the disease had been slowed, as the daily tally of new cases plateaued. That prompted a number of states - including Texas, California, Florida and Arizona - to move forward with plans to ease off public shelter-in-place and business closure orders.  Many of these states moved ahead despite not hitting the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended benchmarks for doing so, such as a 14-day drop in cases and less than 5% of tests coming back positive for the virus. It turns out, the overall national numbers were misleading, as states that were hit hard early, such as New York and New Jersey, were experiencing declines, while numbers in other states were beginning to inch up. They're not inching up anymore, they're surging - and the worst, as far as hospitalisations and fatalities, could be yet to come. Now Texas, California and Arizona, among others, have re-imposed business closure orders and mandated mask-wearing, which has been determined to reduce the spread of the virus. It may be too little to avoid another public-health crisis, however. ""We opened way too early in Arizona,"" Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, a Democrat, said in recent television interview. ""We were one of the last states to go to stay-at-home and one of the first to re-emerge."" The 8,181 Covid-19 hospitalisations in Texas on Sunday were yet another record high. In Arizona, 14% of coronavirus tests are positive for the virus.  California, an early success story in limiting the spread of the virus, has seen a 90% increase in cases over the past two weeks, after the state in May allowed local authorities more discretion in businesses re-openings. The surge in cases is also again leading to delays and shortages in testing - an area that had appeared to be a strength for the US after a halting start. Without adequate testing, it will be significantly more difficult to identify and isolate new cases and locations where the virus is spreading unchecked. ""We're right back where we were at the peak of the epidemic during the New York outbreak,"" former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said during a television interview on Sunday.    At least for the moment, the rate of daily deaths has not reached New York levels - but that may only be a matter of time, as the current cases progress. ""It is already too late,"" says Luiza Petre, a New York City physician and professor of cardiology at the Mt Sinai School of Medicine. ""We're at a point of no return where it will be very, very difficult to restrain this pandemic."" Compounding the decision by some states to prioritise reopening in spite of warnings from public-health officials, one of the best methods of limiting the spread of the virus - wearing a face covering - has become mired in partisan acrimony. A June survey by Pew Research Center found that only 49% of conservative Republicans said they wore a mask most of the time in the past month, while that number is 83% among liberal Democrats. Conservative opposition becomes even more entrenched at the prospect of government-enforced mask mandates. ""Kansans don't need Laura Kelly and the nanny state making decisions best left to individuals,"" Bill Clifford, a Republican congressional candidate in Kansas, said in response to a mask order from his state's Democratic governor. ""State mask mandates violate the principles of individual liberty and local control upon which America was founded."" Donald Trump himself has contributed to the division, mocking a reporter who refused to remove his mask during a press conference as being ""politically correct"" and retweeting a Fox News journalist who suggested a photo of Joe Biden in a mask was damaging to the Democrat's image. The president has steadfastly refused to wear a mask in public events - a position that has clearly registered with his supporters. At the president's campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June, few in the crowd chose to use face-coverings, and most disregarded social-distancing suggestions. Public-health officials aren't free from blame, either. Early on, they declared that face-coverings were only helpful for front-line medical personnel.  While the real motivation for such statements may have been to reserve limited supplies to those most in need, the end result was a message that was muddled and shifted as the pandemic progressed. While some state governments have eased restrictions on public gatherings and allowed businesses to re-open, they have frequently accompanied such moves with recommendations that individuals make decisions based on medical advice and common sense. Those recommendations have been, to put it mildly, not always heeded. Summer holidays led to mask-less crowds in reopened bars and restaurants, public parks and beaches. And while masks were a fairly common sight during the mass anti-discrimination protests that swept the nation in the past month, social-distancing practices were essentially non-existent. The numbers behind this new coronavirus surge indicates that many of the newly infected are younger Americans, who have been among the quickest to return to in-personal socialising. Some political leaders, including the president, have essentially encouraged this, asserting that the young and healthy have little to fear from the virus. ""Now we have tested over 40 million people,"" Trump tweeted on Saturday. ""But by so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless."" That flies in the face of public-health studies that have shown that a fifth of Covid-19 cases result in severe respiratory distress. ""We have data in the White House task force,"" US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Sunday, refusing to reject Trump's 99% figure as false. ""Those data show us that this is a serious problem. People need to take it seriously."" But a president downplaying the severity of the disease can go a long way toward undermining words of warning from his subordinates. The coronavirus resurgence has also lit the fuse on a bomb that is set to explode in just a few months. September is when American children traditionally head back to classrooms across the nation, and it's becoming clear that nothing close to a normal educational experience is waiting for them. School administrators are starting to unveil their plans for the coming academic year, and in many cases it's a blend of in-person and distance learning with the hope that it's enough to keep their institutions from becoming staging grounds for spreading the pandemic. Already some teachers' unions are rebelling at the suggestion that educators - including elderly or those at greater health risk - return to classrooms with what they view as insufficient protection or preparation. ""Our educators are overwhelmingly not comfortable returning to schools,"" wrote the head of a Washington DC area teachers' union. ""They fear for their lives, the lives of students and the lives of their families."" Meanwhile, parents facing the prospect of having to manage more de-facto home-schooling and figuring out how to care for and supervise their children while they, themselves, are being asked to return to their workplaces. Trump, despite campaigning in 2016 against federal involvement in local education systems, is already pressuring schools to open back up on time. He's called for the CDC to revise its guidance to make it easier to reopen school buildings and threatened to cut off federal funds for those that don't comply. Florida, a Republican-controlled state currently in the midst of a widespread coronavirus outbreak, already has ordered its schools to open for classes at the end of August. The president's rhetoric, delivered via Twitter, seems destined to politicise yet another aspect of the coronavirus response, again putting local officials in the unenvious position of balancing community health concerns with demands to return to normal times that seem increasingly out of reach. Although the coronavirus situation in many US states in the south and west has become increasingly dire, what was once the epicentre of the outbreak - New York - has made remarkable improvements. Daily deaths, which peaked on 8 April at 799, have dropped to single digits. Only 1.38% of the state's coronavirus testing last Friday returned positive results.  As other areas have re-imposed lockdown restrictions, New York has begun reopening many public facilities and private business such as salons, tattoo shops and youth sport leagues. Indoor restaurants, however, remain closed. ""What happened in New York should have been a cautionary tale for the other states to pay attention and learn to create a more centralised strategy,"" says Ms Petre, the New York City cardiologist. ""New York is a success story."" As the state continues to ease its mitigation restrictions, there is the risk that the virus will return resurgent. ""We've been through hell and back, but this is not over,"" said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. ""This can still rear its ugly head anywhere in this nation and in this state."" A funny thing happened on the way to the next Great Depression. The US economy, expected by many forecasters to be in a devastating tailspin, stabilised and began to improve. May unemployment figures, predicted to top 20%, registered at 13.3% instead. Then, in June, they ticked down to 11.4% - an indication that the workplace haemorrhaging had been stopped much earlier than expected. Meanwhile, key stock indices have bounced back from their late winter beating. By 2 July, the Dow Jones Industrial Index had recovered 66% of its losses from its February record high.  The Standards & Poor's 500 Index, a broader measure of stocks, has made up 77% of its losses this year. Other economic indicators offer similar signs of an economic resurgence. The strength of the recovery has largely been attributed to the push by states to quickly lift virus mitigation orders and federal action to provide economic support for businesses and individuals hit hardest by the virus. The return of business closures in several states could mean the economic good news will be short-lived.   Meanwhile, most of the stimulus measures passed by Congress have either run their course or are set to expire soon, while there appears little prospect of further action. ""Since it is now clear that the effects of this crisis will be felt at least until the end of 2020, that relief package will not be enough,"" says Jill Gonzales, an analyst with the personal finance website Wallethub.  While the coronavirus afflicts a growing number of US states, the American medical community continues to grind away at treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine. Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, has shown promise in limiting the severity of the disease in hospitalised patients (prompting the US government to strike a deal with the drug's manufacturer to prioritise American patients). A new study indicates that the commonly available steroid dexamethasone cut the risk of death for coronavirus patients on ventilators by a third. There are also ""encouraging signs"" from experts that the use of blood plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients could help those currently suffering from the disease, although clinical research is ongoing. ""Medicine has evolved at lightning speed,"" says Ms Petre. ""The government has teamed up with pharmaceutical companies and a lot has been done, which is good"" On the vaccine front, there are now several pharmaceutical companies reporting positive results from early tests on drugs to boost immunity to the coronavirus. The president is promising a vaccine by the end of the year, if not earlier, although medical professionals caution that such a timeline is far from certain. Anthony Fauci, the chief US immunologist, would only say scientists are ""aspirationally hopeful"" that a vaccine would be ready by 2021. Given that a return to normal life in the US appears increasingly contingent on a safe and reliable vaccine, a lot is riding on these hopes."
economic indicators,What does China's slowdown mean for the UK?,2024-09-15,2019-01-20,By Dharshini David,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46917562,"Monday sees the release of China's GDP figures, and they'll be even more closely watched than usual.  Apple's  CEO, Tim Cook, blamed cautious Chinese consumers in part for his company's failure to sell as many iPhones as he hoped, sending share prices down around the globe.  Car sales in the country, meanwhile, have dropped for the first time in two decades.  On the back of such evidence, investors and policymakers are becoming increasingly jittery about the state of such a crucial engine of world growth.  Measuring an economy's output is never easy but China's data comes with a bigger health warning than most.  Rather than 6.5%, independent economists say the GDP figure may actually be closer to 5% - or even lower.  Xiang Songzuo, a finance professor  and former chief economist of China Agriculture Bank, has claimed  that 2018 growth may have been as low as 1.7%.  His online video has since been censored by authorities.  The unreliability of the official figures is one reason why other indicators such as Apple's sales have the power to send shockwaves around global stock markets. It may be hard to confirm the scale of the slowdown in China but it's clear that growth has shifted down a gear.  It's recently been revealed that activity in factories and workshops stalled for the first time in two years in November.  The month after, exports dropped 4.4% compared to a year previously. Chinese households are clearly feeling the squeeze: retail sales are growing their slowest rate in 15 years.   In part, possibly. After establishing itself as the world's workshop over the last forty years, China's found itself losing its competitive edge to the likes of the Philippines and Vietnam, where labour is even cheaper.  The government decided to switch focus away from exports to growing domestic demand.  However, concerns then arose about the size of China's debt pile - and the risk of bad loans.  Between them, the country's households, government and corporations have debts totalling almost three times the size of GDP. A tightening of credit appears to have weighed on spending and investment. And then there's the trade war with the US.  While there was an initial flurry of orders brought forward to evade tariffs, those latest export figures suggest those measures are now hurting Chinese producers.    While the government has introduced measures to support the economy, most economists expect China's growth to slow further.   In terms of our exports, China's is the UK's 6th largest trading partner. We sold them over £22bn worth of our goods in 2017 - with cars, medicines and oil-based products forming the major part.  Politicians' have pinned their hopes on a closer trading relationship with China in the post-Brexit era. But demand might not be quite as strong as they're anticipating .  Then there's the billions of pounds Chinese companies and entrepreneurs invest in the UK every year - £20bn in 2017 alone.  Thames Water, Pizza Express and West Bromwich Albion FC are among the many which enjoy Chinese backing. That kind of investment is notoriously volatile. And let's not forget the concerns about bad loans. There's a good reason why the Bank of England's Governor Mark Carney cites China as one of the biggest risks to global financial stability.   Several large banks, not least HSBC and Standard Chartered have significant exposure to that market.  Since 1980, growth (if the official figures are to be believed) has averaged over 10% per year, meaning the size of the economy has surged 42-fold over that time.  China's  time in the sun, its superhuman growth spurt, may be over.  By 2030, economists say growth will have settled down to about a third of its current figure.  But even that would be enough to ensure it overtakes the US to take pole position as the world's largest economy."
economic indicators,Northants was 'hair's breadth' from tier 3,2024-09-15,2020-12-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-55331495,"Northamptonshire was a ""hair's breadth"" away from being moved into tougher tier three Covid-19 restrictions, its director of public health said. The county will remain under tier two rules, as it has been since England's second national lockdown ended. Lucy Wightman, director of Public Health Northamptonshire, said people should remain ""vigilant"". The government said the picture in the county was ""mixed,"" but does ""not warrant inclusion in tier three"". Northampton South MP Andrew Lewer said he was ""relieved"" at the news. The decision comes despite Northampton having the highest weekly case rate - 232 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 12 December - of any place in tier two after the latest tier allocation. The town has the 89th-highest rate in England. In the latest government data, four districts in the area showed a week-on-week rise in cases, though Kettering, Corby and Daventry saw a fall. Mrs Wightman said: ""Northamptonshire, and Northampton in particular, are a hair's breadth away from moving in to tier three. ""Although it is welcome news from an economic perspective, we are asking people to remain really vigilant. ""Just because they can do something, should they?"" With neighbouring areas such as Milton Keynes, Bedfordshire, Peterborough, Warwickshire and Leicestershire all now sitting in tier three, Mrs Wightman said there were a ""number of conversations"" about Northamptonshire. She added: ""Am I surprised? No. ""I know the government is taking into consideration the hard work we are undertaking locally. ""But they do recognise Northampton was touch and go, and if we don't see considerable decline in our case rates over Christmas then we are highly likely to see changes in the new year."" The allocation of tiers is dependent on factors including each area's case numbers, the reproduction rate - or R number - and the current and projected pressure on the NHS locally. Tier two rules mean people cannot socialise with other households indoors and the rule of six will apply outdoors. Pubs and restaurants can remain open, but food can only be served with a substantial meal. Different rules for meeting friends and family will apply over Christmas. Tier allocations will be reviewed every 14 days, and the regional approach is due to last until March. There are exceptions for some of the tier two rules, for childcare and support bubbles. The announcement means Northampton Town Football Club will still be able to welcome 2,000 fans for their League One home game with Lincoln City on 19 December. The Department of Health and Social Care said: ""The overall picture remains mixed in Northamptonshire.  ""Case rates are broadly increasing across the area, but case rates in over 60s are decreasing across the majority of the area. ""The epidemiology indicators do not currently warrant inclusion in Tier 3."" It added the number of daily Covid hospital admissions in the county continues to rise and has doubled in the last 14 days."
economic indicators,The cost of not counting the dead,2024-09-15,2021-02-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55674139,"Only eight African countries out of more than 50 have a compulsory system to register deaths, a BBC investigation has found. This is not just a failure of the state to recognise individual tragedies but has enormous implications for the making of government policy. All but two countries in Europe - Albania and Monaco - have a universal death registration system, and in Asia, just over half, analysis of UN data shows. But in Africa it is only Egypt, South Africa, Tunisia, Algeria, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe, Seychelles and Mauritius that have what are called functioning, compulsory and universal civil registration systems - known as CRVS systems - which record deaths. All of the countries surveyed by the BBC, working with researchers from the UN's Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), do have some sort of death registration. But it is often on paper and not available in a shareable digitised form. The information may be used in a local area but cannot calculate mortality trends on a national level. In the wake of the Ebola epidemic, and now Covid-19, having an accurate picture of who is dying, from what and where, is crucial when it comes to allocating resources and funding. This also has implications for tracking maternal and child mortality as there are children whose birth and untimely death go unrecorded. This not only robs them of a ""right to an identity"", in the words of William Muhwava - the head of demography at the UNECA based in Addis Ababa - it also means that lessons are not learnt.  ""In order to help the living, we need to count the dead,"" UN Population Fund demographer Romesh Silva told the BBC.  Those who are missed out on the registers are often the poorest and socially excluded, he adds, and the absence of information about their deaths means that measures to deal with the causes are sometimes not taken. ""Despite investments, CRVS systems remain dysfunctional, forcing governments to rely on surveys... which by the time they are published are already outdated,"" says Irina Dincu, from the Centre of Excellence for CRVS systems. When it comes to coronavirus there is a concern that its true extent in some countries is not fully understood. It has been widely reported that Africa's Covid-19 death toll is far lower than in other parts of the world.   Expertise in epidemic control, a swift response in some countries, the relatively young population and cross-immunity from other coronaviruses are all thought to have had an impact. But data scientists say that calculating a key indicator of the pandemic's fallout - known as ""excess deaths"" - is impossible in most countries because of the lack of CRVS systems.  Excess deaths is a measure which compares the actual deaths over a period of time with the number of deaths expected based on the same period in previous years. But it relies on the full registration of deaths. Looking at excess deaths gives a sense of the overall loss of life caused directly by Covid-19. It also shows deaths caused indirectly by the pandemic because of factors such as overstretched health systems, fear of attending hospital and an economic downturn.  A Lancet study across 118 low-income and middle-income countries estimated that the continued disruption of health systems from Covid-19 could result in 1,157,000 additional child deaths and 56,700 additional maternal deaths.  South Africa and Egypt are among the eight countries which do have functioning death registers, so calculating excess deaths in both countries is possible, and the results are telling.  By early February, South Africa had recorded nearly 138,000 excess deaths since the pandemic began - that is almost three times the official figure given for Covid-19 deaths.  To break it down: 46,200 of these people were officially recorded as having died with coronavirus and there are death certificates to prove it.  This means the other 91,500 were either undiagnosed, or died as an indirect consequence of the pandemic such as delayed cancer treatment or fear of going to hospital.  At the height of the pandemic in late last July, South Africa experienced 54% more deaths than was expected for that time period. Although when the lockdown was first imposed, fewer deaths were recorded than normal, presumably because of fewer cases of alcohol-related violence and road accidents. Thanks to Egypt's comprehensive registration system, it is possible to calculate that there were more than 68,000 excess deaths between May and August last year.  In June, the number of recorded deaths was almost double what would usually be expected.  On average, official Covid-19 deaths made up under 10% of those additional losses.  But for most countries on the continent there is no way to reach any conclusions like this as the data is so sparse.  In 14 countries a maximum of only one in 10 deaths are recorded, including in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon. Over half of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa only keep handwritten death records. Certain states, such as Eritrea and Burundi, have no legal requirement to register or collate deaths at all.  Eritrea has recorded only seven Covid-19 death to date and Burundi, just three, although there was speculation that the virus was a contributing factor in the unexpected death of Burundi's former President Pierre Nkurunziza last year.  Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, recorded only 10% of all deaths in 2017.  The pandemic further ""paralysed all the civil registration activities"" in the country, which were not deemed an essential service, according to a UN report in April 2020.  This could explain why the number of Covid-19 deaths per million people remains relatively low there.  Nigeria has recorded nine Covid-19 deaths per million, compared to the global average of 316. Meanwhile, South Africa has recorded 827 Covid-19 deaths per million and Tunisia 659 - the two highest in Africa. But it is important to take into account that these countries have good registers that capture most deaths - 92% and 95% of the population, respectively. The BBC and UNECA's research has created the most up to date and comprehensive assessments of the death registration systems on the continent.  It was also discovered that many countries are making progress in bridging the data gap. The Central African Republic (CAR) has one of the lowest performing CRVS systems on the continent following years of conflict, which is still ongoing.  In 2017 only 2% of estimated deaths were registered in the country. Twice as many male deaths were recorded as female -  and then only in the capital, Bangui, and its outskirts. Elvis Franck Matkoss, head of the statistics department at the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Co-operation, told the BBC that ""the government attaches particular importance to CRVS and its fundamental role in promoting good governance"".   He added that the CAR was making great efforts to improve on its 2% coverage through the modernisation of registration centres and the creation of a more centralised system.  Mr Matkoss said the government was also providing funding to help communities register their dead, as well as promoting free birth certificates for all children.  Senegal and Rwanda are both working with a US non-profit organisation, Vital Strategies, to put together historic mortality data that can be compared to deaths during the pandemic - using a method called ""rapid mortality surveillance"".  Five other countries - Togo, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ghana - are working with the African Field Epidemiology Network to do the same. Chad and Liberia are asking community health workers to notify the authorities about deaths that occur outside of hospitals. They are using ""verbal autopsies"" - interviewing next of kin about the deceased - a low-cost solution to understand major causes of death in a specific region. Some countries are using mobile technology to collect, manage and archive data about deaths. In Rwanda and Mozambique, people can use smartphones to register deaths on an electronic system, allowing relatives to report deaths while socially distancing. In Uganda, the Civil Registration Office has set up the Mobile Vital Records System for the registration of births and deaths in health centres and at a community level.  Over the next decade, data scientists hope this kind of innovation will help more countries on the continent to reach their universal death registration targets. The BBC's research has highlighted some of the problems and the UNECA's Mr Muhwava said that it had brought ""to the fore the challenges that CRVS systems in Africa face in documenting death events"".

economic indicators,Northern Ireland business review of 2020,2024-09-15,2020-12-29,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-55402788,"In February one business group warned that Covid-19 would have a 1% impact on Northern Ireland tourism. Little did we know that just four weeks later the entire sector - and so many others - would be shut down to stop the spread of coronavirus. BBC News NI reflects on a year in business dominated by the pandemic. The UK airline Flybe went into administration in March - it was a huge blow to the Northern Ireland aviation industry before the Covid-19 crisis hit. Since then airlines all over the world have been shedding jobs and Northern Ireland airports have been haemorrhaging money. Not only are people not booking holidays but holidaymakers disappointed by cancellations are looking for refunds from travel agents and airlines. That will also affect demand for planes and have a knock-on effect on the aerospace sector, including one of Northern Ireland's largest employers, Spirit Aerosystems - formerly Bombardier - which changed ownership in a deal completed this year. As huge parts of the economy were forced to close in response to the pandemic in March, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced an unprecedented intervention. The job retention scheme - known as furlough - initially paid 80% of workers' wages, even more generous than business lobby groups had asked for. At its peak, it supported almost a quarter of a million workers in Northern Ireland. But so many jobs could not be saved. The number of people on unemployment-related benefits doubled even with government support. Since March employers have proposed making more than 10,000 workers redundant - about half of those were in manufacturing and retail. The furlough scheme has been extended until April - a warning sign that the government does not expect things to be back to normal any time soon. Employers still have to contribute towards the wages of staff on furlough, something that becomes increasingly challenging when businesses are closed. The Beannchor Group - which owns a list of hotels, pubs and restaurants in Belfast - said furlough contributions cost it £30,000 a week while its shutters were down. As each lockdown came, pain was felt across the various sectors forced to close, like non-essential retail and hospitality. Business groups were frustrated at how significant decisions were communicated, often at short notice. Each sector would call for financial support, a date to reopen and guidance about trading safely. That cycle built up hopes and dashed them again as dates were pushed back at short notice. A number of different industries said they felt lessons were not learned from March and that again in October and December they felt things could have been handled differently. Many businesses had no choice but to adapt, whether that was by introducing online ordering, offering takeaway, or installing outdoor seating or screens and other equipment to protect staff from the virus. All of those changes were at an extra cost to businesses at a time when they did not have money coming in. There were also new ways of operating in hospitality, for example, with rules on who could sit together and for how long. Each of those restrictions chipped away at profitability. Some big names in hospitality, like the Duke of York pub in Belfast's Cathedral Quarter, decided it was not worth reopening in 2020. A huge amount of financial support was offered to businesses but as each scheme was announced, gaps were identified. No one policy could help everyone and many traders fell outside the criteria for any support. The high street had a number of big casualties in 2020, some of which had been struggling before the pandemic. Closing shops during lockdowns sped up shifts in consumer behaviour as shoppers were forced online. Big names like Eason, Oasis and Warehouse disappeared from towns, cities and shopping centres. Debenhams, which was already in administration, was not able to find a buyer, leading to hundreds of job losses in Northern Ireland. Hundreds more jobs are at risk at the Arcadia group - which owns once-iconic brands such as Topshop and Dorothy Perkins - which is also in administration. Many other businesses did not survive 2020. Arguably some of them - like the big chains already mentioned - had underlying health issues. For others, the pandemic meant their work dried up overnight. But some managed to thrive. With some creative thinking, manufacturers of everything from sportswear to window blinds switched their operations and staff to make protective equipment to help fight against Covid-19. Some food producers had a huge rise in demand and continued to grow and create jobs in spite of the pandemic. And demand also grew in other areas, like the delivery sector, where people who lost their jobs in lots of different sectors are now looking to work. While many of the economic indicators, like unemployment, paint a bleak picture, the take-up of things like the furlough scheme show how the effect of the pandemic could have been much worse without government help. Unfortunately the economy is not out of the woods yet. The news of a Covid-19 vaccine will mean the economic recovery can start next year but another lockdown from now until February will mean more financial pain. Economists predict it will be years before the Northern Ireland economy bounces back fully from the crisis. The pace of that recovery will also depend heavily on how government support is extended. Add Brexit to the mix, with 2020 marking the end of the transition period. Throughout the year businesses in Northern Ireland have not known whether they would be leaving the EU with a trade deal or on World Trade Organisation terms. However, they do now have some certainty on how the Northern Ireland protocol will work - that will help their planning for 2021. In 2020, business groups were pitted against the health service in a ""health versus wealth"" narrative. None of the dozens of business owners I spoke to wanted to get sick or put the lives of their staff, customers or families at risk. Many said they would rather stay closed but they could not afford to. Unfortunately the effect on many business owners will extend to their own homes, their families and their mental health. Many business groups will be glad the year is over and will behoping for some signs of growth in 2021. The interconnected relationship between the two sides of this crisis means the only way to get the economy back to normal is by dealing with the health crisis and reducing the pressure on the health service. Uncertainty continues and it might not be until the second half of 2021 that businesses can return to some sort of normality. But at least they can take some comfort that there is hope - an end is in sight to the costly cycle of lockdowns and reopenings."
economic indicators,Business activity drops at sharpest rate in years,2024-09-15,2019-12-09,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-50693107,"Business activity in NI's private sector fell at its sharpest rate in seven years last month, according to a survey by Ulster Bank. It asks businesses about things like orders, exports and staffing in what is considered a reliable indicator of economic performance. Last month, NI companies reported the sharpest decline in new orders since May 2012. Brexit uncertainty was the main reason for the fall, according to the report.  Respondents said there was a wariness among customers to commit to new projects. All four sectors reported a fall in output but retail and construction were the hardest hit, said the report: ""In this environment, firms' desire to maintain staffing levels comes at a cost to profit levels,"" said Ulster Bank chief economist Richard Ramsey.  ""Firms therefore seem willing to take a hit to their profits in the short-term in the hope that conditions will improve once there is greater certainty around the situation with Brexit."" Mr Ramsey warned this could prove to be overly-optimistic.  ""Even if a Brexit deal is passed, there is still much to be decided around the new relationship with the EU and how any new arrangements would work,"" he said."
economic indicators,Can we tell yet who has the edge?,2024-09-15,2018-08-01,By Anthony Zurcher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45013748,"This is it. After primaries, debates, countless polls, months of campaigning and endless speculation, the US mid-term elections are almost here. In some states, early voting has been going on for weeks and turnout has surpassed previous records for non-presidential years. At this point Democrats are cautiously optimistic of their chances to take back some legislative power. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi has gone so far as to flat-out state that her party will win control of the House of Representatives.  Such an outcome would have immediate and drastic implications for the president's ability to advance his political agenda and Democratic oversight of his administration. The ""mid-term wave"" - a sweeping electoral triumph that reshapes the national political map - is a recurring phenomenon in US politics. Is one about to crash on Republicans in Washington? For the purposes of this analysis, a mid-term wave is where one party picks up a combination of more than 20 seats in the US House of Representatives and the Senate. That's happened eight times in the last 70 years, notably in 1994 (a Republican wave against Bill Clinton) and 2010 (one against Barack Obama). Today, the Republican Party is near a modern-day high in seats in the House of Representatives, with a 241-to-194 seat majority, so it could be poised for a tumble. The Senate terrain may be friendlier for Republicans, with Democrats defending 10 seats in states Mr Trump won in 2016, but this year's political atmosphere is such that an electoral storm could be brewing.  Democrats have the political wind at their back, but intervening events - like the fight over confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court - have the potential to shake things up. What is the current state of play?  Here are the measurements - and the history lessons - that will give us clues. Money makes the (political) world go round. Levels of cash pouring in for candidates, parties and independent groups are an indication of electoral muscle for advertising, organisation and get-out-the-vote efforts. They're also a reflection of the enthusiasm of each side's donor base. There's one component of campaign fundraising that tracks particularly closely with every wave election in the last 25 years, a period during which the role of money in political campaigns skyrocketed.  In the Republican wave of 1994, individual donations to House candidates - which are limited under campaign finance law - tilted toward Republicans. The party then took control of the chamber for the first time since 1955.  In 2006, the fundraising advantage flipped to the Democrats, as did control of Congress. Four years later, Republicans were back in the money - and back in charge of the House. In 2014, they built their biggest majority there in 83 years and won control of the Senate, as well.  ""In mid-term waves, long-time incumbents can get kind of caught flat-footed when they're faced with a well-funded, competitive race,"" says Geoffrey Skelley of the University of Virginia Center for Politics.  2018 outlook: What was once a remarkable fund-raising advantage for Democratic House of representative candidates has become an astounding one. The latest figures show them more than doubling the Republican amount of contributions from individual donors. As of 2 November, they have brought in $649m (£500m), against ""only"" $312m for Republicans. Democratic enthusiasm is translating into open pocketbooks - and a rising financial tide is lifting all Democratic ships. It's not all gloom and doom for Republicans, however. They have plenty of deep-pocketed donors pouring their own money into independent expenditures, and the Republican Party itself is flooding money into key races across the US. When it comes to grass-roots enthusiasm and small-money donors, however, all the energy and excitement is clearly coming from the left. In the past month alone, Democrats have hit the accelerator and left the Republicans behind in a cloud of dust. Mid-term elections are said to be a referendum on the incumbent president.  When presidents are unpopular, voters take out their frustration on their party in Congress.  If the chief executive is riding high, the party is rewarded (or, at least, not excessively punished). A look at the Gallup presidential approval poll over the last 60 years tends to bear this out. Every time a president faced a net-negative rating in the month before the mid-terms - Ronald Reagan in 1982, Bill Clinton in 1994, George Bush in 2006 and Barack Obama in 2010 and 2014 - it meant lights-out for his party at the ballot box in November. The exceptions are also enlightening.  Gerald Ford was plus-24 in October 1974, but his numbers - following his controversial pardoning of Richard Nixon the month before - were poised to take a nosedive, declining 15 points over the next three months. Democrats gained 48 seats in the House and five in the Senate - what would be known as the ""Watergate Class"" of Congress. Lyndon Johnson was around the break-even point in 1966, but unease about the Vietnam War and civil rights unrest, combined with his party's inflated congressional numbers after a big victory two years earlier, set Democrats up for a tumble. 2018 outlook:  Donald Trump's approval ratings have been remarkably stable, given the tumult of his first year-and-a-half in office. He didn't have much of a ""honeymoon"" period following his election, so there haven't been many sharp changes. At the end of August, the president stood at 40% approval. On the eve of the mid-term elections his approval is… 40% That's not a good sign for Republicans. The president has defied political gravity in the past, but his unpopularity could be a weight that sinks his party on Tuesday. This involves asking people simply which party's House candidate they would support in the election. There are 435 individual House of Representatives races in every mid-term election, meaning at least 870 candidates from the two major parties plus a handful of prominent independents and third-party politicians.  Each race is unique, every constituency has its own particular interests, and each congressional district has a demographic identity as unique as a fingerprint. It therefore seems implausible that the collective outcome of all those races could be boiled down to a simple poll asking whether a voter would prefer a nameless Democrat or a faceless Republican.  The generic ballot question, however, has proven to be a remarkably accurate predictor of mid-term election prospects for the two major parties. ""The national generic ballot picks up the national political climate,"" says Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University who has crafted an election prediction model based largely on the generic ballot polling numbers.  ""I view it as a measure of the political mood of the electorate."" In 1958, 1982 and 2006, the Democratic generic ballot advantage ballooned before the party's wave-election victories.  When the Republican waves of 1994, 2010 and 2014 swept through, the Democratic advantage narrowed to low single digits (or even, at times during the election run-up, disappeared entirely). This year, Abramowitz says, the tipping point for Democratic control of the House sits around a seven-point generic ballot advantage. A lead bigger than that, and a wave could be on the horizon. 2018 outlook: The Democratic generic ballot lead has shifted over the course of the past year. In the late spring it narrowed to the point that it appeared Republicans were in excellent shape for November. By mid-September, however, the Democratic lead approached double-digits. That trend tailed off a bit, but the current eight-point margin is on the lower edge of where it has to be for a blue wave, even if it falls short of a tsunami. Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans are pushing positive economic numbers as a reason why they deserve another two years of unified control in Washington.  Historically, however, a growing economy is no guarantee of success for the president's party.  In 1994, when the governing Democrats ceded Congress, the economy was expanding at more than 4%, although unemployment was a bit higher than the current mark, at 5.8%.  In other wave years, 2006 and 2014, the economy wasn't in bad shape either. A struggling economy, on the other hand, can be a death sentence for the incumbent party's mid-term prospects.  In 1958, Republicans in Congress faced a bloodbath largely due to that year's recession, which included a modern-record -10% first-quarter GDP contraction.  Negative growth in 1974 and 1982 also probably contributed to Republican losses those years.  ""You'd rather have a strong economy than a bad economy, but it doesn't mean you're going to escape the wrath of voters,"" says Abramowitz. 2018 outlook:  Third-quarter gross domestic product growth is down a bit, after the second quarter hit 4.2%. Combined with unemployment at a 49-year low and signs of wage growth, however, the economic numbers are undoubtedly good. Mr Trump has decided to make immigration control his closing argument to mid-term voters - to the dismay of some Republicans who would prefer he focus laser-like on the robust economy. If history is a guide, however, the president may be right to look for a different issue, as a growing economy is no guarantee of electoral success. Set aside all the poll numbers, economic figures and expert analyses.  Who has their finger on the pulse of the political climate better than anyone? Probably the politicians themselves. They're the ones whose names are on the ballots, and they're the ones who could be out of a job if a wave hits. Facing the prospect of embarrassing electoral defeat, some politicians may opt to ease into early retirement or get a head-start on colleagues searching for post-public-service gainful employment. ""We know historically that open seats are more difficult to defend,"" says Skelley. ""And because they're more difficult to defend, that gives the party that doesn't control them a better shot."" A look at modern retirement trends shows a mixed picture. The retirement figures in 2010 gave little hint of the carnage in store for Mr Obama's party. In 1994, however, a surge of Democratic retirements may have foreshadowed big Republican gains that autumn.  2018 outlook: If 1994's retirements were a harbinger of doom for Democrats, 2018's numbers could spell trouble for Republicans.  Several key committee chairs and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan have already joined what's become a modern record for retirements from a majority party - a telling sign that they think Republicans may not be a majority much longer.  Several incumbents - on the left and right - also were forcibly retired, as they lost primary races to grass-roots challengers.  That could be another indication of an anti-incumbent mood in the electorate that, because there are more Republicans running for re-election than Democrats, could help fuel a Washington power shift.

economic indicators,10 numbers that tell the story of Zimbabwe,2024-09-15,2017-11-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42013720,"Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe resigned last year after almost four decades in power. Now, the country is approaching its first post-Mugabe election, with his successor Emmerson Mnangagwa and MDC Alliance candidate Nelson Chamisa the two front-runners in a field of 23 candidates. Here are 10 numbers that will help you understand how the country got to where it is now. Robert Mugabe, who led the country's liberation movement, was in power from independence in 1980 until he was ousted in November last year at the age of 93. His years in office, first as prime minister until the switch to a presidential system in 1987, were marked by economic turmoil and the crushing of dissent.  Emmerson Mnangagwa is his successor - nicknamed the ""crocodile"" because of political cunning. Once a Mugabe loyalist, he promises to revive the shattered economy and hopes to win elections on 30 July to legitimise his presidency. Zimbabwe's economy has struggled since a controversial land reform programme was introduced in 2000.  The programme that saw white-owned farms redistributed to landless black Zimbabweans - and those with good political connections - led to sharp falls in production. As the country's central bank printed money to try to get out of the crisis, rampant inflation took hold. Although the World Bank does not have figures for 2008 and 2009, numbers from Zimbabwe's central bank showed annual inflation reached 231 million % in July 2008. Officials gave up reporting monthly statistics when it peaked at just under 80 billion % in mid-November 2008. The country was forced to abandon its own currency a year later at a rate of Z$35 quadrillion to US$1. More on post-Mugabe Zimbabwe: The political and economic crises between 2000 and 2008 nearly halved Zimbabwe's GDP - the biggest contraction in a peacetime economy, according to the World Bank. A brief period of recovery between 2009 and 2012 has now faltered and the economy faces serious challenges, says the World Bank. Growth has slowed sharply from an average 8% from 2009 to 2012, caused by shifts in trade and a series of major droughts.  Mr Mugabe always blamed Zimbabwe's economic problems on a plot by Western countries, led by the UK, to oust him because of his seizure of white-owned farms. The country's political and economic crises have resulted in high poverty rates.  The hard years between 2000 and 2008 saw poverty rates increase to more than 72%, according to the World Bank. It also left a fifth of the population in extreme poverty.  Extreme poverty, estimated to have fallen from 2009 to 2014, is now projected to have risen again substantially. About 27% of children under the age of five suffer stunted growth, with 9% severely stunted because of poor nutrition, the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey report revealed. But poverty in Zimbabwe is still lower than in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, where about 41% of the population were living on less than $1.90 a day in 2013, World Bank data suggests. Estimates of the country's unemployment levels vary wildly. The World Bank's modelled estimates, based on International Labour Organisation data, puts the figure as low as 5% in 2016, while Zimbabwe's biggest trade union claimed the jobless rate was as high as 90% last year. However, the World Bank's definition only covers those actively seeking work. Many of those not counted may not seek a job despite wanting one because they ""view job opportunities as limited, or because they have restricted labour mobility, or face discrimination, or structural, social or cultural barriers"". The CIA World Factbook estimates the rate was 95% in 2009, but says current figures are not known. Thanks to large investments in education since independence, Zimbabwe has one of the highest adult literacy rates in Africa, with 89% of the adult population literate, according to World Bank data from 2014. Globally, the literacy rate stood at 86% in 2016, while in sub-Saharan Africa it was 64%. Almost all women and men aged 15-49 have had at least some primary education, according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey. More than 70% of people aged 15-49 have also attended secondary school.  Zimbabwe has the sixth highest HIV prevalence rate in sub-Saharan Africa, with 1.3 million people living with HIV in 2016, according to UNAids. However, after a peak in 1997, rates are declining.  According to the UN, this is a result of successful campaigns encouraging condom use as well as programmes preventing the transmission of infection from mother to child. Treatment and support services have also improved. Life expectancy fell in the 1990s, with the HIV/Aids epidemic a major killer. It dropped from a high of just under 61 years in 1986 to 44.1 years in 2003.   It is now steadily improving again, but with unemployment and poverty endemic and HIV/Aids rates still high, it remained at just 60 in 2015, according to World Bank data. Mobile devices are the leading communication tool for Zimbabweans. But while most have a mobile phone, only 43% of households have a radio, 37% have a television and 10% have a computer, according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey. After a growth spurt after independence in 1980, a decline in birth rates and a rise in death rates saw population growth slide downwards. With high outward migration rates also high, the population has not recovered its post-independence growth. Written and produced by Lucy Rodgers."
economic indicators,Has Eritrea's self-reliant economy run out of puff?,2024-09-15,2016-07-13,Mary Harper,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36786965,"Some of the poorest housing are small dwellings made from metal sheets A ""go it alone"" culture has long been central to Eritrea, including its economy. It is slowly opening up to foreign investment, but recent policies, especially a currency reform, mean many people are now struggling in what was already one of the poorest countries on earth.  In a dusty corner of the capital, Asmara, is a walled market. It assaults the senses as soon as you enter, for it deals in just two things: Chillies and metal. Big chillies, medium-sized chillies and, fiercest of all, the tiny chillies, draw tears, itches and sneezes. Chillies are a staple commodity in the markets There is a deafening cacophony as old metal is bashed from rusty, useless scraps into shiny cutlery, hairpins, gates, gutters and religious artefacts.  ""I am rewinding the metal,"" says a man as he bangs out a large serving dish from an old oil drum.  The market is basically a giant recycling centre and represents the country's fierce spirit of ""self-reliance"", a phrase I hear often in Eritrea. Eritrean metal worker: ""I am rewinding the metal.""  This culture started during the 30-year war of independence from Ethiopia, when rebels produced almost everything they needed in underground factories, including clothes, shoes and medicine.  It endured after Eritrea won the war in 1991, with the country periodically expelling aid agencies, saying they promoted dependency.  Unlike most African countries, there is a lack of large UN and NGO land cruisers zooming around the place. Although education up to tertiary level is free, young Eritreans are not free to pursue their own dream careers. They become locked into a system of obligatory national service, mainly in civilian roles, and have no idea when they will be released. In the spice and metal market, a man proudly shows me a storage container he has made from broken bits of mirror and steel. ""I have been in national service for nine years. The pay is very low - less than $50 [£37]a month - so I supplement it by working here."" Eritrea came third bottom in the United Nations Human Development Index for 2015. Time and again, I hear similar stories of people doing two or even three jobs to make ends meet.  On the plane to Asmara, I meet a man who imports mobile phones, televisions and satellite dishes from Dubai.  ""I have been in national service for 12 years. But I sort of 'dropped out' to become a trader."" More from Mary Harper: Could Eritrea come in from the cold? Africa's modernist enigma Eritrea celebrates 25 years of independence after war with Ethiopia Eritrea in pictures National service has another economic effect, as it is one of the main reasons so many young Eritreans flee their country for Europe, draining the country of much of its productive workforce.  However, if they get there safely, instead of dying in the desert or drowning in the sea on the way, many end up as ""useful"" members of the diaspora, sending money home.  In 2005, remittances were estimated to account for about a third of Eritrea's GDP.  ""However, that figure is plunging. The diaspora is now spending the money on helping people leave Eritrea instead of supporting relatives at home,"" says one official. Busha mine workers - although potentially lucrative mining doesn't generate much employment The Eritrean authorities used to be quite happy for disaffected youth to leave, says a diplomat.  A potential threat to stability was out of the way, and they were likely to end up sending remittances.  But, the diplomat says, the country now faces a serious capacity shortage and is doing more to encourage them to stay.  Hagos Ghebrehiwet, the economic adviser to the president, says the amount paid to those in national service is increasing from about $50 to $130-$300 a month, depending on education levels.  Government ministers tell me they earn about $200 a month, plus some allowances.  Most of the complaints I hear in Eritrea are about the skyrocketing cost of living, plus chronic shortages of electricity and water.  Depending on their size, families receive a certain quantity of basic foodstuffs, such as cereals, oil and sugar, at highly reduced prices. But other items cost a lot. For example, a litre of milk costs more than $2.  Business people, including taxi drivers, shopkeepers and hoteliers, say their incomes have halved since a new form of currency was introduced at the end of last year in an attempt to control smuggling, the parallel market and human trafficking. They complain that restrictions on imports and tight limits on the amount of money they can withdraw from banks are strangling their businesses. Shops selling imported goods can be expensive, with a single nappy costing more than $1 and a small tube of toothpaste nearly $2 Finance Minister Berhane Habtemariam says people were given six weeks to swap their old notes for new ones, at par.  ""We had no choice. The coffers of our banks were literally empty. When people came to exchange their notes, they had to explain how they had earned the money.  ""As so much of it was illegal, only 40% of the old notes were handed in, leading to a 60% contraction in the money supply."" The introduction of the new notes has had an impact on the parallel market. The fixed exchange rate has remained at 15 Eritrean nakfa for $1, but Eritreans say they now only receive about 18-20 nakfa for the dollar on the unofficial market, instead of nearly 60.  It is very difficult to work out what is going on in Eritrea's economy because the government does not release figures for its GDP and other key indicators. ""We have not given out any information about our budget for seven years because our enemies will use it against us,"" says the finance minister. Despite this secretive behaviour and the allegations of human rights abuses in the labour force, there are signs of growing interest from foreign investors. Some have been in Eritrea for years, such as the Italian-run Dolce Vita garment factory in Asmara.  The mainly Eritrean workforce makes designer shirts for Giorgio Armani and Pierre Cardin, as well as uniforms for Italian scouts and jeans for the local market. The Italian-run Dolce Vita garment factory has been a familiar sight in Asmara for years Another hope for the Eritrean economy is mining.  Canada's Nevsun, in joint venture with the government, began producing gold at Bisha mine in 2011. The mine also exploits copper and zinc deposits.  Human rights groups criticised Bisha for using conscripts during the construction phase, but Nevsun and the government deny national service labour is used in commercial mining. Nevsun says Bisha contributed about $800m (£550m) to the Eritrean economy in its first five years of operation. A Chinese mining company has recently started operations, and two more mines are expected to come online in the next few years. But mining, although potentially lucrative, does not generate much employment. Canada's Nevsun says the Bisha mine contributed $800m to the Eritrean economy in its first five years of operation The population is predominantly rural, working the harsh, dry land. But Eritreans and foreign investors are looking towards the country's 1,200km (745-mile) Red Sea coastline, with its hundreds of unspoiled islands, rich fish stocks and ports, all of which have significant economic potential. Whether any of this will be realised will depend on two main factors. Eritrea's willingness to adopt a more flexible attitude towards its economy, and foreign investors' readiness to engage with a country that has recently been accused of crimes against humanity and has spent years in international isolation. Nation of between 3.5 million and 6 million (the figures are disputed) on Red Sea - one of Africa's poorest countries One-party state - no functioning constitution or independent media  Former Italian colony, later formed loose federation with Ethiopia  1962 - Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie dissolved Eritrean parliament, seized Eritrea Eritrean separatists - the Eritrean People's Liberation Front - fought guerrilla war until 1991, when they captured capital Asmara Eritrea voted for independence in 1993 May 1998 border dispute with Ethiopia led to two-year war costing 100,000 lives  Still no peace settlement - thousands of troops face each other along 1,000km (620-mile) border Could Eritrea come in from the cold?

economic indicators,Tunisia's president - saviour or usurper of power?,2024-09-15,2022-07-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-62244847,"As Tunisia's president asks voters to approve on Monday a new constitution that gives him greater powers, North Africa analyst Magdi Abdelhadi looks at the man seen by his supporters as a saviour and by his opponents as a usurper of power.  President Kais Saied clearly feels that he is a man of destiny. Although his authoritarian streak is neither unique nor new to Tunisia or the region, his academic credentials and rhetorical style separate him by a long distance from all other Arab autocrats.  Delivering his speeches in impeccable classical Arabic, often adlibbed, at a considered pace, the former law professor conveys a sense of a man who weighs his words carefully, with clear focus and vision and ironclad determination. Despite mounting criticism both at home and abroad since he assumed total power in Tunisia a year ago, he has continued undeterred to his, and his alone, desired destination. This may very well be part of his appeal to many Tunisians.  Tunisia was the birthplace of the Arab Spring, which saw the overthrow of long-serving ruler Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.  But after more than a decade of political instability, which saw 10 governments come and go and endless squabbles in parliament, at times degenerating into violence, many Tunisians have simply grown sick of this ""democracy"",  which brought no tangible improvement to their quality of life. On the contrary, the economy was in free fall, with all economic indicators pointing in the wrong direction: inflation and unemployment up, foreign debt up, and the value of the Tunisian dinar has plunged. And things got much worse as the Covid pandemic struck,  and even more so after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the impact it had on food and energy prices.  Mr Saied is not against the Tunisian revolution, at least that is what he says in public. Rather, he sees himself as the man of the people, who ""corrects"" the path of the revolution.  But the word ""correction"" - tassheeh in Arabic - has a notorious history in Arab politics. It has often been deployed to justify power-grabs.   Characteristically, the leader of ""the correction"" is motivated by selflessness and a profound sense of the weight of history upon his shoulders. He wants to set history right.  Mr Saied's constitution enshrines that narrative.  Speaking in the name of the Tunisian people, who have not been consulted in any significant way in its drafting, the draft constitution says: ""Out of a sense of profound historic responsibility to correct the path of the [2011] revolution and the path of history itself, that is what happened on July 25 2021.""  That is the day President Saied sacked the government, suspended the parliament and embarked on his single-handed mission to redesign the country's political future.  Critics say he's taking Tunisia back to where it was before the 2011 Arab spring - outright autocracy.   We will soon find out whether the Tunisians will endorse that narrative and back Mr Saied's authoritarianism.  In fact, Tunisians are not alone in expressing disappointment with democracy. Disillusionment with the ability of a democratic system of government to tackle economic hardships is part of a wider trend of perceptions in North Africa and the Middle East.  According to a recent survey, 81% of Tunisians prefer a strong leader, and 77% are more interested in effective government than the form it takes.  There is a broad consensus among most observers that the new constitution reverses many of the democratic gains of the 2014 constitution that has been de facto annulled by Mr Saied. He has ruled by decrees since July last year.    As has been widely anticipated, Mr Saied's constitution is designed to give greater powers to the president and far less of it to the elected parliament.  This is a reversal of the balance of power between the two institutions as it was established in the 2014 constitution.  Crucially, it sets no curbs on presidential powers. There is no way of impeaching him in parliament or by any other institution.  Further, it is the president who selects the prime minister and the ministers, and he can dismiss them. He can also dissolve parliament as it seeks to withdraw confidence from the government. The new constitution also undermines the independence of the judiciary - a cornerstone of a democratic system. In short, it takes Tunisia back to the presidential system it had since independence with an emasculated parliament that has limited oversight powers. But the draft does introduce some real innovation - not just for Tunisia, but for the entire region. It removes the clause, found in most constitutions in the Arab world, that stipulates that Islam is the religion of the state and puts the relationship between religion and the state on a new trajectory. Instead,  the document says that ""Tunisia is part of the Islamic nation, and only the state has to work to achieve the objectives of Islam"". These are defined as protecting the individual's life, integrity, wealth, religion and freedom - no reference here to Sharia (Islamic law),  which has been the main rallying cry of Islamism everywhere.  And Islam is defined not in the narrow terms of Sharia's legal code, but in such broad terms that make it potentially compatible with democratic values, which Muslim reformers have long called for. This could effectively criminalise the use of religion by any political group, and thus undercut the powerful Islamist movement, Ennahda. But it is very likely to appeal to secularists.  Some of the strongest criticism of Mr Saied and his constitution have focused on the drafting process itself, which was neither transparent nor inclusive. It was put together by a group handpicked academics. The public online consultation that was announced earlier this year has failed to attract large number of Tunisians - only 500,000, some 5% or so of the electorate. Crucially, neither the constitution nor the president have specified the criteria for considering the document has secured wide public support.  No threshold for approving the document, nor a minimum turnout have been stipulated.  Several parties - including the biggest block in the dissolved parliament, Ennahda - have called for a boycott. But opposition to Mr Saied has never managed to mount an effective campaign to rally the public against the president or force him to change course. All eyes will be on the turnout. A big turn out with a yes vote could cement Mr Saied's power.  A low turnout or a no vote could plunge him and Tunisia in a deeper constitutional crisis.  Although he has been democratically elected with some 70% of the vote in 2019,  failure to secure resounding popular support could further undermine his legitimacy and will most likely embolden his enemies to challenge him."
economic indicators,Treasury refuses to publish UK economic forecast,2024-09-15,2022-09-20,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62970803,"The Treasury is refusing to publish a forecast of the UK's economic outlook alongside this Friday's mini-Budget.  Independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has already provided a draft to Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, the BBC understands. The Treasury Select Committee says a forecast is ""vital"" given recent government moves to curb living costs. Action to cap annual energy bills could cost about £150bn, and tax cuts are expected on Friday. The mini-Budget is expected to see the government reverse a rise in National Insurance and scrap a planned increase in corporation tax, which reports say could cost £30bn. The draft forecast the OBR has provided does not include the impact of the energy bill help. It has offered to provide a forecast including this impact, but that has been rejected. The fact the offer has not been taken up is raising some concerns about whether the government's tax and spending policy is ""flying blind"", given predictions that the UK is facing a lengthy recession.  MPs on the Treasury Select Committee wrote to the chancellor on Tuesday seeking assurance that an OBR forecast would be published. ""These forecasts are a vital indicator of the health of the nation's finances, and provide reassurance and confidence to international markets and investors,"" said the committee's chairman, Mel Stride. ""There has been a deterioration in our economic outlook since the last OBR forecast in March. There have been significant fiscal interventions since then and we are told there will be further significant interventions including major permanent tax cuts to be announced on Friday. ""Under these circumstances, it is vital that an independent OBR forecast is provided."" The OBR is obliged to produce economic forecasts twice a year, usually accompanying the Autumn Budget and Spring Statement.  On Friday, there will be no independent assessment about whether permanent tax cuts and some one-off spending increases are consistent with the government's Budget rules.  The lack of OBR forecast also means it will not cast judgement on the impact of the new tax measures on growth - a key target for the government which wants to increase the trend rate of growth to 2.5%. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: ""Given the exceptional circumstances our country faces, we have moved at immense speed to provide significant energy bill support for households and businesses, and are acting swiftly to set out further plans to kickstart economic growth later this week. ""We remain committed to maintaining the usual two forecasts in this fiscal year, as is required."" In its latest long-term forecast in July, the OBR said trend growth had fallen from 2.2% to 1.4%, partly because of a declining size of the workforce. In the City, where in recent weeks the value of the pound sterling has fallen and the cost of borrowing for the UK government has risen, there is some expectation that the Treasury will imminently have to formally increase its ""remit"" for borrowing.  The Financing Remit is given to the Debt Management Office based on a forecast for borrowing. Extra sales of government loans, known as gilts, also need to be co-ordinated with the Bank of England, which is planning to sell off some of the gilts it owns, as it starts to reverse its long-running programme of stimulus. Government insiders say that the main motivation behind Friday's announcements is to enact the PM's leadership campaign promises as quickly as possible, and that a full forecast will accompany an upcoming Budget statement.  The cost of the energy package, for example, could vary considerably depending on market prices for gas, and the ability of the government to renegotiate expensive contracts for renewable energy."
economic indicators,NI firms 'saw strong finish to 2017',2024-09-15,2018-01-15,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-42660413,"The Northern Ireland private sector experienced a strong finish last year, Ulster Bank data has suggested. The bank surveys private sector activity monthly, in what is considered a reliable indicator of the economy. December's survey saw overall business activity expanding at the fastest monthly rate in a year, while new orders accelerated to a 40-month high. For 2017 as a whole, output, orders and employment growth increased at their fastest rate in three years.  The bank's chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said: ""Local firms, most notably manufacturers, are benefiting from a pick-up in the global economy and the enhanced price-competitiveness resulting from sterling's weakness."" UK manufacturing as a whole saw significant growth in 2017. The latest official figures showed manufacturing output is expanding at its fastest rate since early 2008 after recording a seventh consecutive month of growth in November. Renewable energy projects, boats, aeroplanes and cars for export helped make output 3.9% higher in the three months to November than 2016. Mr Ramsey said optimism among companies in Northern Ireland had strengthened to a three-month high as close to 35% of respondents predicted an increase in output over the coming year. However he cautioned that a continuing squeeze on public spending would continue to act as a drag on the economy. ""Whilst the survey shows the Northern Ireland private sector moving into 2018 on a relatively strong footing, the same cannot be said for the public and third sectors, with government cuts impacting significantly on both."""
economic indicators,Five things about Nigeria: The superpower with no power,2024-09-15,2019-02-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47217557,"More than 84 million Nigerians are registered to vote, but what do you know about Africa's most-populous nation and largest economy? Nigerian musicians are touring the world and picking up awards at the forefront of the global craze for Afrobeats. This is not to be confused with the late, great Fela Kuti's Afrobeat (without the s) - Nigeria's soundtrack to the 1970s and 1980s, which mixed traditional rhythms with funk and jazz. These new stars, including Wizkid, Davido, Tiwa Savage and Jidenna, are proving to be some of Nigeria's biggest exports - so much so that global music giants such as Universal Music Group and Sony have set up offices in the country. Davido's Fall, released in 2017, is the most popular Nigerian music video ever - clocking up more than 100 million views and counting on YouTube. ""This West African phenomenon is not only dominating the sound of the continent, it has flown into club festivals and radio playlists across the globe,"" DJ Rita Ray told the BBC. ""Afrobeats is also influencing genres from grime to RnB and music makers from Ed Sheeran to rappers Drake and Stefflon Don, who have all embraced Afrobeats in recent releases. And that's not to forget British-Nigerian singer, songwriter MNEK, whose writing and production credits include Beyoncé, Dua Lipa, Madonna, Diplo and countless more. Add up all the hits and he'd have more than a billion views on YouTube."" The sound evolved from Nigerian and Ghanaian Afro-pop music, incorporating genres like hiplife, azonto and dancehall - and it was D'banj's track Oliver Twist that launched the Afrobeats bandwagon in 2012, getting to number nine in the UK charts, she says. Other Nigerian talent to look out for include Afrobeats musicians such as Yemi Alade, Tekno, Falz, Olamide, Simi, Mr Eazi, Mologo and Patoranking. ""What makes Afrobeats so compelling is rhythm - Nigerians have always been hot on rhythms, it's the driving force of their music. Afrobeats takes this forward by stripping back to one of the component parts of their rich polyrhythms,"" says Rita Ray. It's not just music where Nigeria packs a cultural punch - it also boasts some of the world's greatest writers. Top of the list comes the late Chinua Achebe, whose debut novel, Things Fall Apart, has become a classic of post-colonial literature selling more than 20 million copies since its publication in 1958. It has also been translated into 57 languages. Wole Soyinka became the first African to be awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 1986 and Ben Okri's The Famished Road won the coveted Man Booker Prize in 1991. And contemporary writers like Chigozie Obioma, Helon Habila, Chibundu Onuzo  Sefi Atta and Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani are keeping up the tradition, to name just a few of those scooping up prizes. ""Nigerians love to be seen and heard. There are probably hundreds of Africans telling amazing stories all over the continent, but Nigerians are getting most of the attention because we are bold and loud,"" Nwaubani told the BBC. ""We aim to be at the top in everything we do. We make sure that everyone knows whenever we enter the building. Even those of us based in our home country, where there is a dearth of adequate publishing structures, are succeeding in commanding the attention of publishers and readers across the globe."" Given that Nigerians have a proverb to hand for every occasion, it is no surprise they are such fantastic storytellers, while the country's thriving multi-million dollar film industry, known as Nollywood, is testament to their love of a dramatic plot. Nigeria's multitude of ethnicities also adds to the creative mix. Arguably the face of feminism in the 21st Century is award-winning writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, who neatly summed up the feminist cause in her book Dear Ijeawele: ""The knowledge of cooking does not come pre-installed in a vagina."" You're into dangerous territory in Nigeria if you try to establish which ethnic or religious group has the biggest population as it brings to the fore a multitude of rivalries - and tensions over money as the larger a state's population, the greater the budget allocated by the central government. Yet there is no denying that Nigeria's population is growing at a dizzying speed. By 2047 it will have overtaken the US to become the world's third-largest nation with 387 million people, according to UN projections. It is also a very young nation with more than 40% of the population of 196 million under the age of 14. And young people are set to play a huge role in this election with more than half of registered voters under the age of 35. The huge growth presents an opportunity for the country with its entrepreneurial spirit as it could in theory take advantage of the economic dividend that a young dynamic population can bring. This is especially true as the workforce in more developed nations is getting older. But it is also a challenge for policy makers. Young graduates can frequently be heard complaining that there are not enough high-quality jobs available, and many speak about hoping to leave the country. Looking at population growth in Africa in general, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has warned that without proper planning it could become a political catastrophe.  Some would argue that the real soundtrack of Nigeria is not Afrobeats, but the din of diesel generators as most Nigerians, even if they are connected to mains electricity, have to rely on them because power cuts are common. Some areas can go without power for weeks. This is despite the fact that Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer and currently pumps out around two million barrels a day. The tax revenue the government receives from the industry and the foreign exchange it gets from its export are vital to the economy. Though many Nigerians would be quick to remind you that much of its oil wealth has been squandered over the years. At one stage Nigerians used to joke that the old state-run power provider Nepa stood for ""Never Expect Power Always"". In a bid to overhaul the industry, the state firm was split up and privatised - a process that was completed in November 2013. Yet complaints about unfair billing and blackouts remain constant. Electricity production has steadily increased since 2000 but it has struggled to keep up with population growth, according to the International Energy Agency. Electricity supply per Nigerian has barely changed since 2005 because the population has grown in that time by approximately 57 million, which is the current population of South Africa. Just more than half of all Nigerian homes have mains electricity, but there is a big urban-rural divide. More than four out of every five homes in towns and cities have mains power while only a third of homes in the countryside do, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. As well as being the continent's biggest oil producer, it is also its largest economy, but its power problems have hampered growth. The hashtag #BringBackOurGirls brought the world's attention to an Islamist insurgency led by Boko Haram militants. Their kidnapping in 2014 of more than 200 girls from a school in Chibok, in north-eastern Nigeria, underlined the heart of their cause - opposition to Western-style education. The group was founded in 2002 in the north-eastern city of Maiduguri, where local residents dubbed it Boko Haram, which loosely translated from the region's Hausa language as ""Western education is forbidden"". Historically, the Muslim rulers of northern Nigeria had resisted direct British colonial rule. But Andrew Walker, author of a book about Boko Haram, ""Eat the Heart of the Infidel"", says it has even deeper roots. ""There is a long history of Islamic radicalism in northern Nigeria, where two caliphates preceded colonialism,"" he told the BBC. ""More recently, the notion that corrupt politicians were not Islamic became the springboard for Muslim cleric Mohammed Yusuf to found Boko Haram. ""The political culture of northern Nigeria, where local politicians court groups like Yusuf's hoping they can aid them in their political ends, incubated the group in its early days. Even before Yusuf and his followers turned to violence, the Maiduguri establishment worried about the mixing in of a charismatic preacher and his poverty-bound devotees to the pot of corrupt electoral politics."" Mr Yusuf's death in police custody nearly a decade ago led the group to launch military operations to create an Islamic state. Many thousands of people were kidnapped and recruited into its ranks, and at one stage the group controlled swathes of territory across three states, imposing strict Sharia. At its peak, in 2015, Boko Haram was ranked the world's deadliest terror group by the Institute for Economics and Peace. But in the last four years, the military, with international support, has managed to take back control of much of this land and rescued many of those taken hostage. Yet the militants are still proving deadly, with fighters from a Boko Haram faction loyal to Islamic State being behind an upsurge in violence ahead of the elections. And 112 of the Chibok schoolgirls are still missing. "
economic indicators,ECB says no quick end to stimulus,2024-09-15,2017-07-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40666236,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has insisted there is still a long way to go before it can call a halt to its economic stimulus programme. ECB president Mario Draghi threw cold water on speculation that the bank might wind the programme down soon. The bank is still buying 60bn euros (£53bn) of bonds a month as part of its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The ECB also kept the key interest rate for the countries that use the euro currency unchanged at 0%. Mr Draghi said: ""After a long time we are finally experiencing a robust recovery, where we only have to wait for wages and prices to follow a course towards our objective.  ""The last thing the governing council wants is an unwanted tightening and for conditions that may either slow down this process or even jeopardise it."" Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The comment on inflation which is sticking in our head is Mr Draghi's notice to markets that: 'We are not there yet.'"" However, the euro did move sharply to a 14-month high against the dollar when at one point Mr Draghi hinted that the governing council of the ECB might start discussing reducing QE in the autumn. Neil Wilson from ETX Capital commented: ""It wasn't much but the market is super-sensitive to anything from Draghi at the moment."" Last month, Mr Draghi's speech in Sintra in Portugal was interpreted by many economists as meaning the eurozone's economic recovery would allow QE to end and for interest rates to rise. Patrick O'Donnell, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said: ""This is a well-choreographed attempt by Mr Draghi to make sure that financial markets don't get ahead of themselves after his more hawkish comments of late."" The QE bond-buying programme, together with ultra-low interest rates, was designed to encourage lending and fend off the threat of deflation in the eurozone. Mr Draghi said the policy had been a success: ""We have created in the last three years six million jobs, much more than any time before the crisis in the same amount of time. ""All the economic sentiment indicators and survey indicators are either at all time highs or close to them so the policies have been successful."" However, the inflation rate in the eurozone was 1.3% in June, down slightly from 1.4% in May, some way below the ECB's target of close to, but below, 2%. Mr Draghi said: ""Measures of underlying inflation remain low and have yet to show convincing signs of a pick-up, as domestic cost pressures, including wage growth, are still subdued. Underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to rise only gradually over the medium term."" Aberdeen Asset Management's Mr O'Donnell said: ""We probably won't hear anything significant out of the ECB until September, which is plenty of time for investors to digest Mr Draghi's caveat laden hawkishness. ""Mr Draghi will be hoping that today's performance is enough to give him a quiet summer."""
economic indicators,Scots economy 'facing challenges ahead',2024-09-15,2017-07-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-40657052,"Scotland's economy will continue to grow this year but there are potential challenges ahead, according to a respected business survey. Scottish Chambers of Commerce's latest quarterly economic indicator has suggested most businesses have a positive outlook for the coming months. However, firms also highlighted longer-term threats to success. They included factors such as falling real incomes and rising recruitment problems. The report, released in collaboration with the University of Strathclyde's Fraser of Allander Institute, covers the key sectors of construction, financial and business services, manufacturing, retail and tourism. It said construction and manufacturing firms reported strong results during the quarter, with the latter experiencing an increase in staffing levels. Tourism businesses also suggested there had been an increase in employment, with visitor numbers up over the quarter. Meanwhile, firms in finance and business services reported a further improvement in sales, with a net balance of firms reporting sales growth at its highest for two years. However, almost half of retail companies saw a decline in profit levels over the quarter, with increased pressure to raise prices. More than half said they expected to increase prices over the next three months. Neil Amner, from Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said the retail sector was ""perhaps most exposed"" to pressures on household budgets. He added: ""Consumer demand drives around three-quarters of Scotland's economic growth, so unless the recent falls in real earnings are reversed, there is a risk that the impact could spread to the wider economy. ""There is also evidence that the low unemployment rate may be impacting on businesses' ability to recruit the talent they need. ""Those recruitment pressures underline the need for early agreement on the rights of existing EU workers to live and work in the UK and for the UK's future migration policy to be driven by business need."" Economy Secretary Keith Brown said the report showed ""encouraging signs"" for Scotland's private sector. He said: ""Our unemployment rate is at a record low, the productivity gap with the UK is closing, we achieved a record breaking year for foreign investment projects in Scotland during 2016, and our economy achieved growth of 0.8%, the highest quarterly rate since 2014. ""While we of course recognise the continuing economic challenges, with Brexit in particular a worrying issue, the Scottish government will continue to use all its powers to grow the economy, including our £500m investment in the Scottish Growth Scheme designed to transform our country's businesses and skills."" A total of 465 firms responded to the survey, which was conducted between 23 May and 12 June."
economic indicators,US prices rise at fastest rate in nearly 40 years,2024-09-15,2022-01-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59969864,"Prices in the US are rising at their fastest rate in almost 40 years, with inflation up 7% year-on-year in December. Strong demand and scarce supply for key items such as cars are driving the increases, which are putting pressure on policymakers to act. The US central bank is expected to raise interest rates this year. The rise in borrowing costs is aimed at reducing demand by making purchases such as cars more expensive.  December's increase marked the third month in a row that the US annual inflation rate has hovered above 6% - well north of policymakers' 2% target. The last time the pace of inflation exceeded that level was 1982. Housing costs were up 4.1% year-on-year, while the cost of groceries rose 6.5% - compared to a 1.5% annual average over the last 10 years. Wednesday's report from the Labor Department showed signs that some of the pressures may be easing. The cost of energy dropped 0.4% from November to December - its first decline since April. But over 12 months energy costs are up by nearly 30% and have returned to their upward trend in recent days. ""Overall, this is every bit as bad as we expected,"" Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics, said of the December inflation report. Reacting to the latest report, President Joe Biden said that it ""demonstrates that we are making progress in slowing the rate of price increases"".  He added that there is ""more work to do"" in the US and noted that ""inflation is a global challenge, appearing in virtually every developed nation as it emerges from the pandemic economic slump"". The price pressures occurring in the US have been seen to varying degrees around the world.  The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which represents more than 30 of the world's largest economies, said this week that inflation among its members had hit its highest rate in 25 years in November.  In the UK, inflation hit a 10-year high in November, while globally, prices are rising at their fastest pace since 2008, according to the World Bank.  While many countries are grappling with higher food and energy costs, the US has seen an unusually large pick-up in inflation.  That's due in part to strong demand from households, whose spending got a boost from government coronavirus aid and shifted suddenly from things like travel to furniture during the pandemic. Economists in the US were initially hopeful that the pressures would ease as the pandemic faded. But ongoing production snarls and the emergence of virus variants have made the price increases more persistent than expected. ""It's proving more difficult than we had hoped to end the pandemic,"" the head of America's central bank, Jerome Powell, told Congress on Tuesday. Sarah House, economist at Wells Fargo, said it is no longer likely that inflation will fade naturally as the pandemic abates, pointing to worker shortages and wages, which have also been rising - though not as fast as prices. ""Although the exceptional pace of goods inflation and momentum in shelter costs are still firmly rooted in the pandemic, the increasingly tight labour market and ensuing wage pressures will make it difficult for inflation to fall back on its own,"" she said. The issue has put pressure on the Biden administration, eroding consumer confidence despite other signs of a strong economy.  Mr Powell has pledged to keep inflation in check by raising interest rates. But on Tuesday he warned those moves would only go so far to address the problem if supply chain issues persist, pointing to risks from new shutdowns in China.  ""Omicron, particularly if China sticks to a no-Covid policy, Omicron can really disrupt the supply chains again,"" he said. Official inflation figures from China on Thursday showed prices rose less than expected in November, with producer prices up 10.3% and consumer prices up 1.5%. But that easing is not necessarily an indicator of what will happen elsewhere, said Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. ""Indicators of what is happening [in China] to the labour market, to wage demands and to the supply bottlenecks that have pushed up some prices ... those are more important indicators,"" he said."

economic indicators,Will the UK financial chaos spark a wider meltdown?,2024-09-15,2022-10-14,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63221410,"The recent chaos on the UK financial markets has generated waves of stress and selling by investors far beyond the UK. As the sell-offs collide with high inflation, rising interest rates and the war in Ukraine, they have raised fears the turmoil in the UK could set off a wider crisis. Many analysts have said they believe the fallout is likely to be limited, especially amid signs that the government is reconsidering some of its plans. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng was sacked on Friday, and the government has dropped parts of the package of tax cuts that initially sparked the market turmoil. But the episode has highlighted the financial risks of the current moment. ""Markets are fragile. We have seen vulnerability that's been building over the last decade-plus,"" Fabio Natalucci, a deputy director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said earlier this week, describing the UK episode as a ""warning shot"".  ""That fragility makes the financial risk much more elevated.""  Borrowing costs in the UK shot up last month, triggered by Mr Kwarteng's announcement of £45bn of tax cuts in his mini-budget, which the government said would help reignite economic growth.  But he did not say how he would pay for them, which alarmed investors already worried about the UK's dim economic prospects. They swiftly sold off their holdings of UK government debt, also called bonds or gilts. The sell-off in UK government bonds prompted a dramatic change in their value.  Prices dropped and investors demanded a higher interest rate for holding a riskier investment, creating major volatility in what is usually considered a stable, safe investment.  That kind of swing can have big ripple effects, as investment firms adjust their holdings to cover losses and the increased risk. In the UK, some of the first cracks appeared at pension funds, giant investment firms that manage people's retirement savings and typically put a big chunk towards investments like government debt. Facing losses that were at risk of spiralling, pension funds pleaded for help from the Bank of England, which agreed to step in and buy government debt as an emergency intervention. In fact, the Bank of England ended up stepping in three times. The sudden rise in borrowing costs also meant chaos for the UK housing market, where mortgage rates on typical two and five-year fixed deals have jumped to more than 6% for the first time in over a decade. Analysts expect the rise in mortgage rates to spark a fall in property prices, meaning that another investment often seen as pretty safe is suffering a major, rapid change in value.   Interest rates on some US and European government debt have also jumped alongside the UK's. And as UK firms respond to the changing market, they have dumped some of their riskier assets, creating knock-on effects. For example, selling of collateralised loan obligations (CLOs), a term for bundles of corporate debt, jumped in the weeks after the UK announcement, the Wall Street Journal reported. That is a part of the market that some already saw as full of financial risks.   ""There is a general sense of unease in financial markets because we never know where the landmines are buried,"" said economist Barry Eichengreen, professor at the University of California, Berkeley.   ""People are worried about which insurance companies and which pension funds and which bond markets are in a delicate state at the moment and we never know for sure. ""When bad things happen anywhere, people pause and global risk aversion rises."" IMF officials said last week that global financial instability was now verging on crisis levels, as investors pull back. ""We are certainly at a stressed moment,"" said Tobias Adrian, financial counsellor at the IMF warned, noting that indicators of strain, like demand for dollars, have surged. ""The only times when things were worse was in times of acute crisis."" The organisation did not forecast a major financial blow-up, noting that the traditional banking system in major economies like the US and UK has become more resilient in response to regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. But there are more vulnerabilities in emerging markets, where the Fund estimates that 29% of banks are at risk of financial problems in the event of a sudden, serious downturn. In the US and UK, officials are also worried about unknown problems in the large ""shadow banking"" system - where investors develop and trade debt products largely outside the view of regulators. As central banks around the world raise interest rates, those piles of debt may come under strain. ""When we look at the safety and soundness of the financial system... we should look at not only the banks but also the non-bank lenders,"" Ben Bernanke, who led the US central bank during the 2008 financial crisis, warned on Monday. He was speaking at a press conference that was supposed to be about his winning the Nobel prize in economics, but was dominated by questions about the current economic risks. For now, the turmoil stemming from the UK appears to be a ""bump in the road,"" Jamie Dimon, head of US bank colossus JP Morgan said Friday.  But he warned: ""There are going to be other surprises""."
economic indicators,NI ministers vote in favour of Covid passports,2024-09-15,2021-11-17,By Jayne McCormack,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-59325108,"Northern Ireland ministers have voted in favour of Covid vaccine passports to be introduced from next month. Under the measure, people have to provide a passport or proof of a Covid test result to access nightclubs, pubs or restaurants. DUP ministers voted against the proposal but Sinn Féin, SDLP, Alliance and UUP ministers backed it. Speaking after the vote, Health Minister Robin Swann said ministers ""have to act"".  He said that the a Covid passport was not the only option for people wanting to enter hospitality premises under the scheme - people could also use a negative lateral flow test taken in the previous 48 hours or proof of a positive PCR test taken in the previous 30 to 180 days. Mr Swann's plan would mean the regulations would take effect from 29 November but won't be legally enforced until 13 December, as there would be a 14-day grace period before fixed penalty notices could be issued.  It is understood the measure would apply for access to: Mr Swann said: ""There's the three options there - it's not solely vaccination."" He added: ""Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down. Our health and social care system is under severe stress. ""We all want this pandemic to be over, but simply wishing it away is never going to be enough. A united effort across society is what is needed to get us through this winter."" But DUP First Minister Paul Givan said that this regulation should be put to a vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly before it takes effect. He added: ""Whenever we ask questions around the economic impact assessment, none has been carried out. ""No equality impact assessment; no assessment in terms of human rights legislation and yet, other executive ministers felt they could support a policy that had flaws within that paper, even on the scientific evidence."" DUP members have been outspoken in their opposition to the proposals. The party's Paul Frew tweeted his vehement opposition to the mandatory Covid status plan. East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said it was a ""bad decision"" made in haste, which would cost the hospitality industry money it could not afford. However, SDLP minister Nichola Mallon challenged the DUP's decision to vote against the proposal, saying that ""the last thing people want is another Christmas apart from each other"".  ""We need to use every tool in our toolbox… serious questions need to be asked of the DUP as to why they voted against it,"" she said.  Sinn Féin Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the Department of Health would now work on drafting a second paper that would look at other measures that can be introduced to manage the spread of Covid-19. Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the executive's decision, and the lack of financial support, sent a signal that the hospitality industry is ""of no value or concern"". ""Evidence shows that this will negatively impact footfall and increase costs in the most important part of the year,"" he said. ""As the worst impacted industry, and the one singled out repeatedly for restrictions, we are facing an unknown future. Our industry will have to fight to retain staff and save businesses."" People who have been vaccinated for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland can obtain certification by downloading the COVIDCert NI app. It was released in July for use by people travelling abroad but was recently updated to allow users to hold a separate certificate for domestic use. People who have already downloaded their certification for international travel will be given an option to activate their domestic certificate. That domestic certificate - in the form of a QR code - will scanned by venue staff using the separate COVIDCert Check NI app. If the QR code is verified, the display will show a green screen containing a tick. If the QR code is not verified, the display will show a red screen containing a cross. Both apps can be downloaded for free from the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store. The health department had warned that tougher Covid-19 restrictions could be required before Christmas even if proof of Covid status comes into force in Northern Ireland.  In its briefing paper for ministers, the department says evidence suggests that adherence to guidelines by the public is declining and that ""Covid certification on a voluntary basis by the hospitality sector"" has had low uptake. It adds: ""We strongly advise that further immediate measures are required to increase adherence to continued mitigations, including use of face coverings, work from home, outdoor meetings, ventilation and limiting contacts."" ""It is unlikely that this will be sufficient to reduce the R number (Rt) to less than 1 unless there is also widespread use of Covid certification across higher risk settings."" The paper says that in the past week the number of new positive cases has risen by 23% in Northern Ireland, hospital admissions have risen 19%, hospital occupancy is up 10% and the percentage of positive tests has also increased.  It added that although intensive care units occupancy and deaths have declined, those are described as ""lagging indicators in the context of increasing community transmission"". High-level discussions about introducing mandatory Covid passports for domestic use in Northern Ireland have been taking place since late summer. At that stage, few of the political parties supported the idea. In September, the SDLP's Infrastructure Minister Ms Mallon proposed the move to other executive colleagues. It was voted down at that stage, with ministers instead opting to put in advice around vaccine certification mitigations but this was not legally enforceable. Ms Mallon and the Alliance Party's Justice Minister Naomi Long both said they wanted to see compulsory vaccine passports being introduced ahead of the nightclub sector reopening in Northern Ireland on 31 October, when social distancing rules were also scrapped in hospitality venues. In mid-October, Stormont ministers published a contingency plan which referred to the ""potential"" deployment of Covid-19 status certification in ""higher risk settings"" but said it would require agreement from the executive. On 1 November, the Department of Health released the COVIDCert Check NI app to allow businesses to scan vaccine certificates ""voluntary use"" of vaccine checks in hospitality and entertainment venues."
economic indicators,Why people voted the way they did,2024-09-15,2017-06-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-40331136,"There's no way of knowing for sure how different types of people voted on 8 June - it's a private ballot, after all - but that doesn't stop polling companies giving it a go. Here are some of the things their surveys have been saying: According to a newly released study by Ipsos Mori, age was the the biggest dividing factor in this election since it began its estimates in 1979. YouGov agrees, calling age the ""new dividing line in British politics"". Both companies, and Lord Ashcroft's exit poll, found Labour did better among under 50s, and the Tories with older voters. According to Ipsos Mori, the 25 to 34 age group was where Labour got the biggest swing from the Conservatives. To illustrate its ""dividing line"" point, YouGov said Labour was 47 percentage points ahead among 18 and 19-year-olds - with the Conservatives 50 ahead among over 70s. Plenty has been said about this - see the BBC's Reality Check verdict here - and YouGov and Ipsos Mori agree that turnout among under 24s went up. According to Ipsos Mori, it increased by 16 percentage points from 2015 to 54%, although it warned that its turnout estimate should be treated with caution. Despite the apparent increases in turnout among young people, Ipsos Mori and YouGov both agreed that older people were still considerably more likely to vote. YouGov estimated the turnout among over 70s at 84%. A university education looks like an indicator as to how someone might have voted on 8 June. ""While the Conservatives' support decreases the more educated a voter is, the opposite was true for Labour and the Lib Dems,"" YouGov said. ""Alongside age, education has become one of the key electoral demographic dividing lines."" Ipsos Mori gave the Tories a whopping 17-point lead among people with no qualifications - and a seven point lead with voters educated to below degree level. But it said Labour had a 15-point lead among graduates (YouGov gave Labour a 17-point lead here). According to YouGov, class is ""no longer a very good indicator of voting intention"", finding little difference among the different socio-economic groupings between the two largest parties. In a reversal of the traditional class divide in British politics, Ipsos Mori found: ""The middle classes swung to Labour, while working classes swung to the Conservatives."" It's only two years since the last general election - and the Tories and Labour both kept 90% of their 2015 voters, Ipsos Mori says. Lord Ashcroft had this as 83% for Labour and 82% for the Tories. But only half of the Lib Dems' voters from last time around stayed with the party, Ipsos Mori said (more on this below). That was a finding from Ipsos Mori, which said Labour's lead here increased by six points to 54 points. Turnout among black and minority ethnic voters also increased by six points since 2015, it said. This was despite a concerted effort by the Conservatives to close the gap with Labour. Remainers in last year's referendum tended to back Labour, Leavers the Tories. Labour led the Conservatives by 47% to 33% among Remainers - while the Conservatives beat Labour by 46% to 39% among Leavers, Ipsos Mori said. Lord Ashcroft found that just over two-thirds of people who voted Tory on 8 June had backed Leave a year earlier - two thirds of Labour voters voted for Remain. No great surprise here. YouGov found the most pro-Conservative readership was the Daily Telegraph, followed by the Express and the Mail, all titles that backed Theresa May's party. Guardian readers were most likely to back Labour followed by the Mirror's. The Lib Dems' vote share was only slightly down from 2015 - but as mentioned above, Ipsos Mori said  only half of the party's 2015 voters stayed with them this time. Where did the rest come from? Roughly the same number of Labour and Tories, says Ipsos Mori. But despite this ""significant churn"", the demographic profile of Lib Dems voters is ""little changed"", it said."
economic indicators,Unemployment in Scotland fell slightly in autumn,2024-09-15,2021-01-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-55808779,"The number people looking for work in Scotland fell slightly during the autumn, new figures show. Unemployment dropped by about 1,000 to 123,000 between September and November, during a period when Covid restrictions were eased. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported a 4.4% unemployment rate in Scotland, 0.1% lower than the previous quarter.  The overall UK unemployment rate rose to 5% from 4.9% over the same period.  Meanwhile, the number of Scots in work increased by 26,000.  The employment rate for ages 16 to 64 was 74.4%, up 0.5% on the previous three months.  The Scottish jobs market showed resilience during the autumn months, according to the latest figures. With Covid infection restrictions eased for many between September and November, the number of Scots seeking work fell by 1,000. Yet, the unemployment figure for the UK as a whole was up by 202,000. So while the Scottish unemployment rate fell one notch to 4.4%, the UK rate was up 0.6% percentage points to 5%. There was a drop in the number of people replying to the Labour Force Survey questionnaire that they were not seeking work during September, October and November.  In Scotland, that was down 17,000 to 760,000. Most of these people are either in family caring roles, full-time students or they have long-term illness. The extent of difficulty in the labour market is not showing up in these monthly figures. The Bank of England believes the real unemployment rate is closer to 7.5%. It is being masked by UK government income support schemes, mainly furlough but also payments to some self-employed people. An indication of change is the estimate of Scots claiming benefit because they were out of work in December or working but on low income, sometimes with reduced hours. That rose by 84% during last year, to 211,000, but it was down by 1,400 since November. A further indicator is the number of Scots in payrolled employment, not including the self-employed.  That number was down by 67,000 during last year, a 2.8% drop to 2.3 million.  The figures, from HM Revenue and Customs, say that rose by 9,000 between November and December - the first monthly increase since July. The Fraser of Allander economic institute said the latest data continued to present ""quite a different picture of the health of the economy and labour market than what we are all experiencing in real time"".   Head of research Stuart McIntyre said: ""Scratch below the surface of the headline data and we can see real and widespread challenges emerging.  ""From nearly 100,000 more people in Scotland claiming unemployment related benefits than before the pandemic, to the nearly nine million fewer hours being worked each week in Scotland compared to a year ago. ""And remember that nearly 200,000 jobs were still furloughed in Scotland at the end of October, down from 500,000 in July, but still representing over 7% of all jobs in Scotland.""  He added: ""Whilst the beginning of a shakeout in the labour market is already under way, by far its largest impacts will be realised when the furlough scheme finally closes, currently scheduled for the end of April this year.  ""What measures are put in place to support those who do not return to their old job when they come off furlough, alongside what measures are taken to stimulate the economy, will be key to how large and persistent the subsequent unemployment crisis becomes."" Responding to the latest data, Scottish government Business Minister Jamie Hepburn said: ""These figures still do not reflect the full impact of coronavirus or outlook for employment, as the Job Retention Scheme continues to play an important role in supporting employers and employees. ""Combined with the huge economic uncertainty caused by Brexit, this remains an extremely uncertain time for the economy and jobs."" Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland, said the figures showed that the furlough scheme, and other government interventions to keep people in jobs, had ""mostly worked so far"".  He added: ""They tell us little about the precarious condition of the economy or the Scottish business community."" CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said that while Scotland continued to buck the national trend with further employment growth, businesses and households were ""still bearing the brunt of the pandemic"". She added: ""The continuation of lockdown restrictions makes it ever more urgent that the UK and Scottish governments do everything they can to protect jobs and livelihoods.  ""The Job Retention Scheme needs to run to at least the end of June to avoid a cliff edge."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""This crisis has gone on far longer than any of us hoped and every job lost as a result is a tragedy. ""Our Plan for Jobs includes grants and loans so that firms can keep employees on, the furlough scheme to help protect jobs, and programmes like Kickstart alongside record investment in skills."""
economic indicators,CBI ex-boss says capitalism not working,2024-09-15,2017-10-24,By Hannah Smith,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41744127,"Capitalism is not delivering on its promise to raise living standards, a former head of the business lobby, the CBI, has warned.  Lord Adair Turner, who is also a former City regulator, made the comments ahead of the release of third quarter growth figures for the UK on Wednesday.  He said the basic idea that ""a rising tide raises all boats"" had gone wrong.  Economic growth was not feeding through into people's incomes and living standards, he said in a BBC interview. ""Everybody knows that capitalism is not egalitarian, but the broad promise has been that, over a ten year period, you can be pretty confident that a rising tide raises all boats and everybody feels somewhat better off, and that's gone wrong,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money programme. Lord Turner is a cross-bench peer, but has also headed the Low Pay Commission after a career in  business and academia. He pointed to a toxic mix of stagnant productivity, falling real wages and rising inequality. ""The combination of that is a lot of people do not feel the system is delivering for them. This is a big challenge for economists.  ""Why, in a world of apparently extraordinary capabilities of technology, do we have these very low productivity growth rates?"" On Wednesday morning the Office for National Statistics will release the first estimate of UK GDP growth for July to September, a key indicator of the health of the economy. Economists are predicting growth of 0.3%, unchanged from the previous quarter.  Lord Turner said sluggish economic growth is only in part a hangover from the financial crisis and high levels of consumer and corporate debt.  ""The more fundamental thing is, where we are getting growth? ""The UK economy has grown a bit in the last five years and we have created lots of jobs, but they have been low productivity jobs,"" he said.   Lord Turner noted certain sectors such as manufacturing, retail and logistics have managed to improve productivity through automation, replacing human workers with robots. But those workers displaced by technological change have ended up in low paid jobs - Deliveroo cyclists working in the gig economy, for example. ""I think paradoxically that we should expect to see in a world of huge automation the continued proliferation of low paid, low tech jobs,"" Lord Turner said.  ""We are going to have to face as a society the question of how do we make sure that people have a good enough standard of living to be equal citizens of society even if the wages they get will be relatively lower?"""
economic indicators,Row over 'murder hotel' road name,2024-09-15,2018-01-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-42690378,"A row has broken out over what to call a street which is informally named after the site of one of Wales's most notorious murders. Red Gables Viaduct, as it is commonly known in Penmaenmawr, Conwy county, took its name from the Red Gables Hotel which used to stand on the road. The hotel was demolished in 2016, 40 years after four people were murdered by a gardener who then shot himself. The town council wants to call the road Ffordd Darbishire after a local family. The road links Bangor Road to the promenade and the A55, which it passes over. A Conwy council report said it had no formal name but was known by the indicator Red Gables Viaduct by the council's environment, roads and facilities service. Penmaenmawr town council wants the 30-year-old road to be officially named. In a letter to the county council, it said: ""The Darbishire family owned Penmaenmawr Quarries for many years and were well known for their contribution to the development of the community. ""As no memorial to the family exists, Penmaenmawr town council thought it would be appropriate to name a road after them."" However local councillor Ken Stevens objected to the proposal, saying the road had been named after an ""iconic building"" and known as Red Gables Viaduct for nearly 30 years and was named as such on tourism brochures. He added the town did not have a history of naming its roads after families or dynasties. But Dennis Roberts, from the Penmaenmawr Historical Society, supported the town council's request. He said: ""The naming of the road 'Red Gables' has little historic significance and has the unfortunate association with the murder of five people [four were murdered, one killed himself] at the house of the same name."" He argued the house had been known for nearly 100 years as Gwyl Annedd and had only became known as Red Gables in the 1970s on a change of use. Mr Roberts said the Darbishire family had owned and managed local quarries for more than 70 years and had been prominent in the social, religious and economic life of the town. He added: ""It is a disgrace that there is no building, street etc which honours their name as once the leading citizens here in the town."" An alternative to Ffordd Darbishire if that was ""too much of a mouthful"" could be Plas Mawr, named after the Darbishires' house which stood on Bangor Road, he said. Conwy council's licensing and regulation committee will make a decision on the name at its meeting on Monday evening."
economic indicators,Things US has got wrong - and got right,2024-09-15,2020-07-08,By Anthony Zurcher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53337483,"So much for a summer lull in the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, the US has seen a resurgence of the disease in numerous states, particularly across the south and west.  The US nation as a whole has topped 60,000 recorded daily new cases this week. Did it have to be this way, though?  Other industrialised nations, in Europe and Asia, pursued more rigorous mitigation plans, ramped up testing and contact tracing earlier, and eased restrictions in a slower and more co-ordinated fashion. They have not, at least so far, seen a resurgence of the virus similar to the one the US is currently experiencing.  The US state of Arizona, for instance, is currently registering as many new cases of coronavirus as the entire European Union, which has a population 60 times greater. It makes for a gloomy review of what's gone right and (mostly) wrong, as the US enters its fifth full month of a pandemic that has no end in sight. A month ago, the coronavirus numbers in the US appeared, at the very least, stable. The spread of the disease had been slowed, as the daily tally of new cases plateaued. That prompted a number of states - including Texas, California, Florida and Arizona - to move forward with plans to ease off public shelter-in-place and business closure orders.  Many of these states moved ahead despite not hitting the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended benchmarks for doing so, such as a 14-day drop in cases and less than 5% of tests coming back positive for the virus. It turns out, the overall national numbers were misleading, as states that were hit hard early, such as New York and New Jersey, were experiencing declines, while numbers in other states were beginning to inch up. They're not inching up anymore, they're surging - and the worst, as far as hospitalisations and fatalities, could be yet to come. Now Texas, California and Arizona, among others, have re-imposed business closure orders and mandated mask-wearing, which has been determined to reduce the spread of the virus. It may be too little to avoid another public-health crisis, however. ""We opened way too early in Arizona,"" Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, a Democrat, said in recent television interview. ""We were one of the last states to go to stay-at-home and one of the first to re-emerge."" The 8,181 Covid-19 hospitalisations in Texas on Sunday were yet another record high. In Arizona, 14% of coronavirus tests are positive for the virus.  California, an early success story in limiting the spread of the virus, has seen a 90% increase in cases over the past two weeks, after the state in May allowed local authorities more discretion in businesses re-openings. The surge in cases is also again leading to delays and shortages in testing - an area that had appeared to be a strength for the US after a halting start. Without adequate testing, it will be significantly more difficult to identify and isolate new cases and locations where the virus is spreading unchecked. ""We're right back where we were at the peak of the epidemic during the New York outbreak,"" former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said during a television interview on Sunday.    At least for the moment, the rate of daily deaths has not reached New York levels - but that may only be a matter of time, as the current cases progress. ""It is already too late,"" says Luiza Petre, a New York City physician and professor of cardiology at the Mt Sinai School of Medicine. ""We're at a point of no return where it will be very, very difficult to restrain this pandemic."" Compounding the decision by some states to prioritise reopening in spite of warnings from public-health officials, one of the best methods of limiting the spread of the virus - wearing a face covering - has become mired in partisan acrimony. A June survey by Pew Research Center found that only 49% of conservative Republicans said they wore a mask most of the time in the past month, while that number is 83% among liberal Democrats. Conservative opposition becomes even more entrenched at the prospect of government-enforced mask mandates. ""Kansans don't need Laura Kelly and the nanny state making decisions best left to individuals,"" Bill Clifford, a Republican congressional candidate in Kansas, said in response to a mask order from his state's Democratic governor. ""State mask mandates violate the principles of individual liberty and local control upon which America was founded."" Donald Trump himself has contributed to the division, mocking a reporter who refused to remove his mask during a press conference as being ""politically correct"" and retweeting a Fox News journalist who suggested a photo of Joe Biden in a mask was damaging to the Democrat's image. The president has steadfastly refused to wear a mask in public events - a position that has clearly registered with his supporters. At the president's campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June, few in the crowd chose to use face-coverings, and most disregarded social-distancing suggestions. Public-health officials aren't free from blame, either. Early on, they declared that face-coverings were only helpful for front-line medical personnel.  While the real motivation for such statements may have been to reserve limited supplies to those most in need, the end result was a message that was muddled and shifted as the pandemic progressed. While some state governments have eased restrictions on public gatherings and allowed businesses to re-open, they have frequently accompanied such moves with recommendations that individuals make decisions based on medical advice and common sense. Those recommendations have been, to put it mildly, not always heeded. Summer holidays led to mask-less crowds in reopened bars and restaurants, public parks and beaches. And while masks were a fairly common sight during the mass anti-discrimination protests that swept the nation in the past month, social-distancing practices were essentially non-existent. The numbers behind this new coronavirus surge indicates that many of the newly infected are younger Americans, who have been among the quickest to return to in-personal socialising. Some political leaders, including the president, have essentially encouraged this, asserting that the young and healthy have little to fear from the virus. ""Now we have tested over 40 million people,"" Trump tweeted on Saturday. ""But by so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless."" That flies in the face of public-health studies that have shown that a fifth of Covid-19 cases result in severe respiratory distress. ""We have data in the White House task force,"" US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Sunday, refusing to reject Trump's 99% figure as false. ""Those data show us that this is a serious problem. People need to take it seriously."" But a president downplaying the severity of the disease can go a long way toward undermining words of warning from his subordinates. The coronavirus resurgence has also lit the fuse on a bomb that is set to explode in just a few months. September is when American children traditionally head back to classrooms across the nation, and it's becoming clear that nothing close to a normal educational experience is waiting for them. School administrators are starting to unveil their plans for the coming academic year, and in many cases it's a blend of in-person and distance learning with the hope that it's enough to keep their institutions from becoming staging grounds for spreading the pandemic. Already some teachers' unions are rebelling at the suggestion that educators - including elderly or those at greater health risk - return to classrooms with what they view as insufficient protection or preparation. ""Our educators are overwhelmingly not comfortable returning to schools,"" wrote the head of a Washington DC area teachers' union. ""They fear for their lives, the lives of students and the lives of their families."" Meanwhile, parents facing the prospect of having to manage more de-facto home-schooling and figuring out how to care for and supervise their children while they, themselves, are being asked to return to their workplaces. Trump, despite campaigning in 2016 against federal involvement in local education systems, is already pressuring schools to open back up on time. He's called for the CDC to revise its guidance to make it easier to reopen school buildings and threatened to cut off federal funds for those that don't comply. Florida, a Republican-controlled state currently in the midst of a widespread coronavirus outbreak, already has ordered its schools to open for classes at the end of August. The president's rhetoric, delivered via Twitter, seems destined to politicise yet another aspect of the coronavirus response, again putting local officials in the unenvious position of balancing community health concerns with demands to return to normal times that seem increasingly out of reach. Although the coronavirus situation in many US states in the south and west has become increasingly dire, what was once the epicentre of the outbreak - New York - has made remarkable improvements. Daily deaths, which peaked on 8 April at 799, have dropped to single digits. Only 1.38% of the state's coronavirus testing last Friday returned positive results.  As other areas have re-imposed lockdown restrictions, New York has begun reopening many public facilities and private business such as salons, tattoo shops and youth sport leagues. Indoor restaurants, however, remain closed. ""What happened in New York should have been a cautionary tale for the other states to pay attention and learn to create a more centralised strategy,"" says Ms Petre, the New York City cardiologist. ""New York is a success story."" As the state continues to ease its mitigation restrictions, there is the risk that the virus will return resurgent. ""We've been through hell and back, but this is not over,"" said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. ""This can still rear its ugly head anywhere in this nation and in this state."" A funny thing happened on the way to the next Great Depression. The US economy, expected by many forecasters to be in a devastating tailspin, stabilised and began to improve. May unemployment figures, predicted to top 20%, registered at 13.3% instead. Then, in June, they ticked down to 11.4% - an indication that the workplace haemorrhaging had been stopped much earlier than expected. Meanwhile, key stock indices have bounced back from their late winter beating. By 2 July, the Dow Jones Industrial Index had recovered 66% of its losses from its February record high.  The Standards & Poor's 500 Index, a broader measure of stocks, has made up 77% of its losses this year. Other economic indicators offer similar signs of an economic resurgence. The strength of the recovery has largely been attributed to the push by states to quickly lift virus mitigation orders and federal action to provide economic support for businesses and individuals hit hardest by the virus. The return of business closures in several states could mean the economic good news will be short-lived.   Meanwhile, most of the stimulus measures passed by Congress have either run their course or are set to expire soon, while there appears little prospect of further action. ""Since it is now clear that the effects of this crisis will be felt at least until the end of 2020, that relief package will not be enough,"" says Jill Gonzales, an analyst with the personal finance website Wallethub.  While the coronavirus afflicts a growing number of US states, the American medical community continues to grind away at treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine. Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, has shown promise in limiting the severity of the disease in hospitalised patients (prompting the US government to strike a deal with the drug's manufacturer to prioritise American patients). A new study indicates that the commonly available steroid dexamethasone cut the risk of death for coronavirus patients on ventilators by a third. There are also ""encouraging signs"" from experts that the use of blood plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients could help those currently suffering from the disease, although clinical research is ongoing. ""Medicine has evolved at lightning speed,"" says Ms Petre. ""The government has teamed up with pharmaceutical companies and a lot has been done, which is good"" On the vaccine front, there are now several pharmaceutical companies reporting positive results from early tests on drugs to boost immunity to the coronavirus. The president is promising a vaccine by the end of the year, if not earlier, although medical professionals caution that such a timeline is far from certain. Anthony Fauci, the chief US immunologist, would only say scientists are ""aspirationally hopeful"" that a vaccine would be ready by 2021. Given that a return to normal life in the US appears increasingly contingent on a safe and reliable vaccine, a lot is riding on these hopes."
economic indicators,What does China's slowdown mean for the UK?,2024-09-15,2019-01-20,By Dharshini David,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46917562,"Monday sees the release of China's GDP figures, and they'll be even more closely watched than usual.  Apple's  CEO, Tim Cook, blamed cautious Chinese consumers in part for his company's failure to sell as many iPhones as he hoped, sending share prices down around the globe.  Car sales in the country, meanwhile, have dropped for the first time in two decades.  On the back of such evidence, investors and policymakers are becoming increasingly jittery about the state of such a crucial engine of world growth.  Measuring an economy's output is never easy but China's data comes with a bigger health warning than most.  Rather than 6.5%, independent economists say the GDP figure may actually be closer to 5% - or even lower.  Xiang Songzuo, a finance professor  and former chief economist of China Agriculture Bank, has claimed  that 2018 growth may have been as low as 1.7%.  His online video has since been censored by authorities.  The unreliability of the official figures is one reason why other indicators such as Apple's sales have the power to send shockwaves around global stock markets. It may be hard to confirm the scale of the slowdown in China but it's clear that growth has shifted down a gear.  It's recently been revealed that activity in factories and workshops stalled for the first time in two years in November.  The month after, exports dropped 4.4% compared to a year previously. Chinese households are clearly feeling the squeeze: retail sales are growing their slowest rate in 15 years.   In part, possibly. After establishing itself as the world's workshop over the last forty years, China's found itself losing its competitive edge to the likes of the Philippines and Vietnam, where labour is even cheaper.  The government decided to switch focus away from exports to growing domestic demand.  However, concerns then arose about the size of China's debt pile - and the risk of bad loans.  Between them, the country's households, government and corporations have debts totalling almost three times the size of GDP. A tightening of credit appears to have weighed on spending and investment. And then there's the trade war with the US.  While there was an initial flurry of orders brought forward to evade tariffs, those latest export figures suggest those measures are now hurting Chinese producers.    While the government has introduced measures to support the economy, most economists expect China's growth to slow further.   In terms of our exports, China's is the UK's 6th largest trading partner. We sold them over £22bn worth of our goods in 2017 - with cars, medicines and oil-based products forming the major part.  Politicians' have pinned their hopes on a closer trading relationship with China in the post-Brexit era. But demand might not be quite as strong as they're anticipating .  Then there's the billions of pounds Chinese companies and entrepreneurs invest in the UK every year - £20bn in 2017 alone.  Thames Water, Pizza Express and West Bromwich Albion FC are among the many which enjoy Chinese backing. That kind of investment is notoriously volatile. And let's not forget the concerns about bad loans. There's a good reason why the Bank of England's Governor Mark Carney cites China as one of the biggest risks to global financial stability.   Several large banks, not least HSBC and Standard Chartered have significant exposure to that market.  Since 1980, growth (if the official figures are to be believed) has averaged over 10% per year, meaning the size of the economy has surged 42-fold over that time.  China's  time in the sun, its superhuman growth spurt, may be over.  By 2030, economists say growth will have settled down to about a third of its current figure.  But even that would be enough to ensure it overtakes the US to take pole position as the world's largest economy."
economic indicators,Audit finds council failings in land sale deals,2024-09-15,2022-07-07,By Michael Fitzpatrick,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62069056,"An extraordinary audit of controversial land deals by Causeway Coast and Glens Council has found a ""culture existed of bypassing best practice and guidance to get land deals done"". The audit was ordered in November 2020.  It came after it emerged the council granted a right of way in Portstewart to a hotel developer for £1 in March 2016. The council said it would consider the report and meet to discuss it in August. The report found the council ""failed to demonstrate"" that it obtained the best price for the ratepayer in the transacting of land sales and rights of way. Local government auditor Colette Kane said the behaviour of some council officers had ""fallen short of the standards expected in a public body"". The report also found council chief executive David Jackson was ""directly involved"" in two particular land deals in which ""a number of significant failings were evident"", including the Portstewart case. The review of this transaction found there was no professional valuation carried out prior to the granting of the right of way. The sale of land to a charity seeking to progress a hotel development at Castleroe Road, Coleraine, in 2015 for £5,000 also featured in the report.  The report found, in both cases, there was a failure to demonstrate best price was obtained and that ""inadequate information"" was presented by senior council officers to councillors to enable them to make informed decisions.  The local government auditor said, in her view, both land transactions were not ""properly authorised"" and that ""there is a case for finding they had not been granted lawfully"". The report said the extent of the detailed involvement of the chief executive in a number of cases was ""unusual"".  ""I have identified evidence that adherence to legislation and best practice in land and property matters was not part of the culture of the council,"" said Ms Kane. ""There was evidence that senior officers were advocating actions that were contrary to best practice. ""This leads me to conclude that a culture existed of bypassing best practice and guidance to get land 'deals done' which set the wrong tone from the top of the organisation. ""In some cases legal advice was ignored and, on one occasion, inaccurate and unreliable information was provided to the local government auditor."" The report detailed how the right of way at Portstewart was granted to a hotel developer to allow site access for a proposed hotel development. Ms Kane said senior council officers' responses repeatedly referred to the economic benefit to the borough ""as justification for the decisions taken"". However, she added she ""did not consider that these responses sufficiently excuse the divergence from good practice and guidance"". The local government auditor found the behaviour of senior council officers was ""serious and concerning"" and recommended council should ""take appropriate action"" including referring them to the relevant professional bodies. On the finding that the conduct of some council officers had fallen ""well short of expected standards"", the report said ""there were indicators of wilful misconduct"" which were considered carefully. However, it concluded ""the threshold has not been adequately reached for any officer"". The local government auditor said the Portstewart case demonstrated ""little regard for getting the best price for the council and ratepayers"" and that the potential for marriage value/other special value to the purchaser ""does not appear to have been taken into account"". The report also highlighted a perceived conflict of interest relating to the council chief executive David Jackson in the Coleraine case. Ms Kane said the purchaser of the land nominated the chief executive for the Freedom of the City of London, which he was awarded in August 2016. This came after initial contact with him regarding the sale but before sealing the transaction.  When asked whether this had been brought to councillors' attention prior to the acceptance of the award, the report said the council responded that ""although several members were present when the chief executive initially declined the award and deferred to elected members, subsequently the mayor and group leaders were verbally briefed"". Ms Kane said this example along with another perceived conflict of interest relating to the valuation process in the Coleraine sale ""could have, and should have, been avoided"". ""They served to further undermine the integrity of the transaction being negotiated and the wider integrity of public services, creating a lack of public trust,"" she added.  In October 2020, BBC News NI reported the council's chief executive was ""ultimately responsible"" for granting right of way over public land in Portstewart for £1. The North Antrim assembly member Jim Allister, who first brought the £1 land transaction to the attention of the Audit Office in 2017, said he welcomed the ""robust findings"". Mr Allister became aware the council had granted the right of way for £1, when he successfully judicially reviewed the council's decision to grant planning permission for the hotel complex in Portstewart. He described the findings as ""truly shocking"" and ""well beyond the tolerance level where the chief executive and other senior officers can cling to office"". ""The £1 land deal to assemble a site for a hotel developer illustrates the cavalier disregard for the ratepayers' interests and the lamentable failure of oversight by compliant councillors. ""I welcome the auditor's belief that the disregard for legal process renders the granting of this easement unlawful. The council must now address this challenge."" The report makes a number of other recommendations which include: A spokesperson for the council said: ""Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council acknowledges the publication of the extraordinary audit report by the Northern Ireland Audit Office. ""Time will be required to fully assess the content and recommendations, and for council to consider the next steps. ""Work on this report began in late 2020, and throughout that time council cooperated fully with the Northern Ireland Audit Office. ""Council has already made changes to its land and property procedures and intends to comply with its obligations to ratepayers and stakeholders. ""The council will meet to discuss the report, its recommendations and further action to be taken, at the next full council meeting on Tuesday 2 August 2022."" In a statement, the DUP said the conduct of some senior council officers ""fell well short"" of the standards expected and that public confidence ""has been eroded"". Sinn Féin councillor Leanne Peacock said the findings were ""deeply shocking and disgraceful"" and urged action for the report's recommendations to be implemented. The SDLP's Margaret Anne McKillop said there had been a ""lack of accountability"" at the council while the UUP said the council must ensure ""recommendations made are dealt with in an appropriate way"".  Independent councillor Angela Mulholland said a ""special council meeting should be called sooner rather than later to deal with the findings"". "
economic indicators,"People eating pet food, says community worker",2024-09-15,2022-11-30,By Sarah Dickins & Steve Duffy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-63754846,"People are having to eat pet food while others try to heat food on a radiator, a community worker with 20 years' experience has said. Mark Seed now runs a community food project in Trowbridge, east Cardiff. BBC Wales analysis of new Census data suggests six of Wales' most deprived communities are in the city. A charity warns that struggling households do not just appear in areas long associated with poverty and policy needs to focus on people not places.  Trowbridge lies in what Mr Seed calls an ""arc of poverty"" from east to west of the Welsh capital, with issues endemic in his area. ""I'm still shocked by the fact that we have people who are eating pet food,"" he said. ""[There are] people who are trying to heat their food on a radiator or a candle. ""These are shocking kind of stories that are actually the truth."" ""Cardiff is a flourishing city however there are pockets of deprivation which are simply not acceptable."" Mr Seed said people were not being paid enough to afford the essentials, with the cost of living crisis pushing prices way up ""so that everybody is squeezed or they just can't afford it"". ""What they are telling us is that they are working every hour they can,"" he added. The Pantry offers good quality food at very low prices to more than 160 members.  One of them is Elizabeth Williams, 54, who says the project ""makes a lot of difference"" and brings people together but times were still hard. ""I usually go without to try to make things better in my house,"" she said. She and her partner are not working, while her son lives with them and works long hours. ""Even with my son working - and he contributes as well - it's difficult because he has to live as well and he's got needs. He has got several things wrong [with him] and he's waiting for surgery."" The latest Census results suggest that as a whole, Wales has seen an improvement in deprivation in the last 10 years. But more than half of households (54.1%) still fall into one of the categories used to measure it, either through being out of a job or long term sick, having poor health or a disability, low level of education or living in an overcrowded or poorly heated home. When you drill down further into Census figures for local neighbourhoods, we can see those places with most households falling into all four categories. They are dominated by urban communities - with six of the top 10 in Wales in Cardiff. The list is topped by Mr Seed's community - Trowbridge and a part of Rumney in the north of the city - with 29 households there classed as deprived in all four categories. This puts it within the worst 1% of more than 7,000 similar-sized communities across England and Wales. Taken alongside the adjoining part of Trowbridge and St Mellons, these neighbourhoods have more households hitting all four deprivation indicators than the whole of Monmouthshire. Separate recent figures at a very local level, this time from the Welsh government, reveal which communities have the highest proportion of children who are eligible for free school meals. This has long been a measure for the numbers of families from poorer economic backgrounds, and who could be more vulnerable to the cost of living crisis. We can plot most of the whole of Wales on a map: communities which appear in dark red have the highest proportions of children who qualify. Cardiff features prominently again, this time topped by East Moors near Splott - but with three neighbourhoods on the Ely estate also ranked in the top 10, with two thirds of school-age children living there eligible for free meals. When you zoom out to look at deprivation figures at wider county levels, they tell a story we are more familiar with. It shows that Blaenau Gwent has the highest proportion of households which are counted as deprived in one aspect of their lives and Merthyr Tydfil with the highest proportion in all four. Cardiff appears lower down in the table. The Welsh capital still has nearly half of its households living with no obvious deprivation at all but they are living close to more than 400 households across 47 different neighbourhoods, which fall into the highest measures of deprivation. For decades west Wales and the valleys received extra funds from the EU because they were among the poorest parts of Europe but Cardiff was not included because in terms of average standards of living in the capital it was not deprived.  Dr Victoria Winckler leads the Welsh anti-poverty charity The Bevan Foundation and warns of the dangers of stereotyping large areas or cities as deprived or prosperous.  ""The stereotype is that Cardiff is prosperous and the Valleys are poor and these figures shows that absolutely is not the case,"" she said. ""You've got pockets of Cardiff that are prosperous, yes but also quite significant areas of Cardiff where people aren't doing so well. ""It matters because the stereotypes or the broad-brush figures shape what governments and local authorities do.  ""So it means that where help might be needed in parts of Cardiff they're not getting it and it also means the opposite that there are opportunities in the Valleys that aren't perhaps being exploited because people think that the potential isn't there. ""There are people who are struggling because they don't have good educational qualifications or good health and they live everywhere."" In Trowbridge, Elizabeth Williams, who has lived in the area for 28 years, said she hears all the time of families, working but going without to give their children what they need. ""It's heart-breaking sometimes because some of them are worse off than others but they've got to do it to keep them and their children sane,"" she says. ""You have to carry on, keep going, that's what I feel at the moment."" Hayat Mohamed, who is originally from Sudan is a Pantry volunteer. She only moved to Trowbridge in September but said what she found was ""shocking"".  ""The economic change, what is happening, what is going on in the whole world.... the world is changing now. All people are suffering."" Mr Seed added: ""People who are in those positions of poverty would be the first to tell you that it's not easy to have a voice, it's not easy to have your dignity and show yourself as someone who counts and unless you do that no-one is going to listen."" ""Buildings go up, the economy flourishes and firms move here - but there's a gap and we're trying to close it."""
economic indicators,Putin's show: Which African leaders will have star role?,2024-09-15,2023-07-27,By Paul Melly,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-66300962,"When President Vladimir Putin opens the Russia-Africa summit in St Petersburg on Thursday, the attendance cast list will be closely scrutinised - in Paris, Washington, London, and at United Nations headquarters in New York. But Africans will view the event quite differently. For Western foreign ministries fretting about the Kremlin's declared ambition to expand its political, military and economic footprint south of the Sahara, the gathering is an indicator of how far Russia's influence could now extend and where it will meet a friendly welcome. Unlike the previous Russia-Africa summit in 2019, attended by 43 African leaders, this time only 17 are expected in St Petersburg. But which of them will take prominent speaking roles in the summit? What deals will be struck with Mr Putin? European and US policymakers until recently saw China as their main competitor in Africa - but now find themselves observing with deep unease Russia's assertive return, epitomised by the presence of Wagner mercenaries in Mali, the Central African Republic (CAR), Libya and, briefly, northern Mozambique. And of course, the invasion of Ukraine has dramatically heightened Western mistrust of Russia's ambitions around the world. Yet little suggests that African leaders share this perspective. Most countries on the continent, even those that have regularly voted at the UN to condemn the attack on Ukraine and its impact, do not want to get drawn into taking sides in a new ""Cold War"" or become pawns in a tussle for global influence and powerplays. In any case, Russia is just one of several major actors now stepping up efforts to court political and economic influence in Africa - alongside not only China, but also India, Turkey, the Gulf states, South Korea and, of course, Western nations and Japan. Having sometimes struggled in the past to mobilise international assistance in tackling their development and security challenges, African governments are not spurning these overtures.  And Russia knows this. In the run-up to the summit, its officials promised a new programme of support for the continent.  The summit agenda includes an ""economic and humanitarian forum"" and African business figures have been invited; the Kremlin promises a raft of agreements on trade, investment, scientific and technical cooperation.  In pursuing this agenda, Russia may be able to build on the academic and research ties developed during the Cold War era, when many Africans studied at Soviet universities.  But that does not mean most participants will approach St Petersburg with an uncritical mindset - even if diplomatic politeness prevents them from speaking frankly. Last month's African leaders' peace mission to Russia and Ukraine was blunt in telling Mr Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky that the war should be ended, for the sake of the rest of the world. And Moscow will hardly have bolstered goodwill by its decision to abandon the agreement for the safe export of both Ukrainian and Russian grain through Black Sea ports, even if Mr Putin has pledged to make up that shortfall. That promises to drive up food prices in numerous African countries, potentially fuelling urban protest and political pressure on the leaders. Mali - a loyal ally these days, its ruling junta partially reliant on Wagner's men to keep jihadist forces at bay - claims to be receiving a special shipment of Russian grain. But it is hard to imagine that Mr Putin could provide such hefty bilateral help to more than a clutch of close allies. Most African grain consumers will have to continue relying on the open world market - where supplies are now tightening and prices are on the rise. Mr Putin is well aware of this diplomatic fallout. Could he be waiting for the summit to perhaps offer a supposedly magnanimously return to the grain deal, on slightly tweaked terms? That's not the only delicate issue on the agenda. Displaced from Russia after his recent mutiny, Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin recently promised his men an expanded focus on African operations.  Despite his apparent falling out with Mr Putin, this would certainly help the Kremlin's drive to extend its capacity to influence African events, particularly in the hugely fragile Sahel region - where Niger's democratically elected President Mohamed Bazoum has been detained by soldiers in a coup bid that could have a major regional impact if it ultimately succeeds.  When Wagner moved into the CAR after President Faustin Archange Touadéra sought Russian help to overcome a UN arms embargo and rebuild his army in 2017-18, this at first looked like a bid for attention, aimed to send the message that ""Moscow is back"" after more than two decades of a low profile after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But by the time Wagner arrived in Mali in 2021, at the invitation of the soldiers who had seized power the year before, the role played by this private military contractor in Russia's security agenda, was viewed with a good deal more mistrust. Most other West African governments saw it as a direct threat to the security of their region. Their relations with Mali soured dramatically. And the coups that followed in Guinea and Burkina Faso, with pro-Russian youths cheering in the streets of the latter's capital Ouagadougou, have only deepened elected African governments' wariness of Moscow's strategy. But that does not mean they will disregard this week's summit. Instead, they will probably try to nudge the Kremlin towards a more conventional path of cooperative engagement, and away from support for the destabilisation of constitutional government and towards more conventional military partnerships through training and the supply of equipment and weapons. And Russia will try to secure their goodwill through a continuation of its economic diplomacy. While it lacks the resources to compete with the US, France, Germany and Japan or China as a bilateral development donor, Moscow does have some cards to play. Last year it was probably Africa's largest source of fertiliser, supplying 500,000 tonnes. It is also of course a significant power in oil, gas and mining. But the critically urgent trade sector right now remains grain. And it will be difficult for Russia to significantly help Africa with desperately needed extra supplies - and thus demonstrate its reliability as a partner - unless there is a restored Black Sea deal that also allows Ukrainian shipments to flow.  Earlier this week, Mr Putin claimed Russia had shipped close to 10 million tonnes of grain to Africa in the first half of this year and insisted that it was able to continue supplying the continent on both a commercial basis and free of charge.  A major boost in food aid would mark a sharp change of stance from a country that has been only a marginal humanitarian donor up to now.  However, even if arrangements to ship out safely from Black Sea ports are restored, there is little to suggest Moscow is really willing and organised to become a major food aid donor on a scale to compare with the likes of the European Union or the US. The political context has dramatically changed since African leaders flew to Sochi for the first Russia-Africa summit back in 2019. Over the past three years, apparently fuelled by a desire to unsettle France and other Western actors, the Kremlin has appeared at least tacitly sympathetic towards the military men who have seized power in Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea and who are viewed by the leaders of neighbouring states as a threat to regional stability.  The Malian regime's insistence that the UN withdraw its peacekeeping force, weakening the defence against spreading jihadist violence, has only deepened regional leaders' concern - and their consequent wariness of Russian policy. So even with a hefty goodwill boost to Russia grain shipments, Mr Putin may struggle to allay widespread West African mistrust, although his guests will be too discreet to express it.

economic indicators,NI reports 'slowest economic growth in UK',2024-09-15,2021-08-09,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-58115547,"Economic growth in Northern Ireland slowed in July after an initial boost from Covid-19 lockdown easing earlier this year, an Ulster Bank survey shows. Every month it asks firms across the private sector about staffing, new orders and exports. It is considered a reliable indicator of economic performance. While the flurry of activity from restrictions easing was expected to end, Northern Ireland reported the slowest growth in the UK in July. Rising workloads meant firms created more jobs last month with a pick-up in hiring reported in both retail and manufacturing. But the survey suggests inflationary pressures remain high with firms reporting a record rise in costs for the fifth month in a row. Three of the four sectors - services, retail and manufacturing - saw an increase in activity; construction was the only sector to see a dip in activity. Ulster Bank's chief economist Richard Ramsey said: ""In some respects, there is a three-speed recovery happening, with manufacturing and services continuing to record robust rates of growth in output and new orders. ""Retailers, however, recorded slower rates of growth across these measures whilst the construction industry has seen its performance go into reverse. ""Output, new orders and employment within the construction industry all contracted in July with very steep rates of decline in incoming work and staffing levels. ""These difficulties within construction are linked to severe cost increases and supply-chain difficulties which have triggered a slump in confidence within the sector."""
economic indicators,Further easing of lockdown measures on Isle of Man,2024-09-15,2020-05-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-52566198,"A further easing of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions on the Isle of Man is due to be phased in from Monday, the chief minister has said. Garden centres will be allowed to reopen to the public from 11 May, provided social distancing measures are in place, Howard Quayle said. That could be followed by the reopening of other retail shops on 18 May, with a final decision to be made on 14 May. The changes were based on the latest data, Mr Quayle said. The council of ministers had also considered ""important indicators from across our social, economic and law enforcement sectors"", he added. The changes represent the second phase of a six-phase plan to ease the island out of lockdown. The announcement comes two weeks after travel restrictions were lifted and those in the construction and horticulture sectors returned to work. The island's border remains closed. Under the proposed changes, workers may be also allowed to return to office-based jobs from 25 May, subject to employers proving they can work safely. A review of whether that would be possible will be considered over the next two weeks. Advice for those in vulnerable groups is also set to be adjusted to allow them to leave their homes to exercise for up to an hour each day, and the restarting of non-essential health services was also ""being explored"". Mr Quayle said: ""We need to balance the need to return to normality across health, society and the economy and have announced some changes in each of these areas today. ""These are gradual changes being made in a measured manner and we will issue further details on these aspects shortly."" All of the measures would be ""subject to constant and regular review"", he added. The chief minister also confirmed that the Senior Race Day bank holiday scheduled for 12 June had been scrapped following the cancellation of this year's TT races."
economic indicators,Germany avoids recession despite trade war hit,2024-09-15,2019-11-14,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50419127,"Germany has narrowly avoided a recession, according to new official data. The country's economy grew by 0.1% in the third quarter of the year after contracting in the previous three months.  A recession is often defined as two consecutive quarters of declining economic activity. Germany's strength as an exporter of manufactured goods has left it exposed to recent conflict in global trade. The growth figure was the right side of zero but it is still very weak. Putting together the new figures and the previous quarter's performance, the economy did shrink slightly over the six month period. Trade is a central element in this story.  The value of total German exports - including services - is about 47% of the country's whole economy, its gross domestic product or GDP.  There is a lot of imported content in those exports. So an alternative way of looking at it is the value added in Germany of the goods it sells abroad. That is about a third of GDP.  For such a big economy, those figures are very large. They reflect the strength of the country's manufacturing industry. Manufactured goods are more extensively traded than services.  The figures mean Germany has been very vulnerable to adverse winds in global commerce.  The tensions that have followed the more assertive approach of US President Donald Trump's administration are a case in point.  Germany has been affected through several channels. The conflict between the US and China has affected the Chinese economy which is an important buyer of German vehicles and industrial equipment.  There have been US tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium. And more recently US tariffs in retaliation over subsidies to the European aircraft maker Airbus have targeted the four individual countries responsible for most of the financial support - Germany, along with the UK, France and Spain.  No surprise then that German economic growth has been slower this year.  The newest figures show that exports did increase in the third quarter of the 2019. But sales abroad have been hit and the risks to exporters remain significant.   It is not all down to trade. Germany's motor industry has had a hard time with emissions issues. Volkswagen was the central player in the scandal over emissions test cheating.  And now there are further issues with the need to adapt to new European Union rules on greenhouse gas emissions and the related challenge of making the transition to electric powered vehicles, which requires massive investment.  There is also a widely held view in Germany that the country needs a major investment programme to improve its infrastructure, in areas such as rail, bridges and broadband.  All that said it bears emphasising that Germany has one of the lowest unemployment rates on the planet at 3.1%. It has also seen the number of people with jobs continue to grow this year, although more slowly than in the recent past.  It is also the case that in terms of the recovery from the financial crisis Germany is a relatively strong performer.  Among the G7 group of leading developed economies, Germany comes out best compared with pre-crisis levels in terms of GDP per capita, a somewhat rough and ready indicator of average living standards.

economic indicators,Three ways Trump could juice US economy,2024-09-15,2019-08-21,By Michelle Fleury,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49402311,"Fears of a possible recession on the horizon has led the White House to begin considering several emergency measures to kickstart the US economy. Donald Trump likes to claim credit for ""the greatest"" economy ever which he hopes will help him win re-election in 2020. America's current expansion is the longest in US history. More Americans are in work. They're being paid more. And they're spending more.  Yet on Tuesday, the president was talking of the need for stimulus.  By Wednesday he had reversed himself, backing away from tax cuts to boost the economy. His contradictory messages reflect his growing concerns about a possible slowdown - or even a recession. If many economists agree on one thing it's that financial markets are flashing red, there is weakness overseas and something may need to be done. So what options are the administration's top economic aides discussing to avoid an election year recession? Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, President Trump said his administration is looking at a temporary payroll tax cut to help the economy. One day later he denied it was on the table. Yet if he changed his mind again, the appeal is simple - if you're worried about a recession, a payroll tax cut can boost consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the US economy. Most American employees pay a ""payroll tax"", which is separate from their federal income tax and is used to fund healthcare and benefit programmes for the elderly - such as Medicare and the Social Security Administration. But not everyone is convinced that is the right medicine for the patient given that American consumers are still spending happily. ""Right now, investment is lagging, not consumer spending,"" says Kyle Pomerleau, Chief Economist at the Tax Foundation. ""As such, a payroll tax doesn't seem well timed."" He suggests that it was Trump's escalating trade dispute between China and the United States that was holding up businesses' decision making. ""He might have better luck if he were to rescind some of his tariffs, which are probably causing some uncertainty for businesses and impacting investment."" The policy was last used during the Obama administration in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis when it faced huge pushback from Congressional Republicans.  In 2011 and 2012, the former president lowered the payroll tax from 6.2% to 4.2%, immediately giving American workers more disposable income.  The White House is nervous that something bad may happen to the economy. As an insurance policy, it floated the idea of using the policy Republicans once opposed before walking it back. ""If the mere suggestion that a recession might threaten their own election prospects is enough to send Republicans rushing to embrace an economic stimulus tool they opposed during the Obama years, that would be blatantly hypocritical and nakedly political,"" Steve Wamhoff at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy wrote in a recent blog post.  Most tax experts agree that cutting the payroll tax can help in a downturn. But if it becomes routine, it could raise longer term questions about the funding for programmes like Social Security - a key component of the US social safety net. And like all tax cuts, a payroll tax cut would also be costly. It would add to the deficit, but just how much? The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an independent public policy think tank, has done the maths.  They estimate that cutting the employee-side Social Security payroll tax by two percentage points for two years would cost nearly $300bn, before interest.  All that red ink could make the government less effective at responding to a recession. ""There are cheaper and more progressive ways to stimulate consumption,"" according to Eugene Steuerle, an Institute fellow and the Richard B Fischer chair at the Urban Institute. While the payroll tax cut is getting a lot of attention, it's not the only tax proposal publicly supported by Donald Trump. The White House is also considering an executive order to require the US Treasury to index capital-gains taxes to inflation. A move that would cost about $100bn over 10 years. Yet 24 hours after talking about it, the President changed his mind and said the tax move wasn't necessary. The move is controversial because it would bypass Congress and is seen as disproportionately benefitting the rich who tend to own more assets and therefore would get more out of this type of tax cut. ""Indexing of capital gains is a permanent change, not a temporary countercyclical or anti-recession policy"", said Eugene Steuerle who  served as deputy assistant secretary of the US Department of the Treasury for Tax Analysis.  ""It mainly benefits higher-income households, it stimulates consumption much less than other anti-recession policies.""  That criticism appeared to have made the president rethink his position by Wednesday. He told reporters he was no longer looking at the tax cut, describing it as ""elitist"".  The idea still has plenty of supporters among Republicans. Texas Senator Ted Cruz and a group of Republican senators sent a letter in late July to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin urging him to take this action.  Doing so, they argued, would benefit ""Americans across all income levels"" because of trickle down economics. But there are plenty of reasons to be sceptical. Trump promised his major tax cut in 2017 would usher in an investment boom. This would allow the US to grow 3% a year (much faster than it did during the Obama years) and make up for the lost government revenue.  The reality, however, has not lived up to the hype.  The US budget deficit has already surpassed last year's total figure and recently jumped by 27% according to government figures released on Monday. The Treasury Department forecasts a deficit of more than $1tr by the end of the fiscal year, two months from now. Add to this that business spending, one of the indicators the Trump administration likes to look at, is constrained.  And if fiscal stimulus won't guarantee prosperity, the president can return to his favourite economic bogeyman - America's central bank, the Federal Reserve. Donald Trump renewed his attacks against Fed chair Jerome Powell, comparing his handling of the economy in a tweet to a ""golfer who can't putt"". Mr Trump has persistently called for the Fed to lower interest rates to spur growth and calm financial markets. Minutes released on Wednesday from the last Fed meeting show the board was split over its rate cut last month. The stock market is one of the barometers the President watches but recently the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its biggest single day loss of the year. This may explain his latest push for a 100 basis point rate cut - the biggest since the 2008 crisis. While he blames the Fed for not moving aggressively enough, many economists say it is Mr Trump's trade policies that are weakening the global economy. There is also concern that he is undermining the Federal Reserve just when he may need it most. Trump continues to say he is not worried about a recession. But his fear that a downturn might turf him out of office has made him and his advisers very nervous.  It is not clear when a downturn may occur or how it would affect Mr Trump's re-election prospects. But the White House isn't taking any chances.  Just last Monday, Vice-President Mike Pence accused the press and Democrats of rooting for a recession when he spoke at the Detroit Economic Club. ""Despite the wishful thinking of some naysayers in the media and in the Democratic Party, the American economy is strong."" He adds this warning, should his boss not win a second term: ""For all of the progress we've made, all of it could be lost."""
economic indicators,How the US is waging its trade war with China,2024-09-15,2018-07-12,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44765760,"After US tariffs on $34bn (£25.7bn) of Chinese goods came into effect last week, China is very much in President Trump's firing line. More is coming: details of another $16bn worth are already in the pipeline and President Trump has ordered the administration to prepare to collect tariffs on £200bn of Chinese trade on top of that.  China's trade policy is unfair, he argues, and it steals the technology of American businesses.  Trump's position is shared by his trade adviser Peter Navarro, who co-wrote a book, Death by China, which was also made into a documentary film. Mr Navarro warns of the threat he thinks that China poses to US interests. The bare figures of China's rise as a trade power are certainly striking. The country exports almost seven times as much as it did at the start of the 21st Century. It is the world's biggest exporter of goods, worth more than $2tn a year. But it is also a leading market for other countries. China ranks second as an importer of both goods and services.  China does however do more of the former - exporting - than importing. There is a substantial imbalance in its trade with the rest of the world.  Using a somewhat wider measure, called the current account of the balance of payments, which includes trade, China had a surplus last year of $165bn.   That is large, but it's not the largest. Germany and Japan have bigger surpluses, and President Trump has taken issue with them as well. President Trump often focuses on these international commercial imbalances, seeing them as a sign that trade agreements signed by his predecessors are unfair, and that other countries are taking advantage of the US.   China's surplus has in fact declined to well below half what it was in 2008. If you focus on the surplus as a percentage of national income or GDP the decline is even more marked - from just below 10% in 2008 to 1.4% in 2017. By that measure it is now a rather moderate imbalance.  The US, by contrast, has a trade deficit with the rest of the world, to the tune of $800bn last year for trade in goods. The largest bilateral deficit was with China at $375bn. These imbalances are significantly smaller if you include trade in services (such as finance, business services and travel) where the US is the world's biggest exporter, though President Trump has a tendency to overlook that. He tends to focus specifically on trade on goods.  It's a matter of debate how much these imbalances matter, and whether they are the result of countries' trade policies.   Most economists would tell you that a country's overall trade balance is the result of savings and investment by business and households, and government tax and spending policies; that it is not determined by trade policies. A country that spends more than it produces will have a trade deficit, such as the US.  One that earns more than it spends will have a surplus. China, with very high levels of household savings, is one example.    That does not mean that government policies aren't a factor.  Tax and spending policies, interest rates, exchange rate policies, and labour market policies can all affect savings and investment and the trade balance.  But it is not, most economists would say, driven fundamentally by trade policies.  It must be said that this is counterintuitive, and it is not a view shared by President Trump. He tends to see the imbalance as the result of China's trade and other policies including subsidies, currency manipulation and the acquisition of others countries' technology.  His administration was particularly critical of the ""Made in China 2025"" initiative, under which Beijing wants to strengthen the country's position in a number of key advanced sectors of industry, including pharmaceutical products, aircraft and robotics. The Office of the US Trade Representative has described it as part of a plan of ""seizing economic dominance of certain advanced technology sectors"". What is beyond dispute is China's giant economic presence.  There was a key moment in China's rise early in the present century, when it joined the World Trade Organization.  That mean that China's access to overseas markets - such as the levels of tariffs it faced - was protected by the WTO's rule book.  President Trump believes that was a mistake, that there was a missed opportunity to force China to open its own markets.  A 2017 report to Congress from the US Trade Representative wrote: ""It seems clear that the United States erred in supporting China's entry into the WTO on terms that have proven to be ineffective in securing China's embrace of an open, market-oriented trade regime"".  More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: The US is now continuing to hit back, with last week's wide-ranging tariffs, and this week's announcements, coming after existing levies on imports of Chinese steel and aluminium. Regarding these two metals there is excess global capacity, which reflects, at least in part, the investment China has made. Since the turn of the century China's steel production has increased six-fold, although it did decline slightly in the past few years. China's aluminium production has increased even more rapidly.  US concerns about China's metals production, and Beijing's approach to acquiring foreign technology, are shared by a number of other leading trade powers, including the European Union. and also by previous US administrations.  The EU has often pressed China to tackle what it considers its excess steel and aluminium capacity, and complained to the WTO about much the same intellectual property and technology issues. George Magnus, of the China Centre at Oxford University, says that President Trump has a point in relation to China's industrial and commercial policies. Foreign companies wanting to operate in China have to work with a Chinese partner in a way that means they can easily lose control of their technology.  He highlights China's advances in high-speed rail and electric vehicles.  Where the EU and others part company with President Trump is in his enthusiasm for unilaterally imposing additional trade barriers on China. Needless to say, they are even less enthusiastic about the steel and aluminium tariffs, which are also hitting US allies.  Another allegation often levelled at China is that of manipulating its exchange rate to gain a competitive advantage. A cheaper currency makes it easier for a country to sell its goods abroad. It was a more widely held concern in the last decade, but the Chinese currency has risen since then, taking away some of that competitive advantage.  That said, it is a weapon that China could possibly use as it continues to respond to the US tariffs on its goods. "
economic indicators,Five big things from Trump’s head-spinning week,2024-09-15,2018-12-21,By Anthony Zurcher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46637680,"This week in Washington has distilled all the chaos, upheaval, drama and conflict of the first two years of the Donald Trump presidency down to its purest form.  It's been a bungee jump from high to low, then careening everywhere in between - and it's not altogether clear that it won't end with the loud and final thud of an impact on the ground.  Here's a look at the crises - plural - that have unfolded in the past few days.  Most, if not all, are of the president's own making. Mr Trump campaigned as a disrupter, and this week has been disruption in the extreme. At the end of last week it appeared that Congress was on a glide path toward avoiding a partial shutdown of the federal government.  Then, on Thursday, everything went haywire. After the White House had signalled it would support the stopgap funding measure, hard-core conservative media outlets and politicians demanded the president draw a line in the sand over building his much-promised border wall. Mr Trump abruptly changed course, announcing that ""any measure that funds the government must include border security"". The fact he's stopped calling for a wall and instead asked for border security and ""metal slats"" - fencing - is a concession that might have meant something if it was made weeks ago, and not under the shadow of a shutdown. The irony is that the warning was made at a signing ceremony for bipartisan farm legislation, during which the president touted another recently passed bill reforming the criminal justice system. Green shoots of inter-party co-operation appeared this week, only to be met with the herbicide of wall acrimony. The House of Representatives seems solidly behind including wall funding in any bill. But the Senate, with only 51 Republicans and unified Democratic opposition, is well short of the 60 votes needed to agree to such a measure. And if enough House members change their mind, there's always the chance that the president will veto a stopgap bill without any funding for the wall. The dynamic changes considerably on 3 January, when Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats take over the House.  At that point, the door slams shut on wall funding ever being approved in the House. The Senate may very well acquiesce to a new wall-free spending bill and the president becomes the final roadblock.  Would he back down, giving the House Democrats an early win? That may be a bitter pill to swallow.  For Mr Trump, however, the pain he appears to fear from his supporters seems to outweigh in his mind the political discomfort from a shutdown. If Mr Trump's pivot on budget funding was surprising, his unexpected announcement that he's pulling the 2,000 US troops out of Syria - and reports of plans for thousands more coming home from Afghanistan - was an electric shock through the US foreign policy establishment. The fact that the president, who campaigned in part on drawing down US involvement obligations abroad, might contemplate such a move is not unexpected. The manner in which the announcement was made, with little apparent consultation with senior government officials or US allies abroad, is the primary source of upheaval - and the cause for concern among even those who might otherwise support the decision. Then came the exclamatory punctuation mark at the end of the drawdown drama. Defence Secretary James Mattis, perhaps the most universally respected member of Mr Trump's Cabinet, announced he was resigning because of differences of opinion he has with the president. In his announcement, he offered full-throated support for the US alliance structure and a warning that the US must serve as a counterweight to authoritarian rivals.  Then came his parting shot. ""Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defence whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,"" he wrote. It was one of the most direct suggestions of disapproval from any of Mr Trump's ever-expanding list of former advisers and Cabinet secretaries.  All of this raises the question, why did the president act now? There has been some speculation that it may be tied the budget fight over the Mexican border wall. If people tell the president there's not enough money, then he'll reduce US commitments abroad. Others have suggested the move was a distraction in the midst of an unpleasant news cycle. Or perhaps it was a move to placate Turkey or - an evergreen explanation - Russia. Whatever the reason, Mr Trump has roiled his supporters in the US Senate at a time when he needs them most. In the past, Republican politicians have managed to walk the line between offering tuts of disapproval for presidential actions they don't like, while still voting lockstep for conservative policy priorities.  In the coming days, however, this straddling effort will be tested like never before. In a recent article in The Atlantic, Benjamin Wittes and Mikhaila Fogel compare Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation of possible Russian ties to the Trump presidential campaign to a siege on a walled city.  If the investigation is ""a campaign of degradation over a substantial period of time"", this week brought a number of new volleys that could hasten the eventual collapse. There was Michael Flynn's sentencing fiasco, in which Mr Trump's former national security adviser admitted in open court that he knowingly lied to the FBI and wasn't tricked or trapped into it. The judge, Emmet Sullivan, then suggested he sold his country out. Facing the prospect of an angry judge threatening jail time, Flynn's lawyers asked for a sentencing delay - dangling the possibility of more co-operation by Flynn and guaranteeing this portion of the Mueller investigation will stretch on until at least March. Meanwhile, the Senate released two investigations into Russian social media campaigns to influence the 2016 presidential election.  They indicated the scope of the attack was much wider than previously known. The efforts reached hundreds of millions of people on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and other services, engaging conservatives and discouraging key voting blocs on the left, all in an attempt to help Mr Trump's presidential bid. The president and his supporters have dismissed evidence of Russian meddling as blame-shifting by Democrats seeking an excuse for their 2016 defeat. With these reports, that becomes a more difficult case to make. What's still not known is if there are any direct links between the Russians and the Trump team. Rumours swirl of new Mueller indictments on the horizon, however, perhaps of Trump confidant Roger Stone, who had contacts with WikiLeaks, the group that released hacked Democratic documents. Then there's the NBC News report that Mr Mueller could release his findings and conclusions in mid-February - which, although it seems like an eternity in US politics these days, is just two months away. The clock is ticking - providing a possible explanation for Mr Trump's dyspeptic attitude of late. There was evidence as early as 2016, thanks in large part to the efforts of the Washington Post's David Fahrenthold, that Donald Trump frequently used his family's charitable foundation - funded in large part by donations from other people - to settle business lawsuits, buy baubles at auctions and, during the presidential campaign, advance his political interests.  Any of this could qualify as ""self-dealing"" and put the charity's tax status at risk. The controversies swirling around the foundation attracted the attention of the Democrat-run attorney general's office in New York, which launched an investigation. On Tuesday, they negotiated the dismantling of the charity. Mr Trump and his lawyers explained that they wanted this all along, and that the entire inquiry was the result of ""sleazy Democrats"". But this is another dark cloud that won't be disappearing anytime soon. Barbara Underwood, in a statement heralding the action, called the foundation ""little more than a chequebook"" for the Trumps, with activity that displayed ""a shocking pattern of illegality"". What's more, she said, the state would continue to seek millions of dollars in back taxes and fines from the Trump Organization, and sanctions against the president and his three oldest children. During the 2016 campaign, Mr Trump repeatedly criticised Hillary Clinton and her family's much-larger operating foundation. Two years later, however, it's the president's charity that remains in the headlines. Mr Trump has spent much of his presidency touting the seemingly endless ascent of the US stock market. ""The Stock Market just reached an All-Time High during my Administration for the 102nd Time, a presidential record, by far, for less than two years,"" he tweeted in early October. Politicians who hitch their star to the stock market, however, can be in for a bumpy ride. Since Mr Trump wrote that tweet, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen more than 4,300 points - a 16% decline.  Due to a combination of rising interest rates, the president's trade wars, the impending government shutdown and indications of slower economic growth, the now long-in-the-tooth bull market may be coming to an end. December has seen the biggest market decline since the Great Depression and the largest drop in any month since 2009.  Larger economic indicators, such as GDP growth, unemployment and consumer confidence, are still strong. The current economic expansion is now entering its 13th year, however, and no one has yet discovered how to outwit the business cycle. What goes up eventually comes down (at least a bit), and the timing may not be good for the president."
economic indicators,Africa grapples with clean energy conundrum,2024-09-15,2020-02-25,By Serusha Govender,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51615647,"Africa is both the world's least electrified continent and the most vulnerable to climate change. And as the continent with the world's fastest growing population, the decisions that African politicians make to boost power supplies could have an impact both locally and globally. The conundrum is how to meet the demand for energy without making the climate situation worse. There is a large amount of investment, much of it from overseas, going into renewable sources. But the continent also has untapped reserves of oil and natural gas, which it aims to exploit. Africa's largest power producer, South Africa, faces an additional dilemma of moving away from coal-fired power stations, which produce nearly all of its energy. It is one of the dirtiest fuels, and is damaging the health of some of the people living near where it is burnt. More than two thirds of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, more than 600 million people, lack access to electricity. But electrification on the continent is still growing more slowly than anywhere else in the world, despite pledges to light up Africa in the next few decades. Investment is going into solar power, wind power and hydropower projects across the continent as part of efforts to change the energy mix. Last year, Kenya unveiled Africa's largest wind farm near Lake Turkana. More than 350 turbines can produce up to 310 MW, which is about 17% of the country's current daytime energy demand, the company behind the wind farm says. Kenya hopes to produce all its energy through renewable sources by the end of this year.  But a Chinese firm also aims to build a coal-fired power station on Kenya's coast, highlighting the country's plans to have an energy mix. The construction of the plant in Lamu is currently on hold following legal action. People in Nigeria, Africa's largest oil-exporting country, are faced with daily power cuts and, to make up the shortfall, many supply their own electricity through diesel generators. But these are the lucky ones as more than half Nigeria's 200 million citizens have no access to electricity at all, according to the International Monetary Fund. The country is experimenting with boosting solar power. Last year, Banyero University, in the northern city of Kano, began generating power for its 58,000 students and staff through a solar plant that is backed up by generators. This is part of a $75m (£58m) fund with solar panel manufacturer Lumos aimed at electrifying one million households over the next five years.  Nigeria aims, by 2030, to generate 30% of its energy needs from renewable sources, which still implies a huge reliance on fossil fuels. By the end of this year, West Africa's largest solar farm, with a 50 MW capacity, is due to start producing power in Mali. Meanwhile, on the other side of the continent, Ethiopia is building the Grand Ethiopia Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile that is expected to produce 6,000 MW of electricity. Ethiopia would like it to start producing power at the end of this year. But the row with Egypt over how fast the dam can be filled up highlights the political difficulties that can come with large-scale energy projects. You may also be interested in: Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo are also looking towards renewable energy sources to supply a significant amount of their power needs. The African Development Bank, as well as investors from outside the continent, especially China, are supporting a lot of these projects. There is also the US' Power Africa initiative, which encourages private companies to partner with African countries to boost the power supply. It aims to produce about 30,000 MW of cleaner energy by 2030. Launched in 2013, the initiative already boasts 56 successful projects producing almost 3,500 MW of power - just over a tenth of its target. But all these projects are unlikely to be enough to satisfy Africa's rapidly growing population. Not every country on the continent is able to boast about its successes.  South Africa, the continent's most developed economy, has been labouring through crippling power cuts for several years. It is also struggling to move away from its dependence on coal, which is a cheap source of energy for the country. There are wind and solar power projects, but these are not producing nearly enough energy to diminish the woes of the state-owned power company, Eskom. The problem for the government is the need to preserve employment in the coal mining sector while also decommissioning the ageing coal-fired power stations. Coal will provide the bulk of South Africa's energy needs for at least the next decade, according to a government plan. It hopes that ""clean coal"" technologies could help reduce emissions, but the country does not yet have access to the technology to make this work.  There are actually a variety of potential technologies to produce cleaner coal, the most common being carbon capture and storage. This is essentially capturing carbon emissions from burning coal and storing it underground.  It sounds easy, but the process of developing this technology and retrofitting it at old power stations is time-consuming and expensive.  Processing plants are also very expensive and difficult to maintain in the long-term. While dozens of African countries are moving ahead with plans to boost renewable energy resources they are not enough to fill the gap in their electricity supplies. The solution to the conundrum of how to maintain economic growth and minimise carbon dioxide emissions lies in applying newer carbon-efficient technologies alongside existing energy production systems.  Focus on Africa will be debating the future of the continent's energy needs on Tuesday at 1730 GMT on the BBC World Service."
economic indicators,Indians set to send home a record $100bn in 2022,2024-09-15,2022-12-01,By Nayana Mena ,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-63822514,"Indians are set to receive $100bn in remittances this year, according to a World Bank report - the first time a single country has reached that number. The increase was led by wage rises and strong labour markets in the US and other developed countries. In total, the amount of money sent back home by migrants around the world has grown by 5% in 2022.  The money is a crucial source of household income in low and middle-income countries, the World Bank says.  Remittances are associated with improved health and social indicators, for example increased birth weight and higher school enrolment figures.  Other top recipient countries for remittances include Mexico, China, Egypt and the Philippines. In recent years, many Indians have moved to well-paid jobs in high-income countries, such as the US, UK and Singapore - enabling them to send more money home. The payments account for around 3% of India's gross domestic product (GDP) - a measure of the size of a country's economy.  While India and Nepal have experienced an increase in remittances, other countries in South Asia have seen a decline of more than 10% in the last year, due to the end of government incentives introduced during the pandemic. Overall, remittances to low and middle-income countries have grown by 5% in 2022 to around $626bn (£510bn) - around half the rate of growth seen in 2021. Next year is expected to be more challenging because of rising prices and slower economic growth around the world. "
economic indicators,InterContinental Hotels sales rise,2024-09-15,2017-10-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41691615,"InterContinental Hotels Group said sales rose as the effect of terror attacks in key markets wore off. Revenues per available room, a key indicator for the hotel industry, increased by 2.3% in the third quarter.  The Holiday Inn owner expanded its hotel offerings by the fastest rate in almost a decade, it said, as it ramped up international expansion.  Sales in Europe rose by 7.1%, while those in the US increased just 0.8% as hurricanes battered the region.   ""Hurricanes Harvey and Irma had a mixed impact,"" the group said in  a trading update.  ""Displacement activity, together with the relief and reconstruction efforts, benefited our franchise business; but performance across the managed estate was negatively impacted by the cancellation of group bookings at some hotels."" Markets previously hit by terror attacks, such as France, Belgium and Turkey, enjoyed strong growth. Southern Europe was also boosted by higher demand during the summer months.  Revenues from China increased 7.8%, buoyed by stronger demand for leisure services in Macau.  ""Despite macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties around the world, we remain confident in the outlook for the remainder of the year,"" said group chief executive Keith Barr.  InterContinental has expanded its room offering by 20,000, bringing the number available up to 235,000.  The results were ""reasonable"" and had put the company on track to meet full-year earnings forecasts, said Anna Barnfather, an analyst at Liberum."
economic indicators,NI economy weakens bucking UK trend,2024-09-15,2019-05-13,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-48244813,"Northern Ireland's economy appears to have weakened significantly over the past three months, research from Ulster Bank has suggested. The bank conducts a monthly survey of private sector activity in what is considered a reliable indicator of the economy. April saw a contraction in new orders, exports, employment and overall output. That follows a fall in output in March and a weakening employment performance since the start of the year. Richard Ramsey, the bank's chief economist, said it was the sharpest fall in business activity since the end of 2012. ""April saw an improvement in business conditions across most of the UK regions,"" he said. ""However, Northern Ireland was a notable exception to this trend. ""Rather than improving, the pace of contraction across a range of indicators accelerated."" He added that Brexit and the lack of a Northern Ireland Executive continued to be cited as factors negatively affecting business. As in March, manufacturing was the only sector to record an expansion in output. By contrast, the data for retail sales was the worst in almost seven years. Mr Ramsey said that the survey should not be interpreted as a clear sign of the beginning of a downturn as Brexit factors could be responsible for volatility in some company performances. By John Campbell, BBC News NI Economics and Business Editor A modern economy is a complex, dynamic system - changes are rarely about one factor. However, it is clear that Brexit is having an impact in some areas - particularly business investment. But there are other forces shaping our economy - for example, retailing is in the throes of technologically-driven change, which has nothing to do with Brexit. Official data for the whole of the UK, published last week, suggested the economy picked up in the first three months of the year after manufacturers' stockpiling ahead of Brexit helped to boost growth. Growth was 0.5% in the quarter, up from 0.2% in the previous three months, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The manufacturing sector grew at its fastest rate since 1988 in the period. The ONS said this was driven by manufacturers rushing to deliver orders before the original Brexit deadline of 29 March. Pharmaceuticals was one of the sectors most affected, expanding 9.4% between January and March. Previous business surveys had shown manufacturers stockpiling goods for Brexit in case the UK left the EU without a transition deal, which they feared could lead to delays at UK borders."
economic indicators,NI private sector activity falls again,2024-09-15,2021-03-08,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-56266970,"Economic output in NI's private sector continued to fall in February because of the coronavirus lockdown, according to an Ulster Bank survey. It also indicated that prices rose at their fastest rate since 2008.  Each month it asks private sector firms about new orders, staffing and exports in what is considered a reliable indicator of economic performance. Chief economist at Ulster Bank, Richard Ramsey, said the main trigger for recovery would be lifting restrictions. ""The one real positive in the latest survey is that Northern Ireland businesses are more optimistic about business activity in 12 months' time than they have been since the pandemic began,"" he added. But the survey suggested conditions remain challenging. Mr Ramsey said Northern Ireland was at the ""bottom of the UK regional table as far as output, orders and employment were concerned"". ""Meanwhile, it was ranked at the top when it comes to input costs and output price inflation,"" he said. ""Once again, shipping costs, raw materials and Brexit-related costs were cited as factors."" The survey indicated that manufacturing and construction firms raised their own prices at the sharpest rate in its history (almost 19 years). Mr Ramsey said: ""Looking to the months ahead, whilst conditions will remain challenging for some time, confidence will likely continue to build as the vaccine rollout continues. ""But the key trigger for a recovery in some sectors, particularly retail and services, is going to be when the current restrictions are lifted."""
economic indicators,Counting the cost of 'no deal',2024-09-15,2020-11-29,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-55123346,"The deepest recession for more than 300 years allied to the biggest risk ever undertaken with the British economy, as it exits the European Union: yes, this is the winter of the Covid-Brexit double whammy.  Yet Brexit was absent from the Chancellor's spending review statement last week. It was not absent, however, from the report by the Office for Budget Responsibility, deliberately coinciding with the Treasury plans. You have to reach page 193, but it's worth a look, given that the end of the transition out of the European Union is just over 30 days away. Discussing the WTO or World Trade Organisation rules (which the prime minister prefers to call ""Australian"", perhaps because it seems less bureaucratic), you'll read why the Chancellor might not want to talk about it. The report looks at different scenarios for both Brexit and for the course of the Covid crisis.  On a ""no deal"" WTO Brexit, it assumes border distortions and delays, and at new trade deals being done (of which more later).  It assumes fiscal policy on tax and spending isn't much changed, though warns that a further slowdown in economic activity would push more people into furlough and more companies into default on their new government-backed loans. It assumes little shift in monetary policy, except that inflation could go up as a result of a dip in the value of sterling, allied to new tariffs on goods imported from the European Union, pushing prices up 1.5%. It's noted that the sectors hardest hit by Covid-19 - hospitality, tourism, travel, etc - are not the ones that would be hardest hit by a hard Brexit. That's where manufacturing supply chains are stressed to breaking point, notably in the car-making industry. A warning last week from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders argued that ""no deal"" looks like costing the industry £110 billion, split equally between the UK and the EU auto sectors. As UK car makers rush to grab a share of the electric vehicle market, tariffs would put £2,000 on the cost to an EU customer, and £2,800 on an EU car coming in the other direction.  As we should know by now, cars are multi-national in their many components, repeatedly crossing the English Channel on the journey to the showroom.  Even with a no tariff deal, and the new complications of trading, the hit to the industry is estimated at £14 billion. ""Brexit has always been an exercise in damage limitation,"" says the SMMT. The WTO outlook, according to the OBR, is for a further 2% reduction in output next year when compared with a managed and agreed no-tariff deal, easing off to a 1.5%, and then stabilising at around 2 percentage points below the level of output that would be otherwise be achieved. With that comes a forecast of unemployment going up by 300,000 over the next two years, before that impact declines, but remains at a higher level than it would have been otherwise. The OBR acknowledges that it's not the only one in the forecasting business. Nor, point out Brexiteers, does it have the strongest of track records with this.   So it lists 13 other studies of the impact of a ""no deal"" Brexit, carried out over the past four years.  The average puts growth, with an EU no-tariff deal, at four percentage points behind the level of growth that could be expected within the European Union.  With no deal and with tariffs, that rises to a gap of 6.1 percentage points. The reasons are partly through the initial loss of jobs and companies failing because more expensive access to EU markets undermines their business model.  Over time, the more significant effect is lower productivity, from having less pressure to compete and less influence from the most efficient EU companies, and then also from lower business investment. The hope is that the UK will strike better trade deals outside the European Union. That's less likely if the UK government has to follow through on its threat to break the protocol on Northern Ireland. It will probably be harder to convince others that Britain is as good as its word in negotiations, and Ireland's allies, including the USA, are strongly critical. So far, there have been several agreements signed, which ensure the current arrangements with other countries are continued after December 31, such as Canada, South Korea, Israel and Morocco.  There are agreements with Norway and Iceland, with plans to open up new arrangements for shared fishing stocks. There was also a deal signed with Japan, hailed by international trade secretary Liz Truss as an improvement on what had gone before. Committees of the House of Commons and of the Lords separately looked into her claims, and both concluded that she appeared to be exaggerating. The elements that appear to be better - such as protection for geographical indicators of British products (think Stornoway black pudding) - are yet to be nailed down.  And the final sticking point, on exporting UK cheese to Japan, was agreed without an increase in Japanese import quota. Instead, it gave Britain the right to tariff-free exports, only so long as the EU quota hasn't already been used up. UK cheese exporters have to wait and see if there are leftovers, which removes any predictability about pricing. The big prize remains a trade deal with the US, or so we've come to think. But the OBR brings a reminder that the gains may not outweigh the political pain of arguing about chlorine-washed chicken and a potential threat to let US healthcare into the NHS. It points to the government's own estimates of the added growth from a trade deal are very modest. All that is worth bearing in mind when the prime minister reassures us that Britain will ""prosper mightily"" when it departs the EU single market. That depends what you mean by ""mightily"". It could be that it prospers, in that the economy continues to grow, but in the short and medium term, it is not expected to prosper as it would have done inside the European Union. What Mr Johnson is clearly trying to get across to European negotiators is that he is relaxed about walking away from talks. If they're convinced of that, they're more likely to give ground. As things stand, the EU has less to lose from a ""no deal"" Brexit, at least relative to its size.  Given that weaker negotiating position, Britain has to show willingness to accept pain. Boris Johnson's approach is to feign (or perhaps to concede?) his ignorance of how much pain that would involve.  The EU's task now is to judge whether he's bluffing. The crunch points for this began last June, and have become more frequent in recent weeks.  We were thinking that they had to leave time for the European and UK parliaments to pass the necessary legislation, but that also appears a flexible schedule, and could mean legislators' Christmas plans become even more complex. The two sides remain stuck on three issues: whether Britain has to play by European rules on support for its industries if it's to have access to European markets. That's about subsidies, and about Europeans wanting to ensure they're not undercut on their standards for environmental, social and labour market rules by Britain doing things more cheaply.  It goes further than that, and the question of whether Britain can be required to follow changing European standards, when it doesn't yet know what they'll be, and won't have influence over setting them.  What's been hard for European to judge is whether Britain is heading towards deregulation, to reduce business costs, or towards much more state intervention in the economy. Boris Johnson seems to be heading in both directions at once.  There's also the question of governance, which is a lot to do with the rules for settling disputes. And then there's the fishing industry - with big expectations raised in Scottish and south-west English port towns, but similar determination also in those of France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain.   Things may yet founder on this relatively very small, very localised part of the economy, even if the price paid by manufacturing exports, like English-built cars and the wider food sector, is far greater than any gain from pushing all foreign boats out of British waters.   There's clearly an interest for Scottish salmon farmers, creel fishers and fish processors in getting quick access to big, lucrative European markets. Britain doesn't have either the size of fleet to pick up on the fishing opportunity that could be created, nor the coastguard fleet to defend its waters against encroachments, which would be very expensive.  We heard in the past few days there could be compromise here, on the timing of a limited European retreat from what has been a very large share of tonnage from UK waters, and the percentage reduction we might see at first, reported as 15 to 18%. Bigger reductions could be achieved over a long period.  That may not be acceptable to the UK, but if they're talking numbers, they've moved beyond assertion of principle, and that could be a positive sign of movement towards a deal. What the British side wants the Europeans to acknowledge is that Britain has secured the right to assert its sovereignty. The European side wants Britain to recognise that sovereignty has to be traded away if it wants to trade with others. It also has to give ground and share power if it wants the co-operation of others on things that are to Britain's benefit - access to the energy market, rules on the environment, security and defence.  If Boris Johnson does choose to compromise, he may find it hard to pivot his own side of Brexit hardliners for that to happen. And given the way Tory MPs are talking with some disdain about the prime minister's rules on infection control, he seems to lack authority with his own people. So getting compromises agreed at Westminster at this late stage could prove challenging. "
economic indicators,Index aims to boost productivity in Scotland,2024-09-15,2019-09-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-49627041," A new index has been created to measure the productivity levels of Scottish businesses. The first Scottish Productivity Index suggests some progress in productivity, but says that Scotland is ""lagging behind"" its competition. The report will be published annually and will look at 15 key indicators. It will track performance in four areas: business practices, skills and training, health and wellbeing and infrastructure and connectivity. The index is being compiled by CBI Scotland and KPMG and contains a number of straightforward recommendations for government and businesses to approach together. One of its main suggestions is that bosses are urged to treat mental health with the same priority as physical health, to boost productivity of the economy. With evidence of Scotland falling behind on in-work training, it also recommends that everyone in the workforce should be given basic digital training by 2025. It was proposed that a ""Productivity Data Bank"" should be compiled for Scotland to provide access to and improve productivity tracking data across the public and private sectors. And it said prioritising investment in management and leadership skills should ensure businesses were rooted in great people practices and building capabilities across the business. Tracy Black, CBI Scotland director, said: ""We're proud to launch the first edition of the Scottish Productivity Index, something we think can bring fresh insights and urgency to the debate about how to get Scotland's economy firing once again. Brexit aside, boosting weak productivity has been the main focus of CBI Scotland's work over the past few years. ""While these findings show that Scotland starts some way behind when it comes to certain productivity measures, we also know that progress is being made. I'm confident that by benchmarking progress in this way, we can find solutions to deliver the step-change Scotland desperately needs."" Jenny Stewart from KPMG said: ""Amid growing geopolitical and economic uncertainty, improving productivity is fundamental to how much we earn; how fast our wages grow; and how much of a contribution every individual in Scotland pays in taxes to support good quality public services and a vibrant, sustainable economy. ""Tackling the productivity challenge could unlock thousands of pounds in higher annual earnings for the average worker and create a more competitive country that can thrive in the international marketplace. ""Our report highlights some of the challenges we face right now, but it also identifies a number of key, straightforward actions that we can all take to unlock future growth. ""Now, more than ever, we need to address productivity in Scotland, and build a more, successful, prosperous and inclusive nation."""
economic indicators,Unemployment rate in NI 'falls back to 2019 level',2024-09-15,2022-05-17,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-61476437,"The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland fell back to its record low in the first quarter of this year, official figures suggest. The rate in the period January to March was 2.3%, a statistically significant fall of 1.2 percentage points over the year. That matches the record low level reached in 2019. Most other indicators also point to a continuing post-Covid jobs market recovery. The number of people on company payrolls in April was 774,600, an increase of 0.4% over the month and 4.5% over the year.  This is the highest on record and the eleventh consecutive month that employee numbers have been above pre-Covid levels. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) says a closer look at the annual increase (4.5%) in payroll jobs shows that the accommodation and food service, activities and arts, entertainment and recreation sectors reported the largest percentage increases over the year (17%). All regions of the UK saw payrolls increasing over the year to April 2022, with London recording the largest increase (5.7%) and the East of England recording the smallest (3.6%).  Northern Ireland had the third highest annual increase, recording a higher increase than the UK average (4.5% and 4.2% respectively). However, the recovery is not complete - total hours worked, self employment and the overall employment rate are still below pre-pandemic levels in Northern Ireland. Nisra said: ""When comparing to the pre-pandemic levels, the total number of hours worked in January-March 2022 was 1.1% below, whilst the employment rate was 0.2 percentage points below.  ""Similarly, the economic inactivity rate remains 0.2 percentage points above the pre-pandemic position."""
economic indicators,Warm welcome for dollars and euros,2024-09-15,2023-06-19,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-65948190,"One of the more powerful motors of the Scottish economy continues to generate jobs. Inward investment by foreign companies is creating and sustaining jobs. The annual survey of such activity, by business consultancy EY, has found that Scotland remains the most attractive place in the UK for foreign direct investment (FDI) outside London. It's quite a distant second place, but a fairly consistent one - expanding its share for four consecutive years and second to London in nine of the past 10 surveys. EY totted up 126 inward investment projects, with nearly 14% of FDI projects, the highest yet. Some 11% of those polled among those who operate in the FDI field said Scotland was their top choice in the UK - again, a long way behind London, and down on last year's 15.8% showing, but a strong second place. While Scottish FDI project numbers grew, the UK registered overall decline of 6%, and growth in the European Union was only 1%. Do positive attitudes mean further investment will come this way?  The signs are good. A record high 19.2% of global inward investors - yet again, second to London - are planning to establish or expand operations in Scotland. Looking at this from city level, Scotland scores again, with Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen in the top five UK cities outside London. More than half the projects come from four countries - Germany, Ireland and Canada, while the USA accounts for nearly a third. And of those American commitments, a healthy proportion are looking to Scottish research and development expertise, or Scotland's digital technology skills. The EY 'attractiveness' survey is heavily and widely deployed by the Scottish government and its agencies,  and by the UK government, both to defend the country's economic record and to attract more investment. According to Adrian Gillespie, chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, the results are ""testament to the dynamic business environment that Scotland offers to investors, including our enviable skills base, world-class universities, vibrant innovation districts, ambitious entrepreneurial communities, and the outstanding quality of life on offer. At Highlands and Islands Enterprise, head of international trade Vicky Grant explains: ""We work closely with companies looking to invest here. We help them identify the ideal location, find premises, help with recruitment and training, and can often also help financially.  Beyond that, we continue working with them to make sure they have access to the full range of support they need to prosper."" But there's a warning in the small print.  Such projects come in many shapes and sizes - they can be small but high-value and strategically significant: they can bring lots of low-skill jobs to areas with poor work opportunities.  The jobs attached vary widely. In 2021, Scotland's tally of jobs attracted hit 10,000, up from 4,500 the year before. Last year, it halved, to 5,000. And many such projects either publish projected recruitment which doesn't work out as planned, or they don't give a headcount number at all. A further way of looking at this was recently published by Scottish Development International. Jointly controlled by the Scottish government and its agency Scottish Enterprise, this co-ordinates efforts to attract funds and build trade, and tells us it can claim credit for 8,500 jobs created or secured through its efforts last year.  The ones highlighted by deputy first minister Shona Robison earlier this month were 90 roles in Cumbernauld, printing labels for Scotch whisky bottles. The business goes back to Glasgow in the 1840s, but it is now part of Italian firm Eurostampa, with a new plant and a big increase in jobs. Much bigger numbers are being generated in aerospace and biotech. At the end of last month, pharma giant Merck announced it plans to create 500 jobs in Glasgow and Stirling for drug testing.  That will bring its Scottish workforce to 1200. That pattern is not unusual. Companies that try out some inward investment in Scotland can be persuaded to step up their presence. Across agencies, often co-ordinated by Scottish Development International, there is a well-oiled machine for building those relationships. Similarly, companies that commit first to London and the South-East - the first point of arrival, in many cases - look to the next best place to expand, where costs are lower.   That is where Team Scotland is ready with a package of incentives, including the hard financial ones, but often getting deals over the line by deploying Scotland's soft power; a round of golf, a nearby whisky distillery tour, its history and environment, more affordable property and its private schools for the kids of inbound senior executives. Many of the success stories these days are, unlike Merck, not big plants or manufacturing, but smaller scale operations tapping into Scotland's skills base for research labs. The labour pool and its flexibility is one of the attractions. There are clusters of industries in Scotland that mean a ready labour pool when a recruiter arrives in town; in finance, for instance, in financial technology, high and low-carbon energy and aerospace.  There are also areas of weakness. Inward investors struggle to find the scale of steel fabrication and engineering expertise to commit to large-scale manufacturing for the the renewable energy boom.  Without that well-lubricated and efficient business eco-system, they may struggle to live up to their commitments of local content when all those offshore wind turbines are installed. It's also no surprise that companies are buying British assets while sterling is so much weaker than it was. It's not just American tourists who find Britain very good value these days. And while FDI 'attractiveness' appears to be a welcome sign, the consequent effect on the economy is not entirely welcome. Where companies are taken over by foreign buyers, that can strip out the corporate base from which to grow internationally competitive firms based in Scotland. There is also the argument that dependence on foreign investment, orienting government agencies towards attracting more of it each year, is a poor substitute for a home-grown, self-confident economic strategy of company growth and export orientation from a Scottish base.  That relative weakening of sterling was accelerated by Brexit. Literally overnight as referendum results came in, the value of sterling fell, and it has remained much weaker than it previously was against the US dollar, falling close to parity during last year's market meltdown provoked by the Liz Truss/Kwasi Kwarteng mini-budget. On the plus side, there has not so far been the exodus of foreign investors who can no longer use the UK as a welcoming and relatively business-friendly base with which to exploit seamless links through Europe's single market.  Through exiting the single market, some inward investment has come into the UK to set up separate entities and distribution bases. More often, it has forced British companies to set up separate entities and distribution bases in the European Union, to avoid the delays and disruption to trade, and - particularly for finance - to trade within EU rules and regulations. That process has added cost to international trade. Twinned with the shock to the system from Brexit has been the UK government's push to 'level up'. And that's where Scotland's success with FDI highlights the broader picture from the annual EY figures, showing how much London is the magnet for inward investment and how much other parts of England are not. There may be signs in this year's EY 'attractiveness' survey of that shifting.  London's dominance over the rest of the UK has fallen away sharply, from 49% of inward investment projects at its peak in 2019 to 32% last year. There was a fall from 394 projects in 2021 to 299 last year. South-east and south-west England saw decline, while there was growth elsewhere. Across the north of England, that growth was by 24%, weighted heavily to the North-West, with 88 projects. That could signal a rebalancing of economic activity, but lots of other indicators will have to move in the same direction.  A committee of MPs, with a Conservative majority, last month tore into the UK government for the shortcomings of its efforts to level up. They see it as far too short-term, driven by competitive bidding rather than strategy, undermined by the politicised way in which funding was allocated, and failing to mesh with any of the devolved administrations, including Holyrood. The current occupants of Downing Street are reported to see it as a legacy of the Boris Johnson era, suffering from too much muddle over what it is trying to achieve and how to go about it, but with the north of England politically in play, it's not a policy Rishi Sunak could kill off. The flipside to Scotland's success in this is England's weakness. There is always the possibility that English regions get more powers and get their act together, drawing on the lessons of inward investment from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  A charismatic mayor may help. Freeports ought to attract more investment of all sorts, though they may not add to the total for the country. But England is still waiting for the catalyst and political commitment that will make the economy in much of the country any more than merely London's hinterland."
economic indicators,Private sector output 'moves up a gear',2024-09-15,2017-08-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-40901852,"Scotland's private sector ""moved up a gear"" last month as output rose at its fastest pace in nearly three years, according to a monthly survey. Bank of Scotland's latest PMI found growth was driven by a ""steady expansion"" in new business. Manufacturing saw strong growth in new orders, while new work in the service sector rose at a more moderate rate. The survey also indicated an increase in recruitment, with job creation reaching a 31-month high. The PMI - which measures changes in combined manufacturing and services output - stood at 53.8 in July, the highest figure since October 2014. Any number above 50 suggests expansion. Scotland's private sector has now grown for eight months in a row, according to the bank.     Fraser Sime, from Bank of Scotland Commercial Banking, said: ""July's survey results signalled the Scottish private sector moving up a gear, as the PMI posted its strongest result in 33 months.  ""This good news was fuelled by the service sector returning to meaningful growth, alongside a faster increase in manufacturing output.        ""Job creation remained positive for the second month running, with July marking the fastest expansion in employment in over two-and-a-half years.  ""Employment growth was consistent across the manufacturing and service sectors.""  He added: ""Input price inflation remained strong in the latest survey, with many firms citing wage inflation and the exchange rate.  ""That said, the positive effects of a subdued currency could be seen in the growth of manufacturing exports in July."" Keith Brown, the Scottish government's economy secretary, said the results were a further vote of confidence in the Scottish economy, coming on the back of GDP figures that showed growth four times that of the UK over the first three months of the year, with unemployment also at a record low of 3.8%. But he warned that uncertainty over Brexit ""continues to cast a shadow over the future economic outlook, threatening jobs, investment and living standards"". A recent survey by Scottish Chambers of Commerce suggested Scotland's economy would continue to grow this year. Its quarterly economic indicator found most businesses had a positive outlook for the coming months. However, firms also highlighted longer-term threats to success, such as falling real incomes and rising recruitment problems."
economic indicators,Strong growth in Irish economy during 2018,2024-09-15,2019-07-11,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48950914,"The Republic of Ireland's economy grew strongly in 2018, official figures suggest. Headline gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 8.2%, according to the country's Central Statistics Office (CSO). Irish GDP is heavily distorted by the activities of multinational companies that use Dublin as a centre for financing and taxation operations. However, alternative measures also showed significant growth. Personal consumption of goods and services, an important indicator of domestic economic activity, grew by 3.4%. A measure known as modified gross national income (GNI*) showed growth of 7.3% (at current prices). The CSO developed GNI* having concluded that GDP no longer provided a sufficient understanding of the Irish domestic economy. It subtracts the retained earnings of global firms that have their headquarters in Dublin. It also adjusts for the depreciation of categories of foreign-owned domestic capital asset, such as intellectual property rights. As measured using GDP, the size of the Irish economy in 2018 was €324bn (£291bn) but using GNI* it was €197bn (£177bn)."
economic indicators,US economy grows at a slower 2.2%,2024-09-15,2018-05-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44306936,"The US economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2% in the first three months of the year, slightly more slowly than the original estimate of 2.3%. The Commerce Department published the revision on Wednesday in its second estimate of GDP. It said exports, inventory investments and consumer spending were weaker than first reported. The declines exacerbated the slowdown from the fourth quarter of 2017, when US GDP increased by 2.9%. The first quarter is typically the weakest of the year and many economists expect economic growth to accelerate in coming months, as some activity shifts later in the year. Compared with the first quarter of 2017, GDP - the measure of goods and services produced in the US, adjusted for inflation - increased by 2.8%, the fastest rate since 2015. However, some metrics continue to lag behind expectations. Wednesday's report showed inflation rose 1.6% from the first quarter of 2017. That measure of inflation - personal consumption expenditure excluding food and energy - is the Federal Reserve's preferred indicator,  The Fed has said it is aiming for an inflation rate of about 2%. Wednesday's report showed consumer spending increased just 1% in the first quarter, instead of 1.1% as originally reported. That marked the weakest growth in almost five years. Spending on homebuilding, another major economic driver, declined 2%. However, business investment was higher than previously reported, driven by a more than 10% increase in spending on intellectual property. The Commerce Department also said the new US tax cut, which reduced the corporate rate from 35% to 21%, was having an effect. Taxes on corporate profits fell $117.4bn in the first quarter, while after-tax corporate profits climbed 5.9%."
economic indicators,10 numbers that tell the story of Zimbabwe,2024-09-15,2017-11-18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42013720,"Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe resigned last year after almost four decades in power. Now, the country is approaching its first post-Mugabe election, with his successor Emmerson Mnangagwa and MDC Alliance candidate Nelson Chamisa the two front-runners in a field of 23 candidates. Here are 10 numbers that will help you understand how the country got to where it is now. Robert Mugabe, who led the country's liberation movement, was in power from independence in 1980 until he was ousted in November last year at the age of 93. His years in office, first as prime minister until the switch to a presidential system in 1987, were marked by economic turmoil and the crushing of dissent.  Emmerson Mnangagwa is his successor - nicknamed the ""crocodile"" because of political cunning. Once a Mugabe loyalist, he promises to revive the shattered economy and hopes to win elections on 30 July to legitimise his presidency. Zimbabwe's economy has struggled since a controversial land reform programme was introduced in 2000.  The programme that saw white-owned farms redistributed to landless black Zimbabweans - and those with good political connections - led to sharp falls in production. As the country's central bank printed money to try to get out of the crisis, rampant inflation took hold. Although the World Bank does not have figures for 2008 and 2009, numbers from Zimbabwe's central bank showed annual inflation reached 231 million % in July 2008. Officials gave up reporting monthly statistics when it peaked at just under 80 billion % in mid-November 2008. The country was forced to abandon its own currency a year later at a rate of Z$35 quadrillion to US$1. More on post-Mugabe Zimbabwe: The political and economic crises between 2000 and 2008 nearly halved Zimbabwe's GDP - the biggest contraction in a peacetime economy, according to the World Bank. A brief period of recovery between 2009 and 2012 has now faltered and the economy faces serious challenges, says the World Bank. Growth has slowed sharply from an average 8% from 2009 to 2012, caused by shifts in trade and a series of major droughts.  Mr Mugabe always blamed Zimbabwe's economic problems on a plot by Western countries, led by the UK, to oust him because of his seizure of white-owned farms. The country's political and economic crises have resulted in high poverty rates.  The hard years between 2000 and 2008 saw poverty rates increase to more than 72%, according to the World Bank. It also left a fifth of the population in extreme poverty.  Extreme poverty, estimated to have fallen from 2009 to 2014, is now projected to have risen again substantially. About 27% of children under the age of five suffer stunted growth, with 9% severely stunted because of poor nutrition, the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey report revealed. But poverty in Zimbabwe is still lower than in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, where about 41% of the population were living on less than $1.90 a day in 2013, World Bank data suggests. Estimates of the country's unemployment levels vary wildly. The World Bank's modelled estimates, based on International Labour Organisation data, puts the figure as low as 5% in 2016, while Zimbabwe's biggest trade union claimed the jobless rate was as high as 90% last year. However, the World Bank's definition only covers those actively seeking work. Many of those not counted may not seek a job despite wanting one because they ""view job opportunities as limited, or because they have restricted labour mobility, or face discrimination, or structural, social or cultural barriers"". The CIA World Factbook estimates the rate was 95% in 2009, but says current figures are not known. Thanks to large investments in education since independence, Zimbabwe has one of the highest adult literacy rates in Africa, with 89% of the adult population literate, according to World Bank data from 2014. Globally, the literacy rate stood at 86% in 2016, while in sub-Saharan Africa it was 64%. Almost all women and men aged 15-49 have had at least some primary education, according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey. More than 70% of people aged 15-49 have also attended secondary school.  Zimbabwe has the sixth highest HIV prevalence rate in sub-Saharan Africa, with 1.3 million people living with HIV in 2016, according to UNAids. However, after a peak in 1997, rates are declining.  According to the UN, this is a result of successful campaigns encouraging condom use as well as programmes preventing the transmission of infection from mother to child. Treatment and support services have also improved. Life expectancy fell in the 1990s, with the HIV/Aids epidemic a major killer. It dropped from a high of just under 61 years in 1986 to 44.1 years in 2003.   It is now steadily improving again, but with unemployment and poverty endemic and HIV/Aids rates still high, it remained at just 60 in 2015, according to World Bank data. Mobile devices are the leading communication tool for Zimbabweans. But while most have a mobile phone, only 43% of households have a radio, 37% have a television and 10% have a computer, according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey. After a growth spurt after independence in 1980, a decline in birth rates and a rise in death rates saw population growth slide downwards. With high outward migration rates also high, the population has not recovered its post-independence growth. Written and produced by Lucy Rodgers."
economic indicators,New York company to create 100 jobs in Belfast,2024-09-15,2021-09-13,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-58546264,"American IT and cybersecurity firm Agio is to create 100 jobs in Northern Ireland over the next five years. The company, which is based in New York, works with the financial services industry, including asset managers and hedge funds. Invest Northern Ireland has offered a £650,000 grant to support the roles, which will be based in a new technology centre in Belfast. Recruitment has started and 19 of the jobs are already in place. Agio's chief revenue officer Garvin McKee, who is from Northern Ireland, said the company was confident a Northern Ireland base would continue to ""add excellent talent to our service organisation"". Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said the investment would contribute £4.5m in annual salaries to the Northern Ireland economy when all of the roles are in place. The jobs announcement comes as an Ulster Bank survey shows economic recovery in Northern Ireland lost momentum in August. Every month the bank asks firms across the private sector about issues such as staffing levels, new orders and exports - the survey results are considered to be a reliable indicator of economic activity. Ulster Bank chief economist Richard Ramsey said last month marked Northern Ireland firms' slowest rates of growth in output, orders and employment in five months. The survey suggests the manufacturing and services sectors saw some loss of momentum in August but output, orders and staffing levels were still growing. But the retail and construction sectors were in contraction territory, with falling sales and orders. ""The survey revealed again an all-too-familiar story, with inflationary pressures and lengthening supplier delivery times,"" said Mr Ramsey. ""Within the UK, Northern Ireland continues to report the steepest rises in input costs, with local firms raising the prices of their goods and services at faster rates than any other region. ""Price pressures linked to raw materials, fuel, freight, wages and Brexit continued to be cited by survey respondents. ""Inflationary price pressures in August eased only marginally relative to their recent record highs, although services firms raised their prices at the fastest pace in 13 years."" Meanwhile a Japanese cybersecurity firm, Nihon Cyber Defence, is opening an office in Belfast with an initial 10 employees. Dougie Grant, a former cybercrime detective at the PSNI, is Nihon's managing director for Europe. Additionally Ciaran Martin, the former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, will be joining the firm's board in Tokyo. "
economic indicators,Eels 'face extinction' says monitoring expert,2024-09-15,2019-08-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-49164766,"Eels are so endangered they could become extinct in our lifetime, an Environment Agency expert warned. Jez Wood monitors numbers of migrating eels in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex and said the fish are finding it harder to negotiate waterways.  The agency said global eel numbers were down 95% in the last 40 years and are not improving as hoped. Mr Wood says climate change, overfishing and river barriers hinder ""these astonishing creatures"". Eels start their lives in the Sargasso Sea near the Caribbean and the European eel species travels across the Atlantic to freshwater habitats. Mr Wood counts the number of eels on the River Wensum in Norwich. The count takes place at an ""eel escalator"" - a structure which helps them negotiate a river barrier at the New Mills Yard pumping station. The eels use the pass between April and September. Despite annual numbers rising to 34,000 when the pass was upgraded in 2016, that figure fell to 3,606 in 2017, but then rose to about 8,000 last year. No eels were counted in April and May this year - but counts in July (usually the busiest month) and August have boosted the total to 2,162 so far in 2019. ""You have to credit the water companies - everybody's working together to protect eels, but they're also a key species - a lot of animals survive on eating eels, like bitterns, herons, otters,"" said Mr Wood. ""It's not an exaggeration to say they could disappear in our lifetime."" He said statistics for individual rivers were only an indicator of the overall population of eels as a wide range of variables came into play each year, such as differing water temperatures and pressures and a lack of understanding about why eels tend to favour different rivers in different years.  David Bunt, director of conservation operations at the Sustainable Eel Group, said European eel numbers have declined since the Industrial Revolution and the creation of more dams, sluices, weirs and hydropower. Eels are faced with more than 1.3 million impassable river barriers across Europe, he said. ""They are an integral part of the freshwater ecology - and they are superb recyclers of nutrients - as well as of high commercial and economic value,"" he added. The extraordinary life cycle of eels Eels begin life in one place - the Sargasso Sea in the north Atlantic, near the Caribbean island of Bermuda They spend 18 months swimming 3,000 miles (4,800km) across the Atlantic Ocean, floating on currents and propelled by the Gulf Stream to find freshwater homes They can live for five to 20 years feeding and growing in the freshwater rivers and lakes of Europe Every autumn, eels make the return journey as ""silver eels"" to the Sargasso, to spawn for a single time - and die"
economic indicators,Can we tell yet who has the edge?,2024-09-15,2018-08-01,By Anthony Zurcher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45013748,"This is it. After primaries, debates, countless polls, months of campaigning and endless speculation, the US mid-term elections are almost here. In some states, early voting has been going on for weeks and turnout has surpassed previous records for non-presidential years. At this point Democrats are cautiously optimistic of their chances to take back some legislative power. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi has gone so far as to flat-out state that her party will win control of the House of Representatives.  Such an outcome would have immediate and drastic implications for the president's ability to advance his political agenda and Democratic oversight of his administration. The ""mid-term wave"" - a sweeping electoral triumph that reshapes the national political map - is a recurring phenomenon in US politics. Is one about to crash on Republicans in Washington? For the purposes of this analysis, a mid-term wave is where one party picks up a combination of more than 20 seats in the US House of Representatives and the Senate. That's happened eight times in the last 70 years, notably in 1994 (a Republican wave against Bill Clinton) and 2010 (one against Barack Obama). Today, the Republican Party is near a modern-day high in seats in the House of Representatives, with a 241-to-194 seat majority, so it could be poised for a tumble. The Senate terrain may be friendlier for Republicans, with Democrats defending 10 seats in states Mr Trump won in 2016, but this year's political atmosphere is such that an electoral storm could be brewing.  Democrats have the political wind at their back, but intervening events - like the fight over confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court - have the potential to shake things up. What is the current state of play?  Here are the measurements - and the history lessons - that will give us clues. Money makes the (political) world go round. Levels of cash pouring in for candidates, parties and independent groups are an indication of electoral muscle for advertising, organisation and get-out-the-vote efforts. They're also a reflection of the enthusiasm of each side's donor base. There's one component of campaign fundraising that tracks particularly closely with every wave election in the last 25 years, a period during which the role of money in political campaigns skyrocketed.  In the Republican wave of 1994, individual donations to House candidates - which are limited under campaign finance law - tilted toward Republicans. The party then took control of the chamber for the first time since 1955.  In 2006, the fundraising advantage flipped to the Democrats, as did control of Congress. Four years later, Republicans were back in the money - and back in charge of the House. In 2014, they built their biggest majority there in 83 years and won control of the Senate, as well.  ""In mid-term waves, long-time incumbents can get kind of caught flat-footed when they're faced with a well-funded, competitive race,"" says Geoffrey Skelley of the University of Virginia Center for Politics.  2018 outlook: What was once a remarkable fund-raising advantage for Democratic House of representative candidates has become an astounding one. The latest figures show them more than doubling the Republican amount of contributions from individual donors. As of 2 November, they have brought in $649m (£500m), against ""only"" $312m for Republicans. Democratic enthusiasm is translating into open pocketbooks - and a rising financial tide is lifting all Democratic ships. It's not all gloom and doom for Republicans, however. They have plenty of deep-pocketed donors pouring their own money into independent expenditures, and the Republican Party itself is flooding money into key races across the US. When it comes to grass-roots enthusiasm and small-money donors, however, all the energy and excitement is clearly coming from the left. In the past month alone, Democrats have hit the accelerator and left the Republicans behind in a cloud of dust. Mid-term elections are said to be a referendum on the incumbent president.  When presidents are unpopular, voters take out their frustration on their party in Congress.  If the chief executive is riding high, the party is rewarded (or, at least, not excessively punished). A look at the Gallup presidential approval poll over the last 60 years tends to bear this out. Every time a president faced a net-negative rating in the month before the mid-terms - Ronald Reagan in 1982, Bill Clinton in 1994, George Bush in 2006 and Barack Obama in 2010 and 2014 - it meant lights-out for his party at the ballot box in November. The exceptions are also enlightening.  Gerald Ford was plus-24 in October 1974, but his numbers - following his controversial pardoning of Richard Nixon the month before - were poised to take a nosedive, declining 15 points over the next three months. Democrats gained 48 seats in the House and five in the Senate - what would be known as the ""Watergate Class"" of Congress. Lyndon Johnson was around the break-even point in 1966, but unease about the Vietnam War and civil rights unrest, combined with his party's inflated congressional numbers after a big victory two years earlier, set Democrats up for a tumble. 2018 outlook:  Donald Trump's approval ratings have been remarkably stable, given the tumult of his first year-and-a-half in office. He didn't have much of a ""honeymoon"" period following his election, so there haven't been many sharp changes. At the end of August, the president stood at 40% approval. On the eve of the mid-term elections his approval is… 40% That's not a good sign for Republicans. The president has defied political gravity in the past, but his unpopularity could be a weight that sinks his party on Tuesday. This involves asking people simply which party's House candidate they would support in the election. There are 435 individual House of Representatives races in every mid-term election, meaning at least 870 candidates from the two major parties plus a handful of prominent independents and third-party politicians.  Each race is unique, every constituency has its own particular interests, and each congressional district has a demographic identity as unique as a fingerprint. It therefore seems implausible that the collective outcome of all those races could be boiled down to a simple poll asking whether a voter would prefer a nameless Democrat or a faceless Republican.  The generic ballot question, however, has proven to be a remarkably accurate predictor of mid-term election prospects for the two major parties. ""The national generic ballot picks up the national political climate,"" says Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University who has crafted an election prediction model based largely on the generic ballot polling numbers.  ""I view it as a measure of the political mood of the electorate."" In 1958, 1982 and 2006, the Democratic generic ballot advantage ballooned before the party's wave-election victories.  When the Republican waves of 1994, 2010 and 2014 swept through, the Democratic advantage narrowed to low single digits (or even, at times during the election run-up, disappeared entirely). This year, Abramowitz says, the tipping point for Democratic control of the House sits around a seven-point generic ballot advantage. A lead bigger than that, and a wave could be on the horizon. 2018 outlook: The Democratic generic ballot lead has shifted over the course of the past year. In the late spring it narrowed to the point that it appeared Republicans were in excellent shape for November. By mid-September, however, the Democratic lead approached double-digits. That trend tailed off a bit, but the current eight-point margin is on the lower edge of where it has to be for a blue wave, even if it falls short of a tsunami. Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans are pushing positive economic numbers as a reason why they deserve another two years of unified control in Washington.  Historically, however, a growing economy is no guarantee of success for the president's party.  In 1994, when the governing Democrats ceded Congress, the economy was expanding at more than 4%, although unemployment was a bit higher than the current mark, at 5.8%.  In other wave years, 2006 and 2014, the economy wasn't in bad shape either. A struggling economy, on the other hand, can be a death sentence for the incumbent party's mid-term prospects.  In 1958, Republicans in Congress faced a bloodbath largely due to that year's recession, which included a modern-record -10% first-quarter GDP contraction.  Negative growth in 1974 and 1982 also probably contributed to Republican losses those years.  ""You'd rather have a strong economy than a bad economy, but it doesn't mean you're going to escape the wrath of voters,"" says Abramowitz. 2018 outlook:  Third-quarter gross domestic product growth is down a bit, after the second quarter hit 4.2%. Combined with unemployment at a 49-year low and signs of wage growth, however, the economic numbers are undoubtedly good. Mr Trump has decided to make immigration control his closing argument to mid-term voters - to the dismay of some Republicans who would prefer he focus laser-like on the robust economy. If history is a guide, however, the president may be right to look for a different issue, as a growing economy is no guarantee of electoral success. Set aside all the poll numbers, economic figures and expert analyses.  Who has their finger on the pulse of the political climate better than anyone? Probably the politicians themselves. They're the ones whose names are on the ballots, and they're the ones who could be out of a job if a wave hits. Facing the prospect of embarrassing electoral defeat, some politicians may opt to ease into early retirement or get a head-start on colleagues searching for post-public-service gainful employment. ""We know historically that open seats are more difficult to defend,"" says Skelley. ""And because they're more difficult to defend, that gives the party that doesn't control them a better shot."" A look at modern retirement trends shows a mixed picture. The retirement figures in 2010 gave little hint of the carnage in store for Mr Obama's party. In 1994, however, a surge of Democratic retirements may have foreshadowed big Republican gains that autumn.  2018 outlook: If 1994's retirements were a harbinger of doom for Democrats, 2018's numbers could spell trouble for Republicans.  Several key committee chairs and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan have already joined what's become a modern record for retirements from a majority party - a telling sign that they think Republicans may not be a majority much longer.  Several incumbents - on the left and right - also were forcibly retired, as they lost primary races to grass-roots challengers.  That could be another indication of an anti-incumbent mood in the electorate that, because there are more Republicans running for re-election than Democrats, could help fuel a Washington power shift.

economic indicators,Why Indian children are getting fatter,2024-09-15,2022-07-29,By Geeta Pandey,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-62307784,"India has long topped the list of countries with the highest number of malnourished children in the world. It's now increasingly also reporting alarming levels of childhood obesity which, experts say, could take on the form of an epidemic if not tackled urgently. When 14-year-old Mihir Jain first rolled into Delhi's Max Hospital in 2017 in his wheelchair to consult Dr Pradeep Chowbey, the bariatric surgeon said he ""couldn't believe my eyes"". ""Mihir was super-super obese, he couldn't stand properly and he wasn't able to open his eyes as his face was fluffy. He weighed 237kg (523lbs) and his body mass index (BMI) was 92."" According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a BMI of 25 or above is considered overweight. After weeks of treatment and a gastric bypass surgery in the summer of 2018, Mihir's weight came down to 165kg.  At the time, Mihir was described as the ""world's heaviest teen"" - the label could be an exaggeration, but India is home to an estimated 18 million overweight and obese children and their number is rising daily. The latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5, conducted in 2019-21), the most comprehensive household survey of health and social indicators by the government, found that 3.4% of children under five are now overweight compared with 2.1% in 2015-16.  On the face of it, the numbers seem small, but Dr Arjan de Wagt, chief of nutrition at Unicef in India, says that ""even a very small percentage can mean very large numbers"" because of the size of the Indian population.  According to Unicef's World Obesity Atlas for 2022, India is predicted to have more than 27 million obese children, representing one in 10 children globally, by 2030. It ranks 99th on the list of 183 countries in terms of preparedness to deal with obesity and the economic impact of overweight and obesity is expected to rise from $23bn in 2109 to a whopping $479bn by 2060. ""We are staring at a massive problem of childhood obesity in India,"" says Dr de Wagt. ""And because the behaviour that starts obesity generally starts in childhood, obese children grow up to be obese adults."" And that is a major worry for health experts. According to WHO, too much body fat increases the risk of non-communicable diseases, including 13 types of cancer, type-2 diabetes, heart problems and lung conditions, leading to premature deaths. Last year, obesity accounted for 2.8 million deaths globally. India has already broken into the top five countries in terms of adult obesity in the past few years. One estimate in 2016 put 135 million Indians as overweight or obese and their numbers are growing. Dr de Wagt says that in India - where 36% children under five years are still stunted - the gains we've been making in combating undernutrition are offset by over-nutrition. ""People are under-nutritioned and over-nutritioned at the same time. Overweight and obesity are results of overnutrition, but that doesn't mean that one's getting all the nutrition they need.""  The biggest problem, he says, ""is the nutritional illiteracy"".  ""If children are given balanced meals that include carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, fruits and vegetables, then it would prevent both undernutrition and overnutrition. But people don't know what is good food, they eat to fill their bellies. they're eating more carbs, more convenience food."" Dr de Wagt says data shows that although childhood obesity is a problem among all social classes, it is more common in urban richer families where children are being fed a diet of food and drinks high in fat, sugar and salt. A 2019 survey by Max Healthcare in Delhi and its suburbs revealed that at least 40% children (5-9 year olds), teens (10-14 year olds) and adolescents (15-17 year olds) were overweight or obese. ""Youngsters sleep late and often resort to midnight binging, mostly on unhealthy snacks,"" says Dr Chowbey. ""They do not burn any calories after eating late at night as they sleep after that and during the day, they are lethargic which means they burn few calories. Moreover, children are spending a lot more time on computers and phones instead of running around and playing."" ""Obesity,"" he also warns, ""impacts not just medical, but each and every aspect of life, including psychological and social. Obese children often face prejudice and social isolation."" Dr Ravindran Kumeran, a surgeon in the southern city of Chennai (Madras) and founder of the Obesity Foundation of India, says unless we intervene with children now, we will not be able to address the problem of obesity in the country. ""If you watch TV now for half an hour, you will see many advertisements about junk food and those glorifying soft drinks. This constant false messaging about benefits of unhealthy junk food must stop, and it can only be done by the government."" Also, he says, we need to get more children into the outdoors.  ""As a country we don't invest in physical fitness. Our cities have no footpaths, there are no safe cycle tracks, and there are few playgrounds where children can play."" That's what Sportz Village, a youth sports organisation, is trying to change, its co-founder and CEO  Saumil Majumdar told the BBC. ""In our country, schools are mostly the only places that offer a safe place for children to play, so schools must play their part in combating obesity,"" he says. Their survey of more than 254,000 children showed that one in two children did not have healthy BMI; a large number of children lacked flexibility, had poor abdominal or core strength and fared poorly on upper and lower body strengths It's not a problem of policy. All schools have physical education classes, but generally only children who are good get any attention. So it's not fun for children who don't enjoy playing,"" Mr Majumdar says. ""We believe that in schools just as children have to learn the basic level of any subject, in the same manner they must be taught the basic levels of fitness.""  Over the years, he says, the schools they've worked with have shown improvements. ""In some cases we have seen fitness levels on some parameters improved from 5% to 17% and we've also managed to get more girls to play. I think play can solve all the world's problems,"" he adds.

economic indicators,"Irish economy grew by 3% last year, FDD suggests",2024-09-15,2020-03-06,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51769585,"Ireland's domestic economy grew by 3% in 2019, official figures suggest. The economic performance was assessed using the final domestic demand (FDD) measure - a way of stripping out some of the effects of multinational firms. Ireland's national accounts tend to be distorted by the activities of global companies which use Dublin as a centre for financing and taxation operations. FDD includes personal and government consumption and investment but excludes things like aircraft leasing. Gross domestic product (GDP), an increasingly unreliable way of assessing the Irish economy, grew by 5.5%. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said it was clear the domestic economy is ""growing at a robust rate"". ""These figures are very much in line with a range of other indicators such as employment growth and taxation receipts,"" he added. ""For instance, the level of employment increased by 2.9% last year, the seventh straight year of employment growth of that rate or higher."" However, Mr Donohoe cautioned that Ireland was now entering ""a precarious trading environment as a result of the spread of coronavirus""."
economic indicators,Slow progress,2024-09-15,2017-10-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-41531665,"Unemployment is at record lows: employment is at record highs. So all's well? Not according to figures published this week. Growth continues to struggle into positive territory, according to Scottish government statisticians. The figure for April to June was published on Wednesday, showing growth of only 0.1%. That's right: the least growth we could have. Construction was particularly weak. And despite manufacturing being helped by the weakness of sterling, it was also into negative territory. The figure for the first quarter of the year, January to March, was downgraded to 0.6%.  It's been noted before that that looks a bit odd, given what else we saw in the economy at that time, given that it was largely driven by three industries, and given that it's out of whack with two-and-a-half years of other growth figures. Economist John McLaren has separated out the figures so that they are directly comparable with the UK ones.  He reckons Scottish growth has been roughly a third that of the UK over the past 30 months - 1.2% to the UK's 4.5%. That ratio is true of the most recent quarter, and of the past year. From those at the Fraser of Allander Institute comes a reminder (this can't be said often enough) that if growth is consistently lower than the rest of the UK, then income tax revenue can also be expected to be lower than Holyrood might have expected from the previous block grant formula. In other words, devolution of income tax power will leave a funding gap, compared with where Holyrood might have been without those devolved powers. Ministers may look on the bright side with these figures. But for their budget forecasts, they now have to look to the independent Scottish Fiscal Commission to set the revenue expectations for them. These growth figures will not translate into comfortable reading for Finance Secretary Derek Mackay. So those who hoped the original 0.8% estimate for the first quarter was a sign of a rosy new 2016 are now hunkering down for tougher times, as other indicators have shown things looking a lot less positive.   Brexit is taking a toll on confidence, as if businesses needed another reason for holding back on investment. The consumer debt binge that has kept us going through many of the bad months in recent years may be running out of road. Real earnings are being squeezed by inflation. And as household budgets are squeezed, even those attractive financing deals on cars are failing to keep momentum behind sales. The September figures for UK new car registrations were down 9.3%. In Scotland they were down 8%, to below 40,000.   September matters a lot to car dealers, because that's one of two months when buyers are attracted by new plates. Over the year so far, Scots registrations are down 5%, and UK ones by 3%. The productivity figures, issued on Friday, are not broken down by parts of the UK. But there's no reason to think Scotland is faring any better than the rest of the Kingdom. It was consistently faring worse, but the most recent Scottish productivity figures, covering 2015, were warmly welcomed for catching up with the UK level of productivity. That may be an achievement, but it's not much of a target to have hit. UK productivity looks dire, and it's been going backwards. Also, the Scottish boost in 2015 followed four very weak years. Productivity is the vital driver of improved prosperity. If we're not producing more per hour worked, we're not earning a real terms pay rise. While productivity stalls, pay rises are making us less competitive.  On average. Why this productivity problem? Well, that's been puzzling economists, just as it's been puzzling governments.   Here are some of the reasons being offered: There are various ways out of poor productivity. They start with investment in skills and equipment, along with their effective deployment. They continue with better infrastructure, in transport and telecoms. Being open to trade is a valuable driver of productivity as well. It forces firms to be competitive with the best. So pulling out of a single market, in which others are more productive, can mean reduced competitive pressure on firms to improve their processes. Being less attractive to inward investors is also a means of slowing up the adoption of new ideas for greater efficiency, which are known to be imported when global companies set up shop. The Brexoptimists (a term I just invented) see the shift to new trading relationships with the world beyond the European Union as the route to a more successful economy. Possibly. And eventually."
economic indicators,Viewpoint: How serious is India's economic slowdown?,2024-09-15,2019-08-27,By Praveen  Chakravarty,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49470466,"Top Indian government officials are engaged in a vociferous public debate over the state of the country's economy. Rajiv Kumar, the head of the government's think tank Niti Aayog, recently claimed that the current slowdown was unprecedented in 70 years of independent India and called for immediate policy interventions in specific industries.  The Chief Economic Adviser, K Subramanian, disagreed with the idea of industry-specific incentives and argued for structural reforms in land and labour markets. Members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's economic advisory council sound inchoate, resorting to social media and opinion editorials to counter one another.  In essence, the quibble among the members of the economic team of Mr Modi and his government is not about whether India is facing an economic slowdown or not, but about how grave the current economic crisis is.  This is a remarkable reversal in stance of the same group of economists who, until a few months ago, waxed eloquent about how India was the fastest growing economy in the world, generating seven million jobs a year. To put all this in context, it was less than just two years ago, in November 2017, that the global ratings agency Moody's upgraded India's sovereign ratings - an independent assessment of the creditworthiness of a country - for the first time in 14 years.  Justifying the upgrade, Moody's had then argued that the economy was undergoing dramatic ""structural"" reforms under Mr Modi.  In the two years since, Moody's has downgraded its 2019 GDP growth forecast for India thrice - from 7.5% to 7.4% to 6.8% to 6.2%.  The immediate questions that arise now are: is India's economic condition really that grim and, if yes, how did it deteriorate so rapidly? One of India's most celebrated entrepreneurs, the founder of the largest coffee store chain, Café Coffee Day, recently killed himself, ostensibly due to unmanageable debt, slowing growth and alleged harassment by tax authorities.  The auto industry is expected to shed close to a million direct and indirect jobs due to a decline in vehicle sales. Sales growth of men's inner wear clothing, a key barometer of consumption popularised by former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan, is negative. Consumption demand that accounts for two-thirds of India's GDP is fast losing steam. To make matters worse, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented her first budget recently with some ominous tax proposals that threatened foreign capital flows and dented investor confidence. It sparked criticism and Ms Sitharaman was forced to roll back many of her proposals. So, it is indeed true that India is facing a sharp economic downturn and severe loss of business confidence.  The alarm over the economic condition is not merely a reflection of a slowdown in GDP growth but also the poor quality of growth.  Private sector investment, the mainstay of sustainable growth in any economy, is at a 15-year low.  In other words, there is almost no investment in new projects by the private sector. The situation is so bad that many Indian industrialists have complained loudly about the state of the economy, the distrust of the government towards businesses and harassment by tax authorities. But India's economic slowdown is neither sudden nor a surprise.  Behind the fawning headlines in the press over the past five years about the robustness of India's growth was a vulnerable economy, straddled with massive bad loans in the financial sector, disguised further by a macroeconomic bonanza from low global oil prices.  India's largest import is oil and the fortuitous decline in oil prices between 2014 and 2016 added a full percentage point to headline GDP growth, masking the real problems. Confusing luck with skill, the government was callous about fixing the choked financial system. To make matters worse, Mr Modi embarked on a quixotic move in 2016 to withdraw all high-value banknotes from circulation overnight. This effectively removed 85% of all currency notes from the economy. This move destroyed supply chains and impacted agriculture, construction and manufacturing that together account for three-quarters of all employment in the country.  Before the economy could recover from the currency ban shock, the government enacted a transition to a new indirect taxation system of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017. The GST rollout wasn't smooth and many small businesses initially struggled to understand it. Such massive external shocks to the economy, coupled with a reversal in low oil prices, dealt the final blow to the economy. Millions of Indians started to lose their jobs and rural wages remained stagnant. This, in turn, impacted consumption, slowing down the economy sharply.  The wobbly state of the economy has also thrown government finances in disarray: tax revenues are much below expectations.  On Monday, the government got a much-needed breather when India's central bank announced a $24bn (£19bn) one-time payout for the cash-starved government. (This amount is more than the dividend paid by the central bank to the government in all five years of the Congress rule between 2009 and 2014.)  The solutions to the economic crisis are not easy.   Indian industry, fed and fattened with government protection through decades, is once again clamouring for tax cuts and financial incentives.  But it is not clear that such benefits will revive private sector investment and domestic consumption immediately.   For all the hype about the Make in India programme, hailed as the harbinger of the country's emergence as a manufacturing power, India's dependence on China for goods has only doubled in the past five years.  India today imports from China the equivalent of 6,000 rupees ($83; £68) worth of goods for every Indian, which has doubled from 3,000 rupees in 2014.  India's exports have remained stuck at 2011 levels and not grown.  So, India is neither making goods for itself nor for the world.  Ornamental tax and other fiscal incentives to specific industries are not suddenly going to make Indian manufacturers competitive and stop India's addiction for affordable Chinese goods. If any, the trade spat between China and the United States only saw countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh benefit and not India. More currency or trade tariffs are not the solutions either. The central bank has lowered interest rates and there is some push to lowering the cost of capital for industry. But again, Indian industry will invest more only when demand for goods and services increases. And demand will increase only when wages increase, or there is money in the hands of people.  So, the only immediate solution for India seems to be to boost consumption through a stimulus given directly to people, in the classical Keynesian mould.  Of course, such a stimulus should be combined with reforms to boost business morale and confidence. In sum, India's economic picture is not pretty.  It is important for India's political leadership to see this not-so-pretty picture and not hide behind rose tinted glasses. Prime Minister Modi has a unique electoral mandate to embark on bold moves to truly transform the economy and pull India out of the woods.

economic indicators,New York company to create 100 jobs in Belfast,2024-09-15,2021-09-13,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-58546264,"American IT and cybersecurity firm Agio is to create 100 jobs in Northern Ireland over the next five years. The company, which is based in New York, works with the financial services industry, including asset managers and hedge funds. Invest Northern Ireland has offered a £650,000 grant to support the roles, which will be based in a new technology centre in Belfast. Recruitment has started and 19 of the jobs are already in place. Agio's chief revenue officer Garvin McKee, who is from Northern Ireland, said the company was confident a Northern Ireland base would continue to ""add excellent talent to our service organisation"". Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said the investment would contribute £4.5m in annual salaries to the Northern Ireland economy when all of the roles are in place. The jobs announcement comes as an Ulster Bank survey shows economic recovery in Northern Ireland lost momentum in August. Every month the bank asks firms across the private sector about issues such as staffing levels, new orders and exports - the survey results are considered to be a reliable indicator of economic activity. Ulster Bank chief economist Richard Ramsey said last month marked Northern Ireland firms' slowest rates of growth in output, orders and employment in five months. The survey suggests the manufacturing and services sectors saw some loss of momentum in August but output, orders and staffing levels were still growing. But the retail and construction sectors were in contraction territory, with falling sales and orders. ""The survey revealed again an all-too-familiar story, with inflationary pressures and lengthening supplier delivery times,"" said Mr Ramsey. ""Within the UK, Northern Ireland continues to report the steepest rises in input costs, with local firms raising the prices of their goods and services at faster rates than any other region. ""Price pressures linked to raw materials, fuel, freight, wages and Brexit continued to be cited by survey respondents. ""Inflationary price pressures in August eased only marginally relative to their recent record highs, although services firms raised their prices at the fastest pace in 13 years."" Meanwhile a Japanese cybersecurity firm, Nihon Cyber Defence, is opening an office in Belfast with an initial 10 employees. Dougie Grant, a former cybercrime detective at the PSNI, is Nihon's managing director for Europe. Additionally Ciaran Martin, the former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, will be joining the firm's board in Tokyo. "
economic indicators,Audit finds council failings in land sale deals,2024-09-15,2022-07-07,By Michael Fitzpatrick,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62069056,"An extraordinary audit of controversial land deals by Causeway Coast and Glens Council has found a ""culture existed of bypassing best practice and guidance to get land deals done"". The audit was ordered in November 2020.  It came after it emerged the council granted a right of way in Portstewart to a hotel developer for £1 in March 2016. The council said it would consider the report and meet to discuss it in August. The report found the council ""failed to demonstrate"" that it obtained the best price for the ratepayer in the transacting of land sales and rights of way. Local government auditor Colette Kane said the behaviour of some council officers had ""fallen short of the standards expected in a public body"". The report also found council chief executive David Jackson was ""directly involved"" in two particular land deals in which ""a number of significant failings were evident"", including the Portstewart case. The review of this transaction found there was no professional valuation carried out prior to the granting of the right of way. The sale of land to a charity seeking to progress a hotel development at Castleroe Road, Coleraine, in 2015 for £5,000 also featured in the report.  The report found, in both cases, there was a failure to demonstrate best price was obtained and that ""inadequate information"" was presented by senior council officers to councillors to enable them to make informed decisions.  The local government auditor said, in her view, both land transactions were not ""properly authorised"" and that ""there is a case for finding they had not been granted lawfully"". The report said the extent of the detailed involvement of the chief executive in a number of cases was ""unusual"".  ""I have identified evidence that adherence to legislation and best practice in land and property matters was not part of the culture of the council,"" said Ms Kane. ""There was evidence that senior officers were advocating actions that were contrary to best practice. ""This leads me to conclude that a culture existed of bypassing best practice and guidance to get land 'deals done' which set the wrong tone from the top of the organisation. ""In some cases legal advice was ignored and, on one occasion, inaccurate and unreliable information was provided to the local government auditor."" The report detailed how the right of way at Portstewart was granted to a hotel developer to allow site access for a proposed hotel development. Ms Kane said senior council officers' responses repeatedly referred to the economic benefit to the borough ""as justification for the decisions taken"". However, she added she ""did not consider that these responses sufficiently excuse the divergence from good practice and guidance"". The local government auditor found the behaviour of senior council officers was ""serious and concerning"" and recommended council should ""take appropriate action"" including referring them to the relevant professional bodies. On the finding that the conduct of some council officers had fallen ""well short of expected standards"", the report said ""there were indicators of wilful misconduct"" which were considered carefully. However, it concluded ""the threshold has not been adequately reached for any officer"". The local government auditor said the Portstewart case demonstrated ""little regard for getting the best price for the council and ratepayers"" and that the potential for marriage value/other special value to the purchaser ""does not appear to have been taken into account"". The report also highlighted a perceived conflict of interest relating to the council chief executive David Jackson in the Coleraine case. Ms Kane said the purchaser of the land nominated the chief executive for the Freedom of the City of London, which he was awarded in August 2016. This came after initial contact with him regarding the sale but before sealing the transaction.  When asked whether this had been brought to councillors' attention prior to the acceptance of the award, the report said the council responded that ""although several members were present when the chief executive initially declined the award and deferred to elected members, subsequently the mayor and group leaders were verbally briefed"". Ms Kane said this example along with another perceived conflict of interest relating to the valuation process in the Coleraine sale ""could have, and should have, been avoided"". ""They served to further undermine the integrity of the transaction being negotiated and the wider integrity of public services, creating a lack of public trust,"" she added.  In October 2020, BBC News NI reported the council's chief executive was ""ultimately responsible"" for granting right of way over public land in Portstewart for £1. The North Antrim assembly member Jim Allister, who first brought the £1 land transaction to the attention of the Audit Office in 2017, said he welcomed the ""robust findings"". Mr Allister became aware the council had granted the right of way for £1, when he successfully judicially reviewed the council's decision to grant planning permission for the hotel complex in Portstewart. He described the findings as ""truly shocking"" and ""well beyond the tolerance level where the chief executive and other senior officers can cling to office"". ""The £1 land deal to assemble a site for a hotel developer illustrates the cavalier disregard for the ratepayers' interests and the lamentable failure of oversight by compliant councillors. ""I welcome the auditor's belief that the disregard for legal process renders the granting of this easement unlawful. The council must now address this challenge."" The report makes a number of other recommendations which include: A spokesperson for the council said: ""Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council acknowledges the publication of the extraordinary audit report by the Northern Ireland Audit Office. ""Time will be required to fully assess the content and recommendations, and for council to consider the next steps. ""Work on this report began in late 2020, and throughout that time council cooperated fully with the Northern Ireland Audit Office. ""Council has already made changes to its land and property procedures and intends to comply with its obligations to ratepayers and stakeholders. ""The council will meet to discuss the report, its recommendations and further action to be taken, at the next full council meeting on Tuesday 2 August 2022."" In a statement, the DUP said the conduct of some senior council officers ""fell well short"" of the standards expected and that public confidence ""has been eroded"". Sinn Féin councillor Leanne Peacock said the findings were ""deeply shocking and disgraceful"" and urged action for the report's recommendations to be implemented. The SDLP's Margaret Anne McKillop said there had been a ""lack of accountability"" at the council while the UUP said the council must ensure ""recommendations made are dealt with in an appropriate way"".  Independent councillor Angela Mulholland said a ""special council meeting should be called sooner rather than later to deal with the findings"". "
economic indicators,Coronavirus outbreak could cripple India's economy,2024-09-15,2020-04-03,By Arunoday Mukharji,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52117704,"Mohammad Alam is one of thousands of workers standing in a food queue in India's capital, Delhi.   The factory where he worked shut down after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus. A daily-wage labourer, he has no other source of income, so he has been forced to come to a government centre for food. ""I don't know how I will survive, I will have to borrow to feed my family,"" he says. Neeraj Kumar, a migrant worker, decided to flee. He and his family joined a throng of people leaving the city soon after the lockdown announcement was made. Public transport systems were stopped, leaving people with no choice but to walk.  Mr Kumar, his wife, and their 10-year-old daughter had already walked more than 40km (24 miles) when we spoke to him. ""There is no work here, that is why we are running away. There are no buses, I have to walk another 260km to get to my village,"" he said. India has announced a $23bn (£18bn) relief package to help people like Mr Alam and Mr Kumar who are part of India's unorganised, informal industry which employs 94% of the population and contributes 45% to its overall output.  This industry is already bearing the brunt of the lockdown with thousands finding themselves unemployed overnight.  ""No-one will be allowed to go hungry,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said while announcing the package - a combination of direct cash transfer benefits and food security measures. But the economic fallout of this unprecedented lockdown has been dire. Businesses have closed, unemployment has risen and productivity has fallen.  India's growth engine was actually sputtering well before the threat of outbreak arrived. Once one of the fastest growing economies in the world, its growth slowed to 4.7% last year - the slowest level in six years.  Unemployment was at a 45-year high last year. Industrial output from the eight core sectors at the end of last year fell by 5.2% - the worst in 14 years. Small businesses had only just begun to recover from the controversial 2016 currency ban that came as a body blow to the cash-consuming informal economy. Now, experts say the coronavirus outbreak is likely to further cripple the already frail economy. So while most welcome the government's measures, they feel much more needs to be done to minimise the economic impact.  ""While free extra rations have been sanctioned, how will the poor access what is due to them?"" wonders economist Arun Kumar.  ""The government should devise a way of using the army and state machinery to physically distribute food to the poor."" With thousands of migrant workers stuck miles away from their homes, the seamless distribution of cash and food needs to be the government's top priority, he adds. And it's not just migrant workers at risk. Farmers are also vulnerable to a potential economic shock from the lockdown - the agriculture industry contributes nearly $265bn to GDP. The government says it will give farmers 2,000 rupees ($30) in April as an advance payment from an $80 annual pay-out to tide over the situation.  ""This money will be inadequate because exports have stopped. Prices in cities will rise because of profiteering and in rural areas they will drop because farmers won't be able to sell their crop,"" says economist Arun Kumar.  The outbreak has happened at a critical farming time - the new crop is ready, waiting to be sold.  Economists warn India's challenge will be in transporting this food from villages to cities in the midst of the lockdown.  If supply chains don't work properly, a lot of food will be wasted and lead to massive losses for Indian farmers.  Experts warn that India is also at the brink of a major unemployment crisis.  Economist Vivek Kaul says people who work for small businesses may end up with job and salary losses. ""I know of places where companies are actively discussing how many people they need to fire,"" he says. And that's not all.  With flights suspended until mid-April, the shutdown is also bound to push India's fast-growing aviation industry into peril. The Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) has assessed that the Indian aviation industry will post losses worth nearly $4bn this year.  This will likely have a cascading effect, affecting the hospitality and tourism industries. Hotels and restaurant chains across the country are empty and are likely to remain so for several months, sparking worries of large-scale layoffs.  The automobile industry, a key indicator of a country's economic growth, has also been forced to hit the brakes - experts are estimating losses of nearly $2bn. So, is India's relief package enough?  Experts say it's a drop in the ocean compared to bailouts in countries such as the US, China and Singapore.  They say India now also needs a larger stimulus package soon to help businesses weather this extraordinary crisis."
economic indicators,The video game prescribed by doctors to treat ADHD,2024-09-15,2022-07-10,By Kitti Palmai,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62060542,"While many parents worry that their children spend too much time playing computer games, Kelcey Sihanourath is pleased to see her son Owain pick up his tablet. Now aged 13, he was diagnosed with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) in pre-school. Since then, the family, who live in the US city of Savannah, Georgia, have taken Owain to see occupational therapists to help him better cope with everyday life tasks. They also tried the medication route, but had to stop after the prescribed drugs exacerbated the boy's regular migraines, and made him sick. With ADHD continuing to affect Owain's school performance over the years, Kelcey says she was ""hoping for something more, for any other option"". ""I could see him struggling to understand why he was not able to focus, and the frustration he had when he tried so hard and would still get distracted,"" she says. ""It broke my heart, but I felt trapped and completely useless."" Help came in the end from what initially seems very incongruous - a computer game called EndeavorRx. In 2020 it became the first such game to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of ADHD in children. Currently only available on prescription from doctors in the US, EndeavorRx at first glance looks very similar to countless other  games. You control a little alien that races on a spaceship through different worlds having to collect things. But the app-based game was developed in conjunction with neuroscientists, and is designed to stimulate and improve areas of the brain that play a key role in attention function. The idea is that it trains a child with ADHD to both better multitask and ignore distractions, with a computer algorithm measuring his or her performance and customising the difficulty of the game in real time.  When doctors prescribe it, the child's parents get sent an activation link that is needed before the game will play. Kelcey says she was ""a little sceptical"", but at the end of 2020 Owain started a three-month programme, playing the game for 25 minutes a day. He then did another round last year. ""He admitted it was a little harder than he expected,"" she says. ""But he understood that he was doing it to help improve his focus. He remained super motivated despite the difficulties and frustrations that came along with it."" After each of Owain's sessions she noted his daily behaviour in the app, and tracked his progress. Soon she started to see small, positive changes in his behaviour. For example, getting ready for school had become smoother, and there were no negative messages from teachers. And after failing third grade, Owain subsequently shot up to getting As and Bs for his work. ""It has been amazing to see my son so successful, but more so, seeing him have confidence in himself,"" Kelcey says. ""He is no longer upset and confused about why he just does not get it."" Eddie Martucci, chief executive of Akili, the Boston-based tech firm behind EndeavorRx, says the game has been designed to boost cognitive progressing. ""It is something that's very difficult to get through molecular means, like taking a pill. But it turns out that sensory stimuli can actually directly stimulate parts of the brain controlling cognitive function."" His company now plans to launch the game in Europe in the next few years.  In London, UK app Thymia is using computer games to help doctors and other medical professionals detect and diagnose mental health issues, particularly depression. One game sees the user have to try to memorise moving objects, while another is a card game that also tests his or her memory. In addition to how well the patient performs in the game, their comments and facial expressions are also monitored and evaluated by the app, which accesses their computer or mobile phone's camera and microphone. Thymia has been launched by Dr Emilia Molimpakis, who has a doctorate in linguistics, cognitive neuroscience and experimental psychology from University College London (UCL). She runs the business with co-founder Dr Stefano Goria, who has a doctorate in theoretical physics from the University of Turin. Dr Goria says the app ""gathers and extracts biomarkers that are relevant for understanding depression symptoms... in a useable and engaging way"". Both Akili and Thymia say that their apps should be used in addition to existing doctor-led monitoring and treatments, and not as a replacement. UK-based adolescent psychologist Angela Karanja agrees. ""While these are... effective inventions, they should be used alongside current existing [patient evaluation] questionnaires, which have been tested and accepted for reliability and validity, as well as doctors' input, and also alongside other treatments, not in isolation,"" says Ms Karanja. New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. Fellow UK psychologist Lee Chambers says that while the use of such video games in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of mental health conditions is still in the early stages, it appears to have ""potential"". ""Engaging with a game has the ability to remove aspects of feeling like we are being tested and measured,"" he says. ""These types of mental health games have an ability to widen access, and track variations in the baseline data that they collect over time. ""Given this, it has the potential to be an early indicator and show patterns in a way we don't currently have access to."""
economic indicators,At a glance: Scottish government independence paper,2024-09-15,2022-06-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-61797726,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has launched the first in a series of papers which she says will set out and debate the case for Scotland's independence. The first paper is entitled: ""Independence in the Modern World. Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland?"" It looks at 10 ""comparator countries"" - Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands - and compares the UK's performance across a range of economic and social indicators. Ms Sturgeon said these independent countries were a similar size to Scotland but were wealthier, fairer and more productive than the UK. The Scottish government's paper acknowledges that an independent Scotland could not be transformed to match the success of the comparator countries overnight.  But it says the comparator country models - especially the Nordic countries - illustrate the range of choices that would be available to an independent Scotland able to pursue different policies from those adopted by Westminster over many years. Independence by itself will not guarantee improved performance, it says. The government says it welcomes a national debate about how an independent country can create a wealthier, happier and fairer Scotland."
economic indicators,Survey suggests rise in trade but layoffs continue,2024-09-15,2020-10-12,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-54478660,"Business activity picked up in the third quarter of the year but Northern Ireland firms continue to lay off staff, an Ulster Bank survey suggests. Each month it asks private sector firms about new orders, staffing and exports in what is considered a reliable indicator of economic performance.  This pick-up in activity comes after the survey reported record falls during lockdown. It said manufacturing, construction and retail all grew in the third quarter. But the biggest sector of Northern Ireland's economy - services - reported a more ""lacklustre performance"". The survey suggested that all four sectors are still shedding jobs ""at a significant rate"". Ulster Bank's chief economist Richard Ramsey said: ""Northern Ireland's private sector has entered the fourth quarter in better shape than it started the third quarter. ""However, the pace of recovery remains relatively weak with the low-hanging fruit on the growth front already plucked. ""What little momentum the economy has will be tested by the headwinds of more restrictions associated with the resurgence in the number of new Covid-19 cases and Brexit. ""While more support measures from Westminster and Stormont will be forthcoming, the recovery will struggle to gain traction in this environment."""
economic indicators,China grows at slowest pace since 2009,2024-09-15,2018-10-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45910262,"China has reported its slowest quarterly growth rate since the global financial crisis. The growth figure for the July to September quarter was 6.5% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said. The result fell short of Reuters analyst forecasts of 6.6%. Policymakers have moved to support the cooling economy in recent months. China faces rising economic challenges including high debt levels and an intensifying trade battle with the US.  The impact of the trade dispute with the US is expected to weigh on growth figures in the coming months.  Friday's growth figure was the slowest quarterly expansion since the first quarter of 2009 - the height of the global financial crisis. The result was also a drop from the 6.7% rate in the prior quarter, but remains in line with the government's full-year target of about 6.5%.  While China watchers advise caution with Beijing's official GDP numbers, the data is seen as a useful indicator on the country's growth trajectory.  Analysis: Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondent  As one China observer told me during a recent trip to Beijing, the country was not expecting to fight a trade war at a time that it was also trying to manage systemic risks in the economy.  They don't have a lot of options on the table. The country is saddled with extraordinary levels of debt so policymakers are reluctant to take measures to stimulate the economy the way they did after 2008.  It means that Beijing is fighting a war on two fronts, without all of the cavalry at its disposal. And it's fighting an increasingly unpredictable and volatile enemy, in the form of an aggressive US administration.  None of which bodes well for China's economic outlook.  Read more from Karishma. For years China has pushed to wean off exports and rely more on domestic consumption for growth.   At the same time, the government has been fighting to contain ballooning debt - driven by a wave of infrastructure development - and a housing bubble without hurting growth. In recent months Beijing has taken steps to support its economy, including cutting capital requirements to boost liquidity, and ease the slowdown.  Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a research note the latest data showed ""some early signs...that policy support is starting to gain traction"" but added ""more easing will still be needed in order to stabilise growth"".  Other data released Friday showed factory output growth in September missed expectations, while retail sales for the month came in slightly above forecasts.  Alongside its domestic challenges, China is also expected to feel the pinch from a trade dispute with the US in the months ahead.  The third-quarter figures are the first to be released by Beijing since US President Donald Trump hit China with two sets of tariffs, targeting $250bn (£192bn) worth of Chinese goods. "
economic indicators,UK rates held as economy shows signs of picking up,2024-09-15,2020-01-30,By Szu Ping Chan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51309256,"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 0.75% amid early signs of a pick-up in the UK and global economies. In Mark Carney's final interest rate meeting as governor, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 7-2 to keep rates unchanged. Recent weak economic data had led to speculation rates could be cut, but Mr Carney said ""the most recent signs are that global growth has stabilised"". But the MPC said it was poised to cut interest rates if necessary. Fewer companies in the UK are worried about Brexit, Mr Carney told a news conference following the rate decision. He added that survey data suggested UK growth will improve. But he said: ""To be clear these are still early days and it's less of a case of so far so good than so far good enough,"" he said, again referring to the UK economy. ""Although the global economy looks to be recovering, caution is warranted,"" he said. ""Evidence of a pick-up in growth is not yet widespread."" He said the coronavirus outbreak was a ""reminder of the need to be vigilant"" when it comes to bumps in economic growth around the world. The nine MPC members have been split on rates since November. Lower interest rates are good news for borrowers and bad news for savers because High Street banks use the Bank of England base rate as a reference point for many mortgages and savings accounts. In a closely-watched decision, policymakers said they would monitor whether a recent improvement in business sentiment would lead to stronger economic growth. The MPC said it stood ready to cut rates if there were signs that growth would remain subdued. ""Policy might need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth, should the more positive signals from recent indicators of global and domestic activity not be sustained,"" the MPC said. Two members, Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders, argued that past business surveys of economic growth had not been reliable. They continued to call for an immediate interest rate cut to 0.5%. The Bank's latest economic estimates suggest the economy did not grow at all in the final three months of last year. Weaker growth at the turn of the year is also expected to drag overall economic growth down to just 0.75% in 2020. This is down from a projection of 1.25% last November. The UK economy is expected to expand by 0.2% in the first three months of this year. The Bank said a trade deal between the US and China that lowers some tariffs would provide a boost to the global economy. An expected rise in spending by the government in the March Budget could provide a further boost to growth, policymakers said. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said she also expected stronger growth ahead. ""Admittedly, the MPC left the door open to a rate cut in the coming months, but with the economy turning a corner and a big fiscal stimulus approaching, we suspect the next move in interest rates will be up not down, albeit not until next year."" The Bank said Brexit-related uncertainty had ""weighed on investment"" over the past few years. Policymakers said companies' Brexit plans had diverted money towards preparing for the UK's departure from the EU that would otherwise be invested elsewhere. This has reduced the UK's long-term growth prospects by limiting the space in which the economy can grow without the risk of overheating. This would force the Bank to raise interest rates, which would in turn slow the UK economy. Policymakers now believe the UK's potential growth has been reduced to 1.1%. This is down from 2.9% before the financial crisis and 1.6% over most of the past decade."
economic indicators,The inside story of the mini-budget disaster,2024-09-15,2023-09-24,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66897881,"The term ""mini budget"" will be forever toxic in British politics. So disastrous was then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's September 2022 statement - which included £45bn of unfunded tax cuts - that its long shadow still stretches over our economics and politics.  Over the past year, I have spoken to all the key players, some in public and some in private, about what happened both before and after that day.  Those conversations have revealed important new details about Mr Kwarteng and then-PM Liz Truss' ""growth plan"" - including that its initial impact was far worse than has been publicly known up to this point.  In the immediate aftermath, top officials were being asked by astounded counterparts how Britain had singlehandedly shifted one of the key indicators of the world economy in the financial markets, known as the Fed Fund futures curve. It was not a proud moment, they tell me.  In Washington for a key IMF meeting, Mr Kwarteng himself was privately having to reassure US bankers, politicians, and diplomats at the British embassy that the UK ""was committed to fiscal responsibility"" and that the Bank of England was one of the UK's ""finest institutions"".  That final comment attracted a lone clapper in the room - a board member of a British bank.   The chancellor went on to draw parallels between himself and Sir Isaac Newton, who held the high-ranking title of Warden of the Royal Mint for roughly 30 years. Bemused guests may not have realised that Sir Isaac himself made drastic attempts to reassert sterling's credibility in the late 17th Century.  As journalists in the room knew at the time, Mr Kwarteng was summoned back to Downing Street mid-meeting - but as he swept through the Washington DC rain he chafed at comparisons between himself and the crisis-ridden Greek Finance minister Evangelos Venizelos who had been hauled back from the IMF during the country's 2011 crisis.  As Mr Kwarteng rushed home, PM Liz Truss was being forced to take her own drastic action. Off the back of the mini-budget, the Bank of England was about to cease its emergency purchases of government bonds - these are a form of debt that the government sells to raise money it needs for public spending. As a result, Ms Truss' team felt she had no choice but to U-turn on a corporation tax cut announced in the mini-budget. The Bank's Governor Andrew Bailey tells me that this was not designed to pressure the government - but to ensure financial stability.  But Ms Truss says there were questions about the bank's governance - they were in a very powerful position over her and did effectively put ""pressure on me and the government to reverse our decisions on taxes"", she says.  Ms Truss says the same of another institution, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which is the country's official independent economic forecaster. It was created to help market confidence by ensuring a government's numbers are regularly checked. She says she had not realised the ""sheer level of power an organisation like the OBR has"" before she got to Downing Street.  The plan by Ms Truss and Mr Kwarteng was to bypass the OBR.   Its boss had worked through summer to prepare for an early set of tax changes and Mr Kwarteng had a draft forecast on his desk when he arrived in the job. But as I  revealed a week before the mini-budget, Downing Street refused to publish it. The numbers, marked as ""market sensitive"", forecast the Truss administration borrowing an extra £110bn over five years as gas prices, inflation and interest rates surged.  The OBR chief executive Richard Hughes told me: ""We were not asked to produce an updated forecast for him. And we were not asked to publish any forecasts alongside that [mini-budget].""   Current Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said this was a fundamental error by Mr Kwarteng. If the OBR had provided a forecast alongside the mini-budget, Mr Kwarteng would have been forced to show how his £45bn in tax cuts would balance with spending cuts or increased borrowing. Instead, the mini-budget had a solitary table asserting how, theoretically, the gap could be filled if the economy grew faster.   It was the equivalent of trying to pay a restaurant bill with an Instagram photo of some gold bars. In the mini-budget, as soon as the government revealed it needed an extra £72bn in funding from the markets - without details of how it calculated the number - the market reacted badly. It simply did not believe the plans.   Massive spending cuts might have bridged the gap - but both Ms Truss and Mr Kwarteng lacked both the clout and the numbers to push such plans through the Commons.  It was made worse by a crisis in a normally sleepy corner of the pensions system that is used to manage the risks of interest rate changes, which are normally predictable and gradual. Interest rates rises are normally good for pensions funds' long term health - but the rise in the effective interest costs for government after the mini-budget was so rapid that these funds had to sell more and more of their government bonds. The more they sold, the more the value of the bonds fell. Ms Truss's team say this was the real crisis, that it was a failure of Bank of England regulation, and that the Bank should have warned them. There was another problem for the markets. The government risked digging an even deeper credibility hole as it continued to defend itself. Cabinet ministers repeatedly blamed the market gyrations on ""global factors"", effectively sending the message that there was no problem to rectify. On two occasions, the Bank of England sent charts to MPs making it crystal clear that the mini-budget was the trigger. Yes, there was a global trend of rising rates, but the surge last September was a UK-specific issue.  Senior bank officials also felt the need to directly correct ministers' public mistakes - for example when ministers played down, or appeared not to understand, the direct impact of rising government interest on fixed-rate mortgages. The Governor of the Bank himself had to explain to senior Cabinet ministers that mortgages were now more likely to be priced off long term borrowing rates rather than the Bank of England base rate.  ""Banks were finding it hard to price on a curve that was moving so much,"" said one official, who advised ministers not to go out in public and blame banks for rising mortgage costs. ""You've got to understand how the pricing works.""   It's clear, looking back, that this was not just a financial heart attack - it was a stress test of Britain's entire system of institutions.   And beyond changing the public perception of Mr Kwarteng and Ms Truss, it changed the entire way British economic policy is directed, how investors act, and how institutions respond to blips.  Economically, the UK has long enjoyed a privilege in the markets - able to run ""twin deficits"" on both trade and government borrowing. But this reliance on the ""kindness of strangers"" funding was shaken by last year's events.   Big corporations report that there are more questions now from major investors than before the mini-budget. Those burnt by a sharp fall in sterling after the announcement will now insist on factoring in costly currency hedges before investing in major British infrastructure.  Politically, ""mini-budget"" is now a sort of anti-brand. Its name is a trump card, deployed to argue for financial credibility and a tight hand on the tiller above everything else. The government and the opposition are contorting themselves to meet a five-year debt target and cut back on investments they have previously said the country badly needs.  If HS2 is cut back, for example, some of that can be attributed to the mini-budget hangover. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has already won an argument to rein in a planned tsunami of green investments if her party wins the general election - and has vowed to strengthen the OBR even more. She and others are clearly trying to link the rising mortgage costs to the chaos of last year - even though much of that now arises from the Bank of England's inflation-fighting efforts.  Arguably the biggest impact of the mini-budget has been on the UK's big institutions.  This time a year ago the OBR, the Bank of England, and top Treasury civil servant Sir Tom Scholar were variously side-lined, briefed against, and fired. They were the ""bean counters"" pursuing ""abacus economics"", standing in the way of newly appointed Prime Minister Liz Truss' agenda.   Her experiment - that push-back against the ""economic orthodoxy"" - went to its breaking point. Policy, from the jobs market, to visas, to investment, is now prioritised based on whether it will ""score"" on the OBR's forecast and help the numbers add up.   The radical economic laboratory experiments are over.  The experts have struck back. "
economic indicators,Teen subjected to coercive control before death,2024-09-15,2021-11-25,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-wiltshire-59420588,"A 17-year-old girl who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend after she ended their relationship was subjected to ""coercive control"" before her death, a review has found.  Thomas Griffiths tried to disrupt Ellie Gould's studies, a form of behaviour known as ""educational sabotage"", the Domestic Homicide Review ruled. He admitted murder and was jailed for 12 and a half years in November 2019. The independent review found no agency failings or shortcomings. It said it was ""alarming"" how quickly their separation escalated to murder after she ended their relationship. Ellie, a keen horse rider, attempted to fight off Griffiths after he attacked her with a kitchen knife at her family home in Calne, Wiltshire, in May 2019. He later staged the scene to make it look like a suicide and returned to school. The review stated: ""In this case, the perpetrator appeared to be disrupting Ellie's studying during an important period of revision, displayed insecurities and appeared to be inducing guilt. ""Ellie sought a break from the perpetrator during their revision for mock A-level exams, but the perpetrator appeared not to accept this. ""His disruption of her studies thereafter should be seen within the context of educational sabotage."" It described educational sabotage as ""a less known form of coercive control and economic abuse which disrupts a victim's ability to gain educational qualifications and furthers a perpetrator's power and control over them"". It said Ellie would have been able to use ""the full range of specialist domestic abuse services"" within Wiltshire had she wanted or felt the need to. The independent multi-agency report's recommendations included promoting the support available for young people in Wiltshire concerned about domestic abuse or controlling behaviour. Additional recommendations included further raising awareness of indicators of abuse in young people's relationships for agencies, as well as families and friends. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Cooper, chairman of the Wiltshire Community Safety Partnership, said: ""Tackling domestic abuse and violence, in all its forms, is every agency's responsibility and we will continue to work together to ensure we are doing all we can to support victims and educate everyone on this issue."" Ellie's friends have since campaigned for self-defence classes to be part of the school curriculum."
economic indicators,No 'significant easing' of Covid rules expected,2024-09-15,2021-01-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-55733768,"No ""significant easing"" of Wales' Covid restrictions should be expected when the current guidelines are reviewed this month, the health minister said. Vaughan Gething said it was ""good news"" that case rates were falling, but warned they still remained high.  He told a Welsh Government briefing the NHS remained ""under pressure"" with critical care services operating at 150% of capacity. A further 44 people have died with coronavirus, taking the total to 4,346. And another 13,800 people had their first vaccine in the past day in Wales, taking the total to 175,816, according to latest figures. Mr Gething made the comments as he was outlining the current situation with Covid in Wales, but he said he did not want to prejudge a Welsh Government decision on the review. Wales has been in a level four lockdown since before Christmas with a decision on a review of the current restrictions expected by 29 January. The seven-day rolling case rate for Wales is 285 cases per 100,000 people, which is down from a high of 636 on 17 December. A key indicator in deciding to put Wales into the strictest alert level was Covid rates exceeding more than 300 cases per 100,000 people in a seven-day period. Wrexham has the highest rate in Wales with 673 cases per 100,000 people, followed by Flintshire with 480.5. Mr Gething said: ""If we come out of level four too soon, too fast, we could well see a rebound in Covid rates. ""And we could end up doing something that overwhelms our health service with all the harm that would cause to our staff and people who need our health service. ""People shouldn't expect any significant easing at the end of this current phase."" He said the Welsh Government would make a decision following advice from its scientific advisers and the chief medical officer. Under current lockdown rules, people are required to make essential journeys only and schools have been closed to most pupils with online learning in place. Mr Gething also said there would be a ""great many more difficult choices to make"" on dealing with Covid-19 with the Senedd election due in May. Ministers are seeking Senedd members' support for emergency legislation to allow the poll to be delayed by up to six months as a last resort. Mr Gething told the briefing: ""Even by the first week of May we can be confident that there will still be a great many more difficult choices to make before we can say the pandemic is over, and before we're then into what I believe will be a full term of recovery from the economic crisis that Covid has caused, as well as the health crisis.  ""This is a piece of legislation to guard against the possibility that Covid rates are so significant that we can't have an election."""
economic indicators,CBI ex-boss says capitalism not working,2024-09-15,2017-10-24,By Hannah Smith,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41744127,"Capitalism is not delivering on its promise to raise living standards, a former head of the business lobby, the CBI, has warned.  Lord Adair Turner, who is also a former City regulator, made the comments ahead of the release of third quarter growth figures for the UK on Wednesday.  He said the basic idea that ""a rising tide raises all boats"" had gone wrong.  Economic growth was not feeding through into people's incomes and living standards, he said in a BBC interview. ""Everybody knows that capitalism is not egalitarian, but the broad promise has been that, over a ten year period, you can be pretty confident that a rising tide raises all boats and everybody feels somewhat better off, and that's gone wrong,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money programme. Lord Turner is a cross-bench peer, but has also headed the Low Pay Commission after a career in  business and academia. He pointed to a toxic mix of stagnant productivity, falling real wages and rising inequality. ""The combination of that is a lot of people do not feel the system is delivering for them. This is a big challenge for economists.  ""Why, in a world of apparently extraordinary capabilities of technology, do we have these very low productivity growth rates?"" On Wednesday morning the Office for National Statistics will release the first estimate of UK GDP growth for July to September, a key indicator of the health of the economy. Economists are predicting growth of 0.3%, unchanged from the previous quarter.  Lord Turner said sluggish economic growth is only in part a hangover from the financial crisis and high levels of consumer and corporate debt.  ""The more fundamental thing is, where we are getting growth? ""The UK economy has grown a bit in the last five years and we have created lots of jobs, but they have been low productivity jobs,"" he said.   Lord Turner noted certain sectors such as manufacturing, retail and logistics have managed to improve productivity through automation, replacing human workers with robots. But those workers displaced by technological change have ended up in low paid jobs - Deliveroo cyclists working in the gig economy, for example. ""I think paradoxically that we should expect to see in a world of huge automation the continued proliferation of low paid, low tech jobs,"" Lord Turner said.  ""We are going to have to face as a society the question of how do we make sure that people have a good enough standard of living to be equal citizens of society even if the wages they get will be relatively lower?"""
economic indicators,Trump admirer leads race for Argentina presidency,2024-09-15,2023-08-14,By Vanessa Buschschlüter,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-66496816,"Far-right economist Javier Milei, who admires US ex-president Donald Trump, has received the highest share of votes in Argentina's primary election.  The primary, in which presidential candidates from all parties take part, is seen as a key indicator for the presidential election on 22 October. Mr Milei exceeded expectations by winning 30% of votes, ahead of more established politicians. Argentine media have described the result as a ""political earthquake"". The primary in Argentina differs from those in other countries, since it is not restricted to party members, but open to all those eligible to cast their ballot in the presidential polls. Voting is also mandatory. Whoever wins the most votes is therefore seen as a favourite for the presidential election on 22 October. Opinion polls ahead of the primaries had seen Mr Milei trailing behind the centre-left economy minister, Sergio Massa, and conservative candidate Patricia Bullrich.  But with more than 97% of votes counted, Mr Milei had 30.06% of votes, ahead of Ms Bullrich's coalition with 28.27% and Sergio Massa's coalition with 27.24%. Newspaper La Nación compared Mr Milei's surge to a tsunami. Mr Milei is a former TV personality who has studied and taught economics. Despite serving as a Congressmen since 2021, he likes to portray himself as a political outsider.    His anti-establishment view have endeared him to Argentine voters angry at the current and previous governments for failing to solve Argentina's economic crisis.  Year-on-year inflation is above 115%, one in four Argentines is living in poverty and the local currency, the peso, has plummeted to such an extent that football fans from rival nations have torn up peso bills to taunt Argentine fans.  Mr Milei has launched bitter attacks on his rivals from established political parties. Speaking after the primary on Sunday he told his cheering supporters that ""we have managed to build this competitive alternative that will put an end to the parasitic, thieving, useless political caste"". The 52-year-old has said that if elected, he would abolish Argentina's central bank, replace the peso with the US dollar and privatise state-run firms which are making a loss.   In a policy that brings to mind Brazil's former far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro, Mr Milei also proposes loosening gun controls. Mr Milei has also stated that he is opposed to abortion unless the mother's life is at risk and has included a promise ""to protect children's lives from conception"" in his campaign programme.  He has attacked sex education in schools as a ploy to destroy the ""traditional family"" and is a climate-change denier.  Sporting long sideburns, singing rock songs and often wearing a leather jacket, the 52-year-old is deliberately provocative and often attacks ""the left"" in expletive-laden outbursts. His unexpectedly good performance in the primary - 10 percentage points above what opinion polls had predicted - has sent the peso tumbling even further. The official rate fell nearly 18% when markets opened on Monday to just over 350 pesos per dollar. Mr Milei's success was celebrated rapturously by his supporters, whom he told: ""We are the true opposition, we are the only ones who want a real change, because remember, a different Argentina is impossible with the same old people, with the same old people who have always failed, with the same old people who have been failing for 100 years."" The candidates who came second and third, Patricia Bullrich and Sergio Massa, will now try to gain ground ahead of the first round of the presidential election on 22 October.  A second round pitting the top two contenders will be held on 19 November if no candidate reaches the 45% of votes - or 40% with a 10-percentage-point lead - needed to win outright. With less than four percentage points' distance between the three top candidates in the primaries, a second round currently seems highly likely.  Argentina is not the first country in the region where an anti-establishment candidate has upset the political apple cart. In Colombia, independent candidate Rodolfo Hernández surged ahead surprisingly in the first round of the 2022 election, but lost to a former left-wing rebel, Gustavo Petro, in the run-off.  And in Chile, a far-right candidate, José Antonio Kast, won the first round in 2021, but was defeated by the left-wing former student leader Gabriel Boric in the second round. In Brazil, supporters of the far-right incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, refused to accept his narrow defeat by his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and stormed Congress just days after the latter was sworn in on 1 January 2023.

economic indicators,Trade disputes settlement system facing crisis,2024-09-15,2019-12-08,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50681431,"The World Trade Organization is facing a crisis in its system for resolving disputes between its members.  It has an appeal ""court"" that is the final arbiter on such disputes and which is about to become unable to function.  WTO rules say three judges have to hear each case. On 10 December the number goes below that level. Only one will be left. The terms of the other two come to an end, and no replacements have been chosen.  In fact there isn't even a process under way to find any. The reason is that the US has refused to allow the recruitment of new judges. Other WTO member countries have repeatedly proposed to start a selection procedure. At the end of November more than 100 members called for that but the US alone said no. It's the only country that has objected at any stage during this stand-off.  In the quarter of a century since the WTO was established, its system for settling disputes has been one of its main functions. A former director general Pascal Lamy has called the system the WTO's crown jewel. It has also been described as ""probably the busiest international dispute settlement system in the world"". But it is now in danger of seizing up. Not quite completely - there may some options for countries to work around the absence of an appeal court, or the Appellate Body to give its official title, but they are second-best and may not be accepted by some countries.  What is the US's objection? Perhaps the biggest issue is that the US accuses the WTO dispute system of ""judicial overreach"" - essentially that it interprets the WTO rules in a way that creates new obligations for WTO members.  One area that particularly grates in Washington is dumping, when a foreign supplier sells goods abroad more cheaply than at home.  The US and others have used a disputed method for assessing whether goods have been dumped and how much the price is below what it should be.  It is known as ""zeroing"". It's not explicitly prohibited by the WTO rules, but the Appellate Body took the view that it was in effect against the spirit.   Yet it is not just about specific cases; it is a general concern that the US has about the rulings going too far, that they in effect create new WTO law.  The US also has some concerns about procedural issues, such as the Appellate Body not issuing its rulings as quickly as it is supposed to, and judges continuing to hear cases they have already started even after their terms have ended. And it is not just the current US administration led by President Trump that has had this concern.   A recent statement by the US delegation at a WTO meeting stated: ""For more than 16 years and across multiple US administrations, the United States has been raising serious concerns with the Appellate Body's overreaching and disregard for the rules set by WTO members."" It is not even the first time that a US administration has been uncooperative on Appellate Body appointments. Under President Obama, the US opposed a second term for a South Korean judge and even for an American chosen by a previous administration.  But on those earlier occasions, the US did not block the appointment of new judges. Critics thought the US then was damaging the credibility of the WTO's dispute system,  but it did not stop it functioning. It is also true that some of the US concerns are shared by other WTO members. But none of them appear to believe that disabling the appeal system is the right way forward.   This time the US is raising the stakes.  President Trump is far less accepting of the WTO than his predecessors were. He has threatened to pull the US out of the organisation and has claimed on Fox News that the WTO was set up ""to benefit everybody but us"", adding, ""we lose the lawsuits, almost all of the lawsuits in the WTO.""  That is not actually true but the remark is an indicator of how much he evidently dislikes the WTO. And President Trump's approach to the WTO has been described as part of an ""assault on the global trading system"".   Other elements in this approach include action against China without having first got a ruling from the WTO's dispute system, and tariffs on steel and aluminium imports imposed ostensibly on the grounds of national security, but seen by many commentators as motivated by a desire to protect US producers from competition.   The prospective incapacitation of the Appellate body is certainly a problem for the WTO and its dispute settlement system. The first stage ruling is not binding on the countries involved if one of them appeals. So if there is an appeal, the dispute is in effect on hold indefinitely and countries can't get authorisation to retaliate.  But that doesn't mean it can't function at all. Countries can choose not to appeal. They can agree alternative steps for conducting appeals by arbitration. There is also the fact that WTO members are still subject to the rules, even if the enforcement mechanism is impaired. The risk of harming their reputation may act as some sort of partial restraint on violations of the rules.  There is also other work done by the WTO which will continue, such as help for developing countries in building up their capacity to benefit from trade, monitoring of members' policies and negotiation. So the impending loss of the appeal function does not mean the WTO will run off the road altogether. But it does mean it won't be firing on all cylinders. "
economic indicators,Italy's far right cash in on cost of living crisis,2024-09-15,2022-09-22,By Katya Adler,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62991601,"Pay for two coffees, drink only one. That's the community-minded tradition known as the caffè sospeso. Those who cannot afford breakfast, pop into their local bar to eat and drink - thanks to the bar owner, plus the kind soul who earlier purchased the sospeso, or ""suspended coffee"". The sospeso initiative is said to have started more than 200 years ago in Naples and is now spreading across Italy, where an eye-wateringly strong coffee and accompanying croissant (known in Italy as a cornetto) are viewed as a basic human right of a morning. Italians, like many others in Europe, are feeling the pinch. Spiralling energy bills compound already existing economic difficulties - hangovers from Covid lockdown measures and the euro crisis. ""Italians feel abandoned. Especially here in the south,"" Pino de Stasio told me. His family have owned Bar Settebello in downtown Naples for decades.  ""Unlike the UK, our government hasn't lent us enough of a helping hand. My energy bills have quadrupled. We're forced to switch off our coffee machine at 4pm every day when energy prices spike. So many businesses and families are going under. That's why, unfortunately, people are looking to the [political] right. Because they haven't yet sat in government to disappoint us."" This Sunday, 100 years after Mussolini's March on Rome, Italy is poised to opt for a leader from the hard right, whose Brothers of Italy party has its roots in neo-fascism.  Polls in Italy are seen as very reliable indicators. Their key uncertainty appears to be the size of the nationalists' victory. Famous for being small of stature but very loud of voice, Giorgia Meloni was addressing a campaign rally just outside Naples, in the working town of Caserta. She bellowed her economic promises at the nodding, cheering crowd. She would change Italy, she promised, investing in its strengths, standing up for its interests in Brussels, cracking down on uncontrolled immigration, protecting Italian families and the disadvantaged, while forcing those who can work off benefits.  Her supporters say ""she makes sense"". While critics fret about her political roots, Ms Meloni knows the money in their pocket - or lack of it - is what Italians care most about right now.  Last election her party got 4% of the vote, now she's angling for her country's premiership. To attract more moderate voters, she's tried to curate a conservative mainstream image. In an interview with Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper, Ms Meloni insisted there were no ""nostalgic fascists, racists or anti-Semites in the Brothers of Italy DNA"", and that she had always got rid of ""ambiguous people"" from her party. With her backstreet Roman twang, dressed in slacks and a baggy jumper, her long blonde hair flying as she strode up and down the stage, her intended message was ""I'm one of you"". ""Don't be afraid,"" she told the people of Caserta. But that's exactly what voters should be, according to her political opponents. Caterina Cerroni, 31, is the youngest candidate standing in this election for the left-wing Democratic Party. She said Giorgia Meloni threatened to erode the rights of young people to get a stable job, LGBTQ+ rights and the rights of women - making it harder to get an abortion. Ms Cerroni also described the right wing's proposal for a flat tax rate as an ""injustice, promoting inequality"". ""I'd rather have a feminist male prime minister than Italy's first female leader, if she's Giorgia Meloni,"" she told the BBC. But bearing in mind the fast-revolving door of Italian governments, many voters we spoke to said their main priority was the durability of Italy's next government. ""What we Italians desperately need is stability,"" bleary-eyed Marco Brozzi told me. The boss of a small ceramics factory, Ceramiche Noi, in the central region of Umbria, he is tired because he and his workers come in well before dawn these days - to benefit from cheaper energy prices at that time. Ceramics factories are massively energy intensive and he told me his gas and electricity bills had shot up 1000% over the last year. Unless the new government formed after this election acted fast to help businesses, he said, his factory could face closure within months. Italy's political system is all about coalition-building and the stability of a Meloni government will depend on how her coalition partners fare in Sunday's vote. She plans to link arms with centre-right former prime minister and business tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, and with her frenemy and former political rival, the far-right populist Matteo Salvini.  Both men have historically close ties to Russia. Berlusconi once gave Vladimir Putin a bedcover emblazoned with a huge photo of them both. They have even gone skiing together. This makes Italy's allies in Nato and in Brussels jumpy.  But Stefano Stefanini, Italy's former ambassador to Nato, told me that where foreign policy was concerned, Italy had been consistent for the past 70 years. The international community should keep an eye on the new government, but also give it a chance, he said. He pointed out that Ms Meloni was a keen Atlanticist who consistently voted in favour of sanctions against Russia while in opposition: ""There's no reason that she'll do different things in government than she's done in opposition.""  According to the director of the institute for foreign affairs in Rome, Nathalie Tocci, Ms Meloni is no populist either. Meaning that even if polls indicated Italians wanted their government to drop sanctions against Russia, in response to energy price hikes, she would be unlikely to U-turn on her position.  Italy's post-war, post-Mussolini constitution also contains a number of checks and balances on those in power. President Sergio Matarella will, for example, be able to influence Ms Meloni's choice of government ministers. If, indeed, she does become prime minister."
economic indicators,Viewpoint: How serious is India's economic slowdown?,2024-09-15,2019-08-27,By Praveen  Chakravarty,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49470466,"Top Indian government officials are engaged in a vociferous public debate over the state of the country's economy. Rajiv Kumar, the head of the government's think tank Niti Aayog, recently claimed that the current slowdown was unprecedented in 70 years of independent India and called for immediate policy interventions in specific industries.  The Chief Economic Adviser, K Subramanian, disagreed with the idea of industry-specific incentives and argued for structural reforms in land and labour markets. Members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's economic advisory council sound inchoate, resorting to social media and opinion editorials to counter one another.  In essence, the quibble among the members of the economic team of Mr Modi and his government is not about whether India is facing an economic slowdown or not, but about how grave the current economic crisis is.  This is a remarkable reversal in stance of the same group of economists who, until a few months ago, waxed eloquent about how India was the fastest growing economy in the world, generating seven million jobs a year. To put all this in context, it was less than just two years ago, in November 2017, that the global ratings agency Moody's upgraded India's sovereign ratings - an independent assessment of the creditworthiness of a country - for the first time in 14 years.  Justifying the upgrade, Moody's had then argued that the economy was undergoing dramatic ""structural"" reforms under Mr Modi.  In the two years since, Moody's has downgraded its 2019 GDP growth forecast for India thrice - from 7.5% to 7.4% to 6.8% to 6.2%.  The immediate questions that arise now are: is India's economic condition really that grim and, if yes, how did it deteriorate so rapidly? One of India's most celebrated entrepreneurs, the founder of the largest coffee store chain, Café Coffee Day, recently killed himself, ostensibly due to unmanageable debt, slowing growth and alleged harassment by tax authorities.  The auto industry is expected to shed close to a million direct and indirect jobs due to a decline in vehicle sales. Sales growth of men's inner wear clothing, a key barometer of consumption popularised by former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan, is negative. Consumption demand that accounts for two-thirds of India's GDP is fast losing steam. To make matters worse, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented her first budget recently with some ominous tax proposals that threatened foreign capital flows and dented investor confidence. It sparked criticism and Ms Sitharaman was forced to roll back many of her proposals. So, it is indeed true that India is facing a sharp economic downturn and severe loss of business confidence.  The alarm over the economic condition is not merely a reflection of a slowdown in GDP growth but also the poor quality of growth.  Private sector investment, the mainstay of sustainable growth in any economy, is at a 15-year low.  In other words, there is almost no investment in new projects by the private sector. The situation is so bad that many Indian industrialists have complained loudly about the state of the economy, the distrust of the government towards businesses and harassment by tax authorities. But India's economic slowdown is neither sudden nor a surprise.  Behind the fawning headlines in the press over the past five years about the robustness of India's growth was a vulnerable economy, straddled with massive bad loans in the financial sector, disguised further by a macroeconomic bonanza from low global oil prices.  India's largest import is oil and the fortuitous decline in oil prices between 2014 and 2016 added a full percentage point to headline GDP growth, masking the real problems. Confusing luck with skill, the government was callous about fixing the choked financial system. To make matters worse, Mr Modi embarked on a quixotic move in 2016 to withdraw all high-value banknotes from circulation overnight. This effectively removed 85% of all currency notes from the economy. This move destroyed supply chains and impacted agriculture, construction and manufacturing that together account for three-quarters of all employment in the country.  Before the economy could recover from the currency ban shock, the government enacted a transition to a new indirect taxation system of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017. The GST rollout wasn't smooth and many small businesses initially struggled to understand it. Such massive external shocks to the economy, coupled with a reversal in low oil prices, dealt the final blow to the economy. Millions of Indians started to lose their jobs and rural wages remained stagnant. This, in turn, impacted consumption, slowing down the economy sharply.  The wobbly state of the economy has also thrown government finances in disarray: tax revenues are much below expectations.  On Monday, the government got a much-needed breather when India's central bank announced a $24bn (£19bn) one-time payout for the cash-starved government. (This amount is more than the dividend paid by the central bank to the government in all five years of the Congress rule between 2009 and 2014.)  The solutions to the economic crisis are not easy.   Indian industry, fed and fattened with government protection through decades, is once again clamouring for tax cuts and financial incentives.  But it is not clear that such benefits will revive private sector investment and domestic consumption immediately.   For all the hype about the Make in India programme, hailed as the harbinger of the country's emergence as a manufacturing power, India's dependence on China for goods has only doubled in the past five years.  India today imports from China the equivalent of 6,000 rupees ($83; £68) worth of goods for every Indian, which has doubled from 3,000 rupees in 2014.  India's exports have remained stuck at 2011 levels and not grown.  So, India is neither making goods for itself nor for the world.  Ornamental tax and other fiscal incentives to specific industries are not suddenly going to make Indian manufacturers competitive and stop India's addiction for affordable Chinese goods. If any, the trade spat between China and the United States only saw countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh benefit and not India. More currency or trade tariffs are not the solutions either. The central bank has lowered interest rates and there is some push to lowering the cost of capital for industry. But again, Indian industry will invest more only when demand for goods and services increases. And demand will increase only when wages increase, or there is money in the hands of people.  So, the only immediate solution for India seems to be to boost consumption through a stimulus given directly to people, in the classical Keynesian mould.  Of course, such a stimulus should be combined with reforms to boost business morale and confidence. In sum, India's economic picture is not pretty.  It is important for India's political leadership to see this not-so-pretty picture and not hide behind rose tinted glasses. Prime Minister Modi has a unique electoral mandate to embark on bold moves to truly transform the economy and pull India out of the woods.

economic indicators,Slow progress,2024-09-15,2017-10-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-41531665,"Unemployment is at record lows: employment is at record highs. So all's well? Not according to figures published this week. Growth continues to struggle into positive territory, according to Scottish government statisticians. The figure for April to June was published on Wednesday, showing growth of only 0.1%. That's right: the least growth we could have. Construction was particularly weak. And despite manufacturing being helped by the weakness of sterling, it was also into negative territory. The figure for the first quarter of the year, January to March, was downgraded to 0.6%.  It's been noted before that that looks a bit odd, given what else we saw in the economy at that time, given that it was largely driven by three industries, and given that it's out of whack with two-and-a-half years of other growth figures. Economist John McLaren has separated out the figures so that they are directly comparable with the UK ones.  He reckons Scottish growth has been roughly a third that of the UK over the past 30 months - 1.2% to the UK's 4.5%. That ratio is true of the most recent quarter, and of the past year. From those at the Fraser of Allander Institute comes a reminder (this can't be said often enough) that if growth is consistently lower than the rest of the UK, then income tax revenue can also be expected to be lower than Holyrood might have expected from the previous block grant formula. In other words, devolution of income tax power will leave a funding gap, compared with where Holyrood might have been without those devolved powers. Ministers may look on the bright side with these figures. But for their budget forecasts, they now have to look to the independent Scottish Fiscal Commission to set the revenue expectations for them. These growth figures will not translate into comfortable reading for Finance Secretary Derek Mackay. So those who hoped the original 0.8% estimate for the first quarter was a sign of a rosy new 2016 are now hunkering down for tougher times, as other indicators have shown things looking a lot less positive.   Brexit is taking a toll on confidence, as if businesses needed another reason for holding back on investment. The consumer debt binge that has kept us going through many of the bad months in recent years may be running out of road. Real earnings are being squeezed by inflation. And as household budgets are squeezed, even those attractive financing deals on cars are failing to keep momentum behind sales. The September figures for UK new car registrations were down 9.3%. In Scotland they were down 8%, to below 40,000.   September matters a lot to car dealers, because that's one of two months when buyers are attracted by new plates. Over the year so far, Scots registrations are down 5%, and UK ones by 3%. The productivity figures, issued on Friday, are not broken down by parts of the UK. But there's no reason to think Scotland is faring any better than the rest of the Kingdom. It was consistently faring worse, but the most recent Scottish productivity figures, covering 2015, were warmly welcomed for catching up with the UK level of productivity. That may be an achievement, but it's not much of a target to have hit. UK productivity looks dire, and it's been going backwards. Also, the Scottish boost in 2015 followed four very weak years. Productivity is the vital driver of improved prosperity. If we're not producing more per hour worked, we're not earning a real terms pay rise. While productivity stalls, pay rises are making us less competitive.  On average. Why this productivity problem? Well, that's been puzzling economists, just as it's been puzzling governments.   Here are some of the reasons being offered: There are various ways out of poor productivity. They start with investment in skills and equipment, along with their effective deployment. They continue with better infrastructure, in transport and telecoms. Being open to trade is a valuable driver of productivity as well. It forces firms to be competitive with the best. So pulling out of a single market, in which others are more productive, can mean reduced competitive pressure on firms to improve their processes. Being less attractive to inward investors is also a means of slowing up the adoption of new ideas for greater efficiency, which are known to be imported when global companies set up shop. The Brexoptimists (a term I just invented) see the shift to new trading relationships with the world beyond the European Union as the route to a more successful economy. Possibly. And eventually."
economic indicators,UK house price growth 'slowing',2024-09-15,2017-12-07,By Brian Milligan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42263597,"The growth in UK house prices is continuing to slow, according to the country's largest lender, the Halifax. It said average prices rose by 3.9% in the year to the end of November, down from 4.5% in October. And it warned that growth is likely to ease further in the longer term, as wages fail to keep pace with inflation. Some commentators also said that the Halifax figures were out of kilter with other indicators, which suggest prices rises are even more modest. Last week, rival lender Nationwide said prices had risen by just 2.5% over the past year, which is lower than the rate of general inflation. According to the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), the cost of living rose by 3% in the year to October. The average house or flat in the UK is now selling for £226,821, the Halifax said. ""The imbalance between supply and demand continues to support house prices, which doesn't look like changing in the near future,"" said Russell Galley, the managing director of Halifax Community Bank.  However, he added that house price growth was likely to slow in the long term. ""Further ahead, increasing affordability issues, as price increases continue to outstrip wage growth, are likely to curb housing demand and cause price growth to ease."" The Halifax said that the changes to Stamp Duty for first-time buyers announced in last month's Budget would help to stimulate demand in London and the South East. For properties costing up to £500,000, first-time buyers will now pay no stamp duty on the first £300,000. However, other data points to a continuing slowdown in the market. In October, the number of home buyers being granted mortgages fell to its lowest for over a year, according to figures from the Bank of England. ""Housing market activity is currently muted and faltering,"" said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the Halifax figures were at odds with other indicators, such as surveys from Nationwide and Rightmove. ""Halifax's suggestion that house prices are surging again conflicts with virtually every other indicator we track,"" he said.  Where can I afford to live?"
economic indicators,Has Eritrea's self-reliant economy run out of puff?,2024-09-15,2016-07-13,Mary Harper,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36786965,"Some of the poorest housing are small dwellings made from metal sheets A ""go it alone"" culture has long been central to Eritrea, including its economy. It is slowly opening up to foreign investment, but recent policies, especially a currency reform, mean many people are now struggling in what was already one of the poorest countries on earth.  In a dusty corner of the capital, Asmara, is a walled market. It assaults the senses as soon as you enter, for it deals in just two things: Chillies and metal. Big chillies, medium-sized chillies and, fiercest of all, the tiny chillies, draw tears, itches and sneezes. Chillies are a staple commodity in the markets There is a deafening cacophony as old metal is bashed from rusty, useless scraps into shiny cutlery, hairpins, gates, gutters and religious artefacts.  ""I am rewinding the metal,"" says a man as he bangs out a large serving dish from an old oil drum.  The market is basically a giant recycling centre and represents the country's fierce spirit of ""self-reliance"", a phrase I hear often in Eritrea. Eritrean metal worker: ""I am rewinding the metal.""  This culture started during the 30-year war of independence from Ethiopia, when rebels produced almost everything they needed in underground factories, including clothes, shoes and medicine.  It endured after Eritrea won the war in 1991, with the country periodically expelling aid agencies, saying they promoted dependency.  Unlike most African countries, there is a lack of large UN and NGO land cruisers zooming around the place. Although education up to tertiary level is free, young Eritreans are not free to pursue their own dream careers. They become locked into a system of obligatory national service, mainly in civilian roles, and have no idea when they will be released. In the spice and metal market, a man proudly shows me a storage container he has made from broken bits of mirror and steel. ""I have been in national service for nine years. The pay is very low - less than $50 [£37]a month - so I supplement it by working here."" Eritrea came third bottom in the United Nations Human Development Index for 2015. Time and again, I hear similar stories of people doing two or even three jobs to make ends meet.  On the plane to Asmara, I meet a man who imports mobile phones, televisions and satellite dishes from Dubai.  ""I have been in national service for 12 years. But I sort of 'dropped out' to become a trader."" More from Mary Harper: Could Eritrea come in from the cold? Africa's modernist enigma Eritrea celebrates 25 years of independence after war with Ethiopia Eritrea in pictures National service has another economic effect, as it is one of the main reasons so many young Eritreans flee their country for Europe, draining the country of much of its productive workforce.  However, if they get there safely, instead of dying in the desert or drowning in the sea on the way, many end up as ""useful"" members of the diaspora, sending money home.  In 2005, remittances were estimated to account for about a third of Eritrea's GDP.  ""However, that figure is plunging. The diaspora is now spending the money on helping people leave Eritrea instead of supporting relatives at home,"" says one official. Busha mine workers - although potentially lucrative mining doesn't generate much employment The Eritrean authorities used to be quite happy for disaffected youth to leave, says a diplomat.  A potential threat to stability was out of the way, and they were likely to end up sending remittances.  But, the diplomat says, the country now faces a serious capacity shortage and is doing more to encourage them to stay.  Hagos Ghebrehiwet, the economic adviser to the president, says the amount paid to those in national service is increasing from about $50 to $130-$300 a month, depending on education levels.  Government ministers tell me they earn about $200 a month, plus some allowances.  Most of the complaints I hear in Eritrea are about the skyrocketing cost of living, plus chronic shortages of electricity and water.  Depending on their size, families receive a certain quantity of basic foodstuffs, such as cereals, oil and sugar, at highly reduced prices. But other items cost a lot. For example, a litre of milk costs more than $2.  Business people, including taxi drivers, shopkeepers and hoteliers, say their incomes have halved since a new form of currency was introduced at the end of last year in an attempt to control smuggling, the parallel market and human trafficking. They complain that restrictions on imports and tight limits on the amount of money they can withdraw from banks are strangling their businesses. Shops selling imported goods can be expensive, with a single nappy costing more than $1 and a small tube of toothpaste nearly $2 Finance Minister Berhane Habtemariam says people were given six weeks to swap their old notes for new ones, at par.  ""We had no choice. The coffers of our banks were literally empty. When people came to exchange their notes, they had to explain how they had earned the money.  ""As so much of it was illegal, only 40% of the old notes were handed in, leading to a 60% contraction in the money supply."" The introduction of the new notes has had an impact on the parallel market. The fixed exchange rate has remained at 15 Eritrean nakfa for $1, but Eritreans say they now only receive about 18-20 nakfa for the dollar on the unofficial market, instead of nearly 60.  It is very difficult to work out what is going on in Eritrea's economy because the government does not release figures for its GDP and other key indicators. ""We have not given out any information about our budget for seven years because our enemies will use it against us,"" says the finance minister. Despite this secretive behaviour and the allegations of human rights abuses in the labour force, there are signs of growing interest from foreign investors. Some have been in Eritrea for years, such as the Italian-run Dolce Vita garment factory in Asmara.  The mainly Eritrean workforce makes designer shirts for Giorgio Armani and Pierre Cardin, as well as uniforms for Italian scouts and jeans for the local market. The Italian-run Dolce Vita garment factory has been a familiar sight in Asmara for years Another hope for the Eritrean economy is mining.  Canada's Nevsun, in joint venture with the government, began producing gold at Bisha mine in 2011. The mine also exploits copper and zinc deposits.  Human rights groups criticised Bisha for using conscripts during the construction phase, but Nevsun and the government deny national service labour is used in commercial mining. Nevsun says Bisha contributed about $800m (£550m) to the Eritrean economy in its first five years of operation. A Chinese mining company has recently started operations, and two more mines are expected to come online in the next few years. But mining, although potentially lucrative, does not generate much employment. Canada's Nevsun says the Bisha mine contributed $800m to the Eritrean economy in its first five years of operation The population is predominantly rural, working the harsh, dry land. But Eritreans and foreign investors are looking towards the country's 1,200km (745-mile) Red Sea coastline, with its hundreds of unspoiled islands, rich fish stocks and ports, all of which have significant economic potential. Whether any of this will be realised will depend on two main factors. Eritrea's willingness to adopt a more flexible attitude towards its economy, and foreign investors' readiness to engage with a country that has recently been accused of crimes against humanity and has spent years in international isolation. Nation of between 3.5 million and 6 million (the figures are disputed) on Red Sea - one of Africa's poorest countries One-party state - no functioning constitution or independent media  Former Italian colony, later formed loose federation with Ethiopia  1962 - Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie dissolved Eritrean parliament, seized Eritrea Eritrean separatists - the Eritrean People's Liberation Front - fought guerrilla war until 1991, when they captured capital Asmara Eritrea voted for independence in 1993 May 1998 border dispute with Ethiopia led to two-year war costing 100,000 lives  Still no peace settlement - thousands of troops face each other along 1,000km (620-mile) border Could Eritrea come in from the cold?

economic indicators,Tunisia's president - saviour or usurper of power?,2024-09-15,2022-07-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-62244847,"As Tunisia's president asks voters to approve on Monday a new constitution that gives him greater powers, North Africa analyst Magdi Abdelhadi looks at the man seen by his supporters as a saviour and by his opponents as a usurper of power.  President Kais Saied clearly feels that he is a man of destiny. Although his authoritarian streak is neither unique nor new to Tunisia or the region, his academic credentials and rhetorical style separate him by a long distance from all other Arab autocrats.  Delivering his speeches in impeccable classical Arabic, often adlibbed, at a considered pace, the former law professor conveys a sense of a man who weighs his words carefully, with clear focus and vision and ironclad determination. Despite mounting criticism both at home and abroad since he assumed total power in Tunisia a year ago, he has continued undeterred to his, and his alone, desired destination. This may very well be part of his appeal to many Tunisians.  Tunisia was the birthplace of the Arab Spring, which saw the overthrow of long-serving ruler Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.  But after more than a decade of political instability, which saw 10 governments come and go and endless squabbles in parliament, at times degenerating into violence, many Tunisians have simply grown sick of this ""democracy"",  which brought no tangible improvement to their quality of life. On the contrary, the economy was in free fall, with all economic indicators pointing in the wrong direction: inflation and unemployment up, foreign debt up, and the value of the Tunisian dinar has plunged. And things got much worse as the Covid pandemic struck,  and even more so after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the impact it had on food and energy prices.  Mr Saied is not against the Tunisian revolution, at least that is what he says in public. Rather, he sees himself as the man of the people, who ""corrects"" the path of the revolution.  But the word ""correction"" - tassheeh in Arabic - has a notorious history in Arab politics. It has often been deployed to justify power-grabs.   Characteristically, the leader of ""the correction"" is motivated by selflessness and a profound sense of the weight of history upon his shoulders. He wants to set history right.  Mr Saied's constitution enshrines that narrative.  Speaking in the name of the Tunisian people, who have not been consulted in any significant way in its drafting, the draft constitution says: ""Out of a sense of profound historic responsibility to correct the path of the [2011] revolution and the path of history itself, that is what happened on July 25 2021.""  That is the day President Saied sacked the government, suspended the parliament and embarked on his single-handed mission to redesign the country's political future.  Critics say he's taking Tunisia back to where it was before the 2011 Arab spring - outright autocracy.   We will soon find out whether the Tunisians will endorse that narrative and back Mr Saied's authoritarianism.  In fact, Tunisians are not alone in expressing disappointment with democracy. Disillusionment with the ability of a democratic system of government to tackle economic hardships is part of a wider trend of perceptions in North Africa and the Middle East.  According to a recent survey, 81% of Tunisians prefer a strong leader, and 77% are more interested in effective government than the form it takes.  There is a broad consensus among most observers that the new constitution reverses many of the democratic gains of the 2014 constitution that has been de facto annulled by Mr Saied. He has ruled by decrees since July last year.    As has been widely anticipated, Mr Saied's constitution is designed to give greater powers to the president and far less of it to the elected parliament.  This is a reversal of the balance of power between the two institutions as it was established in the 2014 constitution.  Crucially, it sets no curbs on presidential powers. There is no way of impeaching him in parliament or by any other institution.  Further, it is the president who selects the prime minister and the ministers, and he can dismiss them. He can also dissolve parliament as it seeks to withdraw confidence from the government. The new constitution also undermines the independence of the judiciary - a cornerstone of a democratic system. In short, it takes Tunisia back to the presidential system it had since independence with an emasculated parliament that has limited oversight powers. But the draft does introduce some real innovation - not just for Tunisia, but for the entire region. It removes the clause, found in most constitutions in the Arab world, that stipulates that Islam is the religion of the state and puts the relationship between religion and the state on a new trajectory. Instead,  the document says that ""Tunisia is part of the Islamic nation, and only the state has to work to achieve the objectives of Islam"". These are defined as protecting the individual's life, integrity, wealth, religion and freedom - no reference here to Sharia (Islamic law),  which has been the main rallying cry of Islamism everywhere.  And Islam is defined not in the narrow terms of Sharia's legal code, but in such broad terms that make it potentially compatible with democratic values, which Muslim reformers have long called for. This could effectively criminalise the use of religion by any political group, and thus undercut the powerful Islamist movement, Ennahda. But it is very likely to appeal to secularists.  Some of the strongest criticism of Mr Saied and his constitution have focused on the drafting process itself, which was neither transparent nor inclusive. It was put together by a group handpicked academics. The public online consultation that was announced earlier this year has failed to attract large number of Tunisians - only 500,000, some 5% or so of the electorate. Crucially, neither the constitution nor the president have specified the criteria for considering the document has secured wide public support.  No threshold for approving the document, nor a minimum turnout have been stipulated.  Several parties - including the biggest block in the dissolved parliament, Ennahda - have called for a boycott. But opposition to Mr Saied has never managed to mount an effective campaign to rally the public against the president or force him to change course. All eyes will be on the turnout. A big turn out with a yes vote could cement Mr Saied's power.  A low turnout or a no vote could plunge him and Tunisia in a deeper constitutional crisis.  Although he has been democratically elected with some 70% of the vote in 2019,  failure to secure resounding popular support could further undermine his legitimacy and will most likely embolden his enemies to challenge him."
economic indicators,Treasury refuses to publish UK economic forecast,2024-09-15,2022-09-20,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62970803,"The Treasury is refusing to publish a forecast of the UK's economic outlook alongside this Friday's mini-Budget.  Independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has already provided a draft to Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, the BBC understands. The Treasury Select Committee says a forecast is ""vital"" given recent government moves to curb living costs. Action to cap annual energy bills could cost about £150bn, and tax cuts are expected on Friday. The mini-Budget is expected to see the government reverse a rise in National Insurance and scrap a planned increase in corporation tax, which reports say could cost £30bn. The draft forecast the OBR has provided does not include the impact of the energy bill help. It has offered to provide a forecast including this impact, but that has been rejected. The fact the offer has not been taken up is raising some concerns about whether the government's tax and spending policy is ""flying blind"", given predictions that the UK is facing a lengthy recession.  MPs on the Treasury Select Committee wrote to the chancellor on Tuesday seeking assurance that an OBR forecast would be published. ""These forecasts are a vital indicator of the health of the nation's finances, and provide reassurance and confidence to international markets and investors,"" said the committee's chairman, Mel Stride. ""There has been a deterioration in our economic outlook since the last OBR forecast in March. There have been significant fiscal interventions since then and we are told there will be further significant interventions including major permanent tax cuts to be announced on Friday. ""Under these circumstances, it is vital that an independent OBR forecast is provided."" The OBR is obliged to produce economic forecasts twice a year, usually accompanying the Autumn Budget and Spring Statement.  On Friday, there will be no independent assessment about whether permanent tax cuts and some one-off spending increases are consistent with the government's Budget rules.  The lack of OBR forecast also means it will not cast judgement on the impact of the new tax measures on growth - a key target for the government which wants to increase the trend rate of growth to 2.5%. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: ""Given the exceptional circumstances our country faces, we have moved at immense speed to provide significant energy bill support for households and businesses, and are acting swiftly to set out further plans to kickstart economic growth later this week. ""We remain committed to maintaining the usual two forecasts in this fiscal year, as is required."" In its latest long-term forecast in July, the OBR said trend growth had fallen from 2.2% to 1.4%, partly because of a declining size of the workforce. In the City, where in recent weeks the value of the pound sterling has fallen and the cost of borrowing for the UK government has risen, there is some expectation that the Treasury will imminently have to formally increase its ""remit"" for borrowing.  The Financing Remit is given to the Debt Management Office based on a forecast for borrowing. Extra sales of government loans, known as gilts, also need to be co-ordinated with the Bank of England, which is planning to sell off some of the gilts it owns, as it starts to reverse its long-running programme of stimulus. Government insiders say that the main motivation behind Friday's announcements is to enact the PM's leadership campaign promises as quickly as possible, and that a full forecast will accompany an upcoming Budget statement.  The cost of the energy package, for example, could vary considerably depending on market prices for gas, and the ability of the government to renegotiate expensive contracts for renewable energy."
economic indicators,A tale of two femicides - and media bias,2024-09-15,2022-05-15,By Megha Mohan and Amalia Zatari,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60648239,"The media prefers some female murder victims to others - one killing gets blanket coverage, while another is quickly dismissed. But crimes of femicide - when a woman is killed because of her gender - may at least be counted more accurately, if the UN can persuade countries to use a new, expanded framework for identifying cases. On 5 Jun 2021, the day before she was murdered, Alexandra Inshina told her friend that she was in love.  That Saturday afternoon, as she sunbathed with her friend Yulia by a lake in Beryozovsky, a small town east of the Ural Mountains in Russia, Alexandra was excited. It had been a few years since her divorce and Alexandra had settled into life as a 35-year-old single mother to a 10-year-old boy. There was much to be happy about. She was already a team leader at the car parts factory where she worked, and two days earlier, she had booked a holiday in Egypt for her and her son.  And now the fizz of new love. A man from the nearby city of Yekaterinburg, whom she would be meeting for a date that evening, was making life a little bit more interesting.  As she spoke, her phone vibrated with a text message. It was him but it wasn't good news. He wasn't sure he would be free, after all. The text seemed like a brush-off. ""She was upset by it,"" Yulia says. The women stayed by the lake together, talking about the unreliability of men, until eight in the evening when they left for their respective homes, promising to check in with each other, as usual, the following day. Alexandra returned to an empty flat, as her son was spending the weekend with her parents. Later, Alexandra made a decision. She would go to Yekaterinburg after all, to an English-themed all-night pub, the Rosy Jane. At 01:30 she ordered a taxi. CCTV footage shows that by 03:00 she was at the pub, alone. Alexandra texted her boyfriend inviting him to join her. ""I'm such a moron,"" he later told Yulia, devastated with guilt. ""I didn't reply."" At 05:00 Alexandra left, and was approached by a man in a car who was moonlighting as a taxi driver. At first she refused to get in, CCTV pictures show, then changed her mind.  ""I think by that time maybe she was tired. She just wanted to get home,"" says Yulia. Thirty minutes later Alexandra Inshina had been stabbed six times, her hands tied behind her back. It would be two days before her body was discovered among nettles and bushes in woods about 25 miles away. ""What a terrible, hateful death,"" another friend, Marina, tells the BBC. Six years before she was killed, Olga told friends that she wanted to be on TV. She was 21 and glamorous, and had just moved to Russia's capital from the western city of Bryansk, leaving her daughter, whom she'd had as a teenager, in her mother's care. In Moscow, Olga attracted admirers. She did some part-time modelling and experimented with her look, dying her naturally dark hair blonde. She told her neighbour, Dmitry, that she wanted to be on Dom-2, a reality TV show based on Big Brother. She also taught children gymnastics at a community hall, and would show Dmitry videos of the kids happily swinging from the rings. At weekends her daughter sometimes visited, and they would document their trips around the city on social media. In several photos Olga cuddles her then eight-year-old daughter into a deep cheek-to-cheek hug, the two laughing with crinkled eyes into the camera. Olga captioned them, ""my baby"".  ""Olga was very sweet. Very innocent,"" says Dmitry. ""You would never have guessed what would happen next in her life.""   Dmitry lost touch with Olga when she moved out of his area but two years later, in July 2020, he came across photos of her on VKontakte, Russia's most popular social media site. ""Grandpa kills 27-year-old prostitute near Moscow,"" read one headline.  It's not clear when Olga became involved in prostitution - it's not an aspect of her life she shared with friends. The BBC spoke to three of them, who are certain this was a road she walked on her way to becoming a TV star, possibly introduced to it through someone in the modelling world. They guess she would have been told it was elite escort work that might lead to a high-profile opportunity in entertainment, which was always her dream. One described her as ""very lovely, very naive and very trusting"". On the day she was murdered, 20 July 2020, Olga had a profile on an online escort site where she went by the name Margo.  A 53-year-old former convict, Oleg Tochilkin - who had been released on parole after serving part of a 20-year prison sentence for crimes including murder and domestic violence - clicked on Olga's profile and invited her to his rented flat in Mytishchi, north-east of Moscow. Court documents seen by the BBC from Mytishchi City Court say that after an argument Tochilkin battered and strangled Olga. He then moved her naked body outside the flat, dumping it at the entrance to the building, where it was discovered hours later.  Alexandra's murderer, Marat Imashev, was also an ex-convict, who had been freed after serving a total of 28 years in jail for crimes including murder, rape, robbery, fraud and more than 10 attacks on women. It took about a week for the police to find him, and that they did was due in no small part to the story going viral, say Alexandra's friends.  The friends mobilised search parties the day after Alexandra went missing, when she failed to pick up her son from her mother's or turn up to work. ""​​She was very fun and very lively but was also a very responsible person,"" says her friend, Marina. ""She would never, under any circumstances, not turn up for work. If she was sick, she may knock back some medicine but she'd always go in."" The friends also set up community pages on VKontakte, and WhatsApp groups where they communicated all day, every hour. They contacted the media early and ensured constant news coverage.  Alexandra became ""the young Blonde of Beryozovsky"", the ""missing mother"" - the stories are now archived under the tag ""blonde murder"". Marina says she found it strange that her friend was marketed this way, but the press coverage was effective.  When the killer was caught, he initially said he had dropped Alexandra off at a cafe, but later confessed to stealing her jewellery and stabbing her. He is now pleading guilty to murder in a trial that began on 7 April. Asked by a journalist how he felt, he replied ""I repent"" and turned away. It was easy to give prominent coverage of Alexandra's story, says Anastasia Rovnushkina, a journalist for E1 News in Russia, because she resonated so well with the public. The story over-performed on the website and spread fast on social media.  ""Alexandra was young, very beautiful, very popular, very responsible,"" she says. ""Her murder was shockingly cruel because she was killed by a person who had been convicted of many crimes previously and had spent nearly 30 years in prison. He killed a woman because women are easier to kill. ""Alexandra was a normal young woman, a mother, she could have been any of us."" Olga was also young and popular, and mother to a daughter who was just a year older than Alexandra's son. She was also killed by a man who had served years in prison for violence against women. But her death prompted far less interest and sympathy from the public. One headline read, ""Do you feel sorry for this kind of victim of violence?"" Another was, ""The bloody details of how a prostitute from Bryansk was killed"". And there was the one that called Olga a ""whore"" and referred to her killer as ""grandpa"". As in Alexandra's case, some reports also reduced her to ""the blonde"". Olga's mother told the BBC that the reporting caused significant pain to the family, in particular to Olga's then 11-year-old daughter.  The news sites that filed on Olga's murder did not return our calls for comment. Moscow's RenTV said that they could not remember the case, or which journalist they had assigned to it.  Anastasia Rovnushkina, who reported on Alexandra Inshina's murder for E1 News, suggests that the circumstances of Olga's death explain the different coverage. ""The media reflect the values of our audience. And when it comes to cases surrounding sex workers, the logic goes that if you choose a criminal path like that, then that's your choice. It's against the law in Russia and it's presumed that you are facing much higher risks in that work,"" she says. ""But if you're an ordinary person, like any of us, then I think the language used by the media for you is different. Any of us could find ourselves in the situation Alexandra was in, but most can't imagine being in the shoes of a sex worker.""  Now working in London, she adds ""and it is the same in UK media. It is the same everywhere."" Femicide has been defined in various ways. Sometimes it is described as the killing of a woman, because she is a woman. Russian researcher Lyubava Malysheva defines it as the killing of a woman by a man who knows he is killing a woman. What all definitions have in common is the idea that the victim's gender is a factor in her death. Until recently the UN would not have classified either Alexandra's or Olga's death as femicide, as it only recognised cases where the killer was an intimate partner or family member. But in March, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) put forward an expanded framework that acknowledges strangers also commit the crime.  A murder should be regarded as femicide when it meets any of a number of conditions, the framework says, for example if the killer displayed hatred for the woman because of her gender and identity, if the body of the victim was disposed of in a public space (as Alexandra's was), or if the victim was working in a vulnerable profession such as the sex industry (like Olga). ""We are expanding the framework now because we have realised that we're not counting all the women that have been killed because they were women,"" says Angela Me, the chief of UNODC Statistics and Surveys. It's an important moment, she says, because if countries follow the framework ""we will for the first time be able to measure global femicide."" She says she hopes it will also serve as an equaliser for murdered women, freeing them from narratives projected on to them by the media.  ""It's to ensure that every woman is counted as a victim, regardless of whether they are a mother, or a sex worker, their social or economic status."" So far 95 countries have been approached to adopt the new framework, including the UK, Brazil, South Korea and Russia. If they do, it will become clearer how well or badly each country is tackling the problem. But that is where it will end. The framework will not advise countries to change their laws. Campaigners doubt Russia will even collect the data. Up to now this task has been carried out only by a single dedicated volunteer, Lyubava Malysheva, using Russian news websites as her sources. Sixty Google alerts ping to notify her of a new article, and she reads between 500 and 1,000 a day, adding the names of any murdered women to her website, Femicid.Net. In 2021 she recorded 1,312 cases. In 2022 so far there have been 425. ""Femicide is a problem across all of Russian society, affecting all Russian women,"" Ms Malysheva says, ""and the government refuses to acknowledge that there is a problem."" Moscow-based lawyer Mari Davtyan agrees, pointing out that in Russian law there are no restraining orders or compulsory anger management training for men who display violent tendencies.  ""The horror of all this is that no-one is keeping control of men who have a history of gender-related violence. These men go on to repeat these crimes over and over again."" This was true for the killers of Alexandra and Olga. Both were jailed, both were released, and both killed again. The women lived in different cities and had different ambitions, but according to their friends Alexandra and Olga shared many qualities. Both were lively personalities with contagious, loud, laughs. They were helpful and reliable friends. They were most happy when with their children - who both currently live with their loving and devastated grandmothers. And both women's friends are adamant that when those children grow up and seek answers, despite what may have been written in the press, they will learn from those who knew and loved their mothers that the women were victims of an urgent social problem, and were not to blame in any way for their deaths.

economic indicators,Brexit 'major feature' of private sector dip,2024-09-15,2019-04-08,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-47851368,"Northern Ireland's private sector saw its first monthly fall in output in almost three years in March, research from Ulster Bank suggests. Its chief economist said Brexit-related uncertainty was a ""major feature."" ""Export orders and employment levels dropped at their fastest rate in almost six years and firms are increasingly pessimistic about the year ahead,"" said Richard Ramsey. The bank conducts a monthly survey of private sector activity. It is considered a reliable indicator of the economy. Manufacturing was the only sector to see output growth in March though Mr Ramsey suggested stockpiling was likely a factor. Equivalent research covering the whole of the UK suggested stockpiling was rising at its fastest rate in 27 years. Mr Ramsey said Brexit-related uncertainty was ""becoming more and more tangible"" but said it was not the only factor in weaker performance with EU export markets also slowing. ""Germany, for instance, is seeing manufacturing activity falling at a rapid rate,"" he said. The economic effects of the Brexit vote have been hotly debated. Brexit supporters point to the fact that a Treasury prediction in 2016 that a vote to leave would cause ""an immediate and profound economic shock"" simply did not happen.  Instead the UK economy has continued to grow, albeit slowly. However some analysts say the data shows the Brexit vote has had a negative effect, notably due to increased inflation caused by the weaker pound. Recent research from the Resolution Foundation concludes the UK has underperformed with regards to pre-referendum expectations, while global growth over the period outperformed pre-referendum expectations. It found that real household disposable income was £1,500 a year lower than the Office for Budget Responsibility's pre-referendum forecast - with more than half of this income hit due to higher than forecast inflation."
economic indicators,NI unemployment rates back to pre-pandemic levels,2024-09-15,2022-04-12,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-61077671,"The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland fell back to its pre-pandemic level at the start of this year, official figures suggest. The rate in the period December-February was 2.5%, a significant fall of 1 percentage point over the year and 0.6 percentage points over the quarter. It is just slightly above the all-time low of 2.3% recorded in 2019. Other figures also suggest that the jobs market continued to recover in the first quarter of 2022. HMRC figures suggest 775,000 people were on company payrolls in March, a 0.1% increase on February and 4.8% higher than March 2021. That is the 10th consecutive month that employee numbers have been above pre-Covid levels. All regions of the UK saw payrolls increase over the year to March 2022, with London recording the largest increase (7%) and the Scotland recording the smallest (4.1%).  Northern Ireland recorded a similar increase to the UK average (4.8% and 4.9% respectively). On a longer timeframe from March 2020 to March 2022, all regions of the UK also recorded an average 2% increase in payrolled employees. Northern Ireland recorded the largest increase (3%). However, the recovery is not complete. Total hours worked, self-employment and the overall employment rate are still below pre-pandemic levels in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) said: ""Employee indicators remain positive with the number of payrolled employees and level of payroll earnings above the pre-pandemic level, while the latest unemployment rate marks a return to the pre-pandemic rate.  ""Employment levels (which includes self-employment) and total hours worked have yet to return to pre-pandemic levels and similarly claimant count and economic inactivity both remain above."""
economic indicators,What's knocked markets off course?,2024-09-15,2018-12-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46515773,"Just a few months ago, US financial markets seemed headed for a third year in a row of hefty increases. But shares have tumbled since October, retreating to lower levels than at the start of the year.  That decline continued on Friday, as weak economic data in Europe and China sparked a late afternoon sell-off, sending all three major US share indexes lower. The Nasdaq dropped almost 2.3%, the Dow fell 2% and the S&P 500 sank 1.9%. For those invested in US stocks, the double-digit gains in seven of the last 10 years may still feel pretty good. But as Wall Street debate turns to just when a recession might begin, many investors are bracing for a rough patch.  What's behind the shift in sentiment? At their peaks this year, the Dow and S&P 500 were up about 8% since the start of 2018. The Nasdaq had increased 15%. But the stock market surge was always a bit suspect. It outpaced other economic measures by a large margin and was driven by the tech sector, which accounted for roughly half of the gains on the S&P 500 up until mid-August of this year. Now some of the biggest winners - such as Apple and Facebook - have stumbled, dragging down the markets and making the weakness elsewhere more visible. All three indexes are off 10% from their earlier peaks - a decline often considered a correction. Until tech recovers, a broader market bounce is unlikely, said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. ""Looking to 2019, volatility is likely to represent the norm rather than the exception,"" he says. ""By many measures, the degree of investment difficulty is on the rise.""  US central bankers have been raising interest rates since 2015, moving away from the unusually low rates put in place during the financial crisis as economic growth rebounds. Analysts are worried about how much more expensive borrowing might get - and whether companies and households will be able to handle the increased costs. Fears have been tempered recently by signals from the US Fed suggesting it may enact fewer rates rises in 2019 than previously expected. But some still worry about the risks from corporate debt levels, which have hit historic highs - with an increasing percentage of the loans made to companies with already large debt loads. US growth is expected to slow to 2.5% in 2019, down from about 3% this year, according to the IMF and Federal Reserve. Some closely watched industries and financial indicators are already flashing warning signs of a more serious contraction. In October, sales of existing homes had fallen more than 5% compared to 2017. Construction spending has started to slip and growth in consumer spending been less robust than expected. Meanwhile, business optimism is in retreat. Indeed, nearly half of US financial officers believe the nation's economy will enter a recession by the end of 2019, a recent Duke University survey found. Investors loved US President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts. But his trade policy has them tied up in knots. In March, Mr Trump ordered tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium, as well as on billions of dollars worth in annual trade from China. He's threatened more, including on foreign cars. The tariffs have already raised costs for US companies - and economists warn they threaten to slow growth, adding to recession worries. Markets aren't sure about White House strategy, and an ongoing investigation of Mr Trump's election campaign ties to Russia has only added to uncertainty emanating from Washington. ""If these investigations produce some sort of smoking gun that throws us into a constitutional crisis, that might prove destabilising,"" says Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities. The IMF expects the global economy to expand 3.7% in 2019, but the growth has become more uneven. The US Federal Reserve recently flagged issues in Europe, China and emerging markets as some of the biggest threats to the American economy, with Brexit high on the list. Indeed, as much as US indexes are down, financial markets elsewhere have dropped even farther.  The Global Dow is down around nearly 9% so far this year, and the MSCI world index is down about 8%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index has fallen about 6%; Hong Kong's Hang Seng index is about 13% lower in 2018. The Shanghai Composite has dropped more than 20%. The Stoxx Europe 600 is off almost 11%. France's CAC 40 has dropped almost 9%, London's FTSE 100 has declined nearly 11%. and Germany's DAX is down more than 15%. So stormy seas likely lie ahead."
economic indicators,Trade disputes settlement system facing crisis,2024-09-15,2019-12-08,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50681431,"The World Trade Organization is facing a crisis in its system for resolving disputes between its members.  It has an appeal ""court"" that is the final arbiter on such disputes and which is about to become unable to function.  WTO rules say three judges have to hear each case. On 10 December the number goes below that level. Only one will be left. The terms of the other two come to an end, and no replacements have been chosen.  In fact there isn't even a process under way to find any. The reason is that the US has refused to allow the recruitment of new judges. Other WTO member countries have repeatedly proposed to start a selection procedure. At the end of November more than 100 members called for that but the US alone said no. It's the only country that has objected at any stage during this stand-off.  In the quarter of a century since the WTO was established, its system for settling disputes has been one of its main functions. A former director general Pascal Lamy has called the system the WTO's crown jewel. It has also been described as ""probably the busiest international dispute settlement system in the world"". But it is now in danger of seizing up. Not quite completely - there may some options for countries to work around the absence of an appeal court, or the Appellate Body to give its official title, but they are second-best and may not be accepted by some countries.  What is the US's objection? Perhaps the biggest issue is that the US accuses the WTO dispute system of ""judicial overreach"" - essentially that it interprets the WTO rules in a way that creates new obligations for WTO members.  One area that particularly grates in Washington is dumping, when a foreign supplier sells goods abroad more cheaply than at home.  The US and others have used a disputed method for assessing whether goods have been dumped and how much the price is below what it should be.  It is known as ""zeroing"". It's not explicitly prohibited by the WTO rules, but the Appellate Body took the view that it was in effect against the spirit.   Yet it is not just about specific cases; it is a general concern that the US has about the rulings going too far, that they in effect create new WTO law.  The US also has some concerns about procedural issues, such as the Appellate Body not issuing its rulings as quickly as it is supposed to, and judges continuing to hear cases they have already started even after their terms have ended. And it is not just the current US administration led by President Trump that has had this concern.   A recent statement by the US delegation at a WTO meeting stated: ""For more than 16 years and across multiple US administrations, the United States has been raising serious concerns with the Appellate Body's overreaching and disregard for the rules set by WTO members."" It is not even the first time that a US administration has been uncooperative on Appellate Body appointments. Under President Obama, the US opposed a second term for a South Korean judge and even for an American chosen by a previous administration.  But on those earlier occasions, the US did not block the appointment of new judges. Critics thought the US then was damaging the credibility of the WTO's dispute system,  but it did not stop it functioning. It is also true that some of the US concerns are shared by other WTO members. But none of them appear to believe that disabling the appeal system is the right way forward.   This time the US is raising the stakes.  President Trump is far less accepting of the WTO than his predecessors were. He has threatened to pull the US out of the organisation and has claimed on Fox News that the WTO was set up ""to benefit everybody but us"", adding, ""we lose the lawsuits, almost all of the lawsuits in the WTO.""  That is not actually true but the remark is an indicator of how much he evidently dislikes the WTO. And President Trump's approach to the WTO has been described as part of an ""assault on the global trading system"".   Other elements in this approach include action against China without having first got a ruling from the WTO's dispute system, and tariffs on steel and aluminium imports imposed ostensibly on the grounds of national security, but seen by many commentators as motivated by a desire to protect US producers from competition.   The prospective incapacitation of the Appellate body is certainly a problem for the WTO and its dispute settlement system. The first stage ruling is not binding on the countries involved if one of them appeals. So if there is an appeal, the dispute is in effect on hold indefinitely and countries can't get authorisation to retaliate.  But that doesn't mean it can't function at all. Countries can choose not to appeal. They can agree alternative steps for conducting appeals by arbitration. There is also the fact that WTO members are still subject to the rules, even if the enforcement mechanism is impaired. The risk of harming their reputation may act as some sort of partial restraint on violations of the rules.  There is also other work done by the WTO which will continue, such as help for developing countries in building up their capacity to benefit from trade, monitoring of members' policies and negotiation. So the impending loss of the appeal function does not mean the WTO will run off the road altogether. But it does mean it won't be firing on all cylinders. "
economic indicators,Why has Wales under-performed in school tests?,2024-09-15,2019-12-02,By Bethan Lewis,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-50587348,"The latest international test results for teenagers - Pisa - have been published. There is a keen eye on how students in Wales have performed, but why? Here is our guide. Pisa's full title is Programme for International Student Assessment - the main tests are in maths, reading and science and are run every three years by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Tests take about two hours and all are done on computer. In 2018, they were taken by 600,000 15-year-old pupils in 79 countries and regions. In the last results, Singapore outperformed all other participating countries. Japan, Estonia, Hong Kong and Canada were also among the top performers. This time around, four Chinese provinces finished top in all areas. This was the fifth time Wales has taken part - results in 2010 saw Wales slip below average performance in all three subject areas and was described by the then-education minister as ""unacceptable"" and ""alarming"".  But the 2018 tests have brought improvements, if Wales is still trailing England in particular, of the other UK nations.  Wales has moved closer to the international average. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said: ""We have caught up, we are continuing to improve in all areas and as a nation we must be determined to keep up this momentum."" In reading, latest tests showed a significant increase in the scores of higher achieving pupils in Wales since 2015 but the scores of lower achieving pupils have not changed significantly.  In science, back in 2015, there were 28 countries with mean scores higher than Wales; that figure is now 19 countries. The study also said Wales had made ""encouraging progress"" in mathematics, and was close to the OECD average for the first time.  There is no single reason, but one factor identified by the OECD was the need improve the quality of teaching. Former education minister Leighton Andrews said the Welsh Government may have taken its ""eye off the ball"" in the 2000s when it scrapped testing and league tables.  The report into the 2015 tests found only 6% of the variation in student performance in Wales could be put down to their socio-economic background. The results also showed Wales' highest performers were achieving lower scores than the OECD average and top performers in other parts of the UK.   Andreas Schleicher, head of education and skills at the OECD, said the nation had under-performed and the education system had ""lost its soul"" by not focusing on high-quality teaching. He said reforms in Wales were on the right lines but it will take a while for these to have an impact. They have become an increasingly influential indicator of global education performance since they were introduced in 2000. Some argue that major businesses look at Pisa scores before making investment decisions, but there are plenty of sceptics who say too much emphasis has been placed on Pisa by politicians.  There are also questions about how useful it is to compare 15-year-olds in such varied education systems and cultures across the world. In Wales, ministers have made improving Pisa scores a top priority over the past decade and said they tested the skills young people will need in future. Education is going through a period of major reforms, many of which have been influenced by Pisa. Some were introduced after the 2010 results, including a renewed focus on literacy and numeracy. There have also been changes to teacher training.  Reformed GCSEs are also more aligned with the skills Pisa tests assess. The last results highlighted concerns more able and talented pupils were not being stretched so the Welsh Government has invested £3m to boost their performance. The biggest reform of all is the ongoing development of a new curriculum which will be introduced in classrooms from 2022. The OECD welcomed the changes, but said improvements in results would take time. In Singapore, which had the best performance last time, education expert Dr Pak Tee Ng said it was about resources and investment. ""It's not just about investing money, it is investing in teachers, investing in professional development, investing so that the schools will be places, safe places and places for children to learn and to grow,"" he said. ""Not only that, I think we play a lot of attention to making sure that we have a much more positive narrative of education. That is to say we would like people to know that good things are happening in the schools and to us teachers are nation builders.   ""The right spirit for education should be that for the sake of our children, for the sake of our country, we will improve regardless of where we stand in international comparative tests."" When asked about creating a more positive narrative in Wales, Dr Pak said: ""Let's not make any international comparative tests into some kind of world cup - children's education is not about competition like a world cup of some sorts. ""I would say it is right and proper for any country to improve the education system with or without international comparative tests.""  Prof Alma Harris, head of Swansea University's school of education, said: ""Pisa does exactly what it says on the tin. ""It looks at the performance of 15-year olds in three different subjects every three years but an education system is way more dynamic than that and therefore looking at issues of mental health in young people, well-being, inclusion, equity - these are all things that Pisa can't measure but they're very important to any education system - it's what gives it excellence and equity.  ""So I'd say that Pisa is one dimension, one indicator that we should take account of - of course - policy-makers will take account of it whatever we say - but to recognise that it is really one very small indicator amongst many others that would give a more contextualised picture of how a system is performing. ""Pisa of itself is not problematic, it's what people do with Pisa and how they interpret Pisa and I think where it's been most unhelpful is where it's changed the policy discourse in a country, away from the way the country may have been going."" Prof Harris said Pisa was problematic if it distracted a country from reform and Wales was ""on a very clear reform trajectory."" "
economic indicators,The week ahead in Parliament,2024-09-15,2020-05-15,By Mark D'Arcy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-52677453,"Week four of the virtual Parliament has passed, and since going online, MPs have held innumerable select committee meetings by video link, the Commons has seen the first remote maiden speech, the first remote personal statement, several online divisions (including the first examples of MPs accidentally voting the wrong way) and at least one all-virtual debate - on an innocuous statutory instrument on pension enrolment.  So the lockdown-beating measures to keep Parliament debating and scrutinising and law-making have proved pretty successful - up to a point.  For ministers the problem area is the passage of legislation. Next week two major Brexit bills, the Immigration Bill and the Trade Bill, will have second reading debates, but then what? In normal times they'd go into committee for several weeks of line-by-line scrutiny, but that kind of scrutiny has not been possible for any bill since Easter, because there is no mechanism in place for votes in virtual bill committees - although creating one should be fairly straightforward. This bottleneck matters because the UK's transitional period before leaving the EU single market is due to end on 31 December and there's a lot of heavy-duty legislating to get done. This is one reason for the ministerial enthusiasm for getting back to normal parliamentary operations, or some semblance of them, after the looming Whitsun recess. The other is that many MPs believe the virtual Parliament, while better than nothing, offers only the palest shadow of the proper scrutiny that comes when a crowded chamber can see the whites of a minister's eyes. But others are worried that it would be premature and unsafe to go back to crowded debating chambers and cheek-by-jowl voting lobbies. So they want to stick with remote voting and online contributions to debates, especially for those MPs who may be vulnerable to the virus. And while there are some wheezes that might allow more MPs into the chamber, like reviving the right to address the House from the upper galleries (which would require some extra microphones and cameras to be installed) the implication is that the current provisions look likely to continue until September. One possible change in June is that MPs may resume sitting for four days a week. With the Lords set to resume sitting for four days a week, it would look odd if the Commons did not, especially while ministers are grumbling about a backlog of legislation. They might even start holding Friday debates on private members' bills, where social distancing was practised long before it was fashionable, and there were rarely more than a handful of MPs in the chamber - the first Friday sitting is due on 12 June.  Here's my rundown of the week ahead, with the usual health warning that very significant statements or urgent questions can be dropped into the agenda at short notice - and, equally, other items can disappear. The Wednesday Liaison Committee motion looks a likely candidate for strategic disappearance.     The Commons opens (14:30) with half an hour of Treasury questions, followed by half an hour of Transport questions, and then, quite possibly a crop of post-weekend statements and urgent questions.  Then, four hours (with a 15-minute suspension in the middle) have been allocated to debate the second reading of the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination Bill. This is a major Brexit measure, repealing EU free movement of persons and other related EU-derived rights in UK law, and making EU, EEA and Swiss citizens subject to UK immigration controls. Irish citizens' immigration rights would remain. What the bill does not do is detail the future points-based immigration system, which will come into force after the Brexit transition period. That will be set out by the home secretary in regulations made under the powers in this bill, which will then have to be approved by Parliament.  The smaller opposition parties have put down ritual amendments to refuse a second reading. The Lib Dems say the bill fails to secure the rights of UK citizens to live, work and study in EU member states and the rights of EU citizens to do likewise in the UK. The SNP says the bill fails to respond to the coronavirus pandemic through a coherent system of visa extensions, the scrapping of no recourse to public funds rules, protection of asylum seekers, relief for families impacted by financial thresholds in the immigration rules, release of immigration detainees and stability for employers recruiting from the EEA. Its amendment also calls for a differentiated migration policy or devolution of powers to Scotland and other devolved nations. Interestingly, though, there is no official Labour amendment (the deadline was 17:00 on Thursday 14 May). Instead, there's an amendment proposed by Campaign Group stalwarts like Bell Ribeiro-Addy, Diane Abbott, John McDonnell, Richard Burgon and Dawn Butler, plus the Greens' Caroline Lucas, which argues that the bill ""usurps parliamentary sovereignty by granting excessive powers to the government to make changes to all immigration law with minimal legislative scrutiny and without primary legislation"". The programme motion calls for the bill to have completed Committee Stage consideration by 25 June, opening the way for what could well be an epic Report Stage.  On the virtual Committee Corridor (14:30) Housing, Communities and Local Government takes evidence on progress in removing dangerous cladding from tower blocks, first from activists and then (15:30) from Lord Greenhalgh, Minister of State at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. The Human Rights Committee (which has peers and MPs in its membership) takes evidence on human rights implications of the government's response to Covid-19 (14:30) including from Adele Green, a mother whose son has learning disabilities, and Andrea Attree, a mother of an autistic daughter. Both children are currently detained. Then they hear from Kevin Cleary, Deputy Chief Inspector of Hospitals and lead for mental health and community services at the Care Quality Commission, along with Kate Terroni, the Chief Inspector for Adult Social Care, and from NHS England. The Education Committee (09:30) looks at the impact of Covid-19 on education and children's services, with witnesses from the National Union of Students, the University Alliance and the Office for Students In the Lords (14:30) questions to ministers include former Home Secretary Lord Blunkett on adjusting the restrictions in place for those isolating due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Greens' Baroness Jones on the privacy concerns around the NHS Covid-19 contact tracing app.  Then peers consider the Draft Human Tissue (Permitted Material: Exceptions) (England) Regulations 2020. This is essentially a list of what parts of a dead person's body may not be removed for transplant purposes under the ""deemed consent"" legislation for England, that was passed last year. Among other things it rules out deemed consent for brain transplants. That is followed by a substantial-looking debate on the International response to COVID-19 - with 48 peers already down to speak MPs begin (11:30) with half an hour of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions, followed by mini-question times for the MPs who speak for the Church Commissioners, the House of Commons Commission, the Parliamentary Works Sponsor Body, the Public Accounts Commission and the Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission. After that, expect the customary crop of coronavirus-related ministerial statements. Then MPs move on to the Human Tissue (Permitted Material: Exceptions) (England) Regulations 2020 - the highly sensitive SI debated in the Lords on Monday. That is followed by the Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2014 (Consequential Modification) Order 2020, which will give the courts in Scotland power to make deductions from the benefits paid to an offender to provide support for their victims.  If MPs notice in time, there may also be some interesting action around a Ways and Means Resolution to allow the Finance Bill to include measures to deal with ""disguised remuneration"", the ultra-controversial IR35 tax provisions. Former cabinet minister David Davis has put down a couple of amendments, the first of which would restrict the government's ability to recoup money from affected taxpayers before 2023-4. His second amendment is a technical one, designed to open the way for MPs to put down amendments to the Finance Bill, in a rather limited kind of way - it is based on a resolution governments used to put down as a matter of routine, which talks about it being ""expedient to amend the law with respect to the national debt and the public revenue and to make further provision in connection with finance,"" wording which provided a little wiggle room for the Commons to influence the working of the Budget. It began to go  out of fashion after Gordon Brown as shadow chancellor in the 1990s used it to ferment a successful rebellion against Chancellor Ken Clarke's fuel duty plans.  The day's committee business includes Digital, Culture, Media and Sport hearing from the UK tourism industry about how the sector has been impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak (09:30). Health and Social Care (09:00) takes expert evidence on the management of the coronavirus outbreak, and Foreign Affairs (14:00) hears from former Foreign Secretary Lord Hague and others on the the FCO and the Integrated Review - which the government bills as the most comprehensive review of Britain's position in the world, since the Cold War. Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (14:00) hears from the Food and Drink Federation, the British Meat Processors Association and the Federation of Wholesale Distributors in its continuing inquiry into Covid-19 and food supply In the Lords (11:00) questions include Labour's Baroness Lawrence of Clarendon asking about progress in implementing the recommendations of the Windrush Lessons Learned Review and Lord Dubs on the improvement in air quality and other environmental indicators since Covid-19 restrictions were introduced  The main business is the detailed Committee Stage scrutiny of the Telecommunications Infrastructure (Leasehold Property) Bill, where there are a number of amendments which would reduce a leaseholder's ability to prevent installation of telecoms infrastructure on their property. The Lords Economic Affairs Committee (15:00) hears from Chancellor Rishi Sunak, which should be fun, given that it includes such luminaries as Lord Burns, the former permanent secretary at the Treasury, Lord Skidelsky, the biographer of Keynes, and keeper of the Thatcherite flame Lord Forsyth The Commons begins (11:30) with Scotland questions, followed, at 12:00 by Prime Minister's Question Time. Then there's more heavy-duty Brexit legislation, with the Second Reading of the Trade Bill, which creates a framework for an independent trade policy and a system for embedding new trade agreements into UK law. Expect all kinds of markers to go down on maintaining existing environmental and workers' rights standards. The Green Party's Caroline Lucas is first through the starting gate, with an amendment to decline a Second Reading to the bill because it contains no provisions for transparency during negotiations or for parliamentary oversight of agreements, and ""leaves UK parliamentarians with less influence over trade policy than their counterparts in other states"".   Lurking at the end of the agenda is the latest exciting episode of the controversy over who should chair the Commons Liaison Committee, the super-committee of select committee chairs, which is best known for its twice-yearly sessions questioning the prime minister (although Boris Johnson has yet to appear before it).  The government is proposing to install Sir Bernard Jenkin - not now a current committee chair - to chair the Liaison Committee, and this is being resisted by the chairs from opposition parties, who are proposing that the chair must be ""a current chair of a Select Committee."" Essentially this is about the government not wanting a perceived troublemaker - Jeremy Hunt, Ton Tugendhat - in a prominent position, given the grief the previous chair, Sarah Wollaston, caused them. The sting in the tail is that a motion to appoint Sir Bernard would be amendable, giving a Commons majority the potential ability to install someone else, and establish that person as a pretty powerful parliamentary player. So keep an eye on the increasingly restive Conservative parliamentary fundamentalists - the Peter Bones and Chris Chopes - who may well see this as an opportunity to remind ministers not to take the Commons for granted, and defy the whip to support an alternative candidate. The government will probably have the votes to get its way (including, probably, the whipped votes of the Conservative committee chairs, who're less than ecstatic about this proceeding) but in doing so, it will be installing the person who is supposed to go into bat for the select committee system, so Sir Bernard may find his colleagues eager to test his mettle.  The day's committee business includes the Work and Pensions Committee (09:30) on the DWP's response to the coronavirus outbreak, with witnesses from the TUC, the Salvation Army, the Prince's Trust and others. Transport (09:30) hears from Unite the Union, the British Air Line Pilots Association and minister Kelly Tolhurst on the transport ramifications of the pandemic, and in the afternoon, the Treasury Committee (14:00) takes evidence from top brass at the Bank of England, including governor Andrew Bailey and members of the Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates.  In the Lords (11:00) the day opens with questions on the response of international institutions to Covid-19 in refugee camps, and inheritance tax avoidance. Then detailed Committee stage scrutiny of the Prisoners (Disclosure of Information About Victims) Bill continues - with signs of guerrilla resistance to the measure from senior lawyers. Watch out for Report Stage.... The Commons is not sitting, but several select committees are in action. Environmental Audit (14:00) takes evidence on Covid-19 and the environment and Scottish Affairs (14:30) talks to Dr Gregor Smith, the Interim Chief Medical Officer for Scotland.  In the Lords (11:00) peers question ministers on guidance given to hospitals about ensuring the safety of patients without Covid-19 who require life-saving emergency treatment, government proposals for the rollout of the UK Shared Prosperity Fund and the changes in global oil markets and the implications of those changes for trade, climate change and international security. Then there are short debates on the contribution made by businesses and the wider private sector in addressing the pandemic, and supporting museums, galleries and historic buildings open to the public, during the pandemic. Neither House is sitting, but the limitations on the number of virtual committees that can be handled on any given day means that a number of select committees are in action.  Home Affairs (09:00) takes evidence on Home Office preparedness for Covid-19, and Public Accounts (13:45) quizzes Sir Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health and Social Care; Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England; and other senior officials on capital expenditure in the NHS, based on this National Audit Office report.  Meanwhile, the Justice Committee (14:00) talks to the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Burnett of Maldon, about the impact of Covid-19 on the prison, probation and court systems (14:30).

economic indicators,London elections 2022: What's at stake?,2024-09-15,2022-04-08,By Tim Donovan,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-61009616,"A few weeks ago, controversy over lockdown parties in Downing Street looked set to be a major factor in the London borough elections. Some fixed penalty notices have been issued and there could still be significant fallout if more details emerge before polling day on 5 May, not least about Boris Johnson or those closest to him. But have growing concerns about the cost of living replaced this as the number one game-changer in this election? And what about events in Ukraine? How will a deepening global conflict shape the intentions of those voters bothering to take part in very local battles?  Whatever the prevailing forces, this will be a signal of whether Boris Johnson - twice victorious as London mayor - is losing his electoral sheen.  The Tories could slip to their lowest number of councillors in the capital. The danger is clear in the limited polling available.  A poll by Deltapoll on 14 March suggested Labour could get 54% of the vote in London, a full 30% ahead of the Conservatives on 24%, with the Liberal Democrats on 9% and the Greens on 5%.  But this will almost certainly overstate the threat to the Tories. Their base is already low in the capital.  The 511 seats they won when these elections were last fought in 2018 was their smallest ever tally. Albeit the number of councillors overall in London has reduced over the years, so comparisons are tricky.  Clearly, the Conservatives could lose more councillors. The question is whether the walls of the historically rock-solid Tory citadels can realistically be breached. The Conservatives control seven councils now. Their worst record was in 1994 and 1998 when they were down to four.  Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster councils have only been Tory-run since the two boroughs were created in 1964. The last local election in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea was fought in the wake of the catastrophic fire at Grenfell Tower. If the Tories there could hold on by losing only one councillor, as they did in 2018, then it would seem almost certain they will do so again. Westminster could be another matter.  There were jitters for the Conservatives here in 2018, which proved unfounded. Now they potentially face a mound-shaped challenge. An attempt to create a post-Covid tourist attraction, the Marble Arch Mound, has been criticised and ridiculed in equal measure. It cost £6m to install and  the council is already taking it down. Could it prove costly electorally too? The two councils more realistically in Labour's sights are Wandsworth and Barnet. In both, they came up short despite considerable efforts on the ground in 2018.  Back then, activists from the Jeremy Corbyn-backing movement Momentum piled into Wandsworth during the campaign. It was to no avail. But only four seats now need to change hands for this totemic Tory council - a favourite of Margaret Thatcher - to fall. In Barnet, the effect of accusations of anti-Semitism under Corbyn's leadership outweighed adverse publicity about the privatising instincts of the Tory administration.  The council became known as ""easyCouncil"" after outsourcing hundreds of millions of pounds worth of services,  drawing on lessons from aviation companies like easyJet. But some Tories are also confident they can make gains in London. Perhaps even winning Havering, which is currently in no overall control.  Campaigners believe they can challenge hard in Enfield, Croydon, and Harrow where they say there's local dissatisfaction. One Tory leader, who didn't want to be identified, insists ""party-gate"" is not having the impact feared. ""Oddly enough there's not been a huge reaction on the doorstep,"" they said. ""For the moment, to borrow a phrase from the world of policing, it's 'nothing to see here, move along'."" In their wildest dreams Labour strategists could see May's elections as a series of firsts: In reality, it will be harder to shift the dial. They need about 100 gains to surpass their previous best total back in 1971 when they had 1,123 councillors. Back then there were more seats available. Boundary changes have reduced the overall number. And Labour has its own hurdles. Lewis Baston has charted what's been happening at a local level for the independent news website OnLondon. He wrote recently: ""Council by-elections in London since 2018 have tended to show Labour slipping, first to the Liberal Democrats and then the Conservatives.  ""There has been a steady drum-beat of swings of 4% or so from Labour to the Tories in London borough by-elections since December 2019. ""Local politics in some marginal boroughs - Croydon, Enfield and Harrow - have seen Labour administrations becoming unpopular."" The Lib Dems will be desperately hoping for signs of a continuing southern revival.  They seem confident they can hold on to Richmond and Kingston. As for their flagship borough of Sutton - in their control since 1990 - the Tories are putting a lot of time and effort into winning this council. In five London boroughs, voters will also be choosing a mayor.  Croydon will be electing its first mayor amid a backdrop of financial chaos. The politics here is febrile there is a chance of the mayor and council being of different political colour. That could raise interesting issues of governance and accountability. Let battle re-commence in Tower Hamlets too, which went through its own turmoil a few years ago. Former Independent mayor Lutfur Rahman has served out his five years suspension for electoral malpractice - and is now seeking to oust Labour's John Biggs who replaced him. Acrimony lingers and there remain scores to settle. Overall though the story in London will inevitably be what it says about the government in power. One of the strongest indicators of how far Tory support has been eroded by recent events will be what happens in Hillingdon. There's little chance of the Conservatives losing control. With 52% of the vote, this is where the Conservatives notched up their best vote share in London in 2018. Any substantial desertion of voters and depletion of Tory councillors here will send a strong message. Especially to the local MP, Boris Johnson. Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

economic indicators,Reality Check: Is Wales worse off after devolution?,2024-09-15,2017-09-21,By Sarah Dickins,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41338397,"Claim: ""A more responsive body will be better placed to promote economic prosperity and quality of life across Wales,"" stated the White Paper before the devolution vote. Reality Check verdict: In the twenty years since the vote for devolution Wales has fallen behind in terms of productivity, wages and household income when compared with the UK has a whole. Of course, no one knows if Wales would have fared even worse without devolution. One way of measuring economic success is to look at how productive a nation is. In the UK, the productivity of devolved nations and the regions of England can be compared by looking at what's called Gross Value Added (GVA). Like Gross Domestic Product (GDP) it measures the value of goods and services produced, but GVA is calculated before tax is applied. Between 2014 and 2015 (the latest figures available), only the north west of England experienced stronger productivity growth than Wales. But this has bucked the longer-term trend. In 1997, Wales was the least productive region of the UK, and since then it has has fallen from 86.8% to 80.6%. So is devolution a factor? Well, in Scotland which also had powers devolved, productivity has risen from 94.8% to 98.3%. The good news for Wales is that there's a higher proportion of people working than 20 years ago. And the unemployment rate - which was was nearly twice the UK rate - is now equal at 4.3%. Scotland's unemployment rate is slightly lower, at 3.8%. With more people in Wales working than in 1997, you might wonder why productivity levels haven't reflected that. It's because the value of what's produced in Wales has fallen relative to the UK, suggesting that a larger proportion of Welsh jobs are lower skilled. And that is reflected in wages. Welsh earnings have fallen relatively since devolution. Whereas average wages were equal in Scotland and Wales in 1997, earnings in Scotland are now £42 a week higher than in Wales. Only in the east Midlands do middle earners now have lower wages than in Wales.  But wages don't tell the whole story. Whether people feel more prosperous is better calculated by looking at household income (Gross Disposable Household Income). This also includes income which doesn't come from working - like pensions, investments and benefits. In 1997 household income in Wales was 87% of the UK average. It has now fallen to 85.5%. The area of Wales where households are living on the smallest incomes has not changed in twenty years, and remains the Gwent Valleys. There, heavy industry declined in the 1980s and early 1990s and has not been replaced .  In 1997 the highest average household incomes were found along the North Wales coast in Conwy and Denbighshire, where many people had chosen to retire. In contrast the latest figures show that the area with the highest average household income is in and around Newport in south east Wales.  This area has seen strong economic growth but is also attractive to people who work across the border in Bristol, but can't afford the higher house prices there. So, several indicators suggest that Wales has fallen further behind the UK average in the last twenty years. It is often argued that London and the south east of England push up the UK averages.  So perhaps it's fairer to compare Wales with Scotland, which voted for devolution at the same time, albeit for a different model. But on these key economic factors at least, Scotland has fared better."
economic indicators,How much longer will Scotland be in lockdown?,2024-09-15,2021-02-02,By Christopher Sleight,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-55901991,"The first minister has confirmed that Scotland will be in full lockdown until ""at least"" the end of February. Nicola Sturgeon said the current restrictions were working, but added the level of Covid infections clearly remained ""too high"". How much progress does Scotland need to make before lockdown can begin to be eased? Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, has talked about using World Health Organisation (WHO) indicators when calculating the level of Covid-19 transmission in the country. He told BBC Scotland this week that the Scottish government was aiming to get the number of cases below 50 per 100,000 people and the percentage of people testing positive under 5% before it would consider relaxing restrictions. Doing both of these things would put Scotland in the WHO's ""level 2"" category of community transmission, where it's judged there is a ""moderate incidence"" of locally acquired infections. The WHO's seven categories range from ""no active cases"" to ""level 4"" community transmission, when the general population is at high risk of being infected. In the organisation's guidance on implementing measures to control Covid-19, the WHO also lists two other ways of calculating the levels of Covid in a population: hospital admissions and death rates. Governments using this guidance will balance these indicators against the other health harms and economic impacts caused by lockdown measures. It's also likely the Scottish government would want to see rates remain below the WHO thresholds for sustained periods, rather than briefly dipping below the line. The WHO advises governments to look at their weekly confirmed cases per 100,000 people and then average the figure out over a 14-day period. By this measure, Scotland had a rate of 165 cases per 100,000 people on 2 February. There's been a sustained decline in this figure since the middle of January, but the rate is still well above the WHO's level 2 threshold of 50. The last time Scotland was below 50 cases per 100,000 was at the beginning of October. It's difficult to compare this rate with the first outbreak in the spring as there was no mass testing earlier in the pandemic. The Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive tests per day by the total number of tests carried out. The figure it's aiming for is 5%, which again would put Scotland in the WHO's ""level 2"" of community transmission. Like infection rates, the number is declining, but there's still some way to go. The WHO says governments should look at the number of weekly deaths ""attributed"" to Covid-19 per 100,000 people and average them out over 14 days. A death rate of two per 100,000 people or less needs to be achieved to indicate ""level 2"" community transmission, according to the WHO. This chart counts deaths in Scotland within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19. If the wider definition of all death certificates mentioning the virus were used, the rate would be slightly higher. The rate in Scotland is currently just over seven and has not yet begun to decline. The full lockdown in the spring ended on 28 May, although the easing of restrictions was phased over several weeks during the summer. Figures on Covid-19 hospital admissions are currently available up to 22 January, when the 14-day average of weekly admissions was 22. The WHO threshold in this instance is 10 cases per 100,000. The 14-day average has not yet begun to decline significantly, but daily admissions appear to have peaked on 11 January, according to Public Health Scotland figures. In the spring, the decline in infection rates was followed by a decline in hospital admissions and finally a fall death rates. If this pattern is repeated, then a corner may have been turned in this second wave - but there is still a long way to go before the rates of infections, hospital admissions and deaths are where the Scottish government would like them to be. In the world race to vaccinate, Israel is out in front after giving first jabs to more than half its adult population. So, what are we learning from their mass vaccination programme? Assessments by the Israeli Ministry of Health (MoH) report signs that infection and illness in the over-60s is being driven down. The fall appears to be most pronounced in older people and areas furthest ahead in their immunisation efforts. This suggests it is the vaccine, and not just the country's current lockdown, taking effect. The MoH data suggests infections and illnesses fell consistently from 14 days after receiving a first jab onwards. In Scotland just under 14% of those aged over 16 have had an injection with England at more than 18%; Wales at nearly 17% and Northern Ireland at 15.59%. Infectious disease specialist Dr Susan Hopkins told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme on Sunday that the UK should see its vaccination programme, which began on 8 December, reducing Covid illness within the next fortnight. While the current vaccines are said to be highly effective in preventing severe sickness in individuals there had been less assurance over whether they could prevent virus transmissibility. However, early research on the Oxford-AstraZenenca vaccine points to good news.  The results of a study, which has not yet been formally published, suggest that the vaccine may have a ""substantial"" effect on transmission of the virus. It means the jab could have a greater impact on the pandemic, as each person who receives it will indirectly protect others too. As well as showing an effect on transmission, the study found the vaccine offered 76% effective protection from a single dose for three months.

economic indicators,Spain threatens to vote against Brexit deal,2024-09-15,2018-11-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46267684,"Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has said Spain will reject the draft Brexit withdrawal deal without a clarification of the text on future talks on the status of Gibraltar. Spain maintains a claim to the peninsula, ceded to the British crown under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. It wants to ensure that future EU talks with the UK do not cover Gibraltar. ""As things stand today if there are no changes regarding Gibraltar, Spain will vote no on Brexit,"" said Mr Sánchez. Throughout the Brexit negotiations, Spain - along with Ireland and Cyprus - has conducted separate talks with the UK about specific border issues.  On Monday Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said that the draft Brexit deal had failed to make clear that talks on Gibraltar were ""separate negotiations"" and not part of future talks between the UK and EU. Mr Sánchez added his weight to those remarks on Tuesday at a forum in Madrid, emphasising that any future negotiations on Gibraltar had to be bilateral. ""As a country we cannot assume that whatever happens in the future with Gibraltar would be negotiated by the UK and EU - it will have to be negotiated between Spain and the UK,"" he said. Article 184 of the draft Brexit deal says the EU and the UK will seek to ""negotiate rapidly the agreements governing their future relationship"" between the official day of withdrawal on 29 March 2019 and the end of a transition period in December 2020. But Spain believes the article in question is ambiguous and wants to ensure that this does not apply to the future of Gibraltar. It insists on its future right to discuss the status of the peninsula bilaterally with the UK, and is seeking clarity that this draft deal will allow it to do so.  Asked about the Spanish objection to Article 184, a European Commission spokesman said they were aware of Spain's concerns. He said the EU's position on Gibraltar had been made clear in April 2017 guidelines, that after Brexit no agreement between the EU and UK could apply to Gibraltar without the agreement of the UK and Spain. Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo accused Spain of adopting a ""well-known tactic"" of raising issues at the last minute. He said Spain's position ""does little to build mutual confidence and trust going forward"".  A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Theresa May said the draft deal covered Gibraltar as well as ""the other overseas territories and the crown dependencies"". ""We will get a deal that works for the whole UK family."" By Gavin Lee, Europe reporter Spain and Britain have been running parallel negotiations over the future of Gibraltar, alongside the main EU-UK Brexit negotiations. Those talks have led to a ""protocol"" being agreed and three Spanish-British committees being set up to tackle tobacco smuggling, oversee cross-border workers rights, and co-operate on environmental protection and border control.  There seemed to be no drama on the horizon and the Spanish prime minister told me a few weeks ago he had ""no significant concerns over Gibraltar"", that the ""behaviour of the British government was good"" and an agreement could be reached. So what has changed?  The Spanish government says that its ""bone of contention"" is with one specific article in the draft Withdrawal Agreement that was only added last week, just before it was signed off by the European Commission, and wasn't seen by Spanish negotiators.   A senior Spanish diplomat told me that Spain wanted the following words (or similar) added to Article 184: ""This does not apply to Gibraltar, which will be subject to bilateral talks between the UK and Spain."" Underlying all of this is the fact that Spain still disputes that Gibraltar as a British overseas territory. Spanish officials refer to the rock as a ""British colony"" and, although the Spanish government isn't seeking to use the Brexit talks to push that claim, it is making it clear that any decision over the future of Gibraltar can only happen with the approval of Madrid. Though Spain ceded the peninsula under the 1713 treaty, it has tried several times to regain control over it. A referendum in the territory in 1967 saw 99.6% of residents vote to remain British. A proposal for joint sovereignty was also decisively rejected by Gibraltarians in a 2002 vote. Spain closed its border with Gibraltar after the 1967 vote and did not fully reopen it until 1985, the year before Spain joined the European Economic Community - the forerunner of the EU.

economic indicators,Reality Check: What is the Norway model?,2024-09-15,2018-10-30,By Chris Morris,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46024649,"The Prime Minister Theresa May is in Norway for a day of meetings with her Scandinavian counterparts at the Northern Future Forum in Oslo.  Brexit is bound to come up in conversation, so it feels like a good day to remind ourselves what the Norway model is.  Since the referendum, Norway has been discussed as one possible Brexit solution because a) it is not a member of the European Union, but b) it is in the European Economic Area (EEA), which means that it's also part of the single market.  So it's about as close to the EU as you can get without being a member state. And, if the UK followed this example, that would mean its trade relations with its nearest neighbours could remain pretty much as they are now.   Alphabet soup alert. You have to join EFTA - the European Free Trade Association, which groups four countries together: Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.   Just to complicate things further, Switzerland has chosen not to join the EEA, and relies on a series of complex agreements with the EU instead.     It means Norway has full access to the single market, and very limited barriers to trade with the EU.   In return it makes substantial contributions to the EU budget, and has to follow most EU rules and laws.   These include the so-called four freedoms - the freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and people.    That means people from across the EU are free to live and work in Norway, and Norwegians can live and work across the EU.   But Norway has no formal say in making EU rules, because it has no representation in any of the main European institutions.  Norway is not part of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) or the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). So it can set its own policies in those areas.    It is also exempt from EU rules on justice and home affairs.   Yes. That sounds familiar doesn't it? Of course it helps when you have one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world, thanks to huge investments generated by oil and gas revenues. Fishing and agriculture are also big issues in rural Norway (fishing is one of the biggest industries in the country) so being outside the CFP and the CAP are important indicators of national sovereignty.  No, it's not.   That means it does need to take some additional administrative steps in order to trade with the EU. But it also means it can sign its own trade deals with other countries around the world.  However, being outside the EU customs union means a relationship like Norway's would not solve the thorny Brexit problem of avoiding a hard border in Ireland.  To keep the Irish border as open as it is now, you would need to add a new customs union (or equivalent arrangement) with the EU - a ""Norway plus"" solution, if you like.   She has. And she has pledged to leave both the single market and the customs union.  Some MPs, though, have recently argued in favour of a short-term 'Norway for Now' option.   Instead of a transition period after Brexit, it would see the UK joining the EEA (via EFTA) for three years, and agreeing a temporary customs union with the EU.  That would, the theory goes, give the UK time to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU for the future.  Good point.   EEA membership would certainly be on offer as a long-term solution after Brexit. But it's unlikely that Norway and friends would want to be used as a waiting room on the UK's route out of the EU.  ""I don't think it's easy to think that you can enter into an organisation you are preparing to leave at the same time,"" Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg told the Northern Future Forum. ""It is also a little bit difficult for the rest of us."" Logistics and the law would pose a problem as well.  There is neither time nor legal authority before 29 March 2019 for the UK to apply to join EFTA and then rejoin the EEA.   As things stand, EFTA states are also not allowed to be in a customs union with the EU.  In the government's mind it is.  Theresa May said in Oslo today that Norway's existing relationship with the EU ""has elements that wouldn't deliver on the vote of the British people."" But these are uncertain times.  If a Brexit deal were to be agreed with the EU, and then voted down in the House of Commons, all bets would be off. And all options (including some version of Norway) could be up for debate.

economic indicators,NI economy continues to contract says Ulster Bank,2024-09-15,2022-10-10,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-63176368,"The Northern Ireland economy continued to contract in September, according to a survey by the Ulster Bank. Every month the bank asks firms across the private sector about issues such as staffing levels and order books. The survey is considered a reliable indicator of economic performance and last month NI firms reported a sharper fall in activity. This was before any turbulence caused by the chancellor's ""mini budget"". All sectors reported a fall in activity for the fifth month in a row. The one positive was that employment continued to rise, but the rate of job creation was only marginal. Survey respondents said worsening economic conditions, falling consumer confidence and rising prices were reasons for the decline. The bank's chief economist in Northern Ireland, Richard Ramsey, said: ""Services firms reported the sharpest increases in their cost base, with wages and energy costs now increasingly at the forefront of inflationary pressures."" ""The one positive in the latest report is employment with firms notching up their 19th consecutive monthly rise in staffing levels. However, the expected further reductions in business activity will no doubt weigh more on hiring intentions in the months ahead,"" he added. The latest survey was carried out before the chancellor's mini-budget announcement.  Mr Ramsey said the plan was unlikely to have the desired outcome.  He said: ""Firms may be relieved to see energy cost pressures easing, accompanied by much-needed government support. But borrowing costs have now moved rapidly in the opposite direction."" ""It's hard to see the chancellor's much-desired growth coming any time soon,"" he added."
economic indicators,Venezuela rejects vote tampering claim,2024-09-15,2017-08-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40808752,"Venezuela's electoral authorities have dismissed a claim that turnout in Sunday's controversial vote for a new constituent assembly was inflated. The firm behind the voting system said turnout was at least one million fewer than the government figure. But the head of the election council hit back, calling it an ""irresponsible claim, with unfounded estimations"". President Nicolás Maduro has said that the new assembly will be inaugurated on Friday. The opposition see the assembly as an attempt by Mr Maduro to cling on to power. They boycotted the election and also held an unofficial referendum in which they said more than seven million Venezuelans voted against the constituent assembly. Turnout in Sunday's poll is seen as a key indicator of the level of support the government enjoys. The government said more than eight million people, or 41.5% of the electorate, had voted. ""It is with the deepest regret that we have to report that the turnout numbers on Sunday 30th July for the Constituent Assembly in Venezuela were tampered with,"" the boss of Smartmatic, Antonio Mugica, told journalists in London. He said a full audit was needed to establish the exact number of voters but he said the firm estimated there was a difference of at least one million. But Tibisay Lucena of the election council accused Mr Mugica of trying to ""raise doubt over the result of the election"". Mr Maduro said the vote was free and fair and that it would not be tainted by ""a company with its headquarters in London and its bank accounts in the United States"". The opposition-controlled National Assembly has approved a request to open a criminal investigation into Smartmatic's claims. Separately, the Reuters news agency reported it had seen an internal memo from Venezuela's electoral authorities saying fewer than four million votes had been cast just two hours before polls closed. Venezuela's controversial vote explained Despite intense pressure at home and abroad, Mr Maduro is ploughing on with the constituent assembly. The first deputies for the new body have received their credentials, among them Mr Maduro's wife and son. Swearing in has already begun and the assembly's first sitting is due on Thursday. Mr Maduro says the constituent assembly, which has the power to rewrite the constitution and bypasses the National Assembly, is needed to restore order after months of crisis. The opposition is calling for fresh demonstrations with a march planned to coincide with the expected installation of the assembly. Venezuela remains in political and economic turmoil. Tumbling oil prices have hit social programmes hard and scores of people have died protesting against the government. But despite the unrest the government retains the crucial support of the armed forces."
economic indicators,'Crazy Rich Asians' and a growing wealth gap,2024-09-15,2018-09-02,By Ana Nicolaci da Costa ,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45292798,"The film Crazy Rich Asians hit the box office last month, and the glossy rom-com has put a spotlight on the region's growing number of super-rich. In plenty of shopping malls in Singapore - where the movie is based - you'll see designer shops with customers carrying bags from Prada, Gucci and Louis Vuitton. It's much like that in other cities. But the region, which was once considered a model of equitable growth, has also seen increased inequality. According to Oxfam the number of super-rich in the Asia-Pacific has surpassed that of North America and Europe. It is also home to the greatest number of millionaires and billionaires in the world, but also hosts nearly two-thirds of the world's working poor. ""Wealth inequality has reached alarming levels in a number of countries in the region,"" said Mustafa Talpur, who heads the inequality campaign in Asia for Oxfam. Why Crazy Rich Asians could never please all What does it take to be a billionaire? 'World's richest 1% get 82% of the wealth' With 585 billionaires, the US still tops the table of the mega-rich, according to Forbes. Mainland China is not far behind with 373.  But if you look at the Asia-Pacific region as a whole, then it has overtaken the US with 600 billionaires, according to Oxfam's analysis of data from Credit Suisse Global Wealth Databook 2017. Also, the Asia-Pacific region has the greatest number of high net worth individuals in the world, or people who have more than $1m on top of the value of their main residence. The region accounts for 34.1% of high net worth individuals globally versus 31.3% for North America, according a Capgemini report from 2018. Asia-Pacific also accounts for 30.8% of their total wealth versus 28.2% for North America. As China enjoyed annual growth of between around 8% and 11%  between 2008 and 2012, the US and the eurozone licked their wounds after devastating financial crises. ""This strong growth through the years has been aided by robust GDP and equity markets growth especially in the emerging markets of China and India. Consistent growth in the key mature markets of Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore also has been a contributing factor,"" said Chirag Thakral, deputy head of market intelligence at Capgemini in New York. Ma Huateng, also known as Pony Ma, is Asia's wealthiest person and number 17 in the world, according to the 2018 Forbes list.   He is the chief executive of China's tech giant Tencent Holdings, which owns WeChat, an enormously popular messaging app in China. He has a net worth of $45.3bn.  Also among Forbes' top 20 billionaires is Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. Alibaba is one of the world's most valuable companies, and its shares nearly doubled in value last year. His net worth was $39bn.  Also in the top 30 are Hong Kong's Li Ka-shing and China's Wang Jianlin, whose net worth was $34.9bn and $30bn respectively on the Forbes list. Li Ka-shing retired from leading his business empire earlier this year and is handing the reins to his eldest son. Li Ka-shing's CK Hutchison Holdings and CK Asset Holdings are involved in sectors including retail, telecoms and power. Wang Jianlin chairs Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group. The group is one of the world's biggest commercial real estate developers and owns US movie theatre chain AMC and film studio Legendary Entertainment. Last year, the heavily indebted firm sold a series of assets. Last year, 79% of the wealth created in China went to the richest 1% of the population, while 73% of the wealth created in India went to the top 1%, according to Oxfam's analysis.  As a result, the top 1% of China's population owned 47% of its national wealth in 2017, while in India they owned 45% of the country's wealth.  In Thailand - a highly unequal country in South East Asia -  96% of the wealth created last year went to the top 1% of the population.  In another sign of rising inequality, Asia-Pacific's income Gini coefficient - a gauge of economic inequality - increased from 0.37 to 0.48 between 1990 and 2014. A coefficient of 0 denotes perfect equality and at 1 represents total inequality Wealth inequality in Asia is even wider. The Gini coefficient was at a lofty 0.82 for China, 0.88 for India and 0.90 for the rest of the Asia-Pacific region in 2015, according to reports by Oxfam and UNESCAP, a United Nations social commission.

economic indicators,The state hospital poor people assume is private,2024-09-15,2017-09-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41265874,"Oil-rich Angola has provided free public health care since its independence in 1975. But does the system favour the elite, asks Mayeni Jones.  Many residents of the Angolan capital Luanda have assured me that the Multiperfil clinic is private, and I can see why they would believe that.  The hospital is one of the best I have ever visited in sub-Saharan Africa.  The medical school has mock surgery rooms and wards stocked with the latest medical equipment.  The hospital's director, Dr Manuel Filipe Dias dos Santos, tells me while showing me round that the hospital's record-keeping is completely electronic and that its doctors come from all over the world.  Multiperfil also trains medical students from across the country.  It's the summer holidays so the medical school is empty, apart from the human dummies that the students would practise on.  But these are no ordinary mannequins - we're told one of the most advanced ones costs up to $200,000 (£148,000).  ""This mannequin,"" Dr Dos Santos tells me, ""can cough, it can cry, it can speak, it can die. It can do anything a human being can do"". There's another reason why you might be forgiven for thinking this is a private clinic - patients here pay more than $200 as a down-payment before they can be attended to. A consultation costs almost $100. These are huge sums for most Angolans. But Multiperfil is not a private clinic. Built in 2002 with funds from a loan to the Angolan government, part of its revenue still comes from the state.  The clinic was granted special status by former President José Eduardo dos Santos, and is allowed to charge for care, despite being publicly funded.  It takes some lower income patients but the majority of the people it treats are insured politicians and members of the military.  And as in turns out, halfway through our tour, Dr Dos Santos is called away to personally tend to a government minister. Critics say this is a hospital that prioritises its elite clients.  Global health expert Sophie Harman from London's Queen Mary University says this is part of a trend in African public healthcare.  She has observed an increase in cases where insurance is used as a requirement in order to keep the general public out of certain hospitals.  As it is often a legal grey area, it is hard to hold people to account.  It also means that members of the public often don't realise that hospitals are public.  A 30-minute drive away from Multiperfil's orderly atmosphere, the situation is very different.  The Cajueiros General Hospital is in Cazenga, one of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods.  As we arrive, a fight breaks out between relatives of patients and security. A guard reaches for his gun but stops short. I got chatting to people who saw the beginning of the fight and they told me this a regular occurrence.  Relatives of patients often clash with security guards over the way they are treated. And that's not their only complaint. One of those relatives, Justino, said his sister-in-law was having surgery inside.  ""My family and I already spent the night out here yesterday and now I'm waiting for those who are inside visiting her,"" he said.  ""One of us always has to be outside because sometimes the hospital staff come out with a prescription and we have to go and buy medicine because the hospital has run out."" Others told me that the cost of medicine is very high. A vitamin capsule can fetch up to 2,000 kwanza ($12; £9).  They're even asked to buy basic goods like gloves and syringes. You can even buy some medical equipment from the hawkers outside the hospital.  Angola is going through a period of economic turmoil triggered by the global drop in the price of oil. The commodity constitutes 90% of the country's exports. But before the collapse in oil prices, Angola was one of the world's fastest growing economies, with an average GDP growth of 11.1% from 2001 to 2010. The problem is that the government did not invest in the health sector during its economic boom years, according to Anne Pitcher from Michigan University, who carried out a survey in Luanda on levels of satisfaction with the previous government. Angola, which is recovering from a 27-year civil war, only spent an average of 4% of its GDP on health from 2004 to 2014. This is below the regional average of 6%, according to the World Bank.  ""When we look at post-war countries, we often see that healthcare is one of the last thing to recover,"" explains Ms Pitcher.   ""It requires a lot of investment but it also requires commitment by government and I think their investment in healthcare has not been what you would expect a middle-income country to have."" Back at the Cajueiros hospital, families settle in for the night outside the hospital gates.  The ruling MPLA promised to increase investment in healthcare while campaigning ahead of last month's general elections.  As the new President Joao Lourenco starts his first term, Angolans will be looking to see whether he can fix an ailing and sick healthcare sector, despite the economic downturn. That change can't come too soon for Catarina, whose sister is a patient. ""Many of us don't have money to put food on the table, let alone buy medication. What are we supposed to do?  ""We need the government to invest in our hospitals so they have enough medicine because we can't afford it."""
economic indicators,Sturgeon: Wellbeing as important as economic growth,2024-09-15,2020-01-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-51200821,"People's quality of life should be as important as economic growth, according to Scotland's first minister.  In a speech later Nicola Sturgeon will say that Scotland is ""redefining"" what it means to be a successful nation.  She will tell a conference that Scotland is creating an economy where ""collective wellbeing"" is as fundamental as GDP. GDP, a measure of goods and services, has been criticised for undervaluing quality of life. Ms Sturgeon's speech comes after Scotland fell five places in an index of social and economic wellbeing in developed countries. The Scottish Trends Index Of Social and Economic Wellbeing uses data based on a range of measures including income, education, longevity and inclusivity. It has placed Scotland in the bottom half of 32 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Last year Ms Sturgeon joined with other leaders to promote a ""wellbeing"" agenda. Iceland's prime minister, Katrin Jakobsdottir, and the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, joined Ms Sturgeon in calling for new social indicators to be considered beside traditional GDP data. Ms Sturgeon will tell the Wellbeing Economy Alliance conference in Edinburgh later that Scotland will take centre stage on the issue. It will host a number of events to promote a ""global wellbeing economy"", including a meeting of the Wellbeing Economy Governments (WeGo) - Scotland, Iceland and New Zealand - at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.  ""The goal and objective of all economic policy should be collective wellbeing. This broader approach is at the very heart of our economic strategy which gives equal importance to tackling inequality as economic competitiveness,"" the first minister is expected to tell the conference.  ""It is why we are so committed to fair work and making sure that work is fulfilling and well paid and why we are acting to ensure a just transition to a carbon zero economy where no one is left behind."" Scotland has fallen five places from 16th to joint 21st on the latest Scottish Trends Index Of Social and Economic Wellbeing. The study uses OECD data from 2006 to 2018 based on a range of measures including: Scotland and Wales experienced the joint biggest falls over that 12-year period. The report said this was mainly due to falling GDP and education scores in Scotland. Greece and Finland also dropped down the rankings, while the biggest rises were credited to Estonia and Poland.

economic indicators,US jobs shock as growth slows,2024-09-15,2019-03-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47499326,"The US economy created the lowest number of jobs for a year-and-a-half in February, well below forecasts.  Just 20,000 new jobs were created last month against expectations of a 180,000 increase, official figures show. It is the lowest growth in non-farm payrolls since September 2017 when employment was affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. However, the small rise followed a sharp increase in new jobs in January, which was revised up to 311,000. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the expectation for 180,000 new positions in February was too high because the figures at the beginning of the year doubled-counted government workers who took second jobs during the US Government shutdown. He said that average new jobs growth over a three-month period was 186,000 which ""is entirely respectable"".  ""Indicators of labour demand have softened a bit but are nothing like weak enough to suggest that the February number is indicative of a new trend; we expect a return to the high 180,000 in March,"" he added.  Official data showed that the number of people ending part-time jobs or on temporary leave dropped by 225,000. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics said: ""This decline reflects, in part, the return of federal workers who were furloughed in January due to the partial government shutdown."" The figures also showed that growth in average earnings picked up to an annual rate of 3.4%, from 3.1% the month before, while the unemployment rate fell, dropping to 3.8% from 4% in January. President Donald Trump said rising wages were ""great for the American worker"", adding: ""I don't know if they expected to see it."" The construction sector saw the worst performance in February, with employment falling by 31,000 jobs compared with an increase of 53,000 in January.  Kully Samra, vice president at Charles Schwab, said that despite the weak job creation last month ""the outlook for the US economy remains strong relative to the rest of the world"".  ""The question is whether businesses are becoming more cautious because of weaker economic data and the return of volatility; or is the economy weakening a result of reduced business confidence?,"" he added.  However, Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: ""The sharp slowdown in payroll employment growth in February provides further evidence that economic growth has slowed in the first quarter. ""That adds weight to our view that the Fed will not be raising interest rates this year."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 212.81 points, or 0.8%, at 25,260.42. Investors were disappointed by the jobs data and a steep fall in Chinese exports amid a trade war with the US."
economic indicators,US Fed sees no rate rise for rest of 2019,2024-09-15,2019-03-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47644267,"The US Federal Reserve does not expect to raise interest rates for the rest of 2019 amid slower economic growth. After a two-day meeting, monetary policymakers voted unanimously to keep the US interest rate range between 2.25%-2.5%. Fed members changed their outlook for 2019 from the two increases predicted in December to no movement. The central bank warned that ""growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter"". It said: ""Recent indicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter.""  Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions, said: ""The Fed did a big about-face on policy. ""The fact that the Fed threw in the towel on a 2019 rate hike was particularly dovish."" Fed chairman Jerome Powell maintained his stance that the central bank would continue to be ""patient"", telling a press conference: ""It may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation calls clearly for a change in policy."" The Nasdaq turned positive, up 0.35% at 7,750.7 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 trimmed earlier falls. Bank stocks were among the biggest losers, and finance firms tend to make bigger profits when interest rates are higher. The dollar fell against the Japanese yen and the euro, but was higher against the pound which was trading lower as tensions heightened over the UK's exit from the European Union next week. Analysis of the so-called ""dot plot - where members of the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee indicate where they expect interest rates to move to - also revealed that they anticipate only one increase in 2020. Mr Powell said that there was a positive outlook for the rest of the year, with the unemployment rate under 4% and inflation below the central bank's 2% target. But he said that ""we are also very mindful of what the risks are"", which include slower global growth and no resolution on either Brexit or US-China trade talks. The Fed also said that is will slow the monthly reduction of US Treasury bonds it holds from $30bn to $15bn from May onwards ending in September. During the financial crisis, the Fed spent heavily to help kick-start the US economy. It has been reducing its a $4.2trn portfolio of US Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities since 2017. The Fed is getting just a little more wary about economic prospects. For sure, these developments are nothing like as dramatic as a cut in interest rates would have been. Nobody expected that and we didn't get one.  But the hint that we should no longer think in terms of any rise at all this year and only one in 2020 is consistent with the picture of a softening economic outlook.  There is also a striking contrast between the growth that Feds policymakers think the US can sustain - about 2% - and what President Trump's administration believes is achievable, which is more like 3%.  That difference matters. If at some stage in the future the Fed thinks the economy is overheating it will raise rates. President Trump has criticised the Fed for rate rises it has already made, and he won't like it any more if they resume.  "

economic indicators,What Hong Kong can expect from 'Beijing's enforcer',2024-09-15,2022-05-14,By Zubaidah Abdul Jalil,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-61267496,"It is a turn of events that, to some, comes as no surprise. This week, pro-Beijing hardliner John Lee was elected as Hong Kong's new leader, replacing Carrie Lam. The 64-year-old former security chief ran uncontested in the chief executive election, and was essentially handpicked for the role by a mostly pro-Beijing election committee. With China increasingly clamping down on Hong Kong, his appointment is a clear indication of Beijing's desire to keep the city on a tight leash, say analysts. ""John Lee's background is that of a policeman, a law enforcer,"" says Dr Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore. He points out that Mr Lee oversaw the crackdown on Hong Kong's 2019 protests, and the introduction of the controversial national security law which prohibits acts of treason, secession, sedition or subversion against China. ""This suggests that Beijing places its view of law and order at the front and centre of ruling Hong Kong."" Professor Steve Tsang, Director of the China Institute at SOAS agrees, calling Mr Lee ""Beijing's enforcer"".  His appointment confirms that ""Beijing intends to have its man in Hong Kong toe the party line and do what Beijing expects it to do."" Analysts also say Mr Lee's lack of popular support leaves little choice for him but to continue relying on Beijing to secure his political position.  ""Given he was one of the top officials responsible for transforming the Hong Kong police from a respected local institution into the most hated and despised of government departments, this background does not give him much of a power base,"" said Prof Tsang.  ""It means he does not have wide support and is beholden to Beijing for his office."" Mr Lee is not due to take the reins of power until 1 July.  But in the days following his selection, several individuals - including 90-year-old retired bishop Joseph Zen - were arrested for running a fund in 2019 to provide legal assistance to detained protestors, on suspicion that they broke the national security law.  Three of the others were former legislator Margaret Ng, pro-democracy activist Denise Ho, and academic Dr Hui Po Keung.  So what will Hong Kong look like under John Lee? In a 44-page manifesto, Mr Lee pledged to strengthen governance and tackle chronic housing problems. He has also pledged to enact legislation to bolster the national security law - a move that could potentially see him criminalising other areas not already covered under the Beijing-imposed law.  ""It will be another indicator of a further erosion of Hong Kong's civil liberties,"" says Kwong Chung Ching, the campaigns coordinator of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China.  In December last year, pro-democracy media organisation Stand News was raided by the police, and its senior staff arrested. Mr Lee had then announced that he supported the move. Numerous other independent news outlets have closed in Hong Kong - once a beacon of press freedom in Asia.  ""Anybody who attempts to make use of media work as a tool to pursue their political purpose or other interests [and] contravenes the law, particularly offences that endanger national security, they are the evil elements that damage press freedom,"" Mr Lee has said.  Hong Kong is also more likely to become ""more integrated into the mainland"", says Prof Tsang. ""The old Hong Kong, which existed prior to 2020, will not have a chance of re-emerging.""  Mr Lee also faces the daunting task of restoring Hong Kong's status as a glittering hub for business and finance, something he vowed to do in his manifesto. The massive, sometimes violent, protests that erupted in 2019 scared away tourists and spooked investors. Stringent Covid restrictions felled the economy further, resulting in a 4% economic contraction in the first quarter of 2022.  According to Eurocham, a net 130,000 people have left Hong Kong since 1 February, with employers reporting difficulties in attracting talent back into the city. Nearly half of all European businesses and 44% of US businesses in Hong Kong are considering relocating in the next year. With a career in the police force spanning more than four decades, Mr Lee stands in contrast to previous chief executives who had backgrounds in business and the civil service.  Analysts say it remains to be seen whether he will be able to repair Hong Kong's reputation. Dr Chong argued that a return to business confidence would require a degree of freedom of information and a restraint on authority.  ""Hong Kong used to be able to provide that in ways that the mainland could not,"" he said.  Furthermore, Mr Lee's appointment raises questions as to whether he will be expected to fall in line with China's zero-Covid policy, as Hong Kong battles one of its worst outbreaks yet.  The city has charted 5,600 deaths in the first quarter of the 2022 alone, compared to just 200 in the first two years of the pandemic, exacerbated by low vaccination rates amongst the city's elderly. ""As long as [Chinese President] Xi insists on zero-Covid, Mr Lee will be expected to implement it, though he has some latitude to reduce its adverse effects,"" says Prof Tsang. But analysts say achieving zero-Covid - or some approximation of it - is a goal that appears to run contradictory to Mr Lee's pledges to re-open the country.  Dr Chong says: ""Mr Lee has stated an intention to open up - but how to square these two cross-cutting demands and in what timeframe is less clear."""
economic indicators,US inflation slows by less than expected,2024-09-15,2024-02-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68277677,"Price increases in the US moderated last month but not as much as expected, as higher housing and food costs offset a decline in petrol prices.  Annual inflation, the pace at which prices rise, was 3.1%, down from 3.4% a month earlier, the Labor Department said. Many analysts had expected inflation to fall to 2.9%. It is the latest economic reading to suggest that authorities have not got inflation fully under control. Financial markets in the US opened lower after the report, which dashed any remaining hopes that progress taming the problem might convince the US central bank to cut rates early this year. ""It looks like everything is running hotter than hoped for,"" said Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors. ""We are not at the stage of worrying about inflation reaccelerating, but we are not out of the woods yet either."" Inflation - which measures the pace at which prices are rising - in the US took off in 2021 as a booming post-pandemic economy created shortages of supplies and strong demand, spurring many firms to put up prices.  It spiked above 9.1% in June 2022, as oil prices surged on the back of the war in Ukraine. Since 2022, many supply issues have healed and demand has moderated, responding in part to the sharp rise in borrowing costs announced by the Federal Reserve. But price increases have continued to percolate through, especially for services.  The ongoing price rises have hit incomes and helped to fuel dissatisfaction among voters ahead of the country's presidential election in November.  ""Everything is getting more expensive, except for the payments on my salary,"" said Francis Leonardo, a 53-year-old grocery worker from Pennsylvania, who said she would be voting for Donald Trump in November.  The Labor Department said on Tuesday that housing costs - which rose by 6% compared with a year ago - were the main driver behind last month's inflation.  Grocery prices were up a more modest 1.2%, as the cost of some items, such as eggs, dropped back. But restaurant prices were 5.1% higher than in January 2023. In other areas, prices for car insurance jumped a hefty 20.5% over the year, while personal care was up 5.3%. So-called core inflation was 3.9%, unchanged from December. That measure does not include food and energy prices, which tend to fluctuate and, therefore, are not seen as good indicators of wider trends. Mark Sherlock, head of US equities at  Federated Hermes Limited, said the data in Tuesday's report would ""surely further extend the timeline for the first rate cut"". ""The Fed has always maintained that they are data dependent, and they are said to be keen to avoid the mistakes of the 1970s (when rates were cut too early and the US economy suffered a second, more painful round of inflation),"" he said.

economic indicators,"Portugal: Two steps forward, one step back",2024-09-15,2014-05-16,Alison Roberts,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-27432712,"Portugal formally exits its eurozone bailout this weekend after three years of painful austerity that was the condition for it to receive 78bn euro (£63bn) in loan guarantees from the European Union and International Monetary Fund. To mark the date, the right-of-centre government called an extraordinary cabinet meeting whose single agenda item was the approval of a medium-term economic strategy. Opposition parties accused the governing coalition of blatant electioneering in calling the cabinet in on a Saturday, barely a week before elections for the European Parliament.  Two formal complaints were submitted to the National Elections Commission, but were struck down. The government denies it is acting with an eye to next week's European vote, but is quite open about the fact that it is seeking to capitalise on media interest in Portugal's bailout exit. ""There will be a natural attention on the ending of the Portuguese programme,"" the cabinet office minister, Luis Marques Guedes, said at a briefing following Thursday's regular cabinet meeting.  ""The Portuguese government intends to make use of these spotlights to make known, through the media, its strategy for reforms in the medium term."" Indeed, the document was originally written in English, according to officials - as part of efforts to convince foreign investors that Portugal is back on ""the path to growth"". The latest economic indicators have, however, somewhat tarnished the image of a country that has left the crisis behind.  Portugal's economic output, or gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 0.7% in the first quarter, even as euro-zone GDP swelled by just 0.2%, according to figures from Eurostat, the EU's statistical unit. Recovery had appeared to be well under way, with the country's economy growing since the second quarter of 2013, when Portugal had the fastest growth in the EU.  Exports have been the main engine of that growth, and it was the fact that they faltered - indeed fell - in the first quarter of 2014 that send the economy into reverse. So what is in prospect for Portugal now? Portugal's footwear industry exports about 95% of its products Some traditional sectors have come through the crisis fighting, with many firms responding to slumping domestic demand by looking abroad for the first time - or by seeking out non-EU markets while Europe stagnated. The footwear industry, which exports 95% of its output, has seen its foreign sales jump by some 40% over the past four years, and the pace of growth has continued in recent months.  Brands such as Fly London, which despite its name is produced by a company based in Guimaraes in northern Portugal, exemplify a move upmarket by many Portuguese shoe manufacturers - a trend that has lifted their average sale price to a point at which they rank behind only those made in Italy. Tourism has also been growing strongly, particularly in the capital, with an increasing diversification away from traditional beach holidays in the Algarve - and this summer is expected to set a new record in terms of visitor numbers. Portugal's prospects are looking better, says Teleperformance Portugal's Joao Cardoso Some other services are also doing well. Teleperformance Portugal, the country's largest contact-centre operator, has maintained its pace of doubling in size roughly every three years even in the crisis, according to its chief executive, Joao Cardoso. The company's innovative approach, not only to customer service but also to helping its local and multinational clients make improvements in their businesses, has won it a string of international awards. ""The world is so open that we now have more opportunities than at any time in the past,"" says Mr Cardoso. ""Portugal is very favourable for this kind of service."" Not only is it relatively easy to persuade native English, German, Swedish or Dutch speakers to move to sunny Portugal, but the company can draw on a large Portuguese diaspora whose members grow up speaking at least two languages.  One-fifth of the 800 people it has hired from abroad in the past two years are emigrants or the children of emigrants. Mr Cardoso is optimistic about his country's prospects, too. ""Portugal's economy is very open - and exports have been growing very fast. ""People are more optimistic now and that means they will take more risks."" Many still object to the government's austerity measures So far as taking risks goes, the 120,000 Portuguese who the government estimates left the country last year in search of work, are certainly proof that there is a widespread readiness to do so.  Portugal's jobless rate has been falling very gradually, but at 15.2% it is still twice the level of a decade ago, and youth unemployment actually rose slightly in March - to a shocking 35.4%. As for the kind of risk that worries investors, international ratings agencies have of late been making positive noises about the outlook for Portugal, but all still rate its sovereign debt as ""junk"".  While its bond yields are at their lowest levels in years, that is in part because of investors' frantic search for decent returns - and the famously reassuring words back in 2012 of the European Central Bank's president, Mario Draghi, that it would do ""whatever it takes"" to ensure the euro's survival. Economist differ on whether Portugal's debt mountain - which the government says will peak this year at 127.5% of GDP - is sustainable. But they do agree that the country's ability to bear and ultimately reduce this burden will depend on the future pace of economic growth.

economic indicators,The Ecuadorian women saving a beloved blue crab,2024-09-15,2024-02-22,Mickal Aranha,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240220-the-indigenous-women-saving-ecuadors-blue-crab,"The blue crab is more than just food for Afro-descendant Esmeraldans, who live on Ecuador's emerald coast. It's an intrinsic part of the culture – and these women are fighting to save it. As a young girl, Amada Cortez Caicedo would collect shells and snails from the once dense mangrove forests along the coast of Esmeraldas, Ecuador. She and her two sisters would traverse the trees' tentacled roots that stand high above the water, to harvest them from muddy burrows. ""I liked spending time in the wetlands because you would find molluscs and crustaceans in the ground, but in the branches you would see other wildlife,"" says Cortez. ""So I would go and gaze at the birds and [collect] snails."" Cortez's mother would sell shellfish to market vendors, who would then sell them in big cities like Quito. The shellfish were a source of income for the family, and they provided food sovereignty – the term used to describe the right to eat culturally appropriate food. Esmeraldan women like Cortez have been gathering shells and crabs in the mangroves for generations. Although some men collect crabs as well, it's primarily young women who do so. It's a patrimonial practice and part of their cultural heritage. Today, the mangroves upon which so many Esmeraldan women depend for their way of life – and which are an intrinsic part of their collective identity – are on the brink of disappearing. If they vanish, so will the blue crabs. The province of Esmeraldas in Ecuador literally means ""emeralds"". It's known as ""the green province"" for its humid tropical forests. It's located in the north-west of the country, bordering Colombia. The coasts are lined with mangroves that are still home to an abundance of plant and animal life. Esmeraldans describe personal attachments to the mangrove ecosystem and a reciprocal relationship with it where the mangroves provide services to the community in exchange for caregiving and protection. Knowledge of how to protect it is embedded into Esmeraldans' oral tradition, and also comes from communicating with the mangroves themselves, which are viewed as a source of wisdom. Between 25-90% of the mangroves in Ecuador have been decimated due to deforestation and intensive shrimp farming. Furthermore, the pollution from the industrial shrimp pools, such as fertilisers and antibiotics, spilled out into the environment, damaging the fragile mangrove ecosystems and the health and wellbeing of the local population. The Esmeraldas crab, with its distinctive blue shell, orange belly, red legs and white main pincer, normally feeds on mangrove leaves and surrounding vegetation. It's a terrestrial crab, often preferring the margins of aquatic habitats like riverbanks, beaches and mangroves, but spawns in estuaries and the ocean. In mangrove habitats, it's found among the muddy tree roots, where it lives in J-shaped burrows, that can be up to 2m (6.6ft) deep. The species' habitat and reproduction process has been drastically affected by human activity. Now the Esmeraldas Blue Crab species, the Cardisoma crassum, is considered an endangered species by locals, who have seen the crab's numbers decline significantly since the 1980s. They are not listed on the international database of endangered species, though; a large challenge facing the communities trying to protect the crabs is that there is little data on their numbers, and so monitoring their decline has been mostly anecdotal. The people of Esmeraldas also face systemic racism, which they say makes it harder to conserve this culturally important species. People of African descent make up more than 40% of the population in the province, having settled there during the forced migration of Africans to America between the 1500s and 1800s. Pilar Egüez Guevara is an anthropologist and filmmaker who focuses on the value of traditional and ancestral foods. She has researched Esmeraldan culture extensively and says that it's one of the most marginalised and forgotten regions of the country, as shown by various social indicators like education, income inequality, access to basic services and opportunities. ""Part of it is because there's a lot of prejudice against people of African descent,"" Guevara says. In order to protect their food heritage and culture, Cortez and her community are saving the blue crabs – and the mangroves the creatures inhabit. In recent years Luna Creciente, an organization in the north of Esmeraldas, and the Union of Peasant Organisations of Esmeraldas of Ecuador (UOCE) in the south of the province, have come together to find ways to protect the Esmeraldas blue crab from extinction. The two groups, which Cortez has been working with, raise awareness about the importance of adhering to biannual seasonal harvesting bans on blue crab set by the Ministry of Production, Foreign Trade, Investment and Fisheries. During the month-long seasonal bans, the capture, transportation, possession, processing and marketing of the crustacean are prohibited. The first national ban is between January and February, when the crab's pre-courtship and mating stage takes place. This stage is carried out in the outer area of the burrows, so harvesting crabs at this time would interfere with normal reproduction. The second seasonal ban occurs between August and September, during the crab's growth period, when they moult their carapace – their outer shell – for a larger one. Additionally, locals are prohibited from catching female crabs and crabs smaller than 7.5cm (3in) carapace length. The local crab fishers not only adhere to these rules, but they patrol the area to make sure everyone else does too. A tracking system to monitor how these policies are helping crab populations is still in development, but locals say they're already seeing an improvement in crab numbers. ""The women of the mangroves are united and now they protect the mangroves,"" says Cortez. ""They only catch the crabs during normal times and during the closed seasons they don't catch them, they let them grow. They take care so that no one enters the mangroves to take the crabs at that time."" Guevara says that this kind of control system is also already embedded in Esmeraldans' oral tradition, in the form of sung poems called ""arrullos"". They are a musical tool which elders use to educate younger generations. ""Some arrullos are about how to protect these mangrove species and the fact that they shouldn't catch them when premature,"" Guevara says. Alongside the arrullos, the government bans focus on the wider population, as well as Esmeraldans who may have lost touch with these ancestral traditions and oral storytelling. In the north of the province, where the mangrove ecosystem is more intact than in the south, mangrove restoration efforts are underway. ""We're carrying out an environmental project with the support of the World Food Programme,"" says Cortez. The mangroves in the south of the province are damaged beyond repair, according to local experts but those in the north are still intact enough to be restored. ""Technicians are there and work with the communities to plant mangroves in the spaces devastated by the shrimp farms,"" Cortez adds. ""The project is beautiful."" This climate change adaptation project involves 66 communities in the Mira-Mataje and Guáitara-Carchi watersheds along the Ecuador-Colombia border. The project aims to reforest 988 acres (400 hectares) of land and conserve 37,000 acres (15,000 hectares) of mangroves. Restoring the blue crab's habitat gives the species a better chance to bounce back. In addition to conserving the blue crab species and the mangroves it inhabits, Esmeraldans are also protecting the blue crab through gastronomy, highlighting the crab as a symbol of their unique food culture. In 2018, Luna Creciente and UOCE petitioned to have the Esmeraldas blue crab recognized by Slow Food International, a global organisation that seeks to prevent the disappearance of local food cultures and traditions. One of the ways Slow Food does this is by raising awareness through the development of an ""Ark of Taste"", a living catalogue of endangered heritage foods that are sustainably produced, unique in taste and part of a distinct region in the world. The Ark lists foods such as Tanzanian wild honey, which is harvested with the help of honeyguide birds leading foragers to beehives where the honey is found. Applying the term ""endangered"" to foods is a novel concept, the word usually applied to plant and animal species, but it helps to draw attention to the thousands of foods around the world that are at risk of disappearing forever. Another tool is the development of Slow Food Presidia, projects to help sustain quality food production processes protecting traditional foods, while also respecting soil, water, animal welfare and biodiversity. In the case of the Esmeraldas blue crab, the presidium has worked on strengthening the value chain for the blue crab – the chain of events to get from harvesting to market sale. This means the entire process of harvesting the crab is protected from beginning to end, and the community is more invested in ensuring that they are sustainably harvested. Once the crabs have reached the age of maturity, they're gathered and brought to feeding pens. With the help of the presidium, six pens were built by the participating Esmeraldan cantons of Muisne, Atacames and San Lorenzo, to contain harvested crabs and allow them to grow bigger. The feedlots were constructed by first digging 30cm (12in) into the soil, then adding stones and cement to form the base. The circular walls were then created by stacking three rows of bricks, which were then covered in tiles. The pens are about 1m (3.3ft) high and 2.5m (8.3ft) in diameter. A key part of this presidium is the ""mink'a"" (voluntary collective), in which community members take ownership of the crabs by feeding them foods like coconut, banana, cassava and sugarcane for about three weeks to improve the crab's taste and quality. The crabs are then harvested and the meat is sent to nearby processing centres, also run by locals. Processing centres in the north and south of Esmeraldas have been fitted with vacuum-packing devices for the meat and freezers to conserve the meat before getting it to market. Generating added value in this way allows Esmeraldan women to sell the crab at a higher price. Processed products also offer an income even when the crabbing season is closed. These projects are also upskilling young Esmeraldan women in jobs such as fishing, cooking, meat removal, packaging, freezing and legal procedures. As well as opening new commercial opportunities, they strengthen ties to the tourism industry and encourage direct contact with urban customers. ""We need to continue involving and training our youth – the new generation of farmers, fishermen, gatherers. So that they can dream and see themselves as farmers, so that they see an opportunity in the territory,"" says Nancy Bédon, president of the UOCE. Finally, Esmeraldan women are continuing their long-held roles as knowledge keepers through their oral tradition, by safeguarding recipes and organising workshops where community members teach each other how to prepare local dishes. In the long term, Bedón says that the crab collectors and Esmeraldans are looking for alternatives for economic survival. They're hoping to develop sustainable farming projects in the various sensitive ecosystems in their territory, which include mangroves, beaches and forests. Recovering species like the blue crab and their habitats will allow them to promote their healthy ecosystems to tourists. ""What we're betting on as farmers, fishermen and gatherers is ecological tourism linked to our traditional cuisines."" This would create new economic avenues for Esmeraldan women. For example, in addition to selling blue crab meat, they can offer tourists meals with flavours they won't find in any other part of the country. One of the emblematic dishes from Esmeraldas is ""encocado"", blue crab coconut stew. ""Crab encocado is a powerful symbol because crab and coconut are foods that make the region's cuisine distinctive,"" Guevara says. In addition to blue crab and coconut, the dish contains annatto seed paste and coastal herbs: chillangua (long coriander), chirarán (basil) and big leaf oregano. Preserving recipes and increasing demand for the blue crab will further incentivise the community to sustainably harvest the crustacean and protect its mangrove habitat. Guevara says that a crucial part of protecting a seed or food item that's under threat of disappearing from the culture, in addition to growing it in an environmentally sustainable way, is preserving the food traditions that go along with it. ""The foods that we are trying to protect are in low demand because people have forgotten their traditions. These foods are no longer found in homes, supermarkets or menus. These recipes are not being made anymore."" she says. Despite Esmeraldans' best efforts to protect the blue crab, earthquakes, major floods and a vulnerability to El Niño weather patterns have hindered their progress. Ecuador's mangroves are a natural buffer against storms and extreme weather like El Niño. They defend against rising sea levels, stabilise the coastline, and reduce erosion. So when most of the mangroves were destroyed in the 1970s and 1980s to build shrimp aquaculture farms, the local communities' natural defense was destroyed as well, making them even more vulnerable to extreme weather. The floods last year caused the crab feeding pens to overflow with mud and water, killing all the crabs Esmeraldans had collected. Cortez is now 65, a retired schoolteacher, poet and the leader of the Black Women's Movement of the North of Esmeraldas (Momune). She is a guardian of Afro-Ecuadorian heritage, including the value of the mangroves, blue crabs and Esmeraldan cuisine. Although she no longer collects shellfish in the mangroves, her writing still pays homage to her early days in the mangrove forests and waterways carved into the Esmeraldan coastal landscape. Many of Cortez's poems reflect on the Esmeraldans' relationship to the mangroves and the foods that come from them, which are a part of their identity and perceptual world. Through the act of harvesting and cooking blue crabs, Esmeraldans relate to one another, to the land, and experience it in all its sensory richness through sight, smell and taste. Cortez's poems ensure that her communities' traditions and values are not lost. ""My poetry tells the story of our strength as women, with the potential to build a new story, with our own lyrics,"" Cortez adds. -- Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that the Afro-descendant Esmeraldans do not identify as an indigenous people, as originally stated; and to refer to Amada Cortez Caicedo by her surname of Cortez and not Caicedo.

economic indicators,NI businesses report surge in confidence,2024-09-15,2024-02-12,By Clodagh Rice,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-68254211,"Northern Ireland companies reported strong growth in their order books, which boosted confidence last month, according to a survey by Ulster Bank. Every month the bank asks firms across the private sector about issues such as staffing levels, exports and new orders. It is considered a reliable indicator of economic performance. It suggests the private sector started 2024 in a stronger position than that on which it ended 2023. The bank's chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said optimism was at a 32-month high. ""The biggest surprise in the latest survey was the surge in business confidence,"" he said.  ""Local firms were their most optimistic about future output levels since May 2021. The positive sentiment was evident across all four sectors."" Mr Ramsey said the renewed optimism was linked to the launch of new products and higher orders.  ""Significantly, the notable improvement in the outlook predates the restoration of Stormont,"" he said. ""The impact on sentiment of the political developments should become apparent in February's survey.""  Three of the four sectors - manufacturing, services and retail - all reported an increase in business activity in January, with only the construction sector reporting a fall. Mr Ramsey said a notable pick-up in domestic demand led to the first rise in new orders in eight months. ""A surge in retail demand and a return to growth in manufacturing orders more than offset the continued declines in services and construction,"" he said. Manufacturing, services and constructions firms all took on more staff last month, with only retailers reducing their staffing levels for the first time in more than a year."
economic indicators,"Private sector growth accelerates, survey suggests",2024-09-15,2024-03-11,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-68518228,"Northern Ireland's private sector grew at its fastest rate in almost a year during February, an Ulster Bank survey has suggested. The monthly survey of about 200 firms is considered a reliable indicator of the health of the private sector economy. Growth in February came from the manufacturing and services sectors. But retail output was flat and construction showed little recovery from a long period of weakness. Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist, said services recorded their fastest rate of expansion in activity in 22 months. The services sector is the largest part of the Northern Ireland economy and has been the source of almost all growth since the pandemic. Official figures for services and manufacturing output in the fourth quarter of last year are due to be published later this week. The third quarter figures suggested services were growing while a period of weakness for manufacturing was continuing. Some economic forecasters expect the Northern Ireland economy to show little overall growth this year. Ulster University and the professional services firm EY have both forecast growth of less than 1%, pointing to the lingering effects of inflation and higher interest rates."
economic indicators,Chris Mason: No fireworks but tax cuts headache for Labour,2024-09-15,2024-03-07,By Chris Mason,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68497593,"We have had a glimpse into the most important tussle of the general election campaign. The battle for economic credibility. This was a Budget where the chancellor attempted to portray himself as a careful, cautious custodian of the economy. The National Insurance fall, alongside the same cut a few months back, amounts to a big tax cut. But there was nothing wildly surprising in what Jeremy Hunt had to say, no fireworks that are likely to instantly transform the Conservatives' prospects. Mr Hunt is instead attempting to make an argument that slowly but surely the economy is recovering. In my interview with him, for instance, he pointed out that average earners will be better off when you compare the National Insurance cuts with those frozen tax thresholds that have amounted to huge tax rises for many people. But the big economic argument to come is wider than that. It takes in inflation, mortgage costs, rent and income per head. As the statistics are traded in the coming days, there is something beneath them that matters more: sentiment. Do people feel better off, do they feel they have more disposable income and do they feel economically confident about the future? It is those three questions that frame the political argument between the Conservatives, Labour and others over the economy. Labour feel they have scraped their way back to being taken seriously by many on the economy again, and there is opinion poll evidence to support this.  What is often an Achilles' heel for Labour they now hope is a strength, not least because they think many, many people feel worse off under the Conservatives. Conversely for the Tories, what is so often a strength for them is now a vulnerability, the economy, given they have presided over the turbulence of recent years. Most of that turbulence, many would accept, was entirely beyond their control: the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, both of which prompted vast public spending to support families and businesses, for which many were very grateful. The consequences of that spending can be seen now in tax rates and the national debt, among other things. But Labour are keen, too, to pin some of the blame squarely on the Tories. ""Where's Liz? Where's Kwasi?"" shouted Labour MPs during the Budget address. Pantomime-esque questions with political bite: Labour want to remind people the previous prime minister and the previous chancellor caused an economic calamity with real consequences. Jeremy Hunt, beyond what he has announced, is trying to set a direction of travel: he told me he would like to scrap National Insurance altogether. Now that might be like you or me saying we'd like to win the lottery: what we'd like to do and what is likely to happen are not the same thing. Scrapping it would cost a fortune. But it is an indicator of aspiration, and an attempt to frame points of difference between the Conservatives and Labour. Can he do enough to start tempting people to think again about switching to Labour? The opinion polls suggest he has one heck of a job on his hands. Labour, meanwhile, conscious they lose far more elections than they win, are attempting to appear reassuring to floating voters.  And so a lot of what this government announces, whether in the Budget or over the last six months, they have gone along with, including much of what was in the Budget. Which now leaves them with a headache - how they pay for some of their promises, having accepted the chancellor's tax cuts."
economic indicators,South Africa's ANC loses capital,2024-09-15,2016-08-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36997461,"DA leader Mmusi Maimane: ""For far too long, the ANC has governed South Africa with absolute impunity"" South Africa's governing African National Congress has been defeated by the opposition Democratic Alliance in local polls in the capital Pretoria. The DA took 43% of the vote compared with the ANC's 41% in Tshwane, the municipality that includes Pretoria. The DA will need to form a coalition in order to secure control there. In the country's largest city, Johannesburg, the ANC beat the DA but fell short of an outright majority, with 44% of the vote. The ANC has also lost Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan area in the Eastern Cape, which includes Port Elizabeth, to the DA.  End of racial politics? It is the ANC's worst electoral performance since it was elected to power at the end of apartheid and the replacement of white minority rule by democracy in 1994, and the first time since then that it has lost control of the capital. The DA has won 93 seats in Tshwane while the ANC is second with 89 seats in the 214-seat municipal council. Observers say a host of corruption scandals and internal party squabbles are to blame for the ANC's decline. The South African economy has stagnated since 2008's global financial crisis, and the country has one of the highest rates of economic inequality in the world. Revelations that upgrades to President Jacob Zuma's private home were funded with $20m of public money caused an outcry. The Constitutional Court recently instructed Mr Zuma to reimburse the state $507,000. DA candidate Athol Trollip has been elected mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay The municipal election result is probably the biggest wake-up call the governing ANC has received since it ushered in democracy in South Africa in 1994.  Clearly the ANC still commands huge support across the country but that support is waning. It can no longer take it for granted that the black majority will blindly follow it.  A good example is in the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality, won by the DA, which has a rich history of anti-apartheid struggle. Its new DA mayor is Athol Trollip, who is white. Twenty-two years after the end of apartheid, black people are now voting on issues and not on race. Mr Trollip, who speaks fluent Xhosa, would not be where he is if the vast majority of black people had not voted for him.  The party of late President Mandela, the icon of the struggle against apartheid, still commands strong support with about 54% of the national vote. The DA has received about 27%, while the radical Economic Freedom Fighters party - contesting local elections for the first time - has taken about 8%. The vote is seen as a possible indicator for the general election due in 2019 The DA's leader, 36-year-old Mmusi Maimane, told reporters: ""For far too long, the ANC has governed South Africa with absolute impunity."" He added that the idea that his party - which has its roots in the non-ANC opposition to apartheid - was a white one had been ""completely shattered"". The ANC said it would ""reflect and introspect where our support has dropped"".  In a brief address before the final results were announced, 74-year-old President Zuma praised the conduct of a vote he called largely peaceful, free and fair. ""Our democracy is maturing,"" he said.

economic indicators,ANC suffers major electoral setback,2024-09-15,2016-08-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36985339,"This video can not be played The ruling African National Congress has got the lowest share of the vote since 1994 South Africa's governing African National Congress (ANC) has suffered its worst electoral setback since apartheid ended in 1994. With 99% of the votes counted after Wednesday's municipal elections, the party has lost the key battleground of Nelson Mandela Bay to the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA). The two parties are in a close fight for Johannesburg and Pretoria.  But the ANC is still in the lead nationally, with 54% of the vote. End of racial politics? The ANC has had the main share of the vote in South Africa since the end of apartheid more than two decades ago.  Unemployment and corruption scandals surrounding President Jacob Zuma have tarnished the party's image. The local elections are being seen as an indication of his mid-term popularity. Mr Zuma will be present when the results are officially announced on Saturday evening, at 18:00 local time (16:00 GMT). Named after ANC liberation hero and South Africa's first democratically elected president, the loss of Nelson Mandela Bay is a big blow to the party. Many of the leaders of the struggle against apartheid come from the area. DA leader Mmusi Maimane says his party has given voters a viable alternative to the ANC The DA, which took 46.5% compared to the ANC's 41% in Nelson Mandela Bay, says it is in talks with other parties to form a coalition in the municipality on South Africa's southern coast. Its leader Mmusi Maimane said Nelson Mandela Bay had voted for change. ""I think that to me says that our message got through - it says our people heard us and South Africans still believe in a dream of a non-racial South Africa, South Africans still want our country to prosper,"" he said. The ANC has conceded defeat in Nelson Mandela Bay after initially saying it was going to challenge the result. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa promised the party would learn from the experience: ""They think that we are arrogant, they think that we are self-centred, they think that we are self-serving, and I'd like to dispute all of that and say we are a listening organisation."" It looks like no party will win an outright majority in the economic hubs of Johannesburg or Tshwane, which includes the capital, Pretoria, and coalition negotiations are already underway. BBC South Africa analyst Farouk Chothia says the ANC's urban vote has collapsed with both black middle and working classes switching to DA. It is a historic moment showing the extent to which people are fed up with corruption and the ANC's failure to deliver on its promises, he says. DA candidate Athol Trollip has just been elected mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay The municipal election result is probably the biggest wake-up call the governing ANC has received since it ushered in democracy in South Africa in 1994.

By Friday mid-morning, the ANC had 54%, followed by 26% for the DA and 8% for the radical Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). The Inkatha Freedom Party has boosted its support slightly, holding on to parts of KwaZulu-Natal state. Correspondents say a poor ANC performance could embolden Mr Zuma's rivals within the party to challenge him.

economic indicators,"Budget Week: shoots of growth, or frosty chill?",2024-09-15,2017-12-11,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-42316770,"It's a big week for Scotland's economy and politics. Thursday is Budget day. Derek Mackay still lacks the red briefcase outside Number 11, but he does have some significant new tax levers to pull. He's also got some tricky spending decisions to make. The squeeze last year wasn't much of a squeeze, and more of a stalling. This year sees a return to real terms cuts.  More of both later in the week. For now, let's look at the wider economy. This week will see the Scottish Fiscal Commission (SFC) spring to life, with a new role in providing a forecast for growth in the Scottish economy and its assessment of Derek Mackay's revenue figures. It's fashionable to dismiss growth forecasts as being about as much use as astrology. The difference with this one is that it's the basis on which the Scottish government's budget has to be based. If Lady Susan Rice, the former TSB Scotland chief executive who chairs the Fiscal Commission, declares that growth is going to be low, that feeds through to her revenue projections.  Slow growth in output means low growth in the income from which income tax is derived. And those are the numbers with which Mr Mackay has to juggle.  He may not like them. But that's the point of the SFC being independent, as it is with the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The SFC can base its estimates on various sources of information. An important guide is the OBR's forecast, as published on 22 November.   That was for a sharp downgrading of growth over the coming years, because the OBR has abandoned its optimism about British productivity returning to trend growth. It's now assumed that it's stuck in the very slow crawler lane. The SFC has to make a judgement if the Scottish budget is similarly stuck. It may not do so this time, but it's hard to see that Scots productivity is doing any better than the UK as a whole.   The 2015 figures showed Scotland catching up with the UK rate, having previously lagged. More recent indications from Scottish government statistics suggest that Scottish productivity has fallen behind again. What are the other bits of information feeding into the SFC's forecast? The EY ITEM Club (sounds a bit more fun than it is) of economists was relatively upbeat when it issued its latest report on Friday, saying Scottish growth next year looks like it should match the UK rate next year. It forecasts 0.7% growth for this full year, and 1.4% next year. That assumes that the Brexit negotiations don't stall, and that business can look to a smooth transition. Quite a big assumption. It's not so upbeat about the path to 2022, forecasting that Scottish growth will lag the UK rate - 1.7% to 2%, on average.  That's how public spending gets hurt - if income tax falls behind the level that would have been passed to Holyrood through the block grant under previous funding arrangements. The Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde University sets out its growth forecast tomorrow, that being Tuesday - too late to influence the SFC. Its last central estimate, published in September, was for 1.2% growth this year, rising to 1.4% in 2018. Car sales figures were truly dire last month, and have been going in that direction for several months. This is partly due to rising prices, and partly due to the lack of confidence in diesel (registrations down 41%).   But a fall of 24% in total new car registrations from November 2016 - much worse than the 11% UK fall - ought to weigh on policy-makers' minds. The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) out with the start of this week, is an important gauge of private sector activity, or lack of it. The good news is that optimism for the next six to 12 months is looking up.  Cost pressures are easing a bit. The bad news: very weak recent output figures - far more so than the UK PMI - have become weaker still. If it's at 50, the index suggests the private sector economy has stalled and is on the brink of contraction. The November survey registered 50.2, the lowest for eight months. That bad news chimes with concerns raised in recent business surveys about investment levels. The economy needs them to rise. But business confidence is lacking, and the surveys point to further weakening. Consumer confidence, or at least a willingness to keep spending, with very low interest rates, has been a vital element of keeping the economy growing over recent years. But yet more surveys, including one regularly done for the Scottish government, are not looking good. Employment figures are much more positive. The trends show Scotland is holding steady with the UK figures on unemployment and employment levels. The question marks are over the quality of those jobs, the low productivity linked to them and whether they are sustainable. The regular IHS Markit survey of recruitment consultants, published last week and also covering November, confirmed that the labour market is looking tight, with worries about skill shortages, not least to replace departing EU citizens. As Kevin Green, boss of REC, the recruiters trade body, reminds us: ""Having less access to candidates can have severe effects, restricting businesses' ability to grow which means they won't be able to create jobs or increase pay for staff."" The strongest indicators in the economy are from manufacturers, helped by the the weakened pound making it easier to sell abroad, and to compete with foreign suppliers on their UK turf. Scottish Engineering, the organisation representing that sector, published a particularly upbeat quarterly survey at the start of this month. It's part of a picture that's taking shape, of the offshore oil and gas industry rebooting its mojo, though after a very steep drop. The only engineering sub-sector finding things really tough-going were machine shops and fabricators. BiFab is one such fabricator with well-publicised difficulties. So if you're Lady Rice, one of the other commissioners or of the 20 staff at the Scottish Fiscal Commission trying to decide what will happen to growth in the next year and beyond, what lesson do you take from this?  There are positives, for sure, but with uncertainty contributing to weak confidence, it's hard to see that Scotland's growth is going to be any better than the UK as a whole, and there is plenty evidence to suggest it will be lower. Is that a good time to use those new income tax powers in order to raise revenue, counter austerity, and help public services?  More on that soon."
economic indicators,Ireland's unemployment rate falls to record low,2024-09-15,2023-05-31,John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2v8670ejzpo,"The unemployment rate in the Republic of Ireland fell to a record low of 3.8% in May, according to official figures. It had been 3.9% in April which matched the previous low attained for a sustained period during the Celtic Tiger era in 2000/01. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the rate peaked in March 2021 at 7.7%. Ireland's economy has recovered strongly since pandemic restrictions were removed. Andrew Webb, chief economist at Grant Thornton Ireland, said the strong labour market performance was no surprise ""given the signals from business and consumer sentiment indicators that suggest recent economic concerns are beginning to fade"". ""A slight note of caution is warranted as vacancy levels are starting to tail off, but overall the labour market performance since the pandemic is a particular economic bright spot,"" he added. Northern Ireland's labour market has also performed well since the pandemic with an unemployment rate of 2.5% which is just above the record low."
economic indicators,Why Spain has so many flats,2024-09-15,2020-05-11,Jessica Jones,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200506-why-do-flats-dominate-spains-housing-market,"Two-thirds of all Spaniards live in flats. What shaped the housing market and, amid lockdown, are people looking at their homes in a new light? Over the weeks of Spain’s tough lockdown, images of people on their balconies applauding healthcare workers have spread across the globe. The footage has been hailed as a heart-warming show of appreciation, but it has also served another purpose: reinforcing the idea of apartment dwellers as the core of Spain’s urban communities. Spain has one of the highest percentages of flat residents in Europe, according to Eurostat. Almost two-thirds of the population live in flats, the highest rate for any EU nation apart from Latvia. In Italy, the proportion is around half, and in France it’s just over a third. In the UK, flat-dwellers only make up 15% of the population. Some 65% of homes for sale in Spain are flats, according to Fernando Encinar of Spanish property site Idealista, compared to just 25% on UK site Rightmove. Teacher Miguel Cobos, 38, a long-time resident of the same neighbourhood in Madrid, currently lives in what he calls a “mini-flat”, a 25-sq/m renovated home in a corrala, a traditional 19th Century building. “Spaniards live in flats because there is no supply of houses at reasonable prices, and if the price is reasonable, they are really far away from the centre or from places of work,” he says. One day, he would like to own a house in the mountain village outside Madrid where his parents have a second home. But if he stays put, his options are limited. “In Madrid, practically the entire supply is flats.” Up, not out Spain’s apartment boom began in the 1960s and 70s under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, when people left the countryside to find work in the cities, leading to massive urban growth, says historian Gloria Román, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Radboud and the NIOD Institute in The Netherlands. “It was urgently necessary to build massively for the working classes. And it was decided to do it in height, growing vertically instead of horizontally because it was cheaper,” says Román. Spain’s restrictive zoning laws, still in use today, put a premium on land surrounding towns and cities. “Inefficient regulation, including very restrictive building codes, created incentives to limit development, so vertical property became much more efficient and cheaper because of the price of land,” says economist Javier Díaz Giménez of Madrid’s IESE Business School. Many Spaniards grew up in flats; using the lift in the building was second nature, and stairs within the flat were the stuff of fantasy. “It was something extraordinary, unprecedented, unheard of… that you could live in a house with two levels,” says Díaz Giménez, recounting his surprise when, on a trip to Dublin to practise English at the age of 12, he found himself staying in a house with stairs. Own your home  Spain may be a nation of flat-dwellers, but it is also traditionally a nation of homeowners. It’s another reason why flats – that were generally cheaper to buy – became so popular.  According to Eurostat figures, 76% of Spaniards owned their own home in 2018, compared to 65% of French and British people and 52% of Germans.  New rental laws and economic conditions during the 1960s meant that for the first time many Spaniards’ main goal was to own property, something encouraged by Franco, whose regime attached great importance to the home as the heart of Catholic society. “The apartment responded well to the double need to offer many housing units – in a short time and at a reduced price – and to the desire that it be owned,” says Román. “In Spain at that time, owning property became one of the main symbols of prosperity.”  New-build apartments held lavish inauguration events that included key handover ceremonies and the blessing of the new homes by a priest – acts that, says Román, were “conveniently publicised by the dictatorship’s propaganda machine”. Partly because of the government messaging, for many poor families owning a property “constituted one of life’s main aspirations”, she says.  It also made sense in a country where an inflationary economy meant most people put their money into bricks and mortar. “Financial markets were not very developed and there was a lot of inflation that would eat away at your savings. The best way to preserve their value was real estate,” adds economist Díaz Giménez.  ‘Intense feeling of community’  The root of apartment living may be economic, but is there a case to be made that Spaniards just like living shoulder-to-shoulder? For many, growing up surrounded by neighbours has fostered a thriving sense of community.  Marc Pradel, 40, an expert on urban sociology at the University of Barcelona, says the dominance of apartments has “generated strong and vibrant neighbourhoods in most Spanish cities, which has reinforced local social life”. In fact, these neighbourhoods and the allure of living in the heart of the town or city is what attracts many people to live in flats. Close-knit living is “one of the wonderful things about Spanish society” for journalist Clea House, 37, who moved back to her native Madrid from London to raise her children. “I wanted my children to thrive on that intense feeling of community and family closeness,” she says. “For me, growing up like that was special and I wanted my children to feel that too.”  One reason Spaniards cope so well living in flats is that they spend so much time outside them, taking advantage of the good weather to meet in town squares, parks and at their local bar. A 2018 Eurostat study showed Spaniards spent significantly more time eating outside the home than residents of many other European nations; 15% of Spanish household consumption was spent in restaurants or bars, compared to the EU average of 9%. A 2018 survey by housing solutions provider Velux also found that Spaniards spent considerably more time outdoors each day than Britons. Cristina Acha, 45, co-founder of AZAB architecture studio in Bilbao, says socialising in Spain is closely linked with public spaces. “In general, it makes us separate our homes from more sociable activities, which makes our homes a place of more domestic chores,” she says.  ‘Limited quality’  But living in flats can have its downsides. Poorer quality flats will have smaller kitchens and fewer rooms as well as absorb the noise and smells from adjoining flats.  For Acha, the main challenge is creating homes that combine intimate indoor space with “the maximum optimism that light, fresh air and nice views bring”. She believes that growing perception of access to nature as a universal right, plus technological change, will be reflected in the homes of the future.  One example: the rise in young freelancers who work from home. “This may mean the need to incorporate new spaces associated with work,” she says. The prolonged Covid-19 confinement has forced people to look at their homes in a new light, adds Acha. “In a certain sense it has been like re-examining an old relationship.”    It’s a sentiment echoed by sociologist Marc Pradel, who says lockdown measures that removed the option of using public spaces have revealed the “limited quality” of many apartments. He says it is hard to predict if anything will change in post-lockdown Spain, but thinks the quality issues highlighted during confinement will combine with general concern about housing that had been growing since Spain’s economic crisis.  And what about the eternal issue of noisy neighbours? For Clea House, it’s not a big deal. “I like hearing my neighbours and noisy living. It’s the way I’ve always lived – to me, that’s life. I like the buzz of the city and for me, part of experiencing that buzz is living in a flat,” she says.  But if lockdown is revealing the worst aspects of apartment living, it is also showcasing the very best. As well as the nightly applause for healthcare workers, social media videos have shown neighbours doing group workouts, bingo games and singing Happy Birthday to each other from their balconies.  For Miguel Cobos, if anything, the lockdown has reinforced community spirit. “Confinement has made us a little more human,” he says. “After the applause, I stay for a while chatting with an older neighbour who also lives alone, then we say goodbye, until tomorrow.”"
economic indicators,The rise of flashy new job titles,2024-09-15,2023-01-09,Alex Christian,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230104-inventing-new-job-titles,"Employees’ roles and seniority have generally been defined with straightforward terms. But new – even somewhat arbitrary – titles are emerging as work changes. What’s the harm? Chief executive officer. Marketing director. Lead writer. Sales associate. Job titles like these have generally been standard across work for years. They’re succinct and clear, communicating essential employee details such as job function and seniority. They make sense to employees and recruiters alike, leaving little room for ambiguity. However, job titles are yet another feature evolving in the changing world of work. Labels like ‘chief visionary officer’, ‘chief innovation evangelist’, ‘business development guru’ or ‘chief remote officer’ are emerging, making the traditional system seem too rigid, and perhaps even stale. On the surface, there may seem little harm in altering what an employee is called, or creating new titles entirely. After all, as work becomes more flexible, job functions and the way we describe them are changing, too. In many ways, these new titles reflect the evolving times; they’re empowering some employees to discover new talents, or feel a heightened sense of belonging.  Yet there’s a reason why traditional job titles have endured for so long – and why loosening the rules around them to create arbitrary titles may not always be the best approach.  Clear and rigid Job titles serve many purposes. In general, they’re clear and indicative of the employee’s seniority and responsibilities. For example, it's largely accepted that assistants are below associates, who are below directors, who are below vice presidents, who are below CEOs. Clear-cut titles signal hierarchy and responsibility, and illuminate a path to earning status and promotion. They’re also how workers look for appropriate roles when they’re job hunting, and what recruiters hinge their searches on.  While most industries have traditionally had some iteration of these status indicators, this is especially the case in hierarchical industries, where an employee’s title matches their rank in an organisation across companies. The legal field is a key example. “Traditionally, career progression in law is from trainee solicitor, to solicitor, to associate, salaried partner and then equity partner in most firms,” explains Rustom Tata, partner and chairman of London-based DMH Stallard. “It conveys relative seniority within a particular firm’s view as to the employee’s experience and development.” While many law firms have added new layers to their organisational structure in recent years through “senior associate”, “managing associate” and “paralegal”, adds Tata, the language of job titles and where they rank in a company remains clear and understood across the industry. However, although job titles may be fairly entrenched in industries like law and finance, they are evolving in many other industries, especially creative ones. In less rigid settings, employers have nearly free rein to create job titles for employees, whether new or newly promoted. These new titles can serve as recruitment or retention tools – and even grab attention from clients.  This was the case for Lennie Hughes, whose official job title is ‘head of hype and culture’ at Truant, a London-based creative advertising agency. This was not initially the title for which the company was recruiting; the position was officially advertised as a more traditional ‘head of marketing and new business’. But, says Hughes, as he interviewed, what shined through was his strong people skills and natural culture fit – rather than traditional marketing experience. Hughes worked with Truant to craft a new title for the role he’d lead, centred more on blending traditional external branding and communications with a fresh take on internal workplace culture. His daily tasks include curating live events, podcasts and apparel lines, alongside typical public relations duties like managing social media accounts and press releases. While marketing and new business are still in Hughes’s remit, he says the new title suits him better – he feels it’s “innovative”. He also acknowledges it’s not without strategic benefit. “If my job is all about getting attention, then the title should do that, too.”  A 'PR move'? Experts and employees alike say there can be an upside to flashy, even somewhat arbitrary job titles.  In one sense, explains Pawel Adrjan, director of EMEA economic research at the hiring platform Indeed, based in London, altered job titles can help make an employee feel more valued at a company. He cites Indeed data, seen by BBC Worklife, showing “people” is outstripping the traditional title of “human resources”; similarly, the standard title of “talent acquisition” is up 75%, while “recruitment” is down 19% since 2019. Similarly, language like “client success” and “customer success” in job titles is replacing “sales”. “‘Human resources’ can sound bureaucratic,” says Adrjan. “By instead using ‘people’ in the title, employers can say they invest in people. Through this language, companies are trying to show they value individuals as customers and partners, rather than resources to exploit.” They can also be exciting for employees, who feel empowered by bespoke, newly minted titles. “It massively boosts your confidence,” says Hughes. “They’re putting faith in your skillset, saying they’ll do everything in their power to create an environment in which you can thrive and develop.” He adds that because many job paths are no longer linear, traditional titles “can feel restrictive”. From the recruiter’s standpoint, they can help lure workers by signalling a progressive, even fun culture. These vague-but-flashy titles can also help companies tap a broad candidate pool. This may be especially useful in a tight job market, says Adrjan. “When hiring is so competitive, employers have to do more to stand out from the crowd: from offering pay, benefits or even job titles.” It is, as Hughes points out, “a PR move”. However, the downsides of new monikers can be significant, too.  First, they can sometimes be fluffy and meaningless, leaving workers with a grandiose title – but little guidance as to what their job actually entails. “As opposed to ‘barista’ or ‘HGV driver’, ‘team member’ has become popular as a branding exercise,” says Adrjan. “It suggests the candidate will be a valued member of the business, but it conveys no information as to the occupation.” And ultimately, when a non-descriptive, inflated job title is used as a costless recruiting tactic to boost worker ego, this ambiguity can lead to a mismatch in expectations between employer and employee. At the extreme end, this could lead to jobs being oversold, placing workers in a tough position where they end up in a role that doesn’t match what they thought was promised.  Unfamiliar titles may also hinder workers when they eventually look for new jobs. Adrjan points out that accurate, descriptive titles with simple and specific language help jobseekers find vacancies that are actually right for them. Rebranding jobs can “go too far”, he says: if the titles become “too generic and vague”, jobseekers may have a difficult time trying to match their employment experience to available roles. Recruiters, too, may not be able to identify the right candidates for new roles, with job titles that are, in effect, meaningless outside an organisation. It can also put candidates on the back foot if hiring managers do reach them. “Having an extremely uncommon word in a title may mean a worker finds it hard to explain their job to recruiters,” says Adrjan. He adds that in a broader sense, both workers and organisations could suffer. “Consistent titles help diversity and equity, providing clear career ladders, pathways and salaries that help diversity and equity.”  Regardless, as the nature of work changes, both in terms of how organisations function and the kinds of roles they create in response, it’s likely we’ll keep seeing new, unconventional titles emerge. But worker beware: as flattering and enticing the inflated job title may seem, there are downsides to consider.  Hughes says he’s still defining his new role. “We’re still feeling out what ‘hype and culture’ means on a daily basis,” he says. But he’s pleased with the choice, and optimistic about how he can grow alongside his one-of-a-kind title. “It has a broad definition,” he says. “It makes the possibilities limitless.”"
economic indicators,"As UK prepares for new lockdowns, Europe too is struggling",2024-09-15,2020-10-11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-54482905,"Just as Europe was hoping it could put Covid to rest, the virus has risen again, with renewed venom. Case numbers have been rising and in their wake, hospital admissions too. Each country is trying to find the right combination of measures - local lockdowns, test-and-trace initiatives, economic support and public communication - to drive down numbers as winter approaches. As the UK government prepares to unveil a range of new lockdown rules, BBC reporters from France, Germany and other European capitals explain how their countries are managing.  At the bottom of the article, we show how two key nations in Asia have seen a different trajectory. Deaths 32,521 | Death rate 50 per 100,000 people | Total cases 671,638 Warning lights are flashing in French cities as the long-anticipated autumn surge starts to make itself felt, writes Hugh Schofield, in Paris. All key indicators give cause for concern. Roughly 18,000 new cases are being detected each day. The number of cases is 116 per 100,000 people and also rising. According to doctors, the main vector is young people resuming social lives post-lockdown and then passing the virus on.  However, there is a change from the first wave in March/April because this time, thanks to testing, the big regional and city/countryside variations are clear to see. Increasingly the epidemic is seen as an urban phenomenon. This means that the government's response is not - and is unlikely ever to be - another national lockdown.  Instead the health authorities have devised a complex system of regional alert levels. About two-thirds of the country are now in a red zone, meaning the virus there is spreading. With each level new restrictions kick in. For example in Paris, on maximum alert along with five other cities, bars are now shut. At the lowest alert level, gatherings are limited to 30; at the higher levels the limit is 10. In addition, government representatives in the regions have discretionary powers to order other measures - such as the compulsory wearing of masks in Paris. Like in other countries, France's mantra is test, trace, isolate. The number of daily tests is now about 175,000. There is already a nationwide network of independent laboratories which have become testing sites, though others have been set up by town halls. When I got tested after developing symptoms in September, it took just a day to arrange the test and another day for the result (negative). However, by general admission, the contact tracing system it is not functioning as it should be. Simply put, there are too many cases and the government is recruiting an extra 2,000 extra staff. In keeping with its reputation, France claims to have the most generous state help in Europe to individuals and businesses that are suffering from Covid. People who are isolating can claim sick benefit in the normal way. If a child needs home care because of an outbreak at school, a parent can stay at home and go on furlough. Furlough has been offered to 1.3 million workers so far. The scheme, under which companies can be reimbursed 85% of a person's salary, has now been extended into the new year. If it is all very French, it is what people expect - not that they show huge confidence in the way the epidemic is being handled.  A poll by Elabe this week suggested only 35% of people trusted the government to ""fight effectively against Covid"". Some 73% said they were ""personally worried"" about the virus - an increase of four points in a week. Deaths 906 | Death rate 8.5 per 100,000 people | Total cases 109,374 If seven days is a long time in politics, how long is seven months in a pandemic? To most here, it feels like an age, writes Rob Cameron, in Prague. Back in March, the Czech Republic was feted for its rapid response to Covid, shutting its borders and swiftly locking down most of the economy. People were told to stay at home where possible. Masks were made compulsory indoors and out. Most respected the measures with good grace and humour. By the end of June, an infamous dinner party was held on Prague's Charles Bridge to celebrate the end of ""this difficult period of the coronavirus crisis"" (although not to declare the virus itself vanquished, as is sometimes wrongly claimed). At that time, the country of 10.7 million was seeing 150 cases a day and had recorded 347 deaths in just over three months. The sun shone. Holidays were booked. Masks and other restrictions were gleefully abandoned. Today, the Czech Republic has both the highest and the fastest-growing daily number of new cases in Europe, with figures almost double those in the UK. The ratio of positive cases to tests stands at 30% - a number that terrifies epidemiologists. The total death toll now stands at more than 800, but will almost certainly pass 1,000 by next week. Officials warn the country's hospitals could soon become overwhelmed.  The track-and-trace system has struggled to keep up. Authorities are taking days - sometimes 14 - to contact people who might have come into contact with an infected person. Its helplines are permanently engaged.  ""A difficult period lies ahead of us. We will need all hands on deck,"" Health Minister Roman Prymula, himself an epidemiologist, told a televised news briefing. Standing next to him on the podium was Prime Minister Andrej Babis, the man whom many Czechs blame for the current crisis. It was Mr Babis - it is widely believed - who vetoed a plan to re-introduce regulations on masks. In the end, the numbers began their inexorable climb to their current peak, and new measures are being introduced anyway. They were too little, too late. The PM has warned that a new lockdown cannot be ruled out and urged people to stay at home for the weekend. Czechs, meanwhile, are trying to grapple with the myriad new rules and regulations coming into force on Monday. Pubs, restaurants and bars will only be able to seat a maximum of four people at one table, and must close at 20:00. Wi-fi will be switched off in shopping centres to put off young people from gathering. Only groups of two will be able to enter shops or shopping centres together, and children aged 12-15 will take turns doing online teaching on a class-by-class basis, to keep classes from mixing in schools. Some scientists say the Czech numbers in March were so low it was wrong even to call it an epidemic. That, sadly, is no longer the case. Deaths 9,609 | Death rate 11.6 per 100,000 people | Total cases 320,899 Germany is widely held up as a model of how to manage Covid in Europe, but there is a nervousness in the air as the weather gets colder, writes Damian McGuinness in Berlin.  So far it has fared comparatively well. Total deaths are below 10,000 - less than a quarter the UK total, in a population significantly larger. But infections, which had remained low over the summer, have started to surge. The latest daily rate is almost 5,000 - a high not seen since April.  This is still low compared with other big European countries. And so far, Germany's track-and-trace system has held up well, but it has its limits. As infections rise, the system will start to struggle. This has already happened in Berlin, Frankfurt and Bremen. Other urban centres are also seeing a sudden rise in infection rates.  And while it's mostly young people now, the fear is that the virus will find its way into the older, more vulnerable population.  Which is why on Friday afternoon Chancellor Angela Merkel had a video conference with the mayors of Germany's 11 biggest cities to decide new stricter measures. ""Now is the time that we will determine in what shape Germany will get through the pandemic this winter,"" Mrs Merkel said. This weekend some cities, including Berlin, are introducing a 23:00 closing times for bars, cafes and restaurants. Limits on numbers of people allowed to meet are also being brought back. Mrs Merkel will meet mayors again in two weeks, and if infection rates haven't fallen, tougher measures will be introduced. The lockdown in Germany was milder than in other European countries — there were never restrictions on going outside, for example. It was also shorter, meaning that businesses suffered less of a hit. Mask-wearing has become ubiquitous, so there have been few outbreaks on transport, in shops, or at other services such as hairdressers.  Polling shows that most people support the government's measures. It's rare to see anyone flouting the rules about wearing face-coverings in shops or on public transport. Mrs Merkel's personal ratings are the highest of any politician. Unemployment rates have only increased by one percentage point since March. In September, the jobless figure even went down slightly.  But Germany would struggle to afford another lockdown — particularly with such generous state support. And unlike the UK, where furlough payments have tapered off in recent months, in Germany they increase the longer someone can't work, or is forced to take a salary cut, because of Covid. The 67% of salary paid to workers with kids for the first three months rises to 87% after six months, and the scheme is set to run until the end of 2021. Deaths 6,546 | Death rate 38.4 per 100,000 people | Total cases 161,929 ""Very bad"" was Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's assessment on Friday of how his country is faring. An understatement perhaps, given the Netherlands has one of the worst infection rates in Europe - almost 6,000 new cases recorded on Thursday, writes Anna Holligan, in The Hague. Like the UK, the second wave came sooner than many expected. Rules had been relaxed over the summer. There was an impression the Netherlands had beaten the virus.  Tests are in short supply, as are the staff to do them. The country can handle 17,500 a day but that means not everyone with symptoms can be tested. There is a joke that the government is adopting Dutch GP's usual advice: ""Take a paracetamol."" This weekend a long-awaited contact tracing app was due to go live. Most bars and restaurants already have registers for customers to leave their details, but few do. Where health authorities do have people's details, they have often been unable to cope and so contacts have gone untraced. In March, the Netherlands implemented a self-titled ""intelligent lockdown"", so life could continue while limiting the spread of the virus. More recently, people have been advised to wear masks in all enclosed public spaces. But introducing mask rules in two stages appears to have affected compliance. Mask-wearers remain in the minority. Looking in shops as I cycled down my local high street in The Hague, no-one was wearing a mask.  There has been a huge economic support package, covering up to 90% of wages. Business owners can apply for a ""gift"" of 1,000 euros (£906) a month. But the government focus now is on encouraging people to adapt to ""the new economic reality"". Chaotic and shambolic are words not often used to describe the Dutch, but increasingly they are how critics have characterised Mr Rutte's handling of the outbreak. Public approval has crumbled. According to the latest polls, support for the government's approach has dipped from 75% to 65%. Some 66% said ministers should be introducing tougher measures.  If there's no downturn in new cases over this weekend, the prime minister has warned tougher measures are unavoidable.  Deaths 32,929 | Death rate 70.5 per 100,000 people | Total cases 861,112 Spain started to see infections rise again almost as soon as its strict national lockdown was lifted at the end of June. There have been constant new outbreaks since then, and the government now accepts that a second wave is hitting the country, writes Guy Hedgecoe in Madrid. There are currently more than 10,000 patients in hospital with the virus. Spain has had the highest number of cases in Europe so far and last week registered another 57,247. Testing capacity has increased since the peak of the first wave, to about 50,000 tests a day. But the numbers of tests available can vary a great deal from one region to another and there are concerns that this has contributed to Spain's difficulties in managing the pandemic.   There are no figures showing the total number of tracers at work in Spain. The health ministry has a tracing app, Radar Covid, but fewer than 10% of Spaniards have it on their phones. The government recently extended a furlough scheme for businesses until the end of January. It allows companies to send workers home or reduce their hours, maintaining unemployment benefits at 70% for those not working. Although infections have been rising in almost all areas of the country since the summer, some regions have been particularly hard hit. In July and August, the north-eastern regions of Catalonia, the Basque Country and Aragón saw a sharp spike in cases and, more recently, the Madrid region has become the biggest source of new infections. The authorities have been introducing local restrictions to tackle outbreaks. In some cases, rules are introduced across a whole region, such as the closure of nightclubs in Catalonia. In other cases, movements are restricted in a town or village and locals are urged to stay at home. Face masks are obligatory in all public places for anyone over the age of six, with some exceptions, and it is unusual to see people flouting that rule on the streets of a city, for example.  But while Spaniards have generally obeyed these restrictions, there have been growing clashes between the national and regional governments, reflecting Spain's deeply polarised politics. The national government has forced through restrictions in Madrid and several surrounding cities, despite strong opposition from the regional administration. People's views on the government's handling of the pandemic tends to reflect this divide and be fairly evenly split - a recent study by the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed that 57% of Spaniards had little or no confidence in the government's response to the crisis. Deaths 433 | Death rate 0.8 per 100,000 people | Total cases 24,703 Life is almost back to normal thanks to a series of measures carried out with wide public support, writes Laura Bicker in Seoul. South Korea was one of the first countries to be hit by the coronavirus. At one point it had the worst outbreak of Covid-19 outside mainland China. But within weeks, doctors and health officials managed to get the rate of infections under control from a peak of 1,000 cases a day in late February to no reported cases by the end of April. They did this through mass testing and strict contact tracing. The country had test kits ready within two weeks of the first reported case on 20 January. Covid-19 tests have always been easily available at clinics and hospitals, and South Korea was the first to pilot drive-through testing. They even came up with space-age telephone-box test booths where the physician was behind clear screens to keep them safe from infected patients. Contact tracing is done through surveillance. Once a case is reported, phone and bank records are pored over by tracing teams to try to find out where the infected person has been and crucially who've they've been near. Text messages are sent to everyone who may have come into contact with the virus, urging them to get a test. This has been one of the most controversial measures, but the majority of people have accepted it and prioritised controlling the pandemic over their own privacy. There are also strict quarantine measures. Everyone in isolation must use a phone app to record their temperature and symptoms, daily. Everyone coming into the country must serve two weeks quarantine and take a test. Going anywhere without a mask is unthinkable here. You would be the odd one out. It is mandatory on public transport and taxis. But all these measures combined have kept this country out of lockdown and the economy largely open. When infections rise, stricter measures are put in place. Schools opened in May but some were closed again after a surge in local cases. Nightclubs and karaoke bars were shut after outbreaks and have remained closed until this week. They are only allowed to reopen if they adhere to strict disinfection guidelines. At one point there was a 21:00 curfew on restaurants in the capital, Seoul. But now, social distancing guidelines are back to their lowest level. There have also been a number of  financial support programmes in place. There has been broad support for South Korea's coronavirus measures. The current administration won a landslide election in April for the first time, which most believe was due to the effective handling of the pandemic. There are still cases reported every day, but life is almost as back to as normal as it can be. We can see friends, eat out, have drinks and travel within the country. Pupils are back at school. Whatever concerns there have been over privacy, most have seen it as a price worth paying. Deaths 27 | Death rate 0.5 per 100,000 people | Total cases 57,866 Singapore has so far avoided the second spikes seen in Europe, writes Karishma Vaswani. As well as the test, trace and isolate doctrine of other countries, Singapore's mandatory mask wearing, strict penalties for rule breaking, and technological tools like a ""trace together"" token, have helped control the virus. The token, which can be worn on a lanyard, uses Bluetooth to look for other users' devices. It tells you if you've been in contact with someone who has been infected - so you can isolate yourself. Singapore was the first country in the world to have a contact-tracing phone app, but the token is seen as more reliable. Initially, it was targeted at the elderly - who may not have smartphones - and young. But now everyone's being encouraged to get one. The city-state, with a population of 5.6 million, was quick to react at the start of the pandemic, after a first round of infections sparked by tourists from Wuhan in China.  Through a meticulous contact tracing and quarantine programme, numbers were kept low. As early as March, it was seen to have beaten the virus, and earned the ""gold standard"" moniker for its efforts. Lockdown had been avoided. But a mass outbreak in the dormitories of low-paid migrant workers dashed those hopes. In April, Singapore went into lockdown for almost two months, costing the economy US$10bn per month in losses, according to some analysts. Six months on, things appear to have been brought under control. But officials are more modest now about their success. The majority of those with Covid are being housed in community isolation facilities - rather than hospitals. These are dedicated to people who aren't severely ill so don't need to be in hospital. Key to this strategy is the opening up the economy - and ensuring that trade dependent, open-bordered Singapore can bounce back when international travel starts again. The economy is slowly restarting, and the plan is to move into the next phase of its recovery programme, by allowing more people to meet in conferences, and weddings. Still, businesses have suffered. To help them Singapore has doled out almost $70bn in wage subsidies, loans to small- and medium-sized companies, and cash handouts to Singaporeans to supplement their living expenses.  But the government is extremely concerned about how the economy will fare as Singapore depends on external trade, tourism and travel to keep growth here strong. Officials say the economy could contract by 7% this year - the worst performance since independence. Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has warned the country is at a ""critical juncture"" in its economic development. Independent economists say Singapore's contraction could be much worse, if a vaccine isn't developed soon.  Statistics as of Saturday 10 October, from Johns Hopkins University, except France"
economic indicators,Unemployment in NI rose by almost 90% in April,2024-09-15,2020-05-19,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-52719592,"Unemployment in Northern Ireland rose by almost 90% in April, official figures suggest. The figures from the NI Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) are the first official indicator of the impact of coronavirus on the NI economy. They show that claimant count unemployment increased from 29,700 to 56,200. That is the highest monthly increase since records began and brings the claimant count back to 2014 levels. Claimant count includes Jobseeker's Allowance Claimants and those claimants of Universal Credit who were claiming principally for the reason of being unemployed. The other, preferred, method of measuring unemployment is the Labour Force Survey (LFS). However, the current survey results only cover the period from January to March so do not capture the impact of the coronavirus lockdown. Across the UK, figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the claimant count in April went up by 856,500 to 2.1 million. Speaking in the assembly on Tuesday, Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said new claims for Universal Credit have gone up by nearly 300% since the Covid-19 crisis began. Ms Hargey told MLAs that since 16 March her department was dealing with 71,000 cases and it had seen new claims for the benefit increase by 294%. She also told MLAs there had been a 110% increase in claims for Jobseeker's Allowance. Ms Hargey told the assembly that her department has made 140,000 payments and was dealing with 7,900 claims a week. Nisra also record the number of proposed redundancies. In April there were 783 proposed redundancies, the fifth largest monthly figure in the last five years. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, the director of Ulster University's Economic Policy Centre said it ""is not wholly surprising"". Gareth Hetherington said: ""There are two factors which characterise this crisis: one is the scale of the impact, the second is its immediacy. ""What happened in the financial crisis took a long time to play out compared to what we've seen in this Covid-19 crisis."" Mr Heatherington said a ""big test"" will be when the government's furlough scheme ends in October, when ""we will be reliant on the level of demand that's in the economy and people's willingness to go out and spend"". Millions of workers across the UK are currently furloughed - not at work but with the government paying 80% of their normal wages, up to a limit of £2,500. He added: ""Economic recovery starts with the lifting of restrictions and, encouragingly, there seems to be growing recognition that it's not a simple choice between maintaining a lockdown and saving lives on the one hand or lifting restrictions and saving the economy on the other. Mr Heatherington said there is a need for retail, hospitality, construction and manufacturing sectors to return to work at ""a viable level in the short term, but long before October""."
economic indicators,"Another 15,000 Scots seeking work over lockdown",2024-09-15,2020-07-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-53427171,"Unemployment in Scotland rose between March and May as the impact of lockdown was felt, official figures indicate. Scotland's unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in the period, a 0.6% increase on the previous quarter. This was higher than the UK unemployment rate of 3.9%. The number of unemployed Scots was up by 15,000 to 120,000. About 28,000 left jobs but were not looking for new work.  However, the figures were not as high as many feared due to the number of people on furlough. There are nearly 750,000 workers in Scotland on the UK government's Job Retention Scheme.  Economists say the full effect on employment will not be felt until the scheme ends in October. Because of the effect of the furlough scheme on the employment market, analysts say the number of hours worked per week is currently a truer reflection of the impact of the coronavirus crisis. The figures showed a sharp decline of nearly 17% in the number of hours worked in May across the UK. After inflation, average pay was down by 1.3%. The Scottish government's Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the UK government's Job Retention Scheme will have offered ""some relief"", and called for the UK government to extend its furlough scheme. She said: ""The Job Retention Scheme will end in October but we believe the UK government must extend the scheme, particularly for sectors that have been most affected by Covid-19, for example travel and tourism and hospitality, given that most of these sectors will not have fully recovered by then."" Ms Hyslop added that the Scottish government had provided a package of support to businesses totalling over £2.3bn.  The UK government's Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said the figures highlighted the impact coronavirus was having on the economy.  He added: ""The UK government has provided unprecedented support for people and businesses in Scotland during this pandemic. Almost 900,000 jobs across Scotland are being supported through the UK government's ground-breaking furlough and self-employed schemes.  ""People and businesses in Scotland also continue to benefit from UK-wide schemes such as the tourism VAT cut, company loans, VAT deferral, and universal credit.""  He said the UK government was committed to getting Scotland's economy back on track, adding: ""We urge the devolved administration in Scotland to work with us on that."" The expectation remains of a big surge in unemployment by the end of this year; the figures for March, April and May only give a hint of what is likely to come. Unemployment was up in Scotland by 15,000, but at 4.3%, the jobless rate remains reassuringly low by most historic standards. Across the UK, the number of those seeking work actually fell, which appears to make little sense. Perhaps more significant is the number of people who were not in work or looking for work, counted as ""economically inactive"". Most of them are students, unpaid carers for family, or those with long-term ill-health. But the number fluctuates on the job prospects for more marginal participants in the labour market.   The total of ""economically inactive"" in Scotland was up by 36,000. That is likely to include many people who lost jobs, and left the PAYE payroll (HMRC is saying that fell 649,000 across the UK through lockdown), but who saw little point in looking for work while things were so dire and while they weren't supposed to be going out anyway. The decline in work and income for self-employed people is less clear. You can remain self-employed on these figures, while having little work or income. Other indicators point to the picture that is expected by year end: falling pay, just as we've heard from recruiters that starting pay is down sharply; a decline in the number of vacancies, though again, the pick-up in activity may see that rise in some months; and other survey evidence showing employers expecting to shed workers as they begin to bear the cost of furlough from August. The big story behind these figures is how well furlough has worked in keeping people on payrolls and employment-ready. As it is withdrawn, many will go back to work. Many have already done so.   But others will find - perhaps many others - that there's not enough work and revenue for employers to bring them back."
economic indicators,NI private sector 'in weakened state',2024-09-15,2022-12-12,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-63941314,"Northern Ireland's private sector output declined for a seventh consecutive month in November, an Ulster Bank survey suggests. It adds to evidence that the local economy may have entered a recession. However, the survey also suggests that inflation may be at or near its peak. The bank's monthly survey of about 200 firms is considered to be a reliable indicator of the private sector economy. Its chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said the local private sector is coming to the end of 2022 ""in a weakened state, with 2023 likely to be a very challenging year"". He added that the ""one silver lining"" is that inflationary pressures seem to be easing, with input costs and output price inflation rising at their lowest rates in 21 months.  ""With energy prices falling back, easing inflation, alongside less supply chain disruption, will be amongst the few positives during 2023,"" he said. The main UK rate of inflation, the Consumer Prices Index, is currently 11.1%. An updated measurement will be published on Wednesday. On Thursday the Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates from their current 3%."
economic indicators,Why heat is a 'silent killer',2024-09-15,2023-09-20,Cagney Roberts,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230918-how-community-maps-can-protect-children-from-extreme-heat,"Heatwaves claim tens of thousands of lives each year. Now a US mapping project is revealing those most at risk so they can get the help they need. On a hot evening in August, when temperatures in Irving, a suburb in Dallas, Texas, can reach a stifling 45C (113F), outdoor pursuits and an active lifestyle can often be challenging for Christina and Landon Howard and their two young children, aged nine and 10. ""We can't go swimming or take part in other daily outdoor activities because it's just too hot outside,"" says Christina.""Our son had to came back indoors the other day after 10 minutes of skateboarding because he felt exhausted by the extreme heat conditions."" Children are at higher risk of being hospitalised during heatwaves when temperatures exceed 29C (84F), a study on heat and children's visits to emergency departments in New York City found. Children aged 0 to four were the most vulnerable, followed by children aged 13 to 18 and five to 12.  Texan homes generally have in-built AC systems, but with little respite outdoors in the city heat, the increase in energy demand is an economic factor that the Howards are also finding burdensome. ""We're expecting to pay almost $1,000 (£787) for next month's electricity bill. This is already very alarming,"" says Landon.""There's a higher potential of having to fork out money for costly AC repairs that are going to be even more difficult for us to pay."" Christina and Landon have decided to take matters into her own hands. In August 2023,they started volunteering with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) urban heat island mapping campaign  after hearing of the scheme through a volunteer callout from the City of Dallas. The initiative collects hyperlocal data to understand vulnerabilities to heat exposure. For several years, Christina and Landon have also been part of a climate change focus group in Texas, helping to make this hidden heat crisis more visible. ""We have always been interested in how climate change will affect our lives and the world, even before recycling was a thing in Texas!"" says Christina. NOAA's heat maps are helping policy makers and families understand the real-life impact of heat waves with unprecedented clarity, by combining satellite imagery, air temperature and humidity data collected by volunteers, and enabling them to implement cooling solutions targeted at each community's specific needs. ""If community heat maps can help lobby governments in the US to recognise the long-term health threats of extreme heat, and the nuanced environmental and economic effects to protect our children and other families – we want to be a part of that,"" says Landon. The Howard family are not the only ones who are experiencing the challenges of extreme heat. As global temperatures continue to rise, extreme heatwaves have become increasingly common in cities around the world. Heatwaves are also projected to cause 38,000 worldwide deaths per year by 2050, with 1,300 deaths already happening each year in the US. The majority of these deaths occur in children under the age of five and adults over 65 years old, according to a report by the World Health Organization. ""We call extreme heat a 'silent killer', [as] we might not see the impacts right away,"" says Morgan Zabow, climate and health communication and outreach coordinator of the National Integrated Heat Health Information System  - a US organisation that provides awareness and science-based information to protect people from heatwaves. Heat can also worsen pre-existing medical conditions such as respiratory and cardiovascular conditions in young children. ""Heatwaves pose a greater risk to otherwise healthy children. They are less able than adults to regulate their body temperature, they sweat less, and their heart and breathing rates are faster than adults,"" says Kimberley O'Sullivan, senior housing and health researcher at the University of Otago in New Zealand. Babies and children living in poorer neighbourhoods are among the most vulnerable to rising heat, and those belonging to ethnic minority groups. The health risks can start even before children are born – and the impact can extend beyond their childhood. One study that examined the impacts of exposure to extreme temperatures in New York City found babies born in temperatures above 29C (85F) and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tend to have a reduction of 1.8g in birth weight, which is projected to increase to 4.6g by 2070. Heatwaves, like other extreme weather events, exacerbate the divide between wealthy, often white communities in the US, and their economically disadvantaged or ethnic minority neighbours.  ""One reason for this is that a lot of people living in hot inner-city neighbourhoods, known as 'urban heat islands', are not prepared for the heat,"" says Nicole Ngo, lead author of the study and associate researcher in planning and public policy at the University of Oregon. Urban heat islands are dense areas with fewer trees, more buildings and black asphalt from sidewalks that absorb heat. They can be up to 6.7C (12F) hotter in the evenings than nearby areas which have more trees, grass and less black asphalt, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. The now-illegal practice of redlining, when federal governments labelled non-white neighbourhoods as undesirable, has historically influenced how much local funding has gone to these areas. Lower income families and communities of colour are more likely to reside in more densely populated areas, with closer proximity to polluting industries such as energy, construction and transport. And a growing body of research suggests that life in these areas is especially tough for children.But does this mean that people living in these areas don't want to take action? ""There is a negative assumption that poorer families are so pre-occupied with economic and social issues that climate change wouldn’t be of interest to them,"" says Merill Singer, professor of anthropology at the University of Connecticut in the US, whose research focuses on the community impact and perceptions of climate change in medical anthropology. One study of a neighbourhood in Hartford, Connecticut, home to a large Latinx population, found that residents feel excluded from climate change information. Participants were very interested in how heatwaves were affecting the health of their babies and young children. ""We found in our research that residents were very concerned because they were already feeling the impacts and suffering the consequences,"" says Singer. ""They want more information and want to participate."" Heat maps are emerging as a powerful tool to help vulnerable communities access this information and provide valuable insights into temperature patterns and locate hotspots. This is enabling policy makers to make better decisions about ways to reduce the impact of rising temperatures. Carbon Count The travel emissions it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. NOAA and its science partner, Capa Strategies, have been mapping more than 70 communities across 22 US states to identify where the hottest neighbourhoods are, why they are hotter than others, and how this affects people living there. They have been working with citizen scientist volunteers who often already reside in a vulnerable area or have an interest in climate change. Since launching the project in 2017, NOAA has recruited more than 20,000 community volunteers. The project gathered more than one million measurements in 2022. Heat data is collected by the volunteers and is then used to aid federal governments to implement cooling solutions in each city through urban greening initiatives, daylighting streams – the process of uncovering buried waterways and restoring them to provide environmental benefits - as well as  building efficiency projects and cooling stations. Led by a team of local community leaders, the volunteers use heat sensors mounted on their own cars to record temperatures on the hottest days of the year. This project is different to other federal heat mapping initiatives because it is a community effort, enabling residents who may not have had access to heat information before. Although previous mapping studies have measured land surface temperatures, NOAA follows a different approach to its data by looking at air temperature and humidity. ""Land surface measurements are useful in some circumstances, when monitoring weather and climate patterns, for example, but they give a less accurate picture of the heat that people experience every day, namely air surface temperatures,"" says Zabow. ""Our urban heat map data is far more accurate to quantify the human experience when talking about the impact of heat on people,"" she adds. The mapping project aims to share awareness about how to protect children from extreme heat and empower others who have an interest in tackling climate change. ""It's not just about government officials going into a city, taking measurements, and never speaking to them again,"" says Zabow. ""It's people from these communities collecting data, who become volunteers and are passionate about learning about the impact heat is having on their children and their neighbourhoods."" The Howard family are an example of how local people can benefit from getting involved in heat awareness initiatives. ""We had a fun family day out in our car with our children – even though it was the hottest time of the day when we were collecting data,"" says Christina. ""Through this experience and working with the City of Dallas and NOAA, we learned how to identify symptoms of heat-related illnesses and where to find resources online and in our community about ways to protect our children during heatwaves. ""We check in with our children more often to see if they are hydrated, and we've introduced more indoor play like board games and creative activities, like baking and writing stories, to motivate our children if outside play is limited when it is too hot outside,"" she says. ""Volunteering gave us a better understanding of how the environment plays its role in the impact of heat around us,"" says Landon. ""Our data readings were noticeably cooler in neighbourhoods with more green space and trees, than those in more built-up areas."" Once the data is collected by the volunteers, it is stored in NOAA's Environmental Visualisation lab in Maryland, and is combined with census data from the White House Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, which identifies communities that are marginalised and overburdened by pollution. This is then aggregated through an interactive dashboard to prompt federal agencies to investigate how disadvantaged communities are being exposed to higher temperatures. The dashboard shows the disparity of health risk between those living in low-income communities or minority groups and more affluent white neighbourhoods. Federal agencies signed up to the programme can use this data to implement strategies to make heat information and resources more accessible in their city, and plan bigger housing and urban development initiatives, such as the introduction of 100 new shaded bus stop shelters in Las Vegas by the Regional Transportation Commission, with plans to expand to 80% of neighbourhoods where some of the hottest readings are. Zabow says the heat maps are making local decision makers pay closer attention to heat issues in their communities and implement effective cooling solutions. ""South Carolina recently declared a heat safety awareness week and we're seeing first-hand how this is positively impacting local neighbourhoods there. They are using our heat island data to build urban farms and a new energy efficient hospital in Charleston,"" she says. Urban agriculture can help reduce temperatures by offering shade and cooling. Increasing urban greening, by for example introducing urban farms, can lower night-time temperatures by 1.1C (2F) in surrounding areas.  The upgraded Medical University of South Carolina hospital has increased the energy efficiency of its buildings by replacing old boiler controls and sensors, retrofitting water fixtures and fume hoods and installing LED lighting upgrades. The renewable energy developer of the hospital, Ameresco, has projected an annual carbon reduction of 3,223 tonnes and annual energy savings of $2,839,000 (£2,275,000). Dallas is the seventh hottest city in the USA according to the Texas Trees Foundation - a non-profit organisation that aims to improve green spaces and plant trees in urban areas. The foundation is combatting extreme heat and heat inequality using existing data from their urban heat island management study. It has set a target to protect and increase Dallas' tree canopy from 32% to 37% by 2040, totalling to almost 15 million trees in the city. In 2015, the Texas Trees Foundation launched a 'cool schools' programme to plant more trees in lower income neighbourhoods, with the aim of providing at least a minimum of 27% shading and cooling relief. The programme has been an effective education effort and it has seen 300-500 children volunteers from each school participate in planting trees. To date the volunteers have planted over 2,000 trees around their school campuses. The Texas Green Schools project in Houston has used heat watch mapping data to introduce a programme aimed at reducing energy consumption in schools and increasing access to green spaces for students in lower-income neighbourhoods. Measures include building shade structures and installing energy-efficient air conditioning systems to reduce indoor temperatures in schools by 15-20C (59-68F), and providing cooling relief for students who live in hotter neighbourhoods. ""Increasing building standards and building in a more energy-efficient way is integral to mitigate the effects of extreme weather, and the long-term effects on young children,"" says O'Sullivan. But gathering data for the heat maps can prove challenging. The project relies on accurate temperature readings from various sources, including community volunteers, weather stations and satellites. ""In some cases, there can be gaps in heat data particularly in areas where there is limited monitoring infrastructure. This can lead to incomplete heat maps, potentially overlooking hotspots or temperature extremes,"" says Singer. Defining the effectiveness of cooling measures can also be complex. Air conditioning, green roofs, tree planting and heat awareness campaigns have varying levels of advantages for vulnerable communities, and will depend on factors like the local climate of an area, ambient pollution – which can be 5% higher than in more rural areas - as well as building design and government maintenance and policy. ""Evaluating the impact of these measures requires rigorous monitoring and analysis which might not always be readily accessible,"" says O'Sullivan. Air conditioning and improving energy efficiency can help keep people cool in hot weather but these measures may not be cost-effective and accessible for poorer families. Some experts argue that these solutions may not address the underlying issue of energy poverty in low-income communities. ""In places like New York City, there are many people who don't have [air conditioning] units because there are building regulations or economic barriers to purchasing them. They also use up a lot of energy,"" says Ngo. ""Challenges such as government legislation, funding and data availability and technical difficulties have limited NOAA's mission to extend the mapping project across the US and worldwide,"" says Zabow. ""Governments and local decision makers often prioritise emergency responses to other climate risks, such as hurricanes, flooding and drought, over heat mitigation."" ""If a tornado, an active wildfire, or flooding comes through a town, you're going to see the destruction. Heat is unfortunately harder for governments to prioritise and fund. We hope to partner with more federal partners and volunteers to build more cooling solutions to protect young children,"" she adds. Heat is becoming increasingly dangerous and it's a threat that is not going away. Community heat maps may not solve the long-term problem, but they are a step in the right direction, by providing awareness and empowering vulnerable children and their families, like the Howards. ""How do we fight off these massive heatwaves that keep happening year upon year?"" says  Christina. ""We want to give our kids the tools to protect themselves from extreme heat right now and when they're older. Who knows what might become of the world in the future there's not enough heat research and actionable change."" -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

economic indicators,The 'vibecession' driving holiday mass layoffs,2024-09-15,2023-12-14,Alexis Benveniste,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231213-the-vibecession-driving-holiday-mass-layoffs,"The holiday season brings cheer for some, but layoffs for others. What's with the practice – and why does it feel so acute right now? On 13 December, US marketplace-platform Etsy announced it would be laying off 11% of its staff, cutting more than 200 jobs. Two days earlier, US financial firm State Street announced they'd lay off 1,500 workers; the same day, toy-maker Hasbro reported cuts of more than 1,000 jobs. This news came just days after Swedish streaming service Spotify laid off 1,500 employees, and global publisher Condé Nast cut 5% of its workforce. In the UK, pharmaceutical companies, banks, automakers and consulting firms also announced sweeping layoffs, shuffling off workers in the last few months of the year. With the holidays in full swing, the months of November and December feel like a particularly cruel time to let people go. Why does it happen?  This year, at least, rocky economic headwinds may play a role, says Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University. He believes most companies that conducted these end-of-year mass layoffs did so under the assumption that an economic downturn is imminent. He calls this response a ""vibecession"", where perceptions drive action – even if the data doesn't tell a story to back up the widespread scepticism. And indeed, the numbers largely don't. Although consumer confidence is down, and many people perceive a weak economy amid inflation and a tightening jobs market, indicators show the economy is mostly strong. This misalignment, says Bloom, feeds into companies scrambling to boost end-of-year-profits in anticipation of a sharp economic downturn, despite the data to the contrary. Hence, layoffs based on ""vibes"". ""Companies try hard to avoid layoffs over the holiday season, so those making cuts now must be under some pressure,"" says Bloom. ""This is in response to something they did not see two months ago, but is now so pressing it can't wait another two months."" Shirley Lin, a professor at Brooklyn Law School in New York, is more sceptical that these cuts are unique to current economic conditions. While layoffs may particularly be high in sectors including tech and media right now, she says end-of-year job cuts are a common business practice across industries. ""Companies typically track their financials to the calendar year when reporting quarterly results,"" she says. ""A company's annual reports to shareholders, which are also important to attract new investors, include last-quarter financial results."" Holiday-season layoffs then are often the result of last-minute cost cutting intended to boost a company's balance sheet for the benefit of shareholders. In addition to saving on paying employee wages, says Lin, cuts also enable employers to avoid paying out bonuses, many of which land at the end of the year. Yet while the timing of these layoffs is not a new business practice, Lin believes the current, highly active state of labour has raised the profile of these holiday-season job cuts. ""We're seeing a historic surge of public support for workers' rights,"" she says. ""In recent years, there's been growing interest in companies and shareholders taking workers' wellbeing and contributions to the company's success back into account, along with the equitable workplace policies."" So, although cutting workers in Q4 is a straightforward way to shore up a company's end-of-year financials, Lin says the approach is ultimately harmful to a company's stakeholders, employees and business partners. ""Layoffs just before the holidays can damage company morale and its public image,"" she says. ""The timing of these layoffs can seem particularly cruel, since worker productivity in the US has soared, but historically without similar levels of wage growth."" No matter the reasons for these layoffs – be it real circumstance, perceived financial vibes or long-standing financial calculus – the newfound scrutiny might have some employers thinking twice about axeing jobs at the holidays."
economic indicators,Want to live in a well-run country?,2024-09-15,2018-01-08,Lindsey Galloway,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20180107-what-its-like-to-live-in-a-well-governed-country,"From Canada to Botswana, these six nations consistently rank highest for their progressive social policies, trust in government and effective justice system. What makes a country well-run? Whether minimising corruption or spearheading educational and medical initiatives, governments around the world use different policies to facilitate a high-functioning society. To quantify the effectiveness of these policies, indexes like the World Justice Project’s Rule of Law Index, the World Bank’s Governance Index and the Social Progress Index survey residents, compile publicly available statistics and rank countries based on their performance across different categories. While each index varies in their precise ranking, certain patterns emerge across all three, with the same countries consistently at the top for their progressive social policies, trust in government and effective justice system. Still, policies are only as good as the people they affect, so we talked to residents living in some of these countries to find out which factors most influence their daily lives. You may also be interested in: • The world’s most welcoming countries • The happiest countries for expats • Countries where people live the longest Denmark While all the Nordic countries rank consistently high across every index, Denmark inches out its neighbours (and blows away the rest of the world) with near-perfect scores on the ‘Basic Human Needs’ ranking in the 2017 Social Progress Index, which includes meeting the nutritional and medical needs of its citizens and giving access to basic knowledge and communication. These benefits are offered to more than just native-born residents. “The general health and social system is well-developed and accessible to anyone living in Denmark, and as a student you can get financial assistance and free language classes,” explained German native Anne Steinbach, editor-in-chief of Travellers Archive who recently lived in Aarhus, Denmark’s second-largest city, for six months. The social system also relies on a sense of trust, rather than paperwork. “When Danes are ill and they cannot go to university or to work, it's fine to simply call and let the employer know. In Germany, however, employees and students need to get an official certificate from the doctor,” Steinbach said. “Both countries are structured when it comes to policy and governance, but Germans like everything to be on paper, in order and certified, whereas Danes treat each other more like friends in almost every situation.” While life in Denmark can be expensive compared to other European countries, with the highest collective taxes in the EU to pay for these services, the benefits outweigh the costs, says Steinbach, and residents are friendly and welcoming to boot. “Danes are all about hygge,” she said, describing a word that roughly translates to a cosiness shared among friends. “Having a movie night or a dinner night and inviting Danish friends over is a perfect way of blending into the Danish culture. Danes love to talk, to mingle and to simply sit together, enjoy the candlelight, good food and interesting talks.” New Zealand Australia and New Zealand are virtually neck-and-neck across the indexes, but New Zealand scores slightly better for overall political stability, fundamental rights and lack of violence/terrorism. “New Zealand was the first nation in the world to give women the vote [in 1893],” said Zoe Helene, founder of Cosmic Sister, who lived in New Zealand for 10 years and frequently visits her parents who are permanent residents. “A group of people brought a physical petition from one end of the island to the other, gathering signatures until it was a giant scroll. That scroll can be viewed in the museum now, and I think it should be something that tourists go to see, like the Statue of Liberty.” The country also has generous policies that support single parents, children, students and seniors. “You know the saying ‘you can judge a civilization by how they care for their elders’? When a New Zealand citizen becomes a senior at 65 they automatically start receiving a generous government allowance, no matter who they are, no matter how much money they earned or inherited, and no matter when they arrived in the country,” Helene said. (In order to receive the government allowance, a person must live in New Zealand for a minimum of 10 years.) Canada Both the United States and Canada rank highly across all indexes, but Canada scores higher in political stability and lack of violence/terrorism. In fact, Canada comes close to many of the Scandinavian countries in its near-perfect scores, including access to nutrition and medical care, as well as to basic knowledge and personal rights. “Canada is more progressive in its values than our neighbour to the south. For instance it would be quite rare for attitudes against a woman’s right to choose, or removing rights from LBGTQ persons, to become serious topics of debate,” said Alia Bickson, an Intrepid Travel guide who lives in Toronto and has dual US and Canadian citizenship. “Of course, individuals have varying views, but the country as a whole supports policies in line with compassion and acceptance of varying life choices.” One mistake newcomers sometimes make, however, is thinking Canadians’ courtesy and thoughtfulness makes them pushovers. “They have a sharp sense of fairness and will assess visitors’ behaviour with a clear eye,” Bickson said. “[Canadians] don’t suffer fools gladly, so do your basic homework before arriving.” Japan Not only does the island nation rank highest in Asia by the World Bank for overall government effectiveness, rule of law and political stability, it also received the highest marks in Asia from the Social Progress Index for its access to basic knowledge, water and sanitation, and access to nutrition and medical care. “The effects of government policies are often quite evident in cleanliness, efficiency and functioning of tax-paid parts of society,” said Adam Goulston, a cross-cultural resume writer who lives in Fukuoka but is originally from the US. “Part of this can be attributed to the natural tendency of the Japanese to value social and public things and keep up appearances. However, a big part also owes to effective and in some cases quite liberal policies, especially in comparison to my home country, the US.” Health insurance is universal, though it can be expensive since it’s income-based and taken out of wages – but residents can go to any doctor any time and costs are capped. Though the aging population and population decline is putting pressure on the solvency of the programme, said Goulston, overall, the system works. Japan also has some of the world's best cancer doctors. The education system is another of the country’s strengths; elementary and secondary school is mandatory, and Japanese schools rank well globally. Though the schools are highly regimented and systematic – which can lead to over-standardisation, according to Goulston – they have prioritised nutrition as a key part of education, with school lunches prepared with locally grown ingredients and paired with lessons on healthy eating and food history. Botswana Botswana consistently ranks as one of the strongest-governed countries in Africa, especially in its role in containing corruption, regionally ranking the highest in both the World Bank assessment and Rule of Law Index. After a string of scandals in the early ‘90s, the government created the Directorate of Corruption and Economic Crime (DCEC) in 1994, which continues to investigate and prosecute officials accused of corruption. Not only that, but the national revenue from diamond mining has been fairly well distributed throughout the county. “The entire country was founded on national unity and that is still the case to date,” said Sehenyi Tlotlego, Botswana native and philanthropy coordinator for safari company Sanctuary Retreats. “We are a nation that believes and practices ‘Ntwa kgolo ke ya molomo’, which means ‘Disputes are resolved effectively by debating them to a conclusion, and not by going to war’.” The country is known for having strong personal freedoms, scoring high in both freedom of the press and personal property rights. That freedom extends to everyday interactions. “Batswana are easy-going people, that believe in open talk and do not take kindly any hidden agendas. It is advisable to be open and discuss issues in the interest of resolving them,” said Tlotlego. “We are also a very liberal society where colour, religion and gender doesn’t matter, and we will tackle, head-on, any form of injustice.” That has also led to strong social foundations that give citizens the opportunities they need to learn and stay healthy. Every village with 500 or more people qualifies for a medical clinic and primary school, said Tlotlego. The country also was early at recognising the HIV/AIDS pandemic and created a rigorous testing and counselling programme, with free antiretroviral treatment to every citizen testing positive. Conservation has also been a strength of Botswana’s government, which has led to tourism driving 12% of overall GDP. “Most of the funds accrued from the tourism industry is ploughed back into the protection of protected areas, wildlife management areas outside protected areas and the ever-growing anti-poaching unit,” said Tlotlego. “Botswana has set up and supported one of the strongest anti-poaching units in Africa.” Chile Ranked highly for its open and transparent government, control of corruption and access to basic knowledge and medical care, Chile has one of South America’s most stable and corruption-free governments. “Whereas you might be expected to pay a bribe to police or politicians in other South American countries, that doesn’t happen in Chile,” said Peter Murphy Lewis, owner of tour company Chile Guru and long-time Chile resident. Even as a foreigner, it’s relatively easy to buy property or to start a business (no more than a few weeks, according to Lewis) compared to other countries. “While there is bureaucracy, it's not overly difficult to navigate,” said Mat Newton, founder of TourismTiger and Santiago resident. While expats may get frustrated with the slow immigration process, once your visa is sorted, “life isn’t too difficult,” Newton promises. Health insurance is affordable and effective, but where the country really shines is its infrastructure. “Santiago, and Chile in general, has high-quality infrastructure which makes living there a relative breeze with none of the headaches one might associate with developing countries,” Newton said, referring to the country’s high-quality highway system and near universal access to water and electricity. Santiago also has one of the world’s largest urban parks in the world, the 1780-acre Metropolitan Park, and numerous bike paths that even Paul McCartney has traversed. While Chile is extremely open and friendly to foreigners, rigid social classes can make it hard to break into the country’s inner social circles, according to Lewis. He recommends that all newcomers join a local Facebook community group, so they can quickly make new friends and find referrals for English-speaking doctors and other services.

economic indicators,Which countries will recover first?,2024-09-15,2020-04-06,Lindsey Galloway,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20200405-covid-19-how-global-economies-will-recover-from-coronavirus,"Experts have already begun assessing how a recovery might look once the Covid-19 virus is contained, and which countries stand to bounce back best. Top 10 most resilient countries, according to the 2019 Global Resilience Index 1. Norway  2. Denmark  3. Switzerland  4. Germany  5. Finland  6. Sweden  7. Luxembourg  8. Austria  9. US Central  10. United Kingdom See the full list here The Covid-19 pandemic has injected an unprecedented amount of uncertainty into the global economy, as countries across the world battle growing infections, implement wide-ranging social-distancing strategies and attempt early fiscal interventions to stabilise markets. While managing the immediate health crisis is vital and necessary for economic stability, experts have already begun assessing how a recovery might look once the virus is contained and which countries stand to bounce back best. To better understand this, we turned to the 2019 Global Resilience Index by insurance company FM Global, which ranks the resiliency of the business environment across 130 countries, based on factors like political stability, corporate governance, risk environment and supply chain logistics and transparency. Pairing these rankings with their country’s initial response to the virus, we identified the nations across the globe that have a high likelihood of maintaining stability and resilience through the crisis. We talked to residents and experts in these places to understand how they’re coping now and what they might look forward to in the hopefully near-term future. Denmark  Ranked second in the index, Denmark scores high marks for its supply chain tracking and low governmental corruption. The country also moved quickly when it came to enacting social-distancing measures in light of the spread of the virus. It announced a shutdown of schools and non-essential private businesses on 11 March and closed its borders to foreigners on 14 March, when the country only had a handful of positive cases. But the moves have already proven effective. “Regular flu has dropped by 70% versus last year, which must be a good indicator of the effectiveness of the steps taken by the government,” said Rasmus Aarup Christiansen, managing partner of Pissup Tours, based in Copenhagen. “I was sceptical at first but seeing how almost all other countries have taken similar steps [like lockdowns and border closings] soon after Denmark, it seems the government was doing the right thing.” Danish culture, which tends to be trusting of authority and willing to stand together for a common cause, has also had an impact on the effectiveness of the measures. “The word ‘samfundssind’ (which roughly translates to “civic sense” or “civic duty”) is the new buzzword in Denmark on both social and traditional media, and most people feel a moral duty to make sacrifices for the sake of public health,” said Aarup Christiansen. “No-one wants to be called out for being responsible for endangering the lives of senior citizens just because they won’t give up their usual luxuries.” That doesn’t mean there haven’t been challenges, however. Aarup Christiansen has personally seen his travel business revenues plummet. While he appreciates the governmental financial aid packages, announced on 14 March (which include covering some of the costs of worker salaries), the rules and outputs have yet to be fully defined and put in place, leading to more uncertainty and layoffs. Still, the measures, like paying 90% of wages of hourly workers and 75% of those of salaried workers affected by the crisis, are being hailed as a model for the rest of the world, by essentially “freezing” the economy until the storm subsides. The model won’t come cheap however; the measures are expected to cost 13% of total GDP. You may also be interested in:  • The most inviting city in Africa?  • Five countries saving the planet  • The world's next superpowers There’s also the sense here that this is a global crisis, and Denmark’s resilience will no doubt rely on how the rest of the world adapts and maintains open trade. “Denmark may be able to gain a relative advantage by having dodged some of the more serious consequences,” said Aarup Christiansen. In fact, the country is already talking about loosening some of the restrictions by Easter based on the containment so far, according to a Bloomberg report. “Denmark’s well-developed pharmaceutical sector may prove an advantage,” said Aarup Christiansen. “I would, however, find no pride in Denmark being better off if it comes from other countries having to suffer.” Singapore Singapore scores high in the index for its strong economy, low political risk, strong infrastructure and low corruption in the survey, pushing it to number 21 in the overall resilience ranking. The country also moved fast to contain the virus and has had one of the flattest curves in the pandemic. “We have tremendous trust in our government, who are relatively transparent about every step they are taking to fight this crisis,” said resident Constance Tan, who works for data analysis platform Konigle. “As a general rule, if the government enforces something, we comply.” That said, there are still rule-flouters, and the country has taken away passports and work passes for those in violation, according to a 21 March report by Channel News Asia. “But as a whole, we work together, and we do not need to worry about social unrest, people dying on the streets or economic destabilisation,” said Tan. As a small country, Singapore depends on the recovery of the rest of the world to have the most successful rebound, but residents generally believe in the strength of the future here. “As a people, like everywhere else, I think surviving this will make everyone more resilient,” said native Justin Fong. “One thing for sure, this has forced the adoption of technology which will bode well for Singaporeans.” Many businesses like Konigle implemented work-from-home policies quickly, and the government released the Trace Together app to help track the virus, which many residents have downloaded. United States  To capture the United States’ broad geographic footprint, the index splits up the country into West, Central and East regions, but as a whole, the US ranks well (9th, 11th and 22nd, respectively) for its low-risk business environment and strong supply chain. Containing the virus has proven challenging in major metropolitan areas like New York, and unemployment has already jumped to historic levels, in large part due to the mandatory shutdowns of more than half of US states, which has particularly hit restaurant and retail workers and other businesses that rely on foot traffic. But the US government has moved quickly to pass stimulus measures to stabilise the economy, and social distancing strategies enacted elsewhere in the country, which seem to be having an effect, should lessen the overall impact of the virus, allowing for a quicker economic recovery. Financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are predicting a “V-shaped” recession and recovery, with an unprecedented negative immediate impacts (as is already being seen) but a relatively quick recovery in the later quarters of the year; while consultants like McKinsey are taking a more measured, but still optimistic view, on recovery based on the successful implementation of public health measures – like the lockdowns in place – and policy interventions like the already-announced $2t stimulus package, likely the first of many. The US is also critical to the world economy, representing a nearly a quarter of global GDP, and the recovery of the global economy is highly dependent on how the US fares. “Generally speaking, the US economy is better-positioned to recover from large shocks and potential longer-run shifts than much of the rest of the world. The population is on average younger than much of the rest of the world with more mobility, and labour market restrictions are generally lighter, thereby facilitating greater labour reallocation” said Eric Sims, professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame. “More immediately, the Federal Reserve in the US and the Bank of England in the UK (neither of which have yet gone to negative policy rates) have a bit more space to provide monetary accommodation than other central banks around the world, such as the ECB or the Bank of Japan.” To further enhance the US’ recovery, the presidential administration has proposed dividing the nation into areas that are less hard hit and allowing normal economic activity to recur. “I think those measures would go long way towards ultimately setting up the conditions for strong recovery,” said Peter C Earle, research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research, a not-for-profit academic think tank. “We want money, goods, services, labour and ideas to flow as freely as possible, not just domestically but internationally as well.” The US’ lack of universal healthcare has been one criticism of the county’s ability to handle the crisis, and one that needs to be addressed for future resiliency. “I think eventually the world can emerge stronger after the virus is contained and I believe the US can, too. But it all depends on the lessons we learn,” said Michael Merrill, an economist and labour historian in the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations. “We are going to have to invest in new forms of public health and create sustainable forms of social protection and institutional resiliency if we are to return to the commercially dense, interconnected, highly networked societies that were the norm only one month ago.” Rwanda We felt confident that the Rwandan government would handle the situation way better than in our home countries Due to recent improvements in corporate governance, Rwanda has made some of the largest leaps in the index in recent years, jumping 35 spots to its current rank of 77th most resilient in the world (and fourth highest in Africa). Most importantly, it looks particularly well positioned to bounce back from this type of crisis as the country successfully contained Ebola from its borders after an outbreak from neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2019. With its mix of universal health care, medical supply-delivering drones and thermometer checks at its borders, Rwanda stands to be well-equipped to maintain stability throughout the crisis, especially when compared to other countries in the region. “A lot of foreign students like me stayed behind because we felt confident that the Rwandan government would handle the situation way better than in our home countries,” said Garnett Achieng, digital content curator for Baobab Consulting and student at the African Leadership University, who lives in Kigali and is originally from Kenya. “Amongst foreign African students, the only anxiety comes with knowing that our families back home are not in the same situation we are in.” Rwanda was the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to impose a total lockdown, and is already distributing free food door-to-door to the country’s most vulnerable. While tourism is expected to be hit hard, as Rwanda is a popular destination for many international conferences and exhibitions, Achieng is hopeful that the country will have relatively few casualties to the virus, making it well-positioned to recover quickly. New Zealand Ranked 12th-most resilient in the index, New Zealand scores especially high in corporate governance and its supply chain. The country has also been able to move quickly to contain the spread of the virus by shutting borders to international travellers on 19 March and enacting a non-essential-business lockdown on 25 March. “As an island nation, it is easier to control our borders, the main source of infections. So the effective border closure makes sense,” said Auckland resident Shamubeel Eaqub, economist at consultancy Sense Partners. “Compared to other countries, the response in New Zealand has been bold and decisive.” The measures are paying off, as some epidemiologists see it as having potential to be one of few “normal” nations left, according to a Guardian report, eliminating all cases if measures remain strong for the coming weeks. With tourism and exports a major part of the economy, New Zealand will face some struggles to its economy in the near term, but this doesn’t necessarily have to be a bad thing. “By being insulated, we will have time to recalibrate,” said Dunedin resident Ron Bull, director of curriculum development at Otago Polytechnic. “We had already started talking about the impact of campers and backpackers on the environment, and this gives us time to weigh up what’s important against the waves of tourist dollars coming in.” Overall, the country is well-placed for a stable recovery, with low levels of government debt and the ability to enact quantitative easing to keep interest rates low. “We have fewer constraints to both blunt the impact of dealing with [the] pandemic and supercharge the recovery,” said Eaqub. “Most importantly, New Zealand remains a relatively high-trust country. This will be a strong foundation for recovery from the biggest health and economic shock in generations.” Bull agrees the country has a likelihood to come out stronger. “Just like a family living in the same house, you have to get to know each other,” he said. “It’s our time to sit down as a New Zealand family and decide who we want to be and make some decisions to make us stronger and better.” Living In is a series from BBC Travel that discovers what it’s like to reside in some of the world’s top destinations.

economic indicators,The rising threat from the oceans,2024-09-15,2013-08-19,Gaia Vince,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20130819-the-rising-threat-from-the-oceans,"In the latest in her series on phenomena and technologies that may profoundly change the state of our planet, Gaia Vince looks at why our oceans are rising, what the consequences might be and describes efforts to adapt to what may become a drastically reshaped world. Imagine the seaside was nearer. Not just a little bit nearer, but lapping uncomfortably close to your doorstep and rising. If you're one of the 10% of the world's population living in a low-lying coastal area, there’s a chance the ocean might get a little too familiar in the coming decades. Humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions have been building up in the atmosphere and warming the planet for the past 150 years, dragging us into the uncharted Anthropocene, or age of man. Almost all of the planet's tropical mountain glaciers have retreated or disappeared in recent decades, including those in the South American Andes, Asian Himalaya, and African Rwenzoris. The resulting meltwater is finding its way into the oceans. Globally, they are rising at an average of 3.5 millimetres per year – roughly twice the rate seen during the 20th Century. Sea levels are expected to rise by around 2.3 metres (7.6 feet) for every 1C of warming in the coming decades, according to a study published by scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research last month. Most of the rise in the past decade was thanks to thermal expansion – at higher temperatures the water takes up a greater volume because its molecules move about more. Now however glacial melt has overtaken thermal expansion as the leading cause of rising sea levels. At the poles, change is underway of a magnitude so extreme that Earth hasn’t experienced its like for over 10 million years. The Arctic is warming at least twice as fast as anywhere else on the planet. One estimate suggests future average global warming of 2-3C, for example, would mean Arctic warming of 6-8C. This is partly because of the hot southerly winds bearing soot pollutants converging on the region. These particles absorb the sun’s rays and when they land on the surface attached to snowflakes they darken it and speed up melting. Almost all the Arctic glaciers are shrinking. The Greenland ice sheet, the second largest in the world, is losing 200 gigatonnes of ice a year, four times more than a decade ago. In 2011 researchers found that the area occupied by crevasses in one part of the ice sheet had increased by 13% since 1985, speeding its flow into the sea. If the ice sheet melts completely, it would cause a global sea level rise of 7m (23feet). Its melting alongside the Antarctic ice sheet, the largest of all, would clearly be a global transformer of epic proportions. Climate models predict that the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Western Antarctica will reach a tipping point after which the rate will suddenly accelerate. This is because meltwater lubricates their faster break-up. Also, being darker than ice and snow, the water now covering a greater proportion of these areas will absorb more of the sun’s heat, speeding up melting even more. The various models differ on the rate of sea level rise they predict. James Hansen's group at NASA Goddard predicts a global rise of as much as 7m (20ft) by 2100. More conservative models, such as that of Stefan Rahmsdorf’s group, at the Potsdam Institute in Germany, peg it at 1.4 metres (4.7ft) by the end of the century. That would be enough to inundate low-lying islands like the Maldives, along with many of the world’s major cities. Even Rahmsdorf says that sea level rise of metres rather than centimetres cannot be ruled out if tipping points not included in his model occur. Atlas redrawn Many of the world's greatest cities would become unliveable long before the most extreme sea-level rise occurred. Here's a world map showing the landmasses most vulnerable to rising seas. As the waters rise, high tides, ocean swell, and storm surges will cause growing numbers of deaths as well as increased property and infrastructure damage. The oceans are not rising uniformly – the Pacific, for example, will rise by 20% more than average. And while tropical islands disappear, new ones are showing up in the Arctic. Uunartoq Qeqertaq (meaning Warming Island), for example, was born in 2006, the result of the melting of an ice-bridge that formerly connected it to mainland Greenland. Groundwater extraction for fish farms in China’s Yellow River delta may be causing land to sink, with the effect that local sea levels are rising nearly 100 times faster than the global average. The atlases of the Anthropocene will have to be redrawn. The changes could also lengthen each day by up to two-thirds of a second, because the melting of the ice caps would cause the oceanic mass to shift closer to the equator, increasing inertia and slowing the Earth’s rotation by a fractional amount. If the ice-sheets melt rapidly – within a few decades – it will be very hard for people to adapt. Current coastal defences would be inadequate to protect our settlements from such high sea-levels. Entire cities would need to move, including power stations, administrative offices, transport hubs and millions of houses and offices. On top of this, agricultural land and water sources would be fouled by seawater incursion, hitting our food supplies. The more developed the coast, the greater the economic loss. This map shows, for example, what the US stands to lose. People would have to move inland or to higher altitudes. Or, in the case of one New Jersey coastal town, submit plans to lift an entire downtown area several feet above its current elevation. Coastal refugees from the world's poorest countries, such as Bangladesh and Burma, would seek new homes at the same time as the richest New Yorkers and Shanghainese. Humans are ingenious, and a variety of creative solutions will no doubt be found, such as stilted tower blocks and floating cities. For example, billionaire Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal, is funding the Seasteading Institute, which hopes to create floating autonomous states. In 2008, the Institute launched a public challenge to create the world's first independent floating city by 2015. The Poseidon Award will go to the first seastead which houses at least 50 full-time residents, is financially self-sufficient, offers seastead real estate on the open market and is politically autonomous. Bangladesh is already preparing. Several amphibious floating houses and schools are being built, so people can rise with the waters. Designs produced as part of the Low Income Flood-proof Technology project have light and buoyant foundations made of either plastic bottles, or ferrocement – a combination of cement, sand, water and wire mesh. The houses themselves are made of bamboo. They are capable of rising three feet (almost one metre) from the ground, but the architects say they could be built to be capable of dealing with higher flood levels. In my next column I'll examine another potential global transformer. Please post your suggestions for topics on the BBC Future Facebook page.

economic indicators,Do we need a world without borders?,2024-09-15,2022-11-18,Gaia Vince,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221117-how-borders-might-change-to-cope-with-climate-migration,"With up to three billion people expected to be displaced by the effects of global warming by the end of the century, should it lead to a shift in the way we think about national borders, asks Gaia Vince? I've had an obsession with maps ever since I first sought my bearings in Winnie the Pooh's ""Hundred Aker Wood"", trying to discover where was ""nice for piknicks"", and the locations of the characters' houses. My childhood was spent studying and drawing treasure maps, charting imaginary lands and plotting routes to faraway places I longed to visit. Today, my home is plastered with the maps I've collected or been given – reminders of places that are special to me. By my desk, I have a large world map, the continents distinguished from the oceans by their mosaic of colours. Each coloured patch is a country, separated from its neighbour by a neat line drawn onto this two-dimensional representation of our world. Comment & analysis Gaia Vince is the author of Nomad Century: How to Survive the Climate Upheaval (2022, Allen Lane). The borders are cleanly defined, ink separating nationalities destined for different fates. For me, these lines mark exciting possibilities, with the potential for exploration and adventure, to visit foreign cultures with different foods and languages. For others, they are prison walls that limit all possibilities. Borders define our fate, our life expectancy, our identity, and so much more. Yet they are an invention just like the maps I used to draw. Our borders don't exist as immutable facets of the landscape, they are not natural parts of our planet, and were invented relatively recently. It can be argued, however, that most of these imaginary lines are not fit for the world of the 21st Century with its soaring population, dramatic climate change and resource scarcity. Indeed, the idea of keeping foreign people out using borders is relatively recent. States used to be far more concerned about stopping people from leaving than preventing their arrival. They needed their labour and taxes, and emigration still poses a headache for many states. There are, however, true human borders set not by politics or hereditary sovereigns, but by the physical properties of our planet. These planetary borders for our mammal species are defined by geography and climate. Humans cannot live in large numbers in Antarctica or in the Sahara Desert, for instance. As global temperatures increase, causing climate change, sea level rise and extreme weather over the coming decades, large parts of the world that are home to some of the biggest populations will become increasingly hard to live in. Coastlines, island states and major cities in the tropics will be among the hardest hit, according to predictions by climate scientists. Unable to adapt to increasingly extreme conditions, millions – or even billions – of people will need to move. The most densely populated areas of the planet are clustered around the 25-26th north parallels which has traditionally been the latitude of most comfortable climate and fertile land. An estimated 279 million people are packed into this thin band of land, which cuts through countries including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, the United States and Mexico. But the conditions here are changing. On average, climate niches – the range of conditions at which species can normally exist – around the world are moving polewards at a pace of 1.15m (3.8ft) per day, although it's far faster in some places. Adapting to the changing climate will mean chasing our own shifting niche – which for much of human history has been within the temperature range -11C to 15C (12F to 59F) – as it migrates north from the equator. True livability limits are the borders we must worry about as the world warms over this century, bringing unbearable heat, drought, floods, fires, storms, and coastal erosion that make agriculture impossible and displace people. Already record numbers of people are being forced to flee their homes with each passing year. In 2021, there were 89.3 million people, double the number forcibly displayed a decade ago, and in 2022 that number reached 100 million, with climate disasters displacing many more people than conflicts. Floods displaced 33 million people in Pakistan this year, while millions more in Africa have been affected by drought and the threat of famine, from the Horn of Africa to the continent's west coast. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi appealed to global leaders at the COP27 climate change conference to take bold action to tackle the humanitarian consequences of global warming. That change needs to be ""transformational"" according to the UNHRC. ""We cannot leave millions of displaced people and their hosts to face the consequences of a changing climate alone,"" says Grandi. Without action, hundreds of millions people will have to leave their homes by 2050, according some estimates. One study from 2020 predicts that by 2070, depending on scenarios of population growth and warming, ""one to three billion people are projected to be left outside the climate conditions that have served humanity well over the past 6,000 years"". With so many people on the move, will this mean that invented political borders, ostensibly imposed for national security, become increasingly meaningless? The threat posed by climate change and its social reper­cussions dwarf those surrounding national security. Heatwaves already kill more people than those who die as a direct result of violence in wars. Compounding this, the global population is still growing, particularly in some of the regions worst hit by cli­mate change and poverty. Populations in Africa are set to almost triple by 2100, even as those elsewhere slow in growth. This means there will be a greater number of people in the very areas that are likely to be worst affected by extreme heat, drought and catastrophic storms. A greater number of people will also need food, water, power, housing and resources, just as these become ever ­harder to supply. Meanwhile, most countries in the Global North are facing a demographic crisis in which people are not having enough babies to support an ageing population. Managed mass migration could thus help with many of the world's biggest problems, reducing the number of people living in poverty and climate devastation, and helping northern economies build their workforce. But the main barrier is our system of borders – movement restrictions either imposed by someone's own state or by the states they wish to enter. Today just over 3% of the global population are international migrants. However, migrants contrib­ute around 10% of global GDP or $6.7tn (£5.9tn) – some $3tn (£2.6tn) more than they would have produced in their origin coun­tries. Some economists, such as Michael Clemens at the Center for Global Development in the US, calculate that enabling free movement could double global GDP. In addition, we would see an increase in cultural diversity, which studies show improves innovation. At a time when we have to solve unprecedented environmental and social challenges, it could be just what is needed. How to think about X This series will change the way you look at the world. Whether it's the concept of ""time"", ""consumerism"", or even ""creativity"", many of us tend to think about – and define – certain ideas in the ways we’ve been taught. But how did our conceptualisation of these big ideas evolve? How to Think About X searches for new ideas about our lives, the concepts that govern them and our future. Removing borders or making them far more flexible, especially to labour flows, has the potential to improve humanity's resilience to the stresses and shocks of global climate change. Managed well, migration could benefit everyone. What if we thought of the planet as a global commonwealth of humanity, in which people were free to move wherever they wanted? We'd need a new mechanism to manage global labour mobility far more effect­ively and efficiently – it is our biggest economic resource, after all. There are already wide­-ranging global trade deals for the movement of other resources and products, but few that deal with labour movement. Some 60% of the world's population is under the age of 40, half of these (and growing) under 20, and they will form most of the world's people for the rest of this century. Many of these young, energetic jobseekers are likely to be among those moving as the climate changes – will they add to economic growth to build sustainable societies, or will their talents be wasted? The conversation about migration has become stuck on what ought to be allowed, rather than planning for what will occur. I believe nations need to move on from the idea of controlling migration to managing migra­tion. At the very least, we need new mechanisms for lawful economic labour migration and mobility, and far better protection for those fleeing danger. Everyone could be offered an official form of United Nations citizenship in addition to their birth citizenship. For some people, such as those born in refugee camps, lacking papers, or citizens of small island states that will cease to exist later this century, UN citizenship may well be their only access to international recognition and assistance, even though citizenship is a human right. Passports could be issued on the back of this. The political theorist David Held argued that we have outgrown our national bound­aries through increasing globalisation, and now live in ""overlapping communities of fate"" from where we should form a cosmopolitan democracy at a global level. Today, we are experiencing a planetary crisis and I believe it is time to see ourselves as members of one globally dispersed species that must cooperate to survive. The scale of the climate crisis requires new global cooperation and, I believe, new international citizenship with global bodies for migration and for the biosphere – new authorities that are paid for by our taxes and to which nation states are accountable. Currently, the United Nations has no executive powers over nation states, but that may well need to change if we are to bring down global temperatures, reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and restore the world's biodiversity. Global governance could also be useful in coordinating the vast new mobile workforce, perhaps using an international quota system to help allocate people to positions during the mass climate migrations of this century. But it would also face challenges created by bureaucracy, corruption and lobbying by powerful corporations. Underpinning global governance, however, there also needs to be strong states. The tension between the desires and needs of the individual and society are very real for us all, and hard enough to reconcile when our society is a small, closely knit group, let alone the population of the whole planet. It's hard to care, for example, about a nameless, faceless stranger in a country you've never visited when making choices about your own life in a city thousands of miles from them. Most people find hard to balance the needs of a stranger one street away. Successful nation states help to manage this with structures and institutions that ensure a useful level of cooperation between strangers that nurtures a strong society in which we all can succeed. We willingly make small, daily sacrifices of time, energy and resources as individuals – paying taxes, for instance – to ensure our societies operate. Most of us do this because it's our society, our social family, our nation state. The invention of the nation state has been a very powerful tool in enabling us to cooperate so well. As the political theorist David Miller put it: ""Nations are communities that do things together."" It would seem unwise, then, to try to completely dismantle or abandon our existing geopolitical system in the brief time we have to prepare for the massive disruption that is expected to occur over the course of this century. Only strong nation states will be capable of setting up the systems of governance that will help our species survive climate change. Only strong nation states will be able to manage a massive movement of migrants from different geographies and cultures to the native population. It may instead require a blend between internationalism and nation­alism. In recent decades, the growth of globalisation has led to greater internationalism – a citizen of London may often feel more commonality with a citizen of Amsterdam or Taiwan than with someone from a small country town in Britain. This may not matter for many successful urbanites, but natives of more rural areas can feel left behind by their own country as once dominant industries decline, and social spaces and cultural traditions dwindle away. This creates resentment and fear of the kind that can lead to prejudice against immigrants, as was seen in parts of the UK during the Brexit debate. Open borders do not have to mean no borders or the abolition of nation states, though. It may be necessary to explore different types of nation states, with different governance options. Will states that are most affected by climate change buy or rent territory in safer places? Or will we see charter cities that operate under different jurisdictions and rules to the territory surrounding them, or floating states that build new territory on the waves? It will take work to reinvent the concept of the nation state so it becomes more inclusive so that it strengthens local connections while forging greater and more equitable global networks. There are multiple benefits in encouraging commonality, a kinship with our fellows, based on our shared societal project, language and cultural works. These traits matter to people enough to make patriotism a powerful source of identity. So why not also engender patriotic feeling about our nations' air, land and water, to encourage people to look after them.? One approach, since we all face environmental threats, might be to enlist military and other security institu­tions in the struggle against climate change. National service for younger citizens and immigrants to help with dis­aster relief, nature restoration, agricultural and social efforts could be another solidarity-creating step. And we may need to restore or invent new national traditions that are environmentally or socially beneficial, and for which citizens can feel pride and respect. These could include social groups and clubs that sing, create, play sport or perform together, and to which members can belong for life. These traditions can help main­tain dignity in hard times and provide patriotic meaning for immigrants to assimilate to. The new patriotic narrative could be about civic nationalism, based on the common good, with rights and duties, and a passionate cultural attachment to nature, and to protecting and conserving places of national (or inter­national) importance. Costa Rica, for instance, embraced the term pura vida, broadly meaning ""good life"", as a national ethos, mantra and identity. Its use became widespread from the 1970s, when refugees from the violent conflicts in neighbouring Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador relocated to the country in large numbers. Costa Rica, a small Central American country that has no standing army and instead invests heavily in nature protection and restor­ation alongside social services such as health and education, used this outlook on life to help define its character and integrate new immigrants. ""A person choosing to use this phrase thus is not only alluding to this shared ideology and identity, he/she is at the same time constructing that identity by means of expressing it,"" says Anna Marie Trester of New York University. ""Language is a very important tool of self­-construction."" This offers us a new way of looking at national pride. It doesn't have to mean seeing ""your people"" as better than other nations', nor does it mean a centralisation of meaning and power. Instead, it can involve the devolution of traditions and an appreciation of regionality and of the enormous cultural value of new citizens. The European Union is an example of supranational identity that allows citizens to feel they are European and identify with the values of the EU,  but without having to give up their national identity. A similar idea can apply within nations as well as between them. In the UK, for instance, London's Chinatown is rightly a much­-visited tourist destination, as is Little India – they are part of the nation's identity, even though Chinese­ Brits and British Indians often face prejudice and socioeconomic disadvantage. To earn national pride rather than suffer divisive tribalism, a nation needs to reduce inequality. The state must invest in the people for the people to feel invested in the state. That means putting social and environmental issues first in ways that are for the benefit of all, rather than a small tribe of global aristocrats. The Green New Deals proposed in the European Union and the US are examples of policies aimed at restoring econo­mies, providing jobs and boosting dignity while helping unite people in a bigger social project of environmental transformation. Try, if you will, to clear from your mind the idea of people being fixed to a location they were born in, as if it affects your value as a person or your rights as an individual. As if nationality were anything more than an arbitrary line drawn on a map. See instead these lines as fusions of cultural richness, transitions rather than barriers across the possibilities that Earth's lands offer us all. * Gaia Vince is the author of Nomad Century: How to Survive the Climate Upheaval and a freelance science journalist and broadcaster. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

economic indicators,The mangrove that defied destruction,2024-09-15,2022-03-30,Jose Alison Kentish,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220329-how-a-caribbean-community-restored-its-dying-mangrove,"When a pristine Caribbean mangrove was decimated by a tourism project, locals on Union Island found a way restore it to its former glory. On a sweltering summer day in 1994, an ancient mangrove forest on Union Island was ripped apart.  A foreign investor had started the foundation work for a hotel, marina and golf course in Ashton lagoon on Union Island, one of the 32 Grenadine islands which dot the clear, blue waters of the southern Caribbean Sea.  The sounds of birds chirping and waves crashing against the intricately woven roots of the mangroves was replaced by the noise of excavators and cement trucks, cutting the trees to make way for culverts and concrete pillars.  Poorly-sized pillars collapsed, cutting off tidal flow in the 10-acre (4-hectare) lagoon. More mangrove trees began dying. The clear water turned putrid and yellow. And what was once the most ecologically diverse lagoon in the region became a barren eyesore and mosquito breeding ground. You may also like: Matthew Harvey, a local fisherman and campaigner, was 37 years old at the time and recalls watching the destruction. His home in the nearby coastal community of Ashton provides a panoramic, aerial view of the site. That view, which had brought him immense joy, began to leave him sad. The hurt was personal: for three years Harvey had protested the development. He knew it would destroy the mangroves and in turn, a fishery that provided the fishermen of Union Island and nearby islands with sea bass, herring, snapper, lobster, conch and shrimp. Harvey had warned that giving investors rights to the mangroves could mean unprecedented ecological disaster for the island. But like similar projects in the Caribbean, promises of development and tourists were too alluring for a government eager to attract foreign investment and reduce unemployment.  ""I tried, I protested,"" Harvey told me as we stood outside his home in January 2020. ""Mangroves are important to survival on Union."" Less than a year after dredging began, the Valdetarro Construction Company declared bankruptcy. Grace Deagazio, who formerly worked for the company as a secretary and public relations officer, says an environmental impact assessment was carried out before works started. ""The assessment was done at the time for the mangroves and there was no problem with regards to the coral reefs,"" she says. ""There would have been no major environmental damage to the island itself, but our company went bankrupt due to an unfortunate series of financial problems. Union Island unfortunately got stuck right in the middle of the company’s bankruptcy; the project got frozen and it’s unfortunate."" Future Planet also contacted members of the former leadership of the company but received no reply. The company declared bankruptcy in 1995. Ashton Lagoon's story is part of a sadly familiar wider picture. Despite their key role providing coastal protection, supporting local livelihoods and storing huge amounts of carbon, mangroves are disappearing, destroyed for coastal development. Globally, the area of mangroves decreased by over a million hectares (3,860 sq miles) between 1990 and 2020 – an area larger than the island of Puerto Rico. The economic fallout, including the loss of fisheries, has been calculated as greater than $40bn (£30bn) a year.  These forests of the sea are among the world's most at-risk ecological systems and are being razed four times faster than terrestrial forests.  But Ashton Lagoon is not among those statistics, because its mangroves and fisheries are now thriving. The story of how that happened provides a blueprint for how other degraded mangroves around the world could one day be revived. Mangroves live where most plants would die. Of the almost 400,000 plant species, only 1,500 are tolerant to saltwater. Some of these halophytes, as they are called, prevent salt from entering their roots, a process known as exclusion. Others excrete salt from special glands in their leaves. Ashton Lagoon has three of the world's 80 mangrove species: the red, which are excluders, and the black and white, which secrete salt. Today, the dark green, pointy leaves of black and red mangroves mingle with the round, light green leaves of the white to make a thick canopy. Its clear, emerald-green waters reveal submerged roots mooring the forest to the ocean floor. The area is a critical habitat for many species. Mangrove flowers attract birds like the egret, heron, bullfinch and hummingbird. Other birds, such as the brown pelican and the endangered West Indian whistling duck, use the forest for food and nesting. Fiddler and mangrove tree crabs scurry through the maze of roots, which also provide refuge to leatherback, hawksbill, loggerhead and the rare green turtles. Near the ocean floor, the ecosystem is home to large fish, like snappers and parrotfish, and juvenile fish, like the grouper, which can remain in the mangrove nursery for more than five years. ""Mangroves are essential to our livelihood, especially for us fishermen,"" Harvey says. ""Before the damage, there were nurseries for all marine life: conchs, lobster, fish, sharks. We fed our families and sold them to residents and businesses."" Harvey, now 62 years old, is fit and slim, a man always on the go. His toughness and strength were key to what happened on Union Island after the tourism development failed. In 1998, four years after the company declared bankruptcy, two Canadian researchers, Stephen Price and Purnima G Price, declared that Ashton Lagoon was ""ecologically dead"" in a report for the Union Island Association for Ecological Preservation. Mangrove forests are a notoriously difficult ecosystem to bring back once disturbed, they said, although damage to the lagoon system could be reversible ""to some extent"". In an effort to reverse the damage, Harvey, who was at the time president of the Union Island Eco Tourism Movement, teamed up with Orisha Joseph, director of local conservation agency SusGren, Lisa Sorenson, a conservation biologist and head of BirdsCaribbean, as well as officials of the Eastern Caribbean Coalition for Environmental Awareness. The trio knew that a scientist named Gregg Moore had also visited the lagoon in 1998 and conducted some tests, and they reached out to ask for his view. Moore, a mangrove restoration ecologist at the University of New Hampshire, was surprised to hear from the team. It had been 10 years since his assessment of the lagoon. For many on Union Island, including Harvey, those years had been spent taking care of families and making ends meet, though the daily sight of the lagoon was never far from their minds. It turned out that Moore's assessment was indeed more optimistic than that of the Prices.  Moore told them that while the lagoon was severely damaged and the remaining trees were suffering from heat stress and extreme salinity, there was hope. ""Mangroves are extremely resilient plants,"" says Moore. ""They're not delicate, but you have to have the right conditions for them. If you change the hydrology in the system dramatically, then you turn off their ability to self-regulate. Soil dumped during construction had blocked the tidal exchange and salt was no longer being flushed out and diluted."" He told Harvey and Joseph that, at the very least, tidal flow needed to be re-established in the system. Doing this, however, would cost roughly $700,000 (£530,000), an amount the island could not afford. SusGren approached aid agencies for funding and started a community-based ecological restoration program. Harvey continued his environmental advocacy.  In May 2007, a workshop organised by Sorenson through Birds Caribbean brought the local community together to hear from coastal engineers, tourism consultants and scientists. Residents, fishers, teachers, environmentalists and the business community voiced their concerns, asked questions and made requests. Moore, who attended this first town hall, says that residents had the final say on how to proceed – a crucial aspect of community-based restoration. In 2010, SusGren secured financing for the project, but it was quickly withdrawn because the government of St Vincent and the Grenadines had not granted permission for the restoration work. The go-ahead would come years later. For now, it looked as though, despite enormous community support, restoration was stalled. It had been 16 years since the mangroves had been decimated.  ""We felt that if restoration works did not start soon, a new developer would come in,"" says SusGren's Joseph. ""That fear is always there and we wanted to be the investor with the plan to protect the mangroves and provide opportunities for our people within them."" Then in 2014, the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre, the German Development Bank and the Philip Stevenson Foundation, which owns the neighbouring island of Petit St Vincent, came through with the $700,000 (£530,000). With funds and government permission now in place, work could begin.  On the surface, restoration work might seem as simple as growing new mangrove plants and embedding them among existing trees. But the reality is far more complex. Toward the end of 2017, excavators, trucks and bulldozers returned to Ashton Lagoon. But this time the machinery was there to undo the damage done a quarter of a century earlier. ""We dug out the place, removed thousands of rusty galvanised sheet piles and pillars,"" says Joseph. Construction crews removed collapsed concrete culverts and excavated openings in the piers of the abandoned marina. Soon the tidal flow began to resemble what it had been in the past. The next step was planting, led by Harvey. In 2018, he assembled a small team of four to replant the mangroves. Meshanda Laborde, a young woman from Union Island who is passionate about science, was among this group. The first step was to build a mangrove nursery using wood and coconut branches to regulate sunlight for the seedlings, she says. ""We then dug a small well near the shed to easily access water for the seedlings with the conditions closest to the environment we would eventually introduce them to."" Restoration planting typically involves potting seedlings in small, black plastic bags (Harvey eschewed these bags and used bamboo stems from Grenada) in shallow water in a nursery before moving them back to the mangrove for planting. The seedlings were collected in the lagoon, carefully transported to the nursery for specialised care and root development, and returned to the mangrove when the planters believed they were strong enough to survive. The team initially spent hours gathering as many ""wildling"" seedlings as they could find from mature mangroves. ""We gathered 1,500 and 1,700 wildlings in the first two weeks,"" says Laborde. Casil Thomas, another member of the team, recalls collecting, setting and nursing the first batch of seedlings. ""We had very early mornings, leaving before the Sun came up and we worked until it set. We pampered them and cared for them like our babies."" Three months later, strong, healthy roots were jutting out of the bamboo stems – some of them over a foot (0.3m) long, says Laborde. They were ready for replanting, although the holders planned to give them protection for a further three years. Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. ""We had already cleared out the rotting and dead mangroves, so we took our plants into those areas and started setting them into the mud,"" says Laborde. ""We were knee-deep in mud but we didn't mind."" Just as the team was experiencing some success, however, disaster hit the nursery. ""There was a rat infestation,"" says Harvey. ""Rodents cut all the leaves and roots of the plants, to make nests."" Despite constant monitoring, they lost hundreds of the seedlings. The team spent two weeks inspecting every bamboo stem and its seedling for damage. They spread a mixture of cement and cornmeal between the rows of plants to get rid of the rodents.  To regain some of the lost time, Harvey experimented with a new method. ""Instead of setting the seedlings in the shallow water where they take about six weeks to produce sufficient roots, we pushed them into the soil in the lagoon and within one week we got a good root system for planting,"" he says. ""I was happy because it worked and reduced the wait time."" Laborde, who had studied human and social biology at school hoping to become a nurse, says she began to think of the seedlings as patients. ""I learned so much, especially new planting techniques, even from the disappointments."" With increasing numbers of category 5 hurricanes, rising sea levels and fears of disappearing coastlines, restoration failure in Union Island could mean devastation not just of the fisheries, but of the entire island. Union Island resident and educator Ann Harvey knows that well. In 2004, she opened a pre-school in memory of her son, Jamie, who had died suddenly the year before and had loved school and volunteering in social and environmental causes. The school was located less than 100m (328ft) from a small, bushy shrub of mangroves that had been spared from the excavator. During the opening celebration, however, radio bulletins warned of an impending storm. As Harvey and her staff scrambled to place sandbags and board up the building, she worried that her new school would not stand a chance against raging wind and waves. Within 24 hours, Hurricane Ivan, one of the most powerful hurricanes in a decade, bore down on the southern Caribbean. It destroyed 90% of the infrastructure on nearby Grenada.  Harvey watched the waves from her house a few miles inland. ""I stood in a corner, just staring, concerned that the [school] roof would be blown away,"" she says. ""But then I noticed something. The mangroves were taking the brunt of the storm, protecting the school. For hours, they swayed in the wind and big waves crashed into them. Some of them eventually broke away, but nothing happened to the school."" Around the world, coastal structures like the pre-school are becoming increasingly vulnerable as climate change intensifies storms and sea-level rise means more water can rush inland. Coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of warming ocean temperatures, sea-level rise, storms and flooding, according to a 2019 special report on oceans by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  Shoring up marine ecosystems, like mangroves, is one of the pillars of building resilience, the IPCC said. With their thick foliage and gnarled, thick root systems, mangroves have been found to reduce wave height and energy. A 100m (328ft) buffer of mangroves can reduce wave height by up to 66%, one report found, and a 500m (1,640ft) buffer can reduce it as much as 99%.  This ability is critical to the future of many islands. ""We have so many low-lying areas, some below sea level,"" Matthew Harvey says. ""If not for these mangroves, I am worried that people would not even be able to live here soon."" Mangroves are also able to trap and store large amounts of carbon dioxide, an ability that has gained them increasing attention as an important component of climate mitigation. But mangrove restoration has not always proven successful. Before the 1970s, mangroves were sometimes seen as a nuisance, but in 1984, the World Bank funded one of the first major restoration projects, providing a $26m (£20m) loan to plant just under 2,500 acres (1,000 hectares) of mangroves in the Philippines.  The government of the Philippines hoped that by replanting the mangroves, fish would return and the lives of over 90,000 residents improved. However, in 1995 researchers revealed that just 18% of the three million planted trees had survived. Researchers say the project failed to plant suitable species in appropriate sites.  Many other mangrove restoration projects have failed, including, more recently, a project in Sri Lanka to plant 3,000 acres (1,200 hectares) of mangrove after the 2004 tsunami. Less than 500 of those acres (202 hectares) have mangroves on them today – researchers attribute this to lack of attention to basic indicators for restoration such as selecting the right species, salinity and hydrology and the best sites. In a 2015 study of 160 marine coastal restoration projects over the previous 40 years, researchers found that half of the initiatives had failed.  Ecologists like Moore say many of the projects are hampered by short-term thinking – they tend to focus on construction and ignore the community and the importance of long-term monitoring and stewardship.  ""Most of the time the money spent on [coastal restoration] projects is for the engineering and the mobilisation and demobilisation of heavy equipment needed to prepare the site and obtain the right hydrology,"" Moore says. ""Then those trucks and bulldozers leave the site, construction crews take their final land survey, say 'we got the grade right, the elevation right', shake hands, pat each other on the back, and they're done."" Yvonne Edwin, a marine biologist from nearby St Lucia, agrees, but says the Caribbean is getting it right. Edwin was one of more than a dozen people who came together to restore a 10-acre belt of mangroves in St Lucia's largest mangrove forest, the Makote Mangroves. She says the accomplishment would not have been possible without community involvement. ""I went into the schools and I got the students to understand the importance of mangroves, even before taking them to help restore them,"" she says. ""Restoration requires a lot of hands and ongoing support and monitoring. Over 400 students joined the community and partners in this venture."" Edwin says mangrove restoration is already fraught with environmental challenges and projects cannot afford to be abandoned once the planting is over. This is especially the case in the Caribbean, which is sometimes faced with heavy rains post-planting. Studies support Moore and Edwin's view. The late ecologist Roy Lewis, one of the world's first mangrove restoration experts, also warned against programmes that bring in community members to collect and plant seedlings but fail to retain them as stewards. Union Island is trying learn these lessons and ensure stewardship is passed from one generation to another. SusGren has trained more than 50 young people in conservation and ecosystem monitoring, including former schoolteacher Kenya Ford. Her tasks included testing the salinity of the water in the mangrove, assessing tree growth and replanting trees to see where they grow best.  Such continued stewardship by residents will be integral to long-term success for the project, says Moore. ""Successful mangrove projects care more than just 'we planted a thousand trees and a thousand trees lived',"" he says. It is this approach to restoration which has helped the Caribbean become one of the few regions to increase mangrove cover in the last decade. SusGren and its partners now view Ashton Lagoon as fully restored, with over 90% of the mangroves planted in the lagoon still alive. These 3,000 mangrove trees now stand about 5ft (1.5m) above sea level along 14 acres (6 hectares) of shoreline. Tidal flushing is back and the turquoise ocean water flows freely into the jade water of the mangrove twice daily. The fish and birds have returned. Farmers now harvest sea moss from the lagoon – the raw seaweed is used to make ice cream and energy drinks popular in the Caribbean. With flowers in abundance in the mangroves again, bees have returned and beekeeping is thriving. SusGren has constructed boardwalks and a pair of bridges across the lagoon, as well as bird towers and viewing decks. The once desolate area is now visited by tourists, academics and, for the first time in 25 years, locals, who have returned to enjoy the beauty and tranquility of the lagoon. ""It's better than a hotel,"" says Joseph. ""It's not a case of a rich investor coming in and owning everything."" Harvey opened a neighbourhood bar in 2011 to supplement his struggling fishing income, and it is still open today. Now, though, he goes out to sea almost daily, sometimes spending up to 12 hours fishing. It's hard work for a 62-year-old, but he plans to continue. As he sits on a small wooden bench at his bar and looks toward the lagoon, he runs his fingers through his full grey beard, saying: ""It took us a long time, but our mangroves are back."" -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

economic indicators,Is the world overpopulated?,2024-09-15,2022-09-06,Zaria Gorvett,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220905-is-the-world-overpopulated,"Towards the end of 2022, the human population on Earth is expected to reach eight billion. To mark the occasion, BBC Future takes a look at one of the most controversial issues of our time. Are there too many of us? Or is this the wrong question? One moment, the valley was a tranquil, swampy wetland. Grasses and palm trees cast fuzzy shadows on the water below. Fish lurked warily at the edges of mangroves. Orangutans sought out fruit with leathery fingers. Then a dormant giant awoke from its sleep. It was around 72,000 BC on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. The Toba supervolcano was erupting, in what is thought to have been the greatest such event in the last 100,000 years. A series of thunderous explosions blasted out 9.5 quadrillion kilograms of ash, which billowed out in sky-darkening clouds that crept around 47km (29 miles) into the atmosphere. In the aftermath, a vast area across Asia was blanketed in a layer of soft dust 3-10cm thick. It choked water sources and stuck to vegetation like cement – deposits from Toba have been found as far away as East Africa, 7,300km (4,536 miles) west of the eruption. But crucially, some scientists believe it plunged the world into a volcanic winter that lasted decades – and nearly made our species extinct. Back in 1993, a team of American researchers studied the human genome for clues to its deep past, and discovered the tell-tale signature of a major ""population bottleneck"" – a moment when humanity shrank so drastically, all subsequent generations outside Africa were significantly more closely related. Later studies have revealed that in this precarious era, which may have occurred between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago, our collective numbers may have hit as few as 10,000 people – equivalent to the current population of the sleepy settlement of Elkhorn in Wisconsin, or the number who attended a single drive-through wedding in Malaysia in 2020. The least affected part of the world was Africa, where genetic diversity remains high to this day – on this single continent, there are larger genetic differences between certain groups than there are between Africans and Europeans.  Some think this timing isn’t a coincidence – they believe it was the Toba volcanic eruption that did it. The idea is hotly disputed, but there's no doubt that much of humanity is descended from a relatively modest number of super-hardy ancestors. At times, the inhabitants of entire regions of the world have been in great peril.      Fast-forward 74,000 years and our once-obscure species of hairless ape has undergone a population explosion, colonising nearly every habitat on the planet and exerting our influence on even the remotest corners – in 2018, scientists found a plastic bag 10,898m (35,754ft) below the ocean's surface at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, while another team recently discovered man-made ""forever chemicals"" on Mount Everest. No part of the world is pristine – every lake, forest and canyon has been touched by human activity. At the same time, our sheer numbers and ingenuity have enabled humanity to achieve feats that no other animal could dream of – splitting atoms, sending complex equipment nearly a million miles (1.6 million km) to observe planets forming in distant galaxies, and contributing to a staggering diversity of art and culture. Every day, we collectively take 4.1 billion photographs and exchange  between 80 and 127 trillion words. On the uncannily specific date of 15 November 2022, the United Nations has predicted that there will be eight billion humans alive at the same time – up to 800,000 times as many as there were survivors of the Toba catastrophe. Today, our population is so enormous, with such little genetic diversity – outside Africa – one researcher recently observed it's actually not that surprising that some people look uncannily similar to perfect strangers – there's a limited gene pool that's constantly being recycled and around 370,000 new opportunities (in the form of babies born) for these genetic coincidences to occur each day. But with humanity's expanding population has come great division. Some view our rising numbers as an unprecedented success story – in fact, there's an emerging school of thought that we actually need more people. In 2018 the tech billionaire Jeff Bezos predicted a future in which our population will reach a new decimal milestone, in the form of a trillion humans scattered across our Solar System – and announced that he's planning ways to achieve it. Others, meanwhile – including the British broadcaster and natural historian Sir David Attenborough – have labelled our swarming masses a ""plague on the Earth"". In this view, nearly every environmental problem we're currently facing, from climate change to biodiversity loss, water stresses and conflicts over land, can be traced back to our rampant reproduction over the last few centuries. Back in 1994 – when the global population was a mere 5.5 billion – a team of researchers from Stanford University, in California, calculated that the ideal size of our species would be between 1.5 and 2 billion people. So is the world overpopulated currently? And what might the future hold for the global dominance of humanity? The debate over the ideal number of people on the planet is as fractured and emotionally charged as ever – but time is running out to decide which is the best direction. An ancient concern It was the late 1980s in central Iraq, and a team of archaeologists from the University of Baghdad were excavating a ruined library in the ancient city of Sippar. Amid the sand, dust, and antique walls, they found 400 clay tablets – records that had been lying forgotten in their scholarly tomb for over three and a half thousand years, still on the same shelves they had once been added to by Babylonian hands. But four in particular were special. They contained missing sections of a story found in fragments on separate tablets scattered across Mesopotamia, which is still intriguing historians today.   ""Twelve hundred years had not yet passed [since the creation of mankind], When the land extended and the people multiplied…"" goes the Atra-hasis – the epic poem stamped into the clay by an anonymous scribe around the 17th Century BC. It's the Mesopotamian version of the ubiquitous Great Flood story, found in countless forms in cultures across the globe, in which civilisation is destroyed by a deity – and it might contain one of the earliest mentions of overpopulation in the historical record. In the ancient tale, the gods become annoyed at all the ""noise"" and ""uproar"" created by the human hordes, as well as the ""lands bellowing like a bull"" due to the stresses they were put under by our species' demands. The god of the atmosphere, Enlil, decides to unleash a few hazards to bring numbers down again – contriving plagues, famines and droughts to arrive at regular intervals of 1,200 years. Fortunately, another god saves the day – this time. But then Enlil plans a great flood instead... and the classic tale of boat-building ensues.   Around the time the Atra-hasis was written, the global population is estimated to have been between 27 and 50 million people, equivalent to the number who currently inhabit Cameroon or South Korea, or 0.3-0.6% of the total who call the planet home today. During the millennium that followed, scholars appear to have fallen relatively quiet about any population concerns. Then in Ancient Greece, they began to ponder the issue again. The philosopher Plato had some strong views. After a period of rapid growth, in which Athens' population doubled, he lamented: ""What is left now is like the skeleton of a body wasted by disease; the rich soil has been carried off and only the bare framework of the district is left."" Not only did he believe in strict population control, managed by the state – he eventually concluded that the ideal city should have no more than 5,040 citizens, and thought setting up colonies was a good way of offloading any excess – but he also felt the importance of moderating consumption. In Plato's magnum opus, The Republic, written around 375BC, he describes two imaginary city-states – administrative regions governed almost like small countries. One is healthy and one is ""luxurious"" and ""feverish"". In the latter, the population spends and devours excessively, surrendering themselves to consumerism until they have ""overstepped the limit of their necessities"". Alas, this morally decrepit city-state eventually resorts to seizing neighbouring lands, which naturally spirals into war – it simply can't sustain its large, greedy population without extra resources. Plato had hit upon a debate that's still raging today: is the human population the issue, or is it the resources it consumes? It took more than five centuries after Plato before the global scale of our population explosion became clear. The author Tertullian, who lived in the Roman city of Carthage, pre-empted modern-day observations about our destructive multitudes by a long shot. In 200AD, when the total human population had reached 190-256 million – somewhere around the number who currently inhabit Nigeria or Indonesia – he believed that the whole world had already been explored, and people had become a burden on the planet. ""..for nature can no longer sustain us"". Over the next 1,500 years, the global human population more than tripled. Eventually, this detached concern turned to panic. Enter Thomas Malthus, an English cleric with a penchant for pessimism. In his famous work, An Essay on the Principle of Population, published in 1798, he began with two important observations – that all people need to eat, and they like to have sex. When taken to their logical conclusion, he explained, these simple facts would eventually lead humanity's demands to outstrip the planet's supplies. ""Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio. A slight acquaintance with numbers will show the immensity of the first power in comparison of the second,"" wrote Malthus. In other words, large numbers of people lead to even larger numbers of offspring, in a kind of positive feedback loop – but our ability to produce food doesn't necessarily accelerate in the same way. These simple words had an immediate effect, igniting passionate fear in some and anger in others, which would continue to reverberate across society for decades. The former thought that something had to be done to stop our numbers spiralling out of control. The latter, that limiting the number of people was absurd or unethical, and every effort should be made to increase the food supply instead. The fewer-people camp were particularly critical of the English Poor Laws introduced hundreds of years earlier, which involved payments to those living in poverty to help them care for their children. It was speculated that these encouraged people to have larger families. At the time Malthus' essay was published, there were 800 million people on the planet. It wasn't until 1968, however, that modern concerns about global overpopulation emerged when a professor at Stanford University, Paul Ehrlich, and his wife, Anne Ehrlich, co-authored The Population Bomb. The Indian city of Delhi was the inspiration. They were returning to their hotel in a taxi one evening and went through a slum, where they were overwhelmed by the amount of human activity on the streets. They wrote about the experience in a way that has been heavily criticised – especially since London's population at the time was more than double Delhi's. The couple authored their book because of concerns about the mass starvation that they believed was coming, particularly to those in developing countries – but also in places like America, where people were starting to notice the impact they were having on the environment. The work has been widely credited with – or accused of, depending on your view – triggering many of the current anxieties about overpopulation. Of course, discussions about how many people there should be have never been purely academic. At times, they have been hijacked to justify persecution, ethnic cleansing and genocide. In each case, the perpetrators have been intent on lessening the populations of specific groups of people, such as those from a certain social class, religion or ethnicity – rather than humanity as a whole – but they are nevertheless sometimes seen as examples of the dangers that the very concept of overpopulation can pose.    As early as 1834, just three and a half decades after Malthus' essay was published, the English Poor Laws were scrapped and replaced with stricter ones. This was partly over Malthusian concerns that this social class (who he called ""peasants"") were reproducing too much, and had the result of forcing orphaned children into bleak, unsanitary workhouses like the one depicted in Charles Dickens' novel Oliver Twist.   Over the coming centuries, eugenics was continually disguised as population control – or received support from the movement – such as during the forced sterilisations of people from minority ethnic groups in 1970s America.  It was also used to curtail individual freedoms. In 1980, China introduced its controversial one-child policy, which was widely seen as an invasive violation of the population's sexual and reproductive rights.  A contentious future As a result of its controversial history, population engineering is a deeply divisive area. Today, any policies involving quotas or targets to increase or decrease the human population are almost universally condemned, except by a handful of extremist organisations. The risk of these incentives leading to coercion or other atrocities is seen as too great. But there is little agreement beyond this. At one end of the spectrum lie those who see lower fertility rates in some areas as a crisis. One demographer is so concerned by the localised drop in the birth rate in the UK that he has suggested taxing the childless. As of 2019, there were 1.65 children born in the country per woman on average. This is below the replacement level – the number of births required to maintain the same population size – of 2.075, though the population was still growing overall because of migration from other countries. The opposing view is that slowing and eventually halting global population growth is not only eminently manageable and desirable, but it can be achieved via entirely voluntary means – methods such as simply providing contraception to those who would like it, and educating women. In this way, proponents of this position believe we could not only benefit the planet but improve the quality of life experienced by the poorest citizens worldwide. One organisation that believes in this approach is the UK-based charity Population Matters, which campaigns to achieve a sustainable global population. They advocate for addressing the pressures consumerism – particularly by the developed world – is placing on the planet, while also highlighting the role that population size has to play in this. To this end, they urge people to take individual responsibility for the environmental crisis, in addition to working towards ending global poverty and inequality through debt relief and overseas aid. ""We deplore any form of population control or coercion, restriction of choice,"" says the director, Robin Maynard. ""So, it's about enabling access, enabling choice, and meeting rights. And that is actually the most effective way that people will make decisions which are good for them and good for the planet, ultimately.""  On the other hand, others advocate for shifting the focus away from adjusting the number of people in the world, however softly or indirectly this is achieved, to our activities. Supporters argue that the quantity of resources each person uses up has more of an impact on our collective influence, and point out that consumption is significantly higher in wealthier countries with lower birth rates. Reducing our individual demands on the planet could shrink humanity's footprint without stifling growth in poorer countries. In fact, Western interest in curtailing population growth in less developed parts of the world has been accused of having racist undertones, when Europe and North America are more densely populated overall. Finally, there's the fatalistic ""solution"" to the perennial population question: simply do nothing. This view relies on the highly unstable dynamics of our global population – it's set to grow significantly, but then it will shrink. Every camp may get what they want in the end, though not forever. Estimates vary, but we're expected to reach ""peak human"" around 2070 or 2080, at which point there will be between 9.4 billion and 10.4 billion people on the planet. It may be a slow process – if we reach 10.4 billion, the UN expects the population to remain at this level for two decades – but eventually after this the population is projected to decline. In the book ""Empty Planet: The Shock of Global Population Decline"", the authors present a very different vision of the future to the one we’re used to, in which the world grapples with the new challenges and opportunities that depopulation could present. Amid all the controversy and uncertainty, it can be hard to know what to think. Here’s how the number of people on the planet might affect a few key aspects of our lives in the future – the environment, economy, and our collective wellbeing. An environmental challenge With bumpy handheld shots, the camera stalks through the Madagascan forest. It's thick with trees and the thrilling mystery of an unknown wilderness. Then suddenly, there it is: a white blur bounces across the frame and off into the distance. The animal is a sifaka – a shy and elusive lemur with long limbs, pale fur and a black face, like a lanky teddy bear. The brief encounter is part of a BBC documentary, Indian Ocean with Simon Reeve, and the presenter soon reveals a startling caveat to the team's lucky find. This is not the wild after all – it's the Berenty reserve in Southern Madagascar, a tiny patch of forest surrounded on all sides by commercial plantations, and one of the last remaining places this rare creature calls home. At the visitor centre, Reeve says he's been reliably informed that nearly all wildlife camerapeople who film in the area set their equipment up in this exact location, where the lemurs are most abundant, facing away into the forest so as not to capture any buildings. While viewers may think they're catching a glimpse into the wild unknown, you could argue that what they’re really getting is a carefully curated illusion of untamed nature. The documentary highlights the ""wilderness myth"" – a misunderstanding that can occur when people are presented with majestic footage of the natural world that excludes humans entirely, or drastically downplays our ubiquity, suggesting that there are still vast tracts of untouched land out there. Satellite images are a particularly powerful tool for shattering this notion: from the air, many countries are revealed to be heavily adapted for human use. As far as the eye can see, the land is a patchwork of agricultural fields, threaded with roads and row upon row of buildings. Some landscapes have been so transformed in just a few decades, by engineering works or deforestation, that they are barely recognisable. These changes come with some startling statistics. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 38% of the planet's land surface is used to grow food and other products (such as fuel) for humans or their livestock – five billion hectares (12.4 billion acres) in total. And though our ancestors lived among giants, hunting mammoths, mega-wombats and 450kg (1,000lb) elephant birds, today we are the dominant vertebrate species on land – a grouping that includes everything from geckos to lemurs. By weight, humans account for 32% of terrestrial vertebrates, while wild animals amount to just 1% of the total. Livestock accounts for the rest. The wilderness-preservation charity WWF has found that wildlife populations declined by two thirds between 1970 and 2020 – in that time, the global population more than doubled. In fact, as our dominance increases, many environmental changes have been occurring in parallel – and a number of prominent environmentalists, from the primatologist Jane Goodall, famous for her study of chimpanzees, to the naturalist and tv presenter Chris Packham, have voiced their concerns. In 2013, Sir David Attenborough explained his views in an interview with the Radio Times: ""All our environmental problems become easier to solve with fewer people, and harder – and ultimately impossible – to solve with ever more people.” For some people, alarm over humanity's environmental footprint has led them to decide to have fewer or no children themselves – including The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who announced in 2019 that they would have no more than two for the sake of the planet. In the same year, Miley Cyrus also declared that she wouldn't have children yet because the Earth is ""angry"". A growing number of women are joining the anti-natalist movement and going on ""BirthStrike"", until the current climate emergency and extinction crisis are dealt with. The trend was buoyed up by research from 2017, which calculated that simply having one fewer child in the developed world could reduce a person's annual carbon emissions by 58.6 tonnes of ""CO2 equivalent"" or CO2e – more than 24 times the savings from not having a car. One 2019 study, led by Jennifer Sciubba, an associate professor of International Studies at Rhodes College, Tennessee, analysed the levels of population growth in over 1,000 regions in 22 European countries between 1990 and 2006, and compared them to how patterns of urban land use and carbon dioxide emissions changed over the same period. The team concluded that the sheer number of people had a ""considerable effect"" on these environmental parameters in Western Europe, but these were not the most important factors in Eastern Europe. This nuanced support for the idea that population growth leads to environmental degradation is backed up by many other studies – but so is the impact of spiralling demand for natural resources, especially in wealthier countries. In fact, many environmentalists now believe that the problems we're currently facing are largely due to consumption, rather than overpopulation – from this perspective, concerns about the latter unfairly shift the blame onto poorer countries. In 2021, a study found that in the US, population growth and the use of non-renewable energy sources are both degrading the environment, while another found that economic growth and the use of natural resources in China from 1980 to 2017 led to higher carbon dioxide emissions. Intriguingly, other research has found that, while the use of natural resources and urbanisation in China both increase the rate of environmental destruction, these are partly offset by the availability of ""human capital"" – essentially, the knowledge and skill of the human population. (Read about how China's now shrinking population might affect the world.) Today it is widely accepted that people are putting an unsustainable strain on the world's finite resources – a phenomenon that's highlighted by ""Earth overshoot day"", the date each year when humanity is estimated to have used up all the biological resources that the planet can sustainably regenerate. In 2010, it fell on August 8. This year, it was 28 July. Whether the problem is too many humans, the resources we use up, or both, ""I can't even fathom how more humans could be better for the environment"", says Sciubba, who authored the book ""8 Billion and Counting: How Sex, Death, and Migration Shape our World"". She suggests one way to make the case might be to view humans and the environment as the same entity, ""but boy, that that's a real hard argument to make"". However, Sciubba is keen to point out that the idea of an impending ""population bomb"" coming to destroy the planet, as suggested by the Ehrlichs' book, is outdated. ""At that time [when it was written], I think there were 127 countries in the world where women on average had five or more children in their lifetime,"" she says. In that era, population trends really did look as though they were exponential – and she suggests that this instilled a population panic in certain generations that are still alive today. ""But today there are only 8 [countries with fertility rates above five],"" says Sciubba. ""So I think it's important for us to realise that those trends changed."" An economic opportunity   In 2012, the Singaporean government devised an unusual way for citizens to celebrate its independence – and disseminated the important instructions via a new rap song. The hit was intended to encourage young couples to have more children, and mixed colourful innuendos with patriotic references to the culture and sights the country has on offer. ""…Let's make a lil' human that looks like you and me, Explorin' your body like a night safari, I'm a patriotic husband you a patriotic wife, Let me come into your camp and manufacture a life…,"" went some of the lyrics. It was released amid fears about Singapore's super-low fertility rate, which was just 1.1 births per woman as of 2020. It's an extreme example of what has become a common trend in wealthy countries, where people marry later and choose to have fewer children. In Singapore it triggered concerns about what the consequences might be for the nation's economy, leading the government there to call on its citizens to do their bit. It's a key concept in economics: the more people you have, the more goods or services they can produce and the more they can consume – so population growth is the best friend of economic growth.    This is one reason that concerns about the growing population in developing parts of the world is sometimes seen as problematic – many developed countries are already densely populated, and this is partly how they achieved their wealth. Denying other countries this opportunity is seen as unfair and even racist.  However, slower population growth isn’t always followed by an economic downfall. Take Japan, which pre-empted global trends in wealthy nations and achieved below-replacement level fertility rates as early as 1966, when it suddenly dropped from around two to 1.6. ""I don’t think it's the case that Japan's economy has declined to the extent that people sometimes portray it, if you look at standards of living,"" says Andrew Mason, emeritus professor in the department of economics at the University of Hawaii. ""They've invested a lot in human capital – so they have fewer children, but they've emphasised education and have very good healthcare systems."" Mason also points out that saving and investment are also common in Japan: ""So there's been increases in [monetary] capital and higher productivity as well. If you combine those things… I think Japan is a good case study in why not to panic [about declining birth rates]."" And there are other ways of growing a country's economy. Mason points out that immigration often provides a helpful source of new workers, and it does so without adding any extra people to humanity's total. But immigration also remains a contentious and highly politicised subject in some counties, so without cultural shifts in how it's perceived, some countries won't have this option. ""Think particularly of countries like Japan and South Korea where they have [historically] been very resistant to immigration, they're going to find it more and more to their advantage [to change this policy],"" says Mason. Equally, the advantages that immigration can provide are inherently highly uneven – one country gets a boost to its economy at the expense of another whose workers left. There's a growing feeling that the global obsession with chasing economic growth at all costs is outdated and should be abandoned altogether. ""One of the things that frustrates me about the overpopulation debate is a lot of comments come out of the same people's mouths – that we don't want there to be too many people, and we also want to make sure that the economy is always growing,"" says Sciubba. ""In a world where there are fewer people, we really need a complete mindset shift away from growth equals progress,"" she says. A happier future  However, demographics influence more than just the environment and economy – they're also a powerful hidden force in shaping the quality of people's lives worldwide. According to Alex Ezeh, a professor of Global Health at Drexel University, Pennsylvania, the absolute number of people in a country is not the most important factor. Instead it's the rate of its population's growth or decline that is key to a country's future prospects – this determines how quickly things are changing. Take Africa, where Ezeh explains that there are radically different rates of population growth currently occurring, depending on where you look. ""In a number of countries, particularly in Southern Africa [one of five regions defined by the United Nations], fertility rates have really dropped and contraceptive use is up – the rate of growth of the population slowing down, which is in some ways good news,"" says Ezeh. At the same time, some Central African countries still have high rates of population growth, as a result of high fertility and longer lifespans. In some places, it's well above 2.5% per annum, ""which is massive,"" says Ezeh. The population will double every 20-plus years in a number of countries."" Even within a single region, different countries can be on surprisingly different paths – Ezeh gives the example of the East African neighbours Burundi and Rwanda. While the former still has high levels of growth – at 5.3 births per woman – in the latter growth is slowing down, with 3.9 births per woman in 2020 compared to 4.5 in 2010. ""I think the conversation about size and numbers is a misplaced conversation"", says Ezeh. ""Think of a city that is doubling every 10 years – and that's a number of cities in Africa – which government really has the resources to improve every infrastructure that currently exists every 10 years, in order to maintain the correct level of coverage of those services?"" Ezeh explains that in particular, it's difficult to support the development of human capital under conditions of extreme growth – which research has found plays an important role in the happiness of people in cities, even more than the amount of money they're earning. It's also thought to be an important predictor of economic growth, in addition to the sheer number of people in a country. ""When economists think about it, a large population is great for many different outcomes, but do you achieve that large population in 10 years or 100 years or 1,000 years? The longer it takes to get there, you can put in place the right structures in the system that will support that population,"" says Ezeh. One factor with a well-documented role in slowing down this rate of growth is the education of women, which has the side-effect of increasing the average age at which they give birth. ""Over time, women get access to education, they have positions outside the family, jobs, all of those that compete with childbearing,"" says Ezeh. However, Ezeh is keen to emphasise the merits of education independent from their impact on population size – it's one of the UN's 17 sustainable development goals. This gets to the heart of one modern view on population engineering – policies should be implemented for the benefit of society, and if they happen to lead to beneficial demographic changes, that's just a bonus. ""I think one of the things we don't want to do is to instrumentalise female education and make it that we want them to go to school because we want women to have fewer children… there are a lot of positives that we cannot minimise by thinking about it in terms of fertility reduction,"" says Ezeh. In fact, the cascading side-effects of policies implemented for other reasons highlight a striking reality of population science – just how imprecise its predictions often are. Across the globe, the decisions made by governments over the coming decades will be hugely influential in determining how many people there are on the planet – with the power to bump us from a future in which there are 10 billion people, to one in which there are 15 billion, and vice versa. ""I think one of the things we know for sure, is… [when people say that] the population of Africa is projected to be x in year y, [it] is not a destiny,"" says Ezeh. ""If you look at the Southern Africa region… its population could be three to four times larger than what it is today by 2100, but it could also be less than 50% larger than what it is today by 2100. It's such a large range of possibilities – whether we make the necessary investments to get to the rate of growth that is consistent with where countries want to go. So that is the magnitude of the opportunity that exists."" An expanding presence However, though the degree to which humanity will continue to expand across the planet is still to be decided, some trajectories have already been set. And one is that the human population is likely to continue to grow for some time, regardless of any possible efforts to decrease it.  This future is down to a phenomenon known as ""demographic momentum"", in which a young population with a fertility rate below replacement level will continue to grow, as long as the death rate and migration levels remain the same. This is because population change isn't just about birth rates – the structure of a population also has an impact, particularly the total number of women at childbearing age. All this means that in countries where fertility rates are high, the full impact of this growth isn't felt until the women in that population reach reproductive age decades later. One 2014 study found that, even in the event of a major global tragedy such as a deadly pandemic or catastrophic world-war, or draconian one-child policy implemented in every country on the planet – none of which anyone is hoping for, of course – our population will still grow to up to 10 billion people by 2100. Even a disaster on such a scale that it leaves two billion people dead within a five-year-period in the middle of the century would still see the population grow 8.5 billion people by 2100. Whatever happens, the authors conclude, there are likely to be many, many people around until at least the next century. With humanity set to become even more dominant in the years to come, finding a way to live together and protect the environment could be our species' greatest challenge yet.  -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

economic indicators,Why trees are being stolen for firewood,2024-09-15,2023-03-02,Lyndsie Bourgon,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230301-the-complex-problem-of-firewood-theft,"In many countries, poachers are stealing trees from forests in the middle of the night – and the problem may be getting worse. Author Lyndsie Bourgon investigates the complex reasons to blame. In the stands of oak, birch and beech that populate Germany's forests, hundreds of trees have been stolen, one-by-one. In one forest alone – Konigs Wusterhausen, near Berlin – poachers took 100 pine trees last winter. In response, a new initiative sprung up to encourage hikers to report sightings of suspicious stumps or people. Managers have begun to nestle cameras into tree branches.   The reason? Wood poachers have been harvesting their winter heat. In October 2022, the Working Group of German Forest Owners Associations (AGDW) reported that firewood scavenging was on the rise in the country's forests, where people were felling trees and chopping them up for easy transport, or in some cases taking wood that was already chopped down from the side of the road. The AGDW estimated the value of stolen wood from German forests the previous winter had reached into the millions of Euros.   Tree theft has become a global problem. To tackle it, there are now hidden cameras in forests around the world – in the redwoods of California, the foggy coastal forests of the Pacific Northwest coast, and the tropical rainforests of South America and Southeast Asia. All are meant to dissuade poachers, who enter the woods at night and take out valuable, old-growth timber. In my book, Tree Thieves: Crime and Survival in North America’s Woods, I tracked poachers and wood dealers as they tromped through the woods to harvest wood and sell it to artisans, mills, and manufacturers, as well as meeting the park rangers hoping to stop them.   You may also like: In their most recent figures, the US Forest Service estimates that timber worth $100m (£83m/€95m) is poached from their land each year. In Canada, the province of British Columbia reports that around $20m (£17m/€19m) worth of timber is stolen from publicly managed forests each year. And globally, this trade contributes to the estimated $152bn (£131bn/€149bn) trade in illegal timber on the black market. Each region's bounty is locally unique: in eastern Missouri, poachers take walnut and white oak; the bark is stripped off elms in Kentucky; bonsai are stolen from gardens in San Diego and Seattle; redwood burl is carved from sequoia in the towering redwoods of northern California. This wood enters our lives in a myriad of ways: during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, the price of wood skyrocketed, and people stole processed timber by the truck-full. Retailers of hardwood flooring and flatpack furniture have been caught sourcing illegal wood in their supply chains. And every winter, parks located in or near cities report the theft of fir boughs and pine trees, felled for Christmas trees.   But the most common motivation identified in my research was to supply firewood. Stories coming from Germany's forests echo those in my home province, where Douglas fir is often poached near roadways that cut through public conservation land. There's often evidence that these trees have been cut into blocks right where they fell, then loaded into the back of a truck and driven off. In rural areas, where it's not uncommon for homes to be heated by multiple stoves as opposed to central heating, this poached wood often feeds the burners in local communities. But now, in the long shadow of both the energy and cost of living crises, the demand for firewood is on the rise. The market for poached wood is expanding.   In the UK, the demand for wood heat has been tangible: wood stove sales have increased by 40%, and chainsaw sales have followed in lockstep. In Dorset, £10,000-worth ($12,000/€11,300) of wood was stolen from a Wildlife Trust site in early January.  In the background, firewood prices have increased throughout Europe. In September 2022, the World Economic Forum weighed in, stating that a country's woodstores are now an indicator of a strong economy. Bulgaria, Switzerland, and Poland all reported that the price of a bundle of wood had more than doubled, and that some people were being scammed into paying high rates for a cord of wood (about 3.6 cubic metres/128 cubic feet) that were never delivered. In Poland, it was reported, officials have begun to consider distributing anti-smog masks in anticipation of people burning wood and trash to find heat.   As I came to know poachers through my research, many of them detailed how they poach wood that they dry to fill their woodstoves, or the stoves of their family members. Some sell their bounty online to needy neighbours, connecting through social media. Outside North America, researchers have found that iconic trees like baobab are being illegally sold and manufactured into charcoal used for cooking.   The ethics of wood poaching have become increasingly complicated: trees that need to be protected to ensure biodiversity, forest health, and climate change mitigation are now being taken by poachers in night-time raids, but this is not necessarily a crime motivated by simple greed. There are economic pressures that exacerbate the problem: poverty is endemic in rural communities that need heat and income. For many poachers, harvesting wood is an act of self-sufficiency, tradition, and necessity. It requires technical skills that had been passed down to them through family members, a ""form of osmosis"", according to one. Burning wood for heat is often accompanied by stigma, particularly in urban settings. But wood's utility morphs along class lines. A crackling fire lit under a glittering mantlepiece at Christmas is aesthetically pleasing and traditional, whereas black smoke spewing from every house in a low-income neighbourhood is often perceived as ""dirty"". For many homes, wood and other biofuels (like peat) are accessible and affordable methods of keeping warm during winter, when prices for fuel skyrocket. ""There is a real social divide,"" says Martin Pigeon, a forest and climate campaigner at the European activist organisation Fern.   Fern's research has indicated that what was once a supplementary form of heat for many has now become primary, the backup now providing security in a time of energy and cost-of-living crises. ""A lot of this is policy driven,"" Pidgeon tells me on a winter's day in Brussels. ""If we had a public sector energy supply, it might not be this way.""   Though the impacts of burning wood on health and environment vary depending on the type of stove used and wood burned, there is no doubt that burning wood contributes to air pollution and deposits health-harming particulates that hang in the air every time a stove door is opened and flames stoked. The rise of wood-burning, both at home and in industrial biomass power plants, has the potential to undo progress in air quality improvements over the past century.   In recent reports, Fern and Greenpeace have cautioned that poaching firewood cannot be compared to the damage caused by mass, legalised logging that services the biomass industry, which burns wood to provide energy. Since 2005, according to Fern's analysis, burning wood has increased alongside the biomass industry's production – now, more than half of the European Union's wood harvest is burned. ""It put a price tag on trees that previously didn't have one,"" says Pidgeon. ""Created an incentive to log the forest."" In times of energy unaffordability and insecurity, wood is a reliable source for many, both in harvest and use. Energy insecurity remains a pressing concern for Europeans across the board – the End Fuel Poverty Campaign estimated in October 2022 that 7 million British households were in fuel poverty. In December 2022, for instance, the Shetland Islands off the north coast of Scotland, found themselves without heat sources when a snowstorm cut off power and telecommunication lines to the island. For similar regions, where power outages are not uncommon, wood stoves are a lifeline in the dark and cold. Earlier in 2022, the council in Aberdeen, where the ferry from Shetland docks to the mainland in the north-east of Scotland, instigated a plan to remove fireplaces from council homes, leading to fierce backlash from constituents, many of whom argued that they would be left without a key heat source during power outages. In one media report, Louise Kelly – a resident of the village Braemar, Aberdeenshire – eloquently called her wood stove a ""backup for resilience"". While researching my book, I have heard echoes of Kelly's reliance on her wood burner from almost everyone I have ever spoken to about managing, harvesting, and living with wood. There is a near universal connection to the burning of wood for heat – and a common thread of safety and subsistence found while sharing a seat around any sort of fire. Firewood, I have come to learn, is imbued with all sorts of meaning, whether domestic, environmental, or political – and this makes the rights and wrongs of tree theft more nuanced than first appears. * Lyndsie Bourgon is the author of Tree Thieves: Crime and Survival in North America’s Woods.

economic indicators,What happened to the ozone hole?,2024-09-15,2022-03-22,Kira Walker,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220321-what-happened-to-the-worlds-ozone-hole,"Back in the 1990s, the hole in the planet's ozone layer was a pressing global crisis – if we had ignored it, today there would be several. In the late 1970s, Jonathan Shanklin, a meteorologist with the British Antarctic Survey, spent much of his time tucked away in an office in Cambridge working through a backlog of data from the southernmost continent on our planet. Shanklin was responsible for supervising the digitisation of paper records and computing values from Dobson spectrophotometers – ground-based instruments that measure changes in atmospheric ozone. Best of 2022 This article is part of BBC Future's ""Best of 2022"" collection, where we bring you some of our favourite stories from the past 12 months. Discover more of our picks here. As the years passed, Shanklin started to see that something was going on – after nearly two decades of fairly constant measurements, he noticed that ozone levels began dropping in the late 1970s. Initially, Shanklin’s bosses weren't as certain as he was that something was happening, which frustrated him. By 1984, the ozone layer over Antarctica's Halley Bay research station had lost one-third of its thickness compared to previous decades. Shanklin and colleagues Joe Farman and Brian Gardiner published their findings the following year, suggesting a link to a human-made compound called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), used in aerosols and cooling devices. Their discovery, the thinning of the ozone layer over Antarctica, came to be known as the ozone hole.  As news of the discovery spread, alarm rippled around the world. Projections that the destruction of the ozone layer would adversely impact the health of humans and ecosystems sparked public fear, mobilised scientific investigation and galvanised the world’s governments to collaborate in an unprecedented way. You might also like: Since its heyday, the story of one of the gravest environmental problems that humanity has faced has largely fallen from the radar. More than 30 years on from its discovery, what ever happened to the hole in the ozone layer? A vital phenomenon Ozone is mostly found in the stratosphere, a layer of the atmosphere between six and 30 miles (10-50 km) above the Earth's surface. This ozone layer forms an invisible protective shield over the planet, absorbing damaging UV radiation from the sun. Without it, life on Earth would not be possible. The British Antarctic Survey first began measuring ozone concentrations above Antarctica in the 1950s. But several decades passed before it became clear there was a problem. In 1974, scientists Mario Molina and F. Sherry Rowland published a paper theorising that CFCs could destroy ozone in Earth's stratosphere. Until then CFCs were thought to be harmless, but Molina and Rowland suggested that assumption was wrong. Their findings were attacked by industry, who insisted their products were safe. Among scientists, their research was contested. Projections indicated that ozone depletion would be minor – between 2-4% – and many thought it would happen on a timescale of centuries. The use of CFCs continued unabated and by the 1970s they were ubiquitous worldwide, used as coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners, in aerosol spray cans and as industrial cleaning agents. A mere decade later, in 1985, the British Antarctic Survey confirmed a hole in the ozone layer and suggested a link to CFCs – vindicating the work of Molina and Rowland, who were eventually awarded the 1995 Noble Prize in chemistry. Even worse, the depletion was happening much quicker than had been anticipated. ""It was really quite shocking,"" says Shanklin, now an emeritus fellow at the British Antarctic Survey. From then on, scientists raced to figure out how and why this was happening. n 1986, as the Antarctic winter neared its end, Susan Solomon, a researcher with the US government National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, led a team of scientists to McMurdo Base in search of answers. At the time, scientists were debating three possible theories, one of which Solomon had proposed: that the answer might lie in surface chemistry involving chlorine on polar stratospheric clouds, which occur at high latitudes and only form during very low temperatures in polar winter. ""It was a great mystery,"" says Solomon, now professor of atmospheric chemistry and climate science at MIT. Her research explained how and why the ozone hole occurs in Antarctica. ""All the data pointed towards the combination of the increase of chlorine from the human use of CFCs and the presence of polar stratospheric clouds as being the trigger for what happened."" Satellite monitoring confirmed ozone depletion extended over a vast region – 7.7 million square miles (20 million sq km). The serious threat posed by ozone depletion – rises in skin cancer and cataracts in humans, harm to plant growth, agricultural crops and animals and reproductive problems in fish, crabs, frogs and phytoplankton, the basis of the marine food chain – spurred international action and collaboration. But considering how grave a threat the ozone hole was deemed to be, why do we not often hear about it anymore? ""It's not the same cause for alarm that it once was,"" says Laura Revell, associate professor of environmental physics at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. This is largely due to the unprecedented international steps that governments took to tackle the problem. Thinking ozone depletion would be small and far into the future, international policymakers initially took a cautious approach to ozone protection. In 1977, a global action plan was adopted, calling for monitoring of ozone and solar radiation, research on ozone depletion’s effect on human health, ecosystems and the climate and a cost-benefit assessment of control measures. A few months before the discovery of the ozone hole by the British scientists, this led to the 1985 Vienna Convention, calling for further research. But it didn't include legally binding controls for CFC reduction, disappointing many. After the ozone hole discovery, heavy investment in scientific research, marshalling of economic resources and coordinated international political action helped to turn things around. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol was adopted to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the chemicals which deplete it. To support compliance, the treaty recognised ""common but differentiated responsibilities"", staggering phase-out schedules for developed and developing countries and establishing a multilateral fund to provide financial and technical assistance to help developing countries meet their obligations. During the 1990s and early-2000s, the production and consumption of CFCs was brought to a halt. By 2009, 98% of the chemicals agreed to in the treaty had been phased out. Six amendments — which the treaty allows when scientific evidence shows further action is needed — have led to ever-tightening restrictions on substances introduced to replace CFCs, such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). While good for the ozone layer, these replacements turned out to be bad for the climate. The global warming potential of the most commonly used HCFC, for example, is almost 2,000 times stronger than carbon dioxide. The treaty's climate benefits have been a positive side effect. In 2010, emissions reductions due to the Montreal Protocol were between 9.7 to 12.5 gigatons of CO2 equivalent, approximately five to six times more than the target of the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty adopted in 1997 that aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The 2016 adoption of the Kigali Amendment, which will limit the use of HFCs, will help avoid up to 0.5 C of global warming by 2100. ""You could argue [the Montreal Protocol] is a much more successful bit of climate protection legislation than any of the other [climate] agreements we've had to date,"" says Revell. Since its adoption, the Montreal Protocol has been signed by every country on Earth – to date the only treaty to be universally ratified. It's widely considered a triumph of international environmental cooperation. According to some models, the Montreal Protocol and its amendments have helped prevent up to two million cases of skin cancer yearly and avoided millions of cataract cases worldwide. Had the world not banned CFCs, we would now find ourselves nearing massive ozone depletion. ""By 2050, it's pretty well-established we would have had ozone hole-like conditions over the whole planet, and the planet would have become uninhabitable,"" says Solomon. Solomon credits three factors for the swift action on the problem: the clear and present danger the ozone hole posed to human health made it personal to people, vivid satellite imagery made it perceptible and there were practical solutions to it – ozone-depleting substances could be replaced fairly quickly and easily. A long recovery Today, the ozone hole still exists, forming every year over Antarctica in the spring. It closes up again over the summer as stratospheric air from lower latitudes is mixed in, patching it up until the following spring when the cycle begins again. But there’s evidence it’s starting to disappear – and recover more or less as expected, says Solomon. Based on scientific assessments, the ozone layer is expected to return to pre-1980 levels around the middle of the century. Healing is slow because of the long lifespan of ozone-depleting molecules. Some persist in the atmosphere for 50 to 150 years before decaying. Despite the Montreal Protocol's overall success, there have been setbacks. In 2018, for example, the concentration of CFC-11, banned since 2010, was found to not be coming down as quickly as was expected, suggesting undeclared emissions were coming from somewhere. The Environmental Investigation Agency traced the emissions to factories in China, which were manufacturing it for use in insulation foam. Once made public, the Chinese government quickly clamped down and scientists say we are now back on track. For Shanklin, this underlines the vital importance of long-term monitoring of environmental variables, whether CFCs, temperature or biodiversity indicators. ""If we're not monitoring them then we don't know whether we're in trouble or not, and if you don't know you're in trouble, you can't take preventative action and I think that's a vital part of this story.""  And the future is not without risks. Major volcanic eruptions typically result in short-term ozone losses, while nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas emitted from fertiliser applications in agriculture, is also a potent ozone-depleting substance. However, it's not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, explains Revell – and emissions are growing. There are also activities whose impact we don't yet fully understand but might pose risks, like rocket launches and sulfate geo-engineering – the idea we can stave off the worse effects of global warming by pumping aerosol into the stratosphere to cool the climate, by causing sunlight to be reflected off those aerosol particles. ""It's really important we do keep in mind the lessons learned from the ozone hole story and make sure we're constantly aware of what's going on in the stratosphere,"" says Revell. ""The risk is we cause some unforeseen damage to the ozone layer if such assessments are not carried out in advance."" There’s a tendency to compare the ozone hole to climate change, yet while the Montreal Protocol does demonstrate we can tackle large environmental problems the comparison only goes so far. CFCs were a replaceable component of a few products. The scope of climate change makes it considerably more difficult to address; fossil fuels are pervasive throughout our lifestyle, they cannot be replaced nearly as easily and most governments and industry have, thus far, resisted reducing fossil fuel emissions. For Shanklin, it's sad to have wound up where we are, stalled on climate action, still talking about what we might do, when there's such a clear example to learn from. ""The creation of the ozone hole showed how rapidly we can change our planetary environment for the worse and that lesson is not really being taken seriously enough by the politicians,"" says Shanklin. ""Climate change is a bigger problem, to be fair. But that doesn't absolve the politicians of responsibility for making the necessary decisions."" *This article was updated on 9 January 2023. The previous version stated that Australia's ""slip, slop, slap"" campaign was launched due to the discovery of the ozone hole.

economic indicators,Ireland's unemployment rate falls to record low,2024-09-15,2023-05-31,John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2v8670ejzpo,"The unemployment rate in the Republic of Ireland fell to a record low of 3.8% in May, according to official figures. It had been 3.9% in April which matched the previous low attained for a sustained period during the Celtic Tiger era in 2000/01. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the rate peaked in March 2021 at 7.7%. Ireland's economy has recovered strongly since pandemic restrictions were removed. Andrew Webb, chief economist at Grant Thornton Ireland, said the strong labour market performance was no surprise ""given the signals from business and consumer sentiment indicators that suggest recent economic concerns are beginning to fade"". ""A slight note of caution is warranted as vacancy levels are starting to tail off, but overall the labour market performance since the pandemic is a particular economic bright spot,"" he added. Northern Ireland's labour market has also performed well since the pandemic with an unemployment rate of 2.5% which is just above the record low."
economic indicators,Why heat is a 'silent killer',2024-09-15,2023-09-20,Cagney Roberts,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230918-how-community-maps-can-protect-children-from-extreme-heat,"Heatwaves claim tens of thousands of lives each year. Now a US mapping project is revealing those most at risk so they can get the help they need. On a hot evening in August, when temperatures in Irving, a suburb in Dallas, Texas, can reach a stifling 45C (113F), outdoor pursuits and an active lifestyle can often be challenging for Christina and Landon Howard and their two young children, aged nine and 10. ""We can't go swimming or take part in other daily outdoor activities because it's just too hot outside,"" says Christina.""Our son had to came back indoors the other day after 10 minutes of skateboarding because he felt exhausted by the extreme heat conditions."" Children are at higher risk of being hospitalised during heatwaves when temperatures exceed 29C (84F), a study on heat and children's visits to emergency departments in New York City found. Children aged 0 to four were the most vulnerable, followed by children aged 13 to 18 and five to 12.  Texan homes generally have in-built AC systems, but with little respite outdoors in the city heat, the increase in energy demand is an economic factor that the Howards are also finding burdensome. ""We're expecting to pay almost $1,000 (£787) for next month's electricity bill. This is already very alarming,"" says Landon.""There's a higher potential of having to fork out money for costly AC repairs that are going to be even more difficult for us to pay."" Christina and Landon have decided to take matters into her own hands. In August 2023,they started volunteering with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) urban heat island mapping campaign  after hearing of the scheme through a volunteer callout from the City of Dallas. The initiative collects hyperlocal data to understand vulnerabilities to heat exposure. For several years, Christina and Landon have also been part of a climate change focus group in Texas, helping to make this hidden heat crisis more visible. ""We have always been interested in how climate change will affect our lives and the world, even before recycling was a thing in Texas!"" says Christina. NOAA's heat maps are helping policy makers and families understand the real-life impact of heat waves with unprecedented clarity, by combining satellite imagery, air temperature and humidity data collected by volunteers, and enabling them to implement cooling solutions targeted at each community's specific needs. ""If community heat maps can help lobby governments in the US to recognise the long-term health threats of extreme heat, and the nuanced environmental and economic effects to protect our children and other families – we want to be a part of that,"" says Landon. The Howard family are not the only ones who are experiencing the challenges of extreme heat. As global temperatures continue to rise, extreme heatwaves have become increasingly common in cities around the world. Heatwaves are also projected to cause 38,000 worldwide deaths per year by 2050, with 1,300 deaths already happening each year in the US. The majority of these deaths occur in children under the age of five and adults over 65 years old, according to a report by the World Health Organization. ""We call extreme heat a 'silent killer', [as] we might not see the impacts right away,"" says Morgan Zabow, climate and health communication and outreach coordinator of the National Integrated Heat Health Information System  - a US organisation that provides awareness and science-based information to protect people from heatwaves. Heat can also worsen pre-existing medical conditions such as respiratory and cardiovascular conditions in young children. ""Heatwaves pose a greater risk to otherwise healthy children. They are less able than adults to regulate their body temperature, they sweat less, and their heart and breathing rates are faster than adults,"" says Kimberley O'Sullivan, senior housing and health researcher at the University of Otago in New Zealand. Babies and children living in poorer neighbourhoods are among the most vulnerable to rising heat, and those belonging to ethnic minority groups. The health risks can start even before children are born – and the impact can extend beyond their childhood. One study that examined the impacts of exposure to extreme temperatures in New York City found babies born in temperatures above 29C (85F) and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tend to have a reduction of 1.8g in birth weight, which is projected to increase to 4.6g by 2070. Heatwaves, like other extreme weather events, exacerbate the divide between wealthy, often white communities in the US, and their economically disadvantaged or ethnic minority neighbours.  ""One reason for this is that a lot of people living in hot inner-city neighbourhoods, known as 'urban heat islands', are not prepared for the heat,"" says Nicole Ngo, lead author of the study and associate researcher in planning and public policy at the University of Oregon. Urban heat islands are dense areas with fewer trees, more buildings and black asphalt from sidewalks that absorb heat. They can be up to 6.7C (12F) hotter in the evenings than nearby areas which have more trees, grass and less black asphalt, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. The now-illegal practice of redlining, when federal governments labelled non-white neighbourhoods as undesirable, has historically influenced how much local funding has gone to these areas. Lower income families and communities of colour are more likely to reside in more densely populated areas, with closer proximity to polluting industries such as energy, construction and transport. And a growing body of research suggests that life in these areas is especially tough for children.But does this mean that people living in these areas don't want to take action? ""There is a negative assumption that poorer families are so pre-occupied with economic and social issues that climate change wouldn’t be of interest to them,"" says Merill Singer, professor of anthropology at the University of Connecticut in the US, whose research focuses on the community impact and perceptions of climate change in medical anthropology. One study of a neighbourhood in Hartford, Connecticut, home to a large Latinx population, found that residents feel excluded from climate change information. Participants were very interested in how heatwaves were affecting the health of their babies and young children. ""We found in our research that residents were very concerned because they were already feeling the impacts and suffering the consequences,"" says Singer. ""They want more information and want to participate."" Heat maps are emerging as a powerful tool to help vulnerable communities access this information and provide valuable insights into temperature patterns and locate hotspots. This is enabling policy makers to make better decisions about ways to reduce the impact of rising temperatures. Carbon Count The travel emissions it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. NOAA and its science partner, Capa Strategies, have been mapping more than 70 communities across 22 US states to identify where the hottest neighbourhoods are, why they are hotter than others, and how this affects people living there. They have been working with citizen scientist volunteers who often already reside in a vulnerable area or have an interest in climate change. Since launching the project in 2017, NOAA has recruited more than 20,000 community volunteers. The project gathered more than one million measurements in 2022. Heat data is collected by the volunteers and is then used to aid federal governments to implement cooling solutions in each city through urban greening initiatives, daylighting streams – the process of uncovering buried waterways and restoring them to provide environmental benefits - as well as  building efficiency projects and cooling stations. Led by a team of local community leaders, the volunteers use heat sensors mounted on their own cars to record temperatures on the hottest days of the year. This project is different to other federal heat mapping initiatives because it is a community effort, enabling residents who may not have had access to heat information before. Although previous mapping studies have measured land surface temperatures, NOAA follows a different approach to its data by looking at air temperature and humidity. ""Land surface measurements are useful in some circumstances, when monitoring weather and climate patterns, for example, but they give a less accurate picture of the heat that people experience every day, namely air surface temperatures,"" says Zabow. ""Our urban heat map data is far more accurate to quantify the human experience when talking about the impact of heat on people,"" she adds. The mapping project aims to share awareness about how to protect children from extreme heat and empower others who have an interest in tackling climate change. ""It's not just about government officials going into a city, taking measurements, and never speaking to them again,"" says Zabow. ""It's people from these communities collecting data, who become volunteers and are passionate about learning about the impact heat is having on their children and their neighbourhoods."" The Howard family are an example of how local people can benefit from getting involved in heat awareness initiatives. ""We had a fun family day out in our car with our children – even though it was the hottest time of the day when we were collecting data,"" says Christina. ""Through this experience and working with the City of Dallas and NOAA, we learned how to identify symptoms of heat-related illnesses and where to find resources online and in our community about ways to protect our children during heatwaves. ""We check in with our children more often to see if they are hydrated, and we've introduced more indoor play like board games and creative activities, like baking and writing stories, to motivate our children if outside play is limited when it is too hot outside,"" she says. ""Volunteering gave us a better understanding of how the environment plays its role in the impact of heat around us,"" says Landon. ""Our data readings were noticeably cooler in neighbourhoods with more green space and trees, than those in more built-up areas."" Once the data is collected by the volunteers, it is stored in NOAA's Environmental Visualisation lab in Maryland, and is combined with census data from the White House Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, which identifies communities that are marginalised and overburdened by pollution. This is then aggregated through an interactive dashboard to prompt federal agencies to investigate how disadvantaged communities are being exposed to higher temperatures. The dashboard shows the disparity of health risk between those living in low-income communities or minority groups and more affluent white neighbourhoods. Federal agencies signed up to the programme can use this data to implement strategies to make heat information and resources more accessible in their city, and plan bigger housing and urban development initiatives, such as the introduction of 100 new shaded bus stop shelters in Las Vegas by the Regional Transportation Commission, with plans to expand to 80% of neighbourhoods where some of the hottest readings are. Zabow says the heat maps are making local decision makers pay closer attention to heat issues in their communities and implement effective cooling solutions. ""South Carolina recently declared a heat safety awareness week and we're seeing first-hand how this is positively impacting local neighbourhoods there. They are using our heat island data to build urban farms and a new energy efficient hospital in Charleston,"" she says. Urban agriculture can help reduce temperatures by offering shade and cooling. Increasing urban greening, by for example introducing urban farms, can lower night-time temperatures by 1.1C (2F) in surrounding areas.  The upgraded Medical University of South Carolina hospital has increased the energy efficiency of its buildings by replacing old boiler controls and sensors, retrofitting water fixtures and fume hoods and installing LED lighting upgrades. The renewable energy developer of the hospital, Ameresco, has projected an annual carbon reduction of 3,223 tonnes and annual energy savings of $2,839,000 (£2,275,000). Dallas is the seventh hottest city in the USA according to the Texas Trees Foundation - a non-profit organisation that aims to improve green spaces and plant trees in urban areas. The foundation is combatting extreme heat and heat inequality using existing data from their urban heat island management study. It has set a target to protect and increase Dallas' tree canopy from 32% to 37% by 2040, totalling to almost 15 million trees in the city. In 2015, the Texas Trees Foundation launched a 'cool schools' programme to plant more trees in lower income neighbourhoods, with the aim of providing at least a minimum of 27% shading and cooling relief. The programme has been an effective education effort and it has seen 300-500 children volunteers from each school participate in planting trees. To date the volunteers have planted over 2,000 trees around their school campuses. The Texas Green Schools project in Houston has used heat watch mapping data to introduce a programme aimed at reducing energy consumption in schools and increasing access to green spaces for students in lower-income neighbourhoods. Measures include building shade structures and installing energy-efficient air conditioning systems to reduce indoor temperatures in schools by 15-20C (59-68F), and providing cooling relief for students who live in hotter neighbourhoods. ""Increasing building standards and building in a more energy-efficient way is integral to mitigate the effects of extreme weather, and the long-term effects on young children,"" says O'Sullivan. But gathering data for the heat maps can prove challenging. The project relies on accurate temperature readings from various sources, including community volunteers, weather stations and satellites. ""In some cases, there can be gaps in heat data particularly in areas where there is limited monitoring infrastructure. This can lead to incomplete heat maps, potentially overlooking hotspots or temperature extremes,"" says Singer. Defining the effectiveness of cooling measures can also be complex. Air conditioning, green roofs, tree planting and heat awareness campaigns have varying levels of advantages for vulnerable communities, and will depend on factors like the local climate of an area, ambient pollution – which can be 5% higher than in more rural areas - as well as building design and government maintenance and policy. ""Evaluating the impact of these measures requires rigorous monitoring and analysis which might not always be readily accessible,"" says O'Sullivan. Air conditioning and improving energy efficiency can help keep people cool in hot weather but these measures may not be cost-effective and accessible for poorer families. Some experts argue that these solutions may not address the underlying issue of energy poverty in low-income communities. ""In places like New York City, there are many people who don't have [air conditioning] units because there are building regulations or economic barriers to purchasing them. They also use up a lot of energy,"" says Ngo. ""Challenges such as government legislation, funding and data availability and technical difficulties have limited NOAA's mission to extend the mapping project across the US and worldwide,"" says Zabow. ""Governments and local decision makers often prioritise emergency responses to other climate risks, such as hurricanes, flooding and drought, over heat mitigation."" ""If a tornado, an active wildfire, or flooding comes through a town, you're going to see the destruction. Heat is unfortunately harder for governments to prioritise and fund. We hope to partner with more federal partners and volunteers to build more cooling solutions to protect young children,"" she adds. Heat is becoming increasingly dangerous and it's a threat that is not going away. Community heat maps may not solve the long-term problem, but they are a step in the right direction, by providing awareness and empowering vulnerable children and their families, like the Howards. ""How do we fight off these massive heatwaves that keep happening year upon year?"" says  Christina. ""We want to give our kids the tools to protect themselves from extreme heat right now and when they're older. Who knows what might become of the world in the future there's not enough heat research and actionable change."" -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

economic indicators,Ten major events that shaped business in 2023,2024-09-15,2023-12-28,Meredith Turits,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231219-ten-major-events-that-shaped-business-in-2023,"Soaring profits, stellar collapses, court cases and more – this year, big business moments abounded. Amid an uncertain economy, international political tension and leadership shake-ups, 2023 delivered big moments in business that shaped our year. They'll set the stage for the months to come. February: TikTok bans go global Prior to 2023, some governments around the world had banned the use of Chinese tech-company Bytedance's TikTok on devices, citing security concerns around data sharing with the Chinese government. In 2023, these bans spread – quickly. In February, the European Commission, European Parliament and EU Council all imposed TikTok bans on government employee devices; Canada, too, mandated the removal of the app from federal devices. Shortly after, countries including the UK, New Zealand and Denmark made similar moves. Currently, more than a dozen countries have either partial or full bans in place.  In late February, the US government gave employees 30 days to uninstall TikTok from their work devices. More than half of US states have since adopted similar bans, and even some universities and private-sector companies have moved to take these decisions. In March, the Biden Administration pushed Bytedance to sell the app, but the Chinese government swiftly announced their opposition. In May, Governor Greg Gianforte of Montana signed a bill to ban TikTok within the state, but in November, a federal judge granted a temporary injunction to stop the ban, citing First Amendment protections. March and May: Three US banks fail The failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March, and First Republic Bank in May, marked the most consequential US banking crisis since 2008. Combined, the three banks held more than $500bn (£399bn) in assets – a number that, adjusted for inflation, exceeds the holdings of the 25 banks that collapsed during the global financial crisis. The banks failed for various reasons, but their implosion kicked off a crisis of consumer confidence in the US banking system, in an economy already experiencing soaring inflation. The US government took steps to quell the panic, including providing emergency aid as well as a promise that customers beyond the FDIC insurance limit at these financial institutions would be ""made whole"". By May, the crisis seemed widely contained. But some US banks still remain vulnerable to rapid interest-rate increases, and continue to hold onto immense piles of cash amid uncertain economic conditions. Regulators have been making moves, including increasing scrutiny of risk management, to hopefully prevent similar failures in the future. May: 'Summer of strikes' kicks off with the Writer's Guild of America Organised labour was immensely active this year. Across the UK, for instance, workers in sectors including transport, healthcare, law, education and more walked out in droves, looking for higher pay, better conditions and future job security in a changing technological landscape. Perhaps the highest-profile strikes happened in the US, where millions of workers initiated work stoppages across a range of industries including health care, hospitality, education and manufacturing. The summer was a particularly active period, vaulted into the widespread public eye when the Writer's Guild of America (WGA) ­– representing more than 10,000 American screenwriters – clashed with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers over contract terms. It wasn't the union's first strike, but it lasted into September – 148 days, considerably longer than its 100-day work stoppage in 2007. In July, the Hollywood actors' guild (Sag-Aftra) joined in solidarity, then began pushing for their own contract improvements soon thereafter. Meanwhile, on 15 September, tens-of-thousands of labourers in the United Auto Workers union (UAW) began a six-week rolling strike across the three major US auto manufacturers: GM, Ford and Stellantis. The scale of the collective action was staggering, but so were workers' gains after negotiations. In many cases, global workers scored unprecedented pay rises and job-security protections, especially in an environment of rising living costs and rapid technological advancement.  May: Nvidia hits $1tn ($797bn) market cap There are few companies with a $1tn market value around the world, and in May, chipmaker Nvidia joined the vaunted club. On 30 May, the company exceeded the mega milestone, making them only the fifth in the US – joining Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon – with such a market cap. It's an important signifier for where analysts think business is heading. Nvidia makes about three-quarters of the chips for computers that power generative artificial intelligence, and the company's ascension in such a short period of time reflects the changing tech landscape around the world, as investors are betting big on the AI boom. July: Twitter becomes X In October 2022, after an excruciating period of back-and-forth negotiations, Elon Musk closed a deal to own Twitter, to the tune of $44bn (£35.1bn). The takeover began as a hostile one; within a couple weeks, the company began layoffs of nearly half its workforce. It was a startling way to cap Twitter's wild year – and only laid the foundation for what came next. Many of the biggest changes began to hit in summer 2023, beginning with the appointment of Linda Yaccarino as CEO in June, amid a crisis of dwindling advertisers ­and dwindling revenue. But the public really felt the effect in July, when Musk declared the ""Twitter"" name a relic, renaming the platform ""X"". It was a move both analysts and users panned – experts say the switch may have cost Musk essential, singular brand equity.   Since then, Musk's ownership has continued to be the subject of immense controversy and financial tumult. In October, X's value dropped to more than half of the purchase price. The platform has not only lost users, but haemorrhaged tens-of-millions of advertising dollars. Musk's response to the attrition came in a 23 November interview with DealBook's Andrew Ross Sorkin, in which the billionaire launched a profane attack slamming the brands that have left.  Another problem has just popped up for Musk and his X – in late December, the EU formally announced it suspects the platform has breached its rules in areas including disinformation and countering illegal content. September: Rupert Murdoch steps down After a shaky year in business, 92-year-old Rupert Murdoch announced he was stepping down as chairman of the board of both News Corp and Fox. Settling a Succession-esque battle, Murdoch's son Lachlan became chairman of both companies, alongside his role as Fox's CEO and executive chair. In April, Rupert Murdoch's Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit from the voting-machine company, Dominion, over its reporting of the 2020 presidential election, at the cost of  $787.5m (£620m). The billionaire global media mogul leaves during a critical time, as the 2024 US election approaches. It remains to be seen how much the business will change – if at all – under the stewardship of Lachlan, whose management style may mirror his father's. October: FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried goes on trial Throughout the past few years, experts hailed Sam Bankman-Fried as an economic pioneer – even saviour. As the founder and CEO of Bahamas-based cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Bankman-Fried legitimised the turbulent crypto market, spurring investors to infuse billions into the company. However, after running into a liquidity crisis in November 2022, the once exalted company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  In October 2023, former billionaire Bankman-Fried and several employees of FTX and crypto hedge fund Alameda Research went on trial to face charges including wire fraud, securities and commodities fraud and money laundering. Several employees pled guilty, while Bankman-Fried went on trial for a month in New York City. After testifying, 31-year-old Bankman-Fried was swiftly found guilty on all seven charges he faced. He awaits sentencing.  Since FTX was such a household name, Bankman-Fried's conviction has left a stain on the cryptocurrency industry. Others in the space are trying to move on, but it's proving difficult. Investors are sceptical and largely gun-shy to infuse capital into industry, and regulators have a close eye on what will happen next.  One additional issue eroding confidence is the November resignation of Changpeng Zhao (CZ) as CEO of massive global crypto exchange Binance. Shortly after Bankman-Fried's conviction, Zhao pled guilty to money laundering violations. The US government has ordered him to pay a $50m (£39.8m) fine, and he faces up to 18 months in prison – if not more. October: Microsoft acquires Activision Blizzard Despite the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)'s attempt to block Microsoft's acquisition of video-game developer Activision Blizzard, the $68.7bn (£54.7bn) deal closed in October. As Microsoft's largest-ever purchase, the move bolsters the company's power and profile in the gaming space.  Perhaps more importantly, however, the completion of the acquisition dealt a blow to the Biden administration's wide-reaching plans to fight mergers and acquisitions that could cause price hikes for consumers. Since October, more than $170bn (£135.4bn) worth of mergers have gone through, leaving questions open as to whether President Biden's anti-trust efforts are working.  In December, the FTC the once again challenged the legality of the merger, though anti-trust lawyers say they face a major uphill battle in their newest appeal. November: WeWork files for bankruptcy protection  Once valued at $47bn (£37.4bn), global coworking giant WeWork filed for bankruptcy protection on 6 November. Shares tumbled, leaving the troubled company valued at less than $50m (£41m). The spectacular fall had been years in the making, especially after its failed attempt at IPO in 2019, but experts still saw its downfall as stunning. Although WeWork's bankruptcy was largely due to a flawed business model that relied on excessive real estate holdings, the bankruptcy has left a question hovering over the coworking industry: does anyone still want these spaces? Experts who study work trends and entrepreneurs in the industry both say yes. Hybrid-working patterns are still leaving people wanting connection, and growing revenue figures in the industry indicate sustained demand. December: Purdue Pharma settlement reaches the US Supreme Court At year's end, the high profile lawsuits against US OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma found their way to the Supreme Court. The justices are currently deliberating whether to allow a multibillion dollar bankruptcy plan to move forward. If it does, the Sackler family – which owns the pharmaceutical company – would be shielded from any civil liabilities going forward, after a March 2022 agreement to pay out $6bn (£4.78bn) of personal holdings. The outcome of this case may set a precedent for how US corporations can use bankruptcy law to protect themselves from civil litigation. Arguments are ongoing, with a decision that will likely drag into 2024. If 2023 serves as an indicator for 2024's business landscape, there will be a lot to watch in the new year."
economic indicators,Which countries will recover first?,2024-09-15,2020-04-06,Lindsey Galloway,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20200405-covid-19-how-global-economies-will-recover-from-coronavirus,"Experts have already begun assessing how a recovery might look once the Covid-19 virus is contained, and which countries stand to bounce back best. Top 10 most resilient countries, according to the 2019 Global Resilience Index 1. Norway  2. Denmark  3. Switzerland  4. Germany  5. Finland  6. Sweden  7. Luxembourg  8. Austria  9. US Central  10. United Kingdom See the full list here The Covid-19 pandemic has injected an unprecedented amount of uncertainty into the global economy, as countries across the world battle growing infections, implement wide-ranging social-distancing strategies and attempt early fiscal interventions to stabilise markets. While managing the immediate health crisis is vital and necessary for economic stability, experts have already begun assessing how a recovery might look once the virus is contained and which countries stand to bounce back best. To better understand this, we turned to the 2019 Global Resilience Index by insurance company FM Global, which ranks the resiliency of the business environment across 130 countries, based on factors like political stability, corporate governance, risk environment and supply chain logistics and transparency. Pairing these rankings with their country’s initial response to the virus, we identified the nations across the globe that have a high likelihood of maintaining stability and resilience through the crisis. We talked to residents and experts in these places to understand how they’re coping now and what they might look forward to in the hopefully near-term future. Denmark  Ranked second in the index, Denmark scores high marks for its supply chain tracking and low governmental corruption. The country also moved quickly when it came to enacting social-distancing measures in light of the spread of the virus. It announced a shutdown of schools and non-essential private businesses on 11 March and closed its borders to foreigners on 14 March, when the country only had a handful of positive cases. But the moves have already proven effective. “Regular flu has dropped by 70% versus last year, which must be a good indicator of the effectiveness of the steps taken by the government,” said Rasmus Aarup Christiansen, managing partner of Pissup Tours, based in Copenhagen. “I was sceptical at first but seeing how almost all other countries have taken similar steps [like lockdowns and border closings] soon after Denmark, it seems the government was doing the right thing.” Danish culture, which tends to be trusting of authority and willing to stand together for a common cause, has also had an impact on the effectiveness of the measures. “The word ‘samfundssind’ (which roughly translates to “civic sense” or “civic duty”) is the new buzzword in Denmark on both social and traditional media, and most people feel a moral duty to make sacrifices for the sake of public health,” said Aarup Christiansen. “No-one wants to be called out for being responsible for endangering the lives of senior citizens just because they won’t give up their usual luxuries.” That doesn’t mean there haven’t been challenges, however. Aarup Christiansen has personally seen his travel business revenues plummet. While he appreciates the governmental financial aid packages, announced on 14 March (which include covering some of the costs of worker salaries), the rules and outputs have yet to be fully defined and put in place, leading to more uncertainty and layoffs. Still, the measures, like paying 90% of wages of hourly workers and 75% of those of salaried workers affected by the crisis, are being hailed as a model for the rest of the world, by essentially “freezing” the economy until the storm subsides. The model won’t come cheap however; the measures are expected to cost 13% of total GDP. You may also be interested in:  • The most inviting city in Africa?  • Five countries saving the planet  • The world's next superpowers There’s also the sense here that this is a global crisis, and Denmark’s resilience will no doubt rely on how the rest of the world adapts and maintains open trade. “Denmark may be able to gain a relative advantage by having dodged some of the more serious consequences,” said Aarup Christiansen. In fact, the country is already talking about loosening some of the restrictions by Easter based on the containment so far, according to a Bloomberg report. “Denmark’s well-developed pharmaceutical sector may prove an advantage,” said Aarup Christiansen. “I would, however, find no pride in Denmark being better off if it comes from other countries having to suffer.” Singapore Singapore scores high in the index for its strong economy, low political risk, strong infrastructure and low corruption in the survey, pushing it to number 21 in the overall resilience ranking. The country also moved fast to contain the virus and has had one of the flattest curves in the pandemic. “We have tremendous trust in our government, who are relatively transparent about every step they are taking to fight this crisis,” said resident Constance Tan, who works for data analysis platform Konigle. “As a general rule, if the government enforces something, we comply.” That said, there are still rule-flouters, and the country has taken away passports and work passes for those in violation, according to a 21 March report by Channel News Asia. “But as a whole, we work together, and we do not need to worry about social unrest, people dying on the streets or economic destabilisation,” said Tan. As a small country, Singapore depends on the recovery of the rest of the world to have the most successful rebound, but residents generally believe in the strength of the future here. “As a people, like everywhere else, I think surviving this will make everyone more resilient,” said native Justin Fong. “One thing for sure, this has forced the adoption of technology which will bode well for Singaporeans.” Many businesses like Konigle implemented work-from-home policies quickly, and the government released the Trace Together app to help track the virus, which many residents have downloaded. United States  To capture the United States’ broad geographic footprint, the index splits up the country into West, Central and East regions, but as a whole, the US ranks well (9th, 11th and 22nd, respectively) for its low-risk business environment and strong supply chain. Containing the virus has proven challenging in major metropolitan areas like New York, and unemployment has already jumped to historic levels, in large part due to the mandatory shutdowns of more than half of US states, which has particularly hit restaurant and retail workers and other businesses that rely on foot traffic. But the US government has moved quickly to pass stimulus measures to stabilise the economy, and social distancing strategies enacted elsewhere in the country, which seem to be having an effect, should lessen the overall impact of the virus, allowing for a quicker economic recovery. Financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are predicting a “V-shaped” recession and recovery, with an unprecedented negative immediate impacts (as is already being seen) but a relatively quick recovery in the later quarters of the year; while consultants like McKinsey are taking a more measured, but still optimistic view, on recovery based on the successful implementation of public health measures – like the lockdowns in place – and policy interventions like the already-announced $2t stimulus package, likely the first of many. The US is also critical to the world economy, representing a nearly a quarter of global GDP, and the recovery of the global economy is highly dependent on how the US fares. “Generally speaking, the US economy is better-positioned to recover from large shocks and potential longer-run shifts than much of the rest of the world. The population is on average younger than much of the rest of the world with more mobility, and labour market restrictions are generally lighter, thereby facilitating greater labour reallocation” said Eric Sims, professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame. “More immediately, the Federal Reserve in the US and the Bank of England in the UK (neither of which have yet gone to negative policy rates) have a bit more space to provide monetary accommodation than other central banks around the world, such as the ECB or the Bank of Japan.” To further enhance the US’ recovery, the presidential administration has proposed dividing the nation into areas that are less hard hit and allowing normal economic activity to recur. “I think those measures would go long way towards ultimately setting up the conditions for strong recovery,” said Peter C Earle, research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research, a not-for-profit academic think tank. “We want money, goods, services, labour and ideas to flow as freely as possible, not just domestically but internationally as well.” The US’ lack of universal healthcare has been one criticism of the county’s ability to handle the crisis, and one that needs to be addressed for future resiliency. “I think eventually the world can emerge stronger after the virus is contained and I believe the US can, too. But it all depends on the lessons we learn,” said Michael Merrill, an economist and labour historian in the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations. “We are going to have to invest in new forms of public health and create sustainable forms of social protection and institutional resiliency if we are to return to the commercially dense, interconnected, highly networked societies that were the norm only one month ago.” Rwanda We felt confident that the Rwandan government would handle the situation way better than in our home countries Due to recent improvements in corporate governance, Rwanda has made some of the largest leaps in the index in recent years, jumping 35 spots to its current rank of 77th most resilient in the world (and fourth highest in Africa). Most importantly, it looks particularly well positioned to bounce back from this type of crisis as the country successfully contained Ebola from its borders after an outbreak from neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2019. With its mix of universal health care, medical supply-delivering drones and thermometer checks at its borders, Rwanda stands to be well-equipped to maintain stability throughout the crisis, especially when compared to other countries in the region. “A lot of foreign students like me stayed behind because we felt confident that the Rwandan government would handle the situation way better than in our home countries,” said Garnett Achieng, digital content curator for Baobab Consulting and student at the African Leadership University, who lives in Kigali and is originally from Kenya. “Amongst foreign African students, the only anxiety comes with knowing that our families back home are not in the same situation we are in.” Rwanda was the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to impose a total lockdown, and is already distributing free food door-to-door to the country’s most vulnerable. While tourism is expected to be hit hard, as Rwanda is a popular destination for many international conferences and exhibitions, Achieng is hopeful that the country will have relatively few casualties to the virus, making it well-positioned to recover quickly. New Zealand Ranked 12th-most resilient in the index, New Zealand scores especially high in corporate governance and its supply chain. The country has also been able to move quickly to contain the spread of the virus by shutting borders to international travellers on 19 March and enacting a non-essential-business lockdown on 25 March. “As an island nation, it is easier to control our borders, the main source of infections. So the effective border closure makes sense,” said Auckland resident Shamubeel Eaqub, economist at consultancy Sense Partners. “Compared to other countries, the response in New Zealand has been bold and decisive.” The measures are paying off, as some epidemiologists see it as having potential to be one of few “normal” nations left, according to a Guardian report, eliminating all cases if measures remain strong for the coming weeks. With tourism and exports a major part of the economy, New Zealand will face some struggles to its economy in the near term, but this doesn’t necessarily have to be a bad thing. “By being insulated, we will have time to recalibrate,” said Dunedin resident Ron Bull, director of curriculum development at Otago Polytechnic. “We had already started talking about the impact of campers and backpackers on the environment, and this gives us time to weigh up what’s important against the waves of tourist dollars coming in.” Overall, the country is well-placed for a stable recovery, with low levels of government debt and the ability to enact quantitative easing to keep interest rates low. “We have fewer constraints to both blunt the impact of dealing with [the] pandemic and supercharge the recovery,” said Eaqub. “Most importantly, New Zealand remains a relatively high-trust country. This will be a strong foundation for recovery from the biggest health and economic shock in generations.” Bull agrees the country has a likelihood to come out stronger. “Just like a family living in the same house, you have to get to know each other,” he said. “It’s our time to sit down as a New Zealand family and decide who we want to be and make some decisions to make us stronger and better.” Living In is a series from BBC Travel that discovers what it’s like to reside in some of the world’s top destinations.

economic indicators,Secrets of ‘high-potential’ personality,2024-09-15,2018-05-09,David Robson,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180508-the-secrets-of-the-high-potential-personality,"Are there six traits that could really mark out your potential to achieve? Are you curious, conscientious and competitive? Do you also have the more mysterious qualities of “high adjustment”, “ambiguity acceptance” and “risk approach”? If so, congratulations! According to new psychological research, these six traits constitute a “high potential” personality that will take you far in life. The truth, of course, is a little more nuanced. It turns out the same traits, in excess, may also impede your performance, and the real secret to success may be to know exactly where you fall on each spectrum, and how to make the most of your strengths and account for your weaknesses. But this new approach promises to be an important step forward in our bid to understand the complex ways our personality affects our working life. Attempts to capture our workplace personality have, after all, suffered a chequered record in the past. One of the most popular tests used today is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which sorts people according to various thinking styles, such as “introversion/extroversion” and “thinking/feeling”. As many as nine out of 10 US companies now use Myers-Briggs to screen employees. Unfortunately, many psychologists feel that the theory behind the different categories is outdated and fails to correlate with actual measures of performance. One study suggested that the MBTI is not great at predicting managerial success. Some critics even claim that it is pseudoscience. “As a conversation starter, it’s a good tool, but if you are using it on a large scale to predict performance or to try and find high-performing candidates, it doesn’t work,” says Ian MacRae, a psychologist and co-author of the book High Potential. Figuring that recent advances in psychological research could do better, MacRae and Adrian Furnham of University College London have now identified six traits that are consistently linked to workplace success, which they have now combined into the High Potential Trait Inventory (HPTI).   MacRae points out that each trait may also have drawbacks at extremes, meaning there is an optimal value of each one. He also emphasises that the relative importance of each trait will be determined by the job you are doing, so the particular thresholds would need to be adapted depending on whether you are hoping to succeed in, say, a technical position. But the version of the test that I have seen was focused on leadership roles. With this in mind, the six traits are:   ConscientiousnessConscientious people commit themselves to plans and make sure they carry them out to the letter. They are good at overcoming their impulses and thinking about the wisdom of their decisions for the long-term. After IQ, conscientiousness is often considered one of the best predictors of life outcomes like educational success. At work, high conscientiousness is essential for good strategic planning, but in excess it may also mean that you are too rigid and inflexible.AdjustmentEveryone faces anxieties, but people with high adjustment can cope with them more easily under pressure, without allowing it to negatively influence their behaviour and decision-making. People with low scores on this scale do appear to suffer from poor performance at work, but you can mitigate those effects with the right mindset. Various studies have shown that reframing a stressful situation as a potential source of growth – rather than a threat to their wellbeing – can help people to recover from negative situations more quickly and more productively.Ambiguity acceptanceAre you the kind of person who would prefer tasks to be well-defined and predictable? Or do you relish the unknown? People with a high tolerance for ambiguity can incorporate many more viewpoints before coming to a decision, which means they are less dogmatic and more nuanced in their opinions.“Low ambiguity tolerance can be considered a kind of dictatorial characteristic,” MacRae says. “They’ll try to distil complicated messages into one easy selling point, and that can be a typical trait of destructive leadership.”Crucially, someone who can accept ambiguity will find it easier to react to changes – such as an evolving economic climate or the rise of a new technology – and to cope with complex, multifaceted problems. “We’re trying to identify the ability of leaders to listen to lots of different opinions, to take complex arguments and to make sense of them in a proactive way, instead of simplifying them,” MacRae adds. “And we have found that the more senior you are in a leadership position, the more important that becomes for decision-making.” Conscientious people commit themselves to plans and make sure they carry them out to the letter. They are good at overcoming their impulses and thinking about the wisdom of their decisions for the long-term.

People with a high tolerance for ambiguity can incorporate many more viewpoints before coming to a decision, which means they are less dogmatic and more nuanced in their opinions. “Low ambiguity tolerance can be considered a kind of dictatorial characteristic,” MacRae says. “They’ll try to distil complicated messages into one easy selling point, and that can be a typical trait of destructive leadership.” Crucially, someone who can accept ambiguity will find it easier to react to changes – such as an evolving economic climate or the rise of a new technology – and to cope with complex, multifaceted problems. “We’re trying to identify the ability of leaders to listen to lots of different opinions, to take complex arguments and to make sense of them in a proactive way, instead of simplifying them,” MacRae adds. “And we have found that the more senior you are in a leadership position, the more important that becomes for decision-making.” Low ambiguity acceptance will not always be a drawback. In certain fields – such as regulation – it can be better to take a more ordered approach that irons out all the wrinkles in the process. Knowing where you stand on this spectrum may prevent you from stretching too far from your comfort zone. Curiosity Compared to our other mental traits, curiosity has been somewhat neglected by psychologists. Yet recent research shows that an inherent interest in new ideas brings many advantages to the workplace: it may mean that you are more creative and flexible in the procedures you use, help you to learn more easily, increases your overall job satisfaction and protects you from burnout. In excess, however, curiosity can also lead you to have a “butterfly mind” – flying from project to project without seeing them through. Risk approach (or courage) Would you shy away from a potentially unpleasant confrontation? Or do you steam ahead in the knowledge that the short-term discomfort will resolve the situation, bringing long-term benefits? Unsurprisingly, the capacity to deal with difficult situations is critical for management positions where you need to take action for the greater good, even when you are faced with opposition. Competitiveness There’s a fine line between striving for personal success and caving into unhealthy jealousy of others. At its best, competitiveness can be a powerful motivation that leads you to go the extra mile; at its worst, it can lead teams to break down. Together, these six traits consolidate most of our understanding to date on the many different qualities that influence work performance, particularly for those setting their sights on leadership. Equally interesting are the personality traits that MacRae and Furnham haven’t included, however. The extroversion-introversion scale, for instance, may determine how we deal with certain social situations, but it seems to make little difference in overall job performance. Agreeableness – our capacity to get along with other people – doesn’t appear to predict professional success. To measure each trait in the HPTI, participants have to rate how strongly they agree or disagree with a series of statements, such as: “I get frustrated when I don’t know precisely what is expected of me at work” (aimed at discovering ambiguity acceptance) or “my personal targets exceed those of my organisation” (which measures conscientiousness). MacRae has now validated HPTI in various sectors, tracking the performance of business leaders of multinational organisations over several years, for instance. The research is still ongoing, but a paper published last year demonstrated that these traits can predict subjective and objective measures of success. In one analysis, the participants’ answers explained about 25% of the variation in income – which is a reasonably strong correlation (and comparable to the influence of intelligence, say) even if it does still leave many differences unexplained. In this study, competitiveness and ambiguity acceptance turned out to be the strongest predictors of take-home pay, while conscientiousness seemed to best predict the subjective measures of satisfaction. The researchers have also examined the relation of these traits to IQ – another important predictor of workplace success – finding a small overlap between the two. As part of a wider recruitment process, the HPTI could be used to screen high potential candidates, but MacRae says it can also aid personal development, so that you can identify your own strengths and weaknesses and the ways you may account for them. It could also be useful for constructing a balanced team that reflects the full spectrum of “high potential” traits, with a wealth of research showing that groups benefit from diverse thinking styles. Almost everyone will fall outside the optimum range for at least some of these traits, but this needn’t be a problem if we have colleagues who can rein us in. But does anyone ever meet all the criteria? MacRae told me that he can think of a couple of individuals who fit the bill, including the CEO of a bank in Canada. “He was almost optimal in all of the traits,” MacRae says. “And I have to say, that was very intimidating.” Despite those feelings of awe, the benefits of this unique personality profile were apparent throughout the meeting. “Even if it can be a bit scary to work with that kind of person, you know exactly what to expect – they are someone you can trust, rely on and respect.”"
economic indicators,How Greece’s millennials pay the bills,2024-09-15,2018-11-13,Jessica Bateman,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20181107-what-it-takes-to-be-young-greek-and-able-to-pay-your-bills,"Contending with one of the world’s worst labour markets, many Greek millennials are ditching dreams of creative, specialised work. Instead, they're making a plan B to get by. Areti Stabelou, from Athens, has been unemployed since she and 24 colleagues were made redundant from their call centre jobs in July. She didn’t like the work; it was hard and drained her energy. “I was just there for the money – it didn’t give me anything else,” she says. It’s one of a series of short-term, low-skilled roles the 28-year-old has held since graduating university with a degree in political science in 2011. She hasn’t been able to find anything better.  “I would like to do something creative. When I first left university I wanted to work in political analysis or for a non-profit,” says Stabelou.  But when her parents moved out of the city, she needed an income to live on. “I had to support myself and find any work I could.”  Greek millennials currently face one of the toughest job markets in the developed world. The youth unemployment rate of 40% has been much discussed in coverage of the Mediterranean nation’s almost decade-long financial crisis, but less reported is the issue of underemployment. Those who do manage to find a job often find themselves, like Stabelou, trapped in one tenuous, low-skilled job after the next. The minimum monthly salary – which most graduates earn – has dropped from 800 euros ($920) to 600 euros ($690) since the start of the crisis, and one in four young people are classed as living in poverty. It’s one of the reasons around 250,000 graduates have left Greece to seek work in other countries over the past eight years. Stabelou’s experience is typical of many who have graduated since the crisis hit. Their main complaint isn’t necessarily that they can’t find a job at all but rather that they can’t find one that is secure, well paid or matched to their skills. This leaves many bright graduates working as bartenders or waiters in the service industry or doing promotional work like handing out flyers in the streets. Many of these jobs are not declared and so not counted in official employment figures. According to Dr Michael Arghyrou, a Greek reader in economics at Cardiff Business School, the country’s shadow economy probably accounts for around one third of all its economic activity. “I am sure that much of this is involving young people,” he says. “It affects their personal wellbeing because they feel insecure, and it affects the country’s finances.” Stabelou admits the experience of struggling to find stable, satisfying work has taken a psychological toll. “In the past I felt very nervous and pessimistic for my future,” she says. “For a period, I was quite depressed – I felt I didn’t have the ability to do anything.” Her most recent period of unemployment has been made easier because she now lives with her boyfriend, who can afford to support her financially and psychologically. “I feel like I have the time now to find out what I want to do in life... I do not want another job like my last one.” Getting hands on Other graduates that previously had ‘traditional’ ambitions have decided to retrain in practical trades, such as hairdressing or tattooing. Agapi Katsorchi, 28, who graduated in 2011 with a degree in political science, retrained as a nail technician after struggling to find any type of well-paid work. “I wanted a career that was creative and inspiring. I would have liked to carry on studying, but didn’t have enough money. I was still optimistic [when the crisis hit] but when I finished university I realised how much it had affected our futures,” she says. The summer of 2011, when she graduated, the average Greek wage had fallen by 13%. A 109bn euro ($124bn) bailout was agreed that summer, and strikes and protests brought the country to a standstill. “My friends and I were all very anxious about finding a job related to our studies, and whether this job would even be permanent. I was lucky because I could live with my parents, but for those who had to live alone it was extremely hard.” Five months after graduating – two of which she spent in unskilled office roles – Katsorchi noticed an advert for a nail art course. Women’s beauty remains one of the few growth industries in Greece – a well-observed phenomenon known as ‘the lipstick index’, which is common in many depressed economies. “I always liked doing mine and other people’s nails,” she says. “After I retrained I realised that I actually really like this job. I find it very creative and I am paid well.” Other graduates have similar stories: one of her colleagues working in nail art has an archaeology degree. Some are skipping university altogether and choosing to pursue trades straight out of high school. Hacking the future Some who witnessed the crisis unfold while still teenagers started university knowing a job wouldn’t be a sure thing on the other side. Instead, they have cooked up a plan B, looking for ways to create their own opportunities. “My dad was without work for several years and it made me realise I couldn’t just wait to finish my studies and find a job – I had to do things for myself, from early on,” says Vasileios Karavasilis, 25, co-founder of games development company eNVy Softworks. His and five other classmates’ solution was to start teaching themselves how to make video games alongside their degrees in computer engineering. “The problem I see is that employers want practical skills which universities don’t teach you,” he says. “And the crisis means companies don’t have any money to train you.” Karavasili and his friends spent four years studying internet tutorials, seeking out mentors and attending industry events before eNVy found their first client. “It was hard to remain optimistic at times,” he admits. “But after we got one client, it just kept rolling.” Setting up businesses or finding non-traditional ways to create opportunities is a trend Karavasili says he is noticing more among students and recent graduates. “Five years ago, no one was doing that,” he says. “Now there are a lot of student organisations encouraging people to get out of the university mindset, teaching them to develop their own skills and work things out for themselves. “I think it’s good to encourage this, but we also need to teach people that it’s not easy. Although with the current situation, I don’t think we have any other choice.” In with the new Although she is currently out of work, Stabelou feels more optimistic about the future for young Greeks than she was even a year or two ago. “I am seeing more quality jobs advertised now, not just ones in call centres or for promotional work,” she says. “These past 10 years have been very difficult for our generation. But I think young people need to stay in Greece and work to improve the situation and our lives.” Greece officially exited its bailout programme in August and GDP is predicted to grow by 2.32% in 2019. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipris has promised to raise wages and cut taxes. Economist Arghyrou remains sceptical: he says he believes the country is still overly bureaucratic and not business-friendly enough to create impactful, sustainable growth. But Stabelou believes her generation is the one that will move the country forward. “All the bad things have been caused by older people. But we are the ones who can bring change.”"
economic indicators,An empire built on pirated CDs,2024-09-15,2019-01-24,Sarah Treleaven,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190122-building-an-empire-in-cambodia--starting-wtih-pirated-cds,"Serial entrepreneur Chy Sila grew businesses in Cambodia for a growing middle class. Photos by Thomas Cristofoletti. Cambodian entrepreneur Chy Sila was born in 1974, one year before the Khmer Rouge took over the country. At 18, he was fresh out of university, working as a tour guide. He wanted to be a lawyer, then an architect. Then in 1998, he began his life as an entrepreneur, starting the first of his many, increasingly successful ventures. As Chy has grown his businesses, he has collected many meaningful objects along the way. All of them tell the story of his journey through life, and also reflect upon Cambodia’s growth as a country in which opportunity has opened. Over the last 20 years, Chy’s accomplishments have paralleled Cambodia’s increasing openness to foreign business and economic growth. The country has averaged 7% in GDP growth per year throughout the past two decades. Fast food restaurants, shopping centres and luxury hotels have sprouted in Phnom Penh. “In 1998, I was working as a tour guide and then decided to start my own business with my childhood friends to make more money,” says Chy. “We were young and we didn’t have much money or experience.”   They thought deeply about the trends and opportunities, and decided to open a shop selling pirated CDs. Although illegal, it was a common business venture at the time, since genuine CDs were too expensive for the local market. Chy estimates that there were 20 or 30 of these stores in Phnom Penh at the time. A customer gave Chy a copy of the Buena Vista Social Club CD – the soundtrack to the popular 1999 movie – and asked him to make a copy. The customer suggested that other customers, like the large number of expats and aid workers, might like a copy, too. “That’s when I realised we could supply them with music from around the world – the things you couldn’t already get, like Cuban, reggae, French music, classical, hip hop,” says Chy. In two years, he sold almost 1,000 copies of the Buena Vista Social Club. His pirated CD shop became one of the most popular in Phnom Penh. With his shop built on piracy, Chy wanted to move into a more legitimate business. He again looked to the emerging trends and saw a newly booming economy in a region with four Asian ‘tigers’ – Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan – that industrialised rapidly between the 1960s and 1990s. In 2001, Chy decided the time was right to launch a fast food chain called BB World – or Big Burger World. “We thought it was easy and catchy,” he says. The first BB World restaurant was 4,000 sq ft (372 sq m), enormous for the market at that time. But Chy bet that Cambodia’s small but growing middle class – the economy got a big boost in 1999, with 9% growth – would take to the small luxury of a burger and fries.   He was right. Six months later, he opened another BB World in a new shopping centre.   Although Cambodia has yet to gain a single McDonald’s franchise, brands like KFC (a trailblazer in 2008) and Burger King have proliferated. In 2003, Chy decided that coffee was the next trend he wanted to tackle in business.   “At the time, there was nothing like Starbucks in Cambodia,” he says. “Coffee culture had been around for years because of French colonialism, but it was all served at cheap roadside stands.”   Starbucks opened its first Cambodian store only in 2015, but now operates 13 locations in Phnom Penh. The new idea for Chy’s chain, T&C, was to introduce a culture of drinking freshly roasted quality coffee in comfortable air conditioning. “We were looking at selling coffee for $1.50 – or three times the existing market price,” he says.   For inspiration, he bought a number of books about growing, buying, making and selling coffee around the world, including this Chinese book.   The chain was a success, with 12 locations at its peak. In 2007, Chy again changed up his business plan. The internet was booming, though still very expensive in Cambodia.   “People here still didn’t have mobile technology, including smartphones or laptops,” he says. (According to a 2018 Freedom House report, Internet penetration is still low at just 34% in Cambodia versus almost 95% in the United Kingdom.)   Chy bet his money that the next big trend could be online games, starting his company ‘Sabay’ – which means ‘happiness’ in Cambodian. “From my early childhood through young adulthood, it was constant war,” he says. “I really believe the next generation deserves to be happier.” Sabay started out with four people in 2007 and now employs almost 200 workers. Per-capita GDP in Cambodia increased about 70% between 2006 and 2011 – helping to create a larger consumer base for his business. In addition to online games, the media company also owns websites and blogs, produces and distributes movies and television and owns cinemas.   “Our businesses have always been aimed at the middle class, which is a challenge because we still have a big gap between the rich and poor,” Chy says. “We always hope we’ll have more people with buying power.” In 2008, as Sabay starting generating revenue, Chy decided to buy himself a small gift: the Jaeger Lecoultre Reverso watch that he had always dreamed about. “I’m not a materialistic guy but I spent a lot of money on this,” he says. “It’s my lifetime gift. It reminds me of my hard work and achievement.” Although the luxury market in Cambodia is still small, the counterfeit goods of yesterday are gradually giving way to the real thing, including a Porsche dealership, Hugo Boss store and the five-star Rosewood Phnom Penh – all of which opened in the last few years. Several years ago, Chy got into cycling when he was looking for something meaningful to do with his spare time. “I have my biking partner and we ride through these small villages that remind me of my childhood. That’s how I maintain a connection to this part of Cambodia,” he says. He also created the Sabay biking team, which now has more than 20 members. In September, they climbed a mountain in Taiwan. “We have time to chat and get to know each other better,” he says. “Also, cycling really teaches you persistence. It makes you realise you actually can climb a mountain.” I remember when I was a child, my mum saved for three years to buy me a bicycle. I never imagined that a bicycle could cost $10,000 Since Chy started building businesses 20 years ago, much has changed in Cambodia. There are still challenges for entrepreneurs, including staffing in the absence of STEM-focused education, market size, access to financing and a strong urban-rural divide.   But that isn’t holding Chy back. Sensing yet another opportunity to be a trendsetter, he’s now planning to introduce a dairy industry to Cambodia.   “We still have so much room to grow here. We call this ‘the golden time’,” says Chy. Businesses are opening, there are a lot of young people, and labour costs are still relatively low – plus market entry isn’t that expensive so people can get a start here.” To me, it’s always lucky to be a pioneer. You have to challenge yourself to introduce these things to the market but if you make it, you’ll be the leader"
economic indicators,Longevity economy,2024-09-15,2019-07-22,Mari Shibata,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190718-longevity-economy,"Embracing the elderly alongside younger generations could combat what economic doomsayers call a “demographic time bomb”. Societal ageing has generally been considered detrimental to a country’s economic health, since it reduces the workforce and increases burdens on healthcare systems. But with a rapid increase in health-span over the past few decades, how do we embrace the changing economics of ageing? The idea of “oldness” stifles business thinking, says Dr Joseph Couglin, founder and director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology AgeLab. He argues that oldness is a social construct that’s at odds with how we realistically live after middle age. That is, people are still plenty capable – and want to be involved – when they hit old age. Coughlin, author of Longevity Economy: Unlocking the World’s Fastest-Growing, Most Misunderstood Market, says businesses need to serve what older people actually want – not what conventional wisdom suggests they need. The economy can actually benefit from people’s longevity if we are able to rethink the ways in which businesses target younger generations. As life expectancies increase, so grows a group of consumers, workers and innovators – and they are getting wealthier by the day. Calendar years will no longer become an objective indicator of age, and are instead creating the space for a new life-stage to emerge.

economic indicators,Can the Nordics really nail equality?,2024-09-15,2019-09-04,Maddy Savage,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190831-the-paradox-of-working-in-the-worlds-most-equal-countries,"Even Europe's most egalitarian countries struggle to put women on an even footing at work. In the Nordics, why do women still lag behind men in pay, management and company ownership? When Bolette Wrestroem moved back to Denmark after spending most of her twenties overseas, she was excited to experience the “gender equality” for which the Nordic region is globally famous. At first, she wasn’t disappointed. “I definitely think Denmark is more open-minded than all the other places I have lived,” says the 28-year-old, now a community manager for a Copenhagen start-up. “There is more focus on what you are capable of, instead of your gender.”  But amid immersion in a culture that seemed to actively champion women’s rights, she couldn’t escape the fact that there were still “primarily white males sitting at the top” of many of the best-known companies. Denmark’s global image, versus the reality, “didn’t always match up”. It is a paradox that many women working in the Nordics will recognise. The region has a glowing reputation as the best place in the world when it comes to gender equality, thanks to welfare states that support working families and promote parental leave, and legal, political and cultural support for the goal of gender equality. But many experts argue that progress has flatlined, suggesting these countries are further from achieving equality than global observers might imagine. “We do have the idea of being gender equal…but we have a long way to go before we are gender equal,” argues Anneli Häyren, a researcher at the Centre for Gender Research at Uppsala University in Sweden. “I think it will take quite a lot of time - another 50 years at least - until we get there - and that is only if we keep working at it.” Glass ceilings Strong progress has been made in the public sector; in Sweden more women than men currently hold management positions in this sphere. In politics, 46% of Swedish members of parliament are women, while the proportion in other Nordic countries is around 40%. However, there are still surprisingly few women in senior private sector roles. Just  28% of managers in Denmark are female, rising to 32% in Finland and Norway, and 36% in Sweden, according to a report by independent think tank The Cato Institute in 2018. Iceland is the highest-scoring Nordic country, with 40%. But that is still three points behind the US, where 43% of managers are women, despite the US ranking just 51 in the World Economic Forum’s Gender Gap index. Strong concerns about this disparity were raised last year in The Nordic Gender Effect at Work, a report from the Nordic Council of Ministers, an advisory body. The writers found “a troubling pattern” in businesses - “the higher up the hierarchy you look, the more men you will see”. “It feels more equal than in the US, because people are more focused and consistent in talking about the topic...But I am not sure they are always held accountable in terms of upholding those ideals,” agrees Dani Nguyen, 31, an executive recruiter based in the Swedish capital who previously worked in Silicon Valley. When it comes to pay, the difference between gross average hourly earnings of male and female employees in Denmark, Iceland and Norway is only slightly below the EU average of 16%. In Finland the figure creeps to 16.7%. Sweden comes out best with 12.3%, but still lags behind Luxembourg, Italy and Romania, which all manage a pay gap of 5% or less. Meanwhile, women in the Nordics trail their male counterparts in attracting investment for new businesses. Only 1% of investments registered in the Nordic Tech List database last year went to companies headed solely by female founders, according to figures analysed by Swedish business news site DI Digital. “It is definitely a problem,” says Rikke Eckhoff Høvding, CEO of industry body The Norwegian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (NVCA).  “It is easier to get VC funding if you are male. We have had this discussion a lot in the last few years and everyone is asking ‘what we can do next?’.” Why has progress stalled? Gender experts and campaigners are at odds over why the region continues to face these disparities. One common explanation is that women are more likely than men to choose public sector careers. This contributes to the pay gap (public sector jobs tend to pay less) and limits the pool of female talent available for top private sector roles. But the reasons women tend to pick these careers remain up for debate. Last year, researchers in the US and UK found that countries with an existing culture of gender equality have an even smaller proportion of women taking degrees in science, technology and mathematics (STEM). “It is a paradox … nobody would have expected this to be the reality of our time,” says Professor Gijsbert Stoet, one of the report’s authors. He argues that since Nordic countries have a generally high standard of living and strong welfare states, young women are free to pick careers based on their own interests, which he says are often more likely to include working in care-giving roles or with languages. By contrast, high achievers in less stable economies might choose STEM careers based on the income and security they provide, even if they prefer other areas. “Girls and boys are different, and have different preferences on the whole,” he argues. He believes too much media focus is placed on the lack of women in CEO positions, since these account for such a small proportion of jobs overall, and suggests that more men fill these roles since “the personality traits and ambition to be important and famous is higher in men than women”. But others strongly believe that social conditioning is the major driver when it comes to women’s career choices and promotion opportunities, and stress that gender stereotypes persist. “I don’t think it’s about choice, it’s about structures … to say it’s about choice is to ‘blame the victim’,” says Anneli Häyren at the Centre for Gender Research at Uppsala University. She argues that men remain better paid due to a greater value being placed on management positions and in certain sectors, such as tech and science, which are “male-gendered”, in contrast to “female-gendered” jobs focused on caregiving. She says men in professions like preschool teaching or nursing usually find it easier to climb these career ladders than women entering “male-gendered” areas. “It is a waterproof sign of how strong the patriarchy is,” she argues. Häyren also rejects the idea that women in the Nordics are less ambitious than men. “Research suggests it is often a strategic decision not to apply for certain roles…Women do want (it), but they realise that they won’t get it.” Work-life balance Juggling a career with family life remains a challenge for some women in the Nordics, despite policies like subsidised childcare and flexible working hours encouraging couples to share parenting. While Nordic fathers do take more parental leave than anywhere else in the world, the gender split of parenting labour remains far from equal. In Iceland and Sweden - which have the most generous policies - almost 30% of leave is taken by fathers, while in Norway the figure is just over 19%, and the proportion drops to 11% in Denmark and Finland, according to The Nordic Gender Effect at Work report. The report also flags two ongoing challenges; women are more likely to work part-time and they invest more hours in housework or caring for elderly relatives than men. Many who can afford help choose not to, because there is a degree of stigma attached to outsourcing household chores in Scandinavia. Even the region’s most high-profile influencer and businesswoman, Isabella Löwengrip, faced criticism when she hired a personal assistant after divorcing her husband. “Men are more active in family life...But women still feel split between work and home and being a good parent - even though we are not in the 1950s anymore,” reflects Anette Tvedergaard Madsen, 45, who has three children and holds a senior marketing role at one of Denmark’s largest banks. Madsen argues that most Nordic companies recognise the benefits of a diverse workforce and its importance when it comes to employer branding. “You want to be a modern organisation and an attractive workplace by creating diversity - not only male and female but also different nationalities,” she says. But the marketing strategist believes that unconscious biases can affect senior hiring decisions.  “Men are definitely not trying to avoid women in top positions,” she argues, but “who they know best and who is sitting next to them” continues to play a role, as well as protecting their own reputations. Stockholm-based recruiter Dani Nguyen agrees. “Even in Sweden there is something of an ‘old boys club’, she argues. “The corporate environment has been built by white men and for white men.” What can be done? Campaigners are proposing a wide range of solutions to move forward, including calls for individual company targets for senior managers or nationwide quotas. “If this isn’t a KPI (key performance indicator) the business is held accountable for, it becomes a side hobby and side hobbies aren’t always invested in financially or time wise,” argues Nguyen. But critics of fixed targets argue that the concept could devalue the way women hired under this regime are perceived in the workplace. Danish start-up community manager Bolette Wrestroem says quotas, while potentially a “good stepping-stone”, could also suggest that “women are only there because it is required and not because of their skills or capabilities”. Quotas for board members have already been introduced on a nationwide scale in Norway and Iceland. But as The Nordic Gender Effect at Work report points out, improvements at board level have not led to a jump in the number of women CEOs or managers. “One reason for this is that the business world is characterised by a wide range of leadership standards and traits that are typically (perhaps stereotypically) associated with men,” it concludes. Nguyen says she has placed several women in high positions in Swedish head offices who ended up leaving because they felt they needed to adapt too much to be heard. “The most important step is creating an environment where people of different backgrounds, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexuality, feel empowered and supported to do their best,” she argues. “We cannot just hire females and minorities and expect them to figure it out.” Many campaigners argue that educating male employees on the benefits of diversity should be more prominent. Numerous global studies have concluded that there is a positive correlation between the presence of women in leadership roles and an organisation's performance. The chief executive of Heba, a Stockholm rental company named-and-shamed for low male-female diversity, recently made headlines for admitting he hadn’t thought about the advantages of having more women managers until his top executive team achieved gender balance. ""I thought competence was the main thing - competence and attitude - not sex, but I've changed my mind. The workplace works better because of the [gender] mix,"" Lennart Karlsson told the BBC shortly afterwards. ""The discussion climate is better, you have a better conversation and a better understanding for each other."" In Norway, a private equity firm criticised for a lack of female managers recently introduced a policy making it mandatory for all fathers to take at least two months’ parental leave, or risk losing their bonus, to help reduce unconscious bias. “If I am a female and I look at the male team members around me becoming fathers and none of them take any parental leave, I will feel that I am an outlier when I get pregnant and I need my parental leave,” says Chief Operating Officer Morten Welo. “So we thought - ‘let’s turn this around’, and say it’s mandatory regardless of gender.” He says the policy also sends “an important signal” that he hopes will encourage more young female graduates to consider the company. “To attract the best talent, we need better diversity.” More companies are also experimenting with digital platforms designed to help tackle unconscious biases. Tengai, the world's first robot designed to carry out unbiased job interviews, is being tested by major Swedish recruitment firm TNG. In Norway,  Equality Check, a community-based platform of employee reviews rating equality in companies (similar to the English-language Glassdoor platform), has become a popular tool for both applicants and HR professionals. “Big funds have also become a lot more aware of how they write job descriptions - what words you use and how do you conduct the interview processes,” adds Rikke Eckhoff Høvding at the Norwegian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (NVCA). “I would say no-one knows the answers, so we need to try different things, readjust and think of something new if it doesn’t work.” Finding role models On a political level, all the Nordic governments are working to tackle the gender gap. Last year Iceland became the first country in the world to require companies with 25 or more workers to demonstrate that they pay men and women equally for the same work, with daily fines for firms that fail to do so. Finland’s new Working Hours Act, due to come into force in 2020, will give the majority of full-time employees the right to decide when and where they work for at least half of their working hours, in a move designed to help boost flexibility. Initiatives in Sweden include the recent launch of the Gender Equality Agency, designed to promote better coordination on the issue, and coding lessons for children, partly aimed at tackling early biases in terms of tech-based career choices. Meanwhile, many campaigners agree that grassroots efforts designed to empower women on an individual level remain essential. “Role models are really important. It’s hard to be what you can’t see,” argues Rikke Eckhoff Høvding. “But you can visualise a career path and take risks if you see others who have taken that path.” She says that the start-up community in Scandinavia is already making strides in this area, through meet-ups, conferences and networking events targeting the gender gap. “Female founders are very keen to promote other female founders,” she argues. Two successful Swedish female entrepreneurs - Charlotte Sundåker and Linda Waxin - recently launched Ownershift, an independent think tank designed to expand discussions about gender equality to include ownership and risk-taking. In Sweden, men still own roughly double what women own in terms of capital, land, real estate, forests and natural resources. “We think that if more women create their own structures and companies, the overall structure will change into more empathic systems,” says Sundåker. Staying in the spotlight For Anneli Häyren, at the Centre for Gender Research in Uppsala, a key goal is simply to ensure that public discussions about gender equality continue, both in Nordic nations and on a global scale. “On some level it really hit the brakes,” she says of public discourse in recent years. “Quite a lot of people think we have discussed it enough and it is a dead debate.” But she believes that raising awareness of the ongoing challenges in Sweden and the Nordics is essential, so that the region can pick up the pace of change and continue to inspire the world.  "

economic indicators,Will flying get more expensive?,2024-09-15,2020-05-29,John Walton,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200528-will-the-price-of-flights-increase-due-to-coronavirus,"Covid-19 has caused unprecedented turmoil in the aviation industry. What does that mean for pricing when planes take to the skies again? As more countries start to ease their Covid-19 lockdowns, attention is returning to the global aviation industry, almost entirely grounded for months. Some passenger airlines have kept skeleton fleets flying for repatriation missions, some have converted passenger jets to use as cargo planes, but all of them would much rather return to their primary objective: flying people safely around the world. But when planes do take to the skies again, how much impact will the pandemic have on what they charge? “We know airlines want to get planes back in the air and bums back on seats,” says Benjamin Cany from Amadeus, a technology company that provides IT services to the travel industry, including one of its principal booking systems. In the short-term at least, that would point to lower fares aimed at incentivising consumers. Yet look past the next few months and there are factors that could push fares up, from airline bankruptcies that could reduce both supply and competition, to reduced fleets caused by retiring aircraft early. And the great unknown is how quickly passengers will return to flying, with the general feeling in the industry that aviation won’t return to pre-pandemic numbers until 2022, 2023 or beyond.   Airlines, Cany says, usually look at past demand to forecast future trends. But there’s no precedent for the current circumstances. “What are airlines to do when the past data is radically different, or no longer relevant for future calculations?” The pricing equation Airline pricing, explains Cany, is normally based on a combination of scientific calculations and models. This, he says, “is about understanding the customer's motivation to travel and how much they are willing to pay for the ticket. Airlines then balance that against capacity, and a myriad other indicators. The airline wants to strike the best deal for the airline and the traveller.” This is both a science and an art. The science, Cany says, “is in the modelling, machine learning and algorithms behind this calculation” and would usually include “the choice between the different airline products (for example, business versus premium economy) and the various airline itineraries available (departure time, arrival time, trip duration). That needs to be combined with historical data, seasonality, as well as market indicators such as upcoming local events, competition on that same route, and so forth.” The art, meanwhile, comes from “the airline’s pricing and revenue management experts, who adjust these indicators to develop the most accurate forecast. That’s where the technology helps, providing these teams with the tools to improve the forecast accuracy to the highest degree,” Cany concludes. But nobody knows how the models that aviation has been honing for decades will change as a result of the extraordinary Covid-19 challenges, particularly given the situation is still evolving. When will demand return? In the most basic of economic terms, for example, airline fares are set based on a supply curve and a demand curve. Airlines usually have the lever of supply under their control, and it’s generally understood that when they want to stimulate demand to fill capacity, they reduce fares. More people will travel if a ticket is $50 than if it is $100. The X factor right now is that many people are scared to travel because of hygiene concerns, lockdown guidance and quarantine rules.  “Short-term, aircraft will continue to be much less full and airlines will be motivated to price seats to get customers flying safely in a Covid-19 world,” says Joe Leader, chief executive officer of APEX, a trade association whose members include airlines and their suppliers. “Airlines have cut back their flights to absolute connectivity minimums and are losing money on the vast majority of remaining flights… Hopefully, the combination of increased Covid-19 safety measures alongside low prices will encourage a travel rebound.” Paul Simmons, a senior airline executive with experience at numerous airlines worldwide including easyJet and Malaysia Airlines, suggests much will depend on what part low pricing can play as a tool to persuade people to travel. “It could be that airlines find their traditional lever of low pricing to drive bums on seats does not work as well as it used to. People may have higher concerns.” The general view is that domestic travel will recover first, a view with which Peter Foster, CEO of Kazakhstan’s national carrier Air Astana, agrees. “Initial indications from our recently-restarted limited domestic flights are that there is pent-up demand for these routes. We believe that business, worker and student travel will recover well before leisure travel.” IATA, an airline trade association, expects low demand when countries first start to travel again, despite some business travellers needing to fly and a desire for what’s known as VFR — visiting friends and relatives — traffic as people miss their families. On the plus side for airlines, IATA notes that the biggest variable cost in aviation, fuel, will be low: as drivers in many places are noticing, there’s oversupply in the petroleum industry keeping prices down. Will supply fall?  If there are major unknowns on the demand side, there are also evolving factors influencing pricing on the supply side. One of the starkest images for the airline industry has been the sight of line after line of jets parked on runways and put into storage at aircraft recycling ‘boneyards’. While older and less efficient planes will be retired, some of them years ahead of schedule, airline executive Paul Simmons points out that most of the planes taken out of fleets have been stored, not scrapped. “This is an important distinction,” he says. Joe Leader from airline association APEX suggests that “there will be more than enough supply even with all of the early aircraft retirements”. Certainly to start off with, demand will be low enough to be met by the aircraft that haven’t been retired. Airbus and Boeing have both announced cuts to the numbers of new aircraft they’re building every month, but as demand rises again, the aircraft manufacturers can increase production, airlines can extend the life of aircraft they’re using, or older aircraft can be brought back into use from storage. It’s already clear that the airline landscape, and indeed the names painted on the side of the aircraft, are likely to be forever changed. Some airlines have already filed for various forms of bankruptcy protection or indeed have simply gone under. This will, in many cases, lead to less competition – and the possibility of monopoly pricing, which tends not to favour consumers. Yet it’s likely that regulators will come down hard on airlines seen to profiteer, while other carriers will seek to jump into monopoly markets where that is possible, or new entrants will arise. For passengers, that’s likely to mean a fair amount of volatility in fares. “Although some airlines will inevitably go out of business, others will scale up to fill the void,” comments Simmons. “The ‘rightsizing’ of supply and demand may take time, however, leading to higher pricing in the medium term.” No easy answers The watchword for aviation, as for so many industries looking to rebound from Covid-19, is going to be uncertainty. New waves of infection, or treatment breakthroughs, would both influence the future path. So too will political and regulatory responses, as well as the wider global economic fallout that is being forecast. Demand, crucially, is not rising evenly; different government restrictions ­– especially quarantine periods on arrival for travellers from some nations – will have effects that are very complex to model, and will necessarily differ between nations or even within regions of the same nation. The US is an example of how perceptions and thus demand can vary across a nation. Scott DeAngelo, chief marketing officer of niche leisure carrier Allegiant Air, said on an earnings call that customer surveys revealed that “in the Midwest and Mid Atlantic, the Upper West, I got to tell you they don’t share the opinion that the evening news is putting out there” around travel. Pictures over the US Memorial Day holiday weekend have shown leisure destinations in some parts of the country packed with partygoers. It seems likely that travel resumption “bubbles” between neighbouring countries and regions with acceptably low infection rates (where “acceptably” will also vary) will continue, and while these may stimulate demand travellers will also not want to be caught overseas if restrictions return swiftly. The question of whether any travel insurance would cover Covid-19-related issues is also crucial. Airlines also need to start flying for people to start buying tickets even in a reduced demand scenario, and we are only just starting to see a very limited number of airlines resuming very limited schedules. That all makes predicting the effects of the interlocking factors upon which airline pricing is based challenging. The demand side of the curve is particularly tricky for long-haul pricing, says Air Astana CEO Peter Foster, who nevertheless expects that the stronger long-haul airlines are likely to try to kickstart demand with lower fares. Short-haul carriers, meanwhile, may benefit from low oil prices, reduced aircraft prices that enable counter-cyclical orders and lower salaries due to surplus aviation workers. “The prognosis may well be lower airfares on short/medium haul routes for at least 18 months to two years,” Foster expects. And while Covid-19 is unprecedented, he believes the past can offer indicators for future trends. “After every major crisis of the last 20 years – the Asian financial crisis of 1998, 9/11, the global financial crisis – low-cost airlines have emerged faster and stronger because suppressed demand combined with depressed consumer spending power has driven people to them,” he says. “I doubt 2020/21 will be any different.” Aviation journalist John Walton writes about airlines, aircraft and everything aeronautical.

economic indicators,The country getting remote work right,2024-09-15,2020-06-24,Katie Bishop,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200623-what-the-dutch-can-teach-the-world-about-remote-work,"The Netherlands may have figured out something about working from home (pandemic or no) that the rest of the world has yet to learn. If you’ve been balancing your laptop on a precarious stack of cookbooks, or lamented VPN speed from your kitchen table, you’re not alone. Ever since restrictions were put in place to slow the spread of Covid-19, companies have been scrambling to enable colleagues to work from home. As we adapt to the much-cited ‘new normal’, some experts are predicting that remote work might be here to stay. This is leaving many nervously eyeing up our makeshift home desk set-ups, and wondering how on earth we can handle the backache.  But for some, remote working is just another day at the office. Thousands of workers in the Netherlands benefit from the country’s astonishingly flexible work culture. While the percentage of employed persons usually working remotely before the coronavirus outbreak lingered at around 4.7% in the UK, and 3.6% in the US, 14.1% of the Netherland’s workforce reports usually working away from the office. The Netherlands has long led the global shift toward remote work, with only Finland catching up in recent years while other countries lag behind. “When the pandemic started, I suddenly found myself playing the part of a remote-work coach for my wife and our neighbours,” says Yvo van Doorn, an Amsterdam-based engineer. “I was suddenly answering questions about home networks and video conferencing. It was eye-opening because I’d taken these things for granted.” Across the globe, many companies have found that the shift to remote work has been a less-than-smooth transition. Setting up usually office-based staff with computer equipment, and recalibrating working culture to keep employees connected, has been a significant shift for most. But for the Netherlands, the country’s already sizeable remote workforce means that the adjustment has been much less dramatic. “Dutch people had certain advantages when we went into lockdown,” explains van Doorn, whose employer Auth0 gives all workers the option for flexible work, offers a budget to create a comfortable and productive home working set up, and helps to arrange coworking spaces if needed. “We’re fortunate enough to be a country where 98% of homes have high-speed internet access, and the Netherlands has the right combination of technology, culture, and approach to make remote working successful. I’m judged on whether I deliver value, not on the fact that I sit at a desk for nine hours a day. ” A culture ripe for remote work As we begin to tentatively imagine a post-pandemic future, there will be many who find themselves looking wistfully toward van Doorn’s permanent home working set-up. Results of a recent US poll, conducted mid-crisis, suggest that 59% of remote workers would like to continue to work remotely as much as possible once restrictions on businesses and school closures are fully lifted. Major international companies, including Barclays and Twitter, have already suggested that expensive city office space may become a thing of the past. Both have already hinted at an end to the commute for its employees, planning potentially long-term remote work policies for after the pandemic. Aukje Nauta, an organisational psychology professor at the University of Leiden, who is researching how companies can enhance individuals in a dynamic work context, believes that employers could look toward the Netherlands for inspiration as they consider how best to implement remote-work policies and set up virtual offices. “Values such as democracy and participation are deeply rooted in the Dutch working culture, so managers place more trust in their workers than elsewhere in the world,” she says. “For example, ING bank [an influential Dutch company based in Amsterdam] now has a policy on unlimited holidays implemented for pilot groups of workers, who can take as much holiday as they want as long as their tasks do not suffer. Employers elsewhere are now learning that employees can be trusted to work from home, and I believe that in post-corona[virus] times, smart combinations of working from home and meeting in real life will emerge more and more worldwide.” But there are also broader economic and social contexts that enable remote work to flourish in the Netherlands. “Physical infrastructure is well developed, and public and commercial remote-working facilities are plentiful,” says Bart Götte, a business futurist and psychologist based in Amersfoort. “Public libraries have reinvented themselves as massive and comfortable modern working spaces, and there are an enormous number of small, quality coffee shops that service the remote workforce. Employers in the Netherlands have also seized the opportunity to cut costs and become more productive – they need less square metres of expensive office space, and strict sick pay legislation in the Netherlands means that they are motivated to make sure that their workers have healthy working facilities at home.” The explosion of remote working facilities in the Netherlands hasn’t just benefited employees of large companies. Around 1.1 million workers in the Netherlands are self-employed, and the normalisation of the virtual office has made it easy for freelancers and small business start-ups to operate without the need for dedicated office space. “I’m a solo-preneur and currently work from home,” says Lara Wilkens, an event producer in Amsterdam. “Working from home is better for the environment, and we have great paid co-working spaces as well as many free places where you can trade a service for a workspace.” ‘The power to reorganise’ With the Netherlands displaying an admirable level of trust in its employees and an understanding of the digital frameworks needed to support remote work, other countries may now be looking towards the Dutch as they plan a post-Covid future. Many countries struggle with a culture of presenteeism, with 83% of UK employees reporting having observed pressure within their workplace to ‘show up’ regardless of whether their mental or physical health allows it. In the US, around 15% of homes do not have broadband, and one in five employees report feeling guilty about taking time away from the office, worrying that this might make them seem less committed to their job. While the Netherlands displays a combination of attuned infrastructure, investment in a digital future, and culture of trust that makes it an aspirational archetype of a well-oiled remote world, companies in other countries still have much to understand and adapt to as Covid-19 ushers in a less office-based future. “What we have seen over the last few months is the power to reorganise,” says Götte. “We are now working remotely on a massive global scale. I think that we will come out of this crisis more digitally literate, aware that many of us are capable of working remotely, with more autonomy, and perhaps an aspiration to become more independent. Due to the accelerating forces caused by Covid, other countries are in a turbulent learning curve, and people are rethinking old policies, procedures, customs, and values. When circumstances change so massively we simply have to learn by doing, and that is perhaps the most important lesson.”  "
economic indicators,Why unique baby names are surging,2024-09-15,2022-03-07,Aysha Imtiaz,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220302-why-uncommon-baby-names-are-surging,"Uncommon baby names are rising across the globe, even in more traditional societies. Why are parents increasingly determined to make children's names ‘unique’? My first visit to Pakistan dismantled any precious notions I had about my name’s uniqueness. While a rare curiosity in California, here, it seemed I met an Aysha, Ayesha or Aisha at every corner.  “It’s like you opened a baby name book and didn’t even look past ‘A’,” I’d tell my parents, vowing that when I had kids, I’d choose something out-of-this-world. And so I did, naming my daughter Sidrat-ul-Muntaha, after an enigmatic lote tree believed to mark the utmost boundary in the seventh heaven – literally the point of extremity none can pass.  Baby naming is an emotionally charged process. Parents worry about the long-term impact of a child’s name, and feel they need to do the best job at setting up a child for success. That’s because we know names matter; our given name forges our identity, influences name stereotypes, may dictate the types of jobs we pursue and even predict career achievements.  The trends around how parents choose names for their children are a product of our evolving cultures; they shift as aspirations for children shift. Research shows today’s rising popularity of unique baby names reflects a move from collectivism to individualistic societies, and provides important contextual clues about whom parents want their children to be. Globally, it seems, parents increasingly value unique names to help children stand out, instead of fit in. From tradition to expression In previous centuries, tradition-driven name conformity was the presiding impulse, explains Laura Wattenberg, founder of namerology.com and author of The Baby Name Wizard. “Parents simply did what had always been done,” she says, pointing out that in England, John and William, for example, were top boy names from the 1200s to 1930s. “According to [statistics] compiled by economist Douglas Galbi, in the 1600s, the top three names for boys and girls accounted for fully half of [England’s] population,” she explains.  This is because naming conventions were founded in religious and ancestral ties. For example, scriptural names were popular, and English Puritans sometimes named their children after moral attributes, such as Faith or Mercy. Family Tree This story is part of BBC's Family Tree series, which examines the issues and opportunities parents, children and families face today – and how they'll shape the world tomorrow. Find more on BBC Future. Similarly, Muslims in Arab and South Asian countries extolled religiosity. Traditional Muslim names include eminent historical figures in Islam (such as Muhammad, after the Holy Prophet PBUH, his contemporaries, the Umm-ul-Momineen or his wives – including Hazrat Aisha RA – and Islamic state caliphs). Often, names underscored religious devotion, such as any of the 99 names of Allah with the preceding word ‘Abdul’, meaning servant of. Uniquely regulated Arab naming traditions also had lineage entrenched, with names frequently prefaced by words such as ‘Bint-e-’ (daughter of), ‘Umm-e-’ (mother of), ‘Abu’ (father of) or ‘Ibn’ (son of). Depending on the pace at which different regions developed, not all these traditions endured. Weakening cultural ties and more mobile populations around the Industrial Revolution made young parents’ choices less dictated by extended family and local customs in the Western world, explains Wattenberg. “Names increasingly became a mode of self-expression… the whole culture moved toward greater celebration of personal freedom and individuality.”  Prior research has established the steady decrease in common names in the US from the 1950s, especially from 1983, and a recent macro-level study analysing 348 million American baby names across 137 years (1880 to 2017) showed Baby Boomers increased the number of novel names per thousand people four-fold for boys and 2.75 times for girls. “The Baby Boomers were the first parents who wanted to be cool, and who wanted their children to be cool as well,” says Pamela Redmond, whose 1988 book Beyond Jennifer & Jason examined the cohort as the first generation to reject many of the ethnic and religious naming conventions of the past. And with an amplified desire for distinctiveness thanks to the rise of the internet in the 1990s, millennials took it a step further. “[These parents] became used to the model of a username – your unique identifier in a social system,” says Wattenberg. “Parents would type a full name they were considering into a search engine and worry because it was ‘taken’. The 1990s also brought a new, surprisingly powerful wrinkle: baby name statistics … Annual rankings of popular names made people feel competitive. But instead of wanting to be number one, everybody wanted to avoid the top of the charts.”   Today, parents signal their style and values with names, explains Redmond, who is also the CEO of Nameberry, a name-consulting business that provides parents with guidance on how to choose a new name. “We hear a lot of parents saying they want to give their sons gender-neutral names to signal feminist values, or honour family in a way that’s in step with current styles – so grandpa Arthur may get honoured by giving your son the middle name Bear, Arthur’s meaning.” ‘A valid indicator of individualism’  Even Japan, which has been a traditional, collectivist society for centuries, is showing a shift away from naming traditions. According to a 2021 study analysing 8,000 baby names between 2004 and 2018, the rate of unique names is increasing in Japan – and it’s an indicator of rising individualism. Study author Yuji Ogihara, from the Institute of Arts and Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, defined ‘unique names’ as ones with low frequency (one per 1,000 names) among the baby cohort. The names didn’t necessarily sound different to more common ones; complexity in Japanese names (stemming from the use of Chinese characters with multiple readings) means uniqueness can be attained in different ways. For example, one name can have multiple different readings — at least 18 for the boy’s name 大翔, which can be read as Hiroto, Daisho and Sora amongst others, and 14 for the girl’s name 結愛, like Yua, Yunari or Meia. So, parents might choose unique variations of a name by abbreviating common readings of Chinese characters, choosing less common characters or reading them with foreign pronunciation corresponding to semantic meaning. For instance, 月 (meaning ‘moon’) is usually read as ‘tsuki’ or ‘zuki’, but is uniquely read ‘runa’, corresponding to the Latin word ‘luna’ for moon, explains Ogihara. “The index of baby names has been confirmed to be a valid indicator of individualism,” he continues. “Empirical evidence shows that common names are less frequently given to babies in more individualistic nations”, such as the United States, Canada and New Zealand. Noticing the paucity of similar research in Japan, his work seeks to address the phenomenon in more than an anecdotal context and root it in societal shifts. In other research, Ogihara contextualised this trend as part of other 'indices of individualism', such as Japan’s rising marriage-to-divorce ratio, and the decrease in three-generation households over 60 years.  Overall, the trend of parents reconceptualising interpretation, pronunciation or spelling to seek novelty in names while staying relatively within the ambit of the predominant naming conventions is a powerful impulse. In Pakistan, for example, while religiosity still prevails, more acts of worship are standing in as names, such as Azaan (call to prayer) or Ayat (a Quranic verse), instead of historically important names of the prophets, suggesting that parents are thinking more laterally to find names that are still religious, but not common. In Japan, Yukiko Uchida, professor of social and cultural psychology at Kyoto University, Japan, roots the rise of more unusual names in multiple factors that eroded people’s trust in a collective society. She cites Japan's economic decline, debate over demographic issues and the aging population, and the emergence of problems such as social withdrawal and NEETs [individuals Not in Education, Employment or Training]. This, she says, led to a sense that people increasingly had to “survive with their own uniqueness, not rely on traditional group belongingness”. Studies from China also show unique baby names are one of many ways to fulfil rising NFU (Need For Uniqueness), which is a product of increasing autonomy and freedom, paired with declining perceived importance of traditional Chinese cultural practices and collectivism. Additionally, research around the rate at which unique baby girl names are rising in Japan gives insight into parental aspirations. One of Ogihara’s most compelling findings is that gender is a factor in cultural naming practises; in Japan, unique names have increased more rapidly for girls than boys. The Chinese NFU study, meanwhile, revealed girl names were more unique than boy names at one point in time, a finding consistent with prior research revealing girls were less likely to receive popular names. Whether the gender difference is measured at one point in time or mapped out as a rate of increase, in the context of traditionally conformist cultures such as China and Japan, it represents a quiet hope of parents for their daughters to be more unique than their sons. Previously, parents in Japan may have named their daughters to conform and be “interdependent, ordinary and concerned with group harmony to fit into society”, explains Ogihara. Now, “more parents hope for their daughters [to] become more independent, unique and autonomous to fit into changing societal norms and expectations. Thus, it’s assumed they [give them more] unique names”.  Dominant parenting aspirations As these trends play out, should we expect a continuing boom of original, uncommon names? Uchida predicts that in Japan, the trend towards unusual names will ultimately hit a ceiling. After all, there’s a limit to the number of kanji (characters) that can be used in names, she points out, and social stigmas do persist. “After the increase in the number of ‘kira-kira’ names (eccentric and unique names) in Japan, a stigma was attached… such as ‘coming from a low class’. Conversely, names that are too traditional tend to be avoided because of being ‘old-fashioned’, so I think there will be a continuing [but not increasing] trend in favour of names that are reasonably stylish and moderately unique.” And chasing unique names may not always be the answer or ticket to success parents want it to be, anyway. “Parents have the instinct that choosing a distinctive name will give their child an advantage in life. It’s a loving impulse, but in practical terms it’s not clear that it works that way,” says Wattenberg, because after all, “Popular means well-liked – and highly distinctive names can be polarising. People may point to successful celebrities with unusual names, but for every Madonna and Beyoncé there’s a Michael Jackson, Emma Thompson, Sam Smith and Elizabeth Taylor,” she concludes.   Ultimately, for parents, giving a child a name is an act of love, influenced both by personal dreams and cultural transmission of values. “Parents come to us for help in finding a name that's tailored perfectly to them, more than one that's different from anyone else,” says Redmond. Uchida agrees. “Rather than ‘standing out’ in a group or ‘becoming a star’, I think it’s a more modest desire for their kids to live their own life.” Aysha Imtiaz is a freelance journalist and elementary school language arts teacher in Karachi, Pakistan."
economic indicators,How shorter workweeks could save Earth,2024-09-15,2019-08-07,Tim Smedley,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190802-how-shorter-workweeks-could-save-earth,"Right now, the human race faces two major challenges: overwork and climate change. Is the solution to ‘degrow’ the economy? If everyone in the world consumed the same levels of fuel, food, clothes and building materials as Europeans, we would require 2.8 planet Earths. If everyone led a US lifestyle, it would require five planet Earths. Somewhere in between commuting, making money and spending money, we are undeniably living unsustainably. And just last month, 29 July became the earliest ‘Earth Overshoot Day’ on record: the day on which humanity’s demand for ecological resources exceeds what Earth can regenerate in a year, according to Global Footprint Network, an international research organisation. 1972 was the last time we made it into December. But there’s a novel idea that could turn this around: we work less, thus slowing down the global economy and curbing our seemingly endless appetite to consume more stuff. Is that feasible – and would it really save the world? Nothing can grow indefinitely Changing our work habits on a global scale is a monumental task. The average American works 44 hours a week and receives just 10 days of holiday. In China, the 72-hour, 6-day week is common. Japan works such long hours there’s even a word for ""death by overwork"": karōshi.  However, one analysis from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst argues “working less is good for the environment”: that if we spent 10% less time working, our carbon footprint would be reduced by 14.6%, largely due to less commuting or grabbing high-carbon convenience foods on our breaks. A full day off a week would therefore reduce our carbon footprint by almost 30%. We like to blame climate change on industry and big business. But the way we live, work and consume is actually the primary source of emissions. A multi-national study by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology of the environmental impact of consumers found that the stuff we buy is responsible for more than 60% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, and up to 80% of global water use. And yet, growing that consumption still further is what economies are built upon. According to University of Surrey professor Tim Jackson’s book Prosperity Without Growth, the global economy has expanded on average by 3.65% each year since 1950. In a ‘business as usual’ world, that would lead to a global economy 200 times bigger than 1950 levels by 2100, or 326 times bigger if developing countries continue to develop. “The non-growing economy is anathema to an economist,” writes Jackson. “But the idea of a continually growing economy is anathema to an ecologist. No subsystem of a finite system can grow indefinitely.” However, there are two conflicting schools of thought about how to save the world by working less: the ‘green growthers’, who believe our salaries can remain the same and economies can continue to grow with a modest cut in working hours and improvements in technology and energy efficiency. And the ‘de-growthers’ – who believe that only by cutting our pay, our working days and our economies can we reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The green growthers The idea of shorter working weeks and green growth is starting to gain traction. Last year, almost a million German metal workers won the right to a 28-hour working week (down from an already modest 35 hours), while the UK Labour Party (parliament’s second largest party) has flirted with the idea of a national four-day week. Will Stronge, co-founder and director of Autonomy, a future of work think tank, is a green growther. He cites the recent example of UK postal workers who have successfully argued for a scale-down in hours from 39 to 35 hours, while keeping the same salary. “In many companies, if you said we will cut your pay… but you get an extra day off, most staff wouldn’t be able to afford it.” From an environmental perspective, he says that “electricity consumption [nationally] goes down fairly significantly on weekends and bank holidays”, suggesting that there are energy efficiency gains from going to work less. Another green growther, Alice Martin, head of work and pay at the New Economics Foundation, believes that “if you reduce working hours while keeping pay constant, then the evidence suggests that does have positive effects on reducing carbon emissions”. Having people in work 20% less of the time translates to a similar drop in carbon emissions, she says, because of changes in behaviour, including reduced commuter travel, eating home-cooked food rather than convenience foods, and spending more time locally, even volunteering. “Having more time in life to do things you actually enjoy could result in a change in behavioural patterns so that you actually stop consuming as many high-carbon products,” she says. However, the reverse could also be true. With a four-day job on a five-day salary, isn’t there a danger that instead of staying at home cooking organic food on our new day off, that we actually increase consumption: more shopping, eating out and short-haul holidays? The de-growthers The degrowth camp say ‘yes’. They argue that the only way to reduce consumption is to have less cash: they welcome a four-day week, but only as the ‘sweetener’ for a four-day salary. Degrowth is a radical, even heretical, economic argument. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has held sway since the 1930s as our means of measuring economic success. However, on a planet with finite resource, endless growth was always an error in the code. In 1972, a report on a computer simulation of exponential economic and population growth, Limits to Growth, commissioned by futurist organisation Club of Rome, became an unlikely international bestseller. The authors found that resource depletion would max out by 2072, leading to ""sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity"". However, mainstream politics maintained its course. The material consumption of combined OECD nations increased by almost 50% between 1990 and 2008 – and lo and behold, every 10% rise in GDP saw a 6% increase in material footprint. The modern degrowth movement – reborn in Europe, following the inaugural International Degrowth Conference in Paris in 2008 – therefore argues that we must begin a managed contraction of our economies, starting with a sharp reduction in working hours. This isn’t the same as welcoming a ‘recession’ and the job losses that come with it. Leading degrowth economist Serge Latouche has explained; “Degrowth does not mean decay or suffering… Instead, degrowth can be compared to a healthy diet voluntarily undertaken.” It results, he says, in “a self-sufficient and materially responsible society”. But it is still a diet. We cannot have our green growth cake and eat it. Milena Buchs, associate professor in sustainability, economics and low-carbon transitions, University of Leeds – and self-confessed degrowther – says that “if leisure consumption increases” due to a shorter working week “and it is carbon-intensive consumption like travel and goods that create more waste, that is exactly why working-time reduction would also require a reduction in income”. A Global Environmental Change paper also questions whether more people working fewer hours would result in an overall increase in commuting traffic: “if shorter hours are to increase productivity and wages…  consumption and emissions could [go up].” How universal basic income could help It’s the top earners who cause the most emissions, however, not the average worker. According to Oxfam, the world's richest 10% produce half of all global carbon emissions, whereas the poorest half of the population cause just 10% of emissions. On this point, Buchs argues that any degrowth scenario would require a means of redistributing wealth “from the rich to the poor”. And the leading proposal to do so is a Universal Basic Income (UBI). With UBI, instead of being a complex web of welfare benefits, it simply pays everyone in society the same fixed state pay-out, perhaps as much as $12,000 (£10,000) a year. It is often associated with the ‘jobpocalypse’ argument: if robots take our jobs, how will we have money to live? But it’s equally central to degrowth: if we all work less and consume less, how do we protect those already on low wages? “Like working time reduction, UBI is one of the key proposals to degrowth”, says Buchs. “The idea is to say yes, everyone should have some sort of minimum income so that your basic needs are satisfied."" Another way of slicing the same pie could be Universal Basic Services, says Buchs: no free salary, but free public services instead, from universal health care right through to college education. Gross Domestic Problem Both green growthers and de-growthers agree that GDP is no longer an adequate measure of economic performance, and that forever trying to grow it has a bad effect on the planet. As Oxford economist Kate Raworth points out, GDP completely ignores the “unpaid care economy”, or ecological services such as clean air and clean water: “Any company that presented only its profit and loss account would get laughed off the stock exchange.” Nina Treu, a leader of Germany’s degrowth (“Postwachstum”) movement, also argues that a system reliant on GDP “needs to always produce more in order to stay stable. These products need to be consumed, which leads to material overconsumption. And this exceeds our natural resources and leads to climate change, which undermines our very source of living.” Even US politician Robert F ennedy once said in the 1960s, “GDP measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile.” Alternative measures to GDP do exist however, such the UN’s Inequality Adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI), which includes life expectancy, inequality and education alongside income. Whereas Norway, the US and Germany come 10th, 11th and 16th in the World Bank’s GDP table, in the IHDI they come 2nd, 24th and 7th, respectively. If we all worked a four-day week, there’s good reason to assume that life expectancy, inequality and education scores could all go up. New research by Henley Business School revealed that firms that adopted a four-day working week found that over three quarters of staff (78%) were happier, less stressed (70%) and took fewer days off ill (62%). ‘Part of humanity’s future’? Yet, say the de-growthers, for this to credibly benefit the environment too, we need to earn less, consume less, lead more frugal lives. I ask Buchs whether that could ever be a platform that people would vote for? “That is exactly the problem,” she says. “We need degrowth, but it isn’t politically acceptable at the moment. To be really, completely honest, I don’t have a good answer [to how we change that].” Maybe we’ll have no choice. In The Path to Degrowth in Overdeveloped Countries, author Erik Assadourian argues that “In the end, whether societal leaders accept it or not, the natural limits of Earth – brought into view by increasing numbers of a population… striving to live as consumers – will shatter the myth of continued growth, most likely due to dramatic changes to the planet’s systems. Thus degrowth is part of humanity’s future.” Earth Overshoot Day took less than 50 years to go from 29 December to 29 July – five months lost. The same trajectory for the next 50 years in unthinkable. In 2002, the Club of Rome authors re-formed to update Limits to Growth, 30 years on. Given three more decades of data – not to mention greatly improved computing power – what would the model show this time? The authors were far more pessimistic than they were in 1972: “Humanity has squandered the opportunity to correct our current course over the last 30 years,” they concluded. The projected year for a total collapse of resources was no longer 2072. It was now 2030.  "
economic indicators,The archaeology of inequality,2024-09-15,2022-05-23,Carles Lalueza-Fox,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220520-why-some-ancient-societies-were-more-unequal-than-others,"Inequality affected some ancient societies, but not all. Changes in farming – and the animals used in it – might have been a factor which caused it to spiral. 26 November 1922 marks what is arguably the most famous discovery in the history of archaeology. On that day, the British Egyptologist Howard Carter made a small hole through which he could insert a candle in the sealed doorway of Tutankhamun's burial chamber and thus lit the interior. As his eyes slowly adapted to the darkness, he was able to make out a chamber that had not been disturbed for over 3,000 years. Tutankhamun was just an obscure pharaoh during his lifetime, and there is evidence that he was hastily buried – the second of the three nested coffins seems to have originally belonged to someone else. And yet the inner coffin, in which his mummy was discovered, is made of solid gold, weighing almost 250lbs (113kg). One can barely imagine how impressive the burials of such powerful leaders as Khufu, Thutmose III, or Rameses II must have been. Alas, they were all looted in antiquity. But contrary to popular belief and cinematic glorification, most archaeologists would say that the search for spectacular treasures isn't their main research objective. They want to understand the daily life of past civilisations. Still, both extremes – the fabulous wealth of kings and the hardscrabble existence of common people – contribute to an understanding of what can be argued is one of the main goals of archaeology: to document and study the evolution of inequality in ancient societies. This also involves the question of how to recognise and quantify it. One of the most obvious approaches would be through the assessment of differential goods deposited in graves. But richly furnished graves may not simply be evidence of social differentiation; rather, they may be an attempt to demonstrate the importance and distinction of a family in relationship to other kindreds – a social importance that may not exist in reality. Moreover, social stratification can be based on wealth but can also be based on personal prestige and power. Therefore, it isn't always possible to assess social differences by comparing graves with goods to those without them. Some archaeologists have attempted to apply economic principles to examine social differences at specific sites and, crucially, compare the data from different places. A study led by Samuel Bowles from the Santa Fe Institute and published in Nature in 2017 tried to address this question by applying the Gini coefficient – a single number most commonly used to measure income inequality – across a large number of sites from the archaeological record, both in the Old World and the Americas. You might also like: The list of sites included paradigmatic cities such as Çatalhöyük in Turkey, Pompeii in Italy, and Teotihuacan in Mexico – the authors measured the dimensions of houses as estimated indicators of wealth. Among modern hunter-gatherers, the team found, the Gini coefficient is low – around 17 (on a scale of 0 to 100). This is not surprising as few objects can be carried in nomadic societies, and consequently, personal qualities such as the ability to hunt count for more. This does not mean that some people didn't have a higher social status; material culture was probably so poor – or so different from our perceptions of status – that it is difficult to grasp social differences among past hunter-gatherers. In the ancient farming societies under study the Gini coefficients are estimated to have been between 35 and 46. Interestingly, the real measurements were lower than those obtained from records. For instance, among the ruins of Babylonia, researchers estimated a coefficient of 40, yet an estimate based on information from the Babylonian chronicles resulted in a higher coefficient of 46. The ancient accounts likely overemphasised the size of the largest houses in admiration. This is not unlike what happens when we return from a trip: we sometimes tend to exaggerate the things that we've seen. Nevertheless, the most remarkable differences come from the comparison of the societies of the Old World and those of the Americas, with the latter being much more equal in the Gini coefficient, despite being highly hierarchical in some cases such as the mighty Aztec Empire. Researchers conclude that the root of these differences could be ecological, since there were more and larger animals to be domesticated in Eurasia – such as cows, horses, pigs, sheep, and goats – than in the Americas, with only dogs and turkeys, and this trait alone created a differential system of accumulated wealth. At the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlán, for instance, houses had highly standardised dimensions and were all quite similar. Aztec society, even with its horrific human sacrifices, was at the time of the Spanish Conquest more egalitarian than Mexico 200 years later, when the European elite had created the encomienda system, under which the indigenous population worked in semi-slavery. Within a few generations, the concentration of wealth had almost doubled in the colonial New World, with a consequent increase in inequality. When did these differences between the Old and New Worlds emerge? Early farming societies had the possibility of generating and storing food surpluses, creating potential scenarios for differences in population size along with a certain degree of inter- and intrasettlement inequality. A recent application of the Gini coefficient to 90 sites from the Near East and Europe showed a remarkable increase of inequality thousands of years after the advent of agriculture – a finding that would indicate it was not farming per se that created unequal societies. According to the authors, at some point some farmers were able to maintain specialised plough oxen that could cultivate 10 times more land than other farmers, thereby transforming the economy toward a higher value of land in detriment of human labour. This emerging inequality at the end of the Neolithic could explain a remarkable example of wealth dating from that period: the Varna burial. This burial was found in a Copper Age cemetery in modern Bulgaria and is dated to 4560–4450BC. It contained more gold than the rest of the world possessed at that time. With it were the remains of an adult male – likely a chieftain or king of some sort – who was buried holding a gold war mace. Curiously, he also had a gold penis sheath of unknown meaning. Still, such findings are exceptional, and there is a general consensus that Neolithic societies were more egalitarian than later ones. Inequality clearly increased with the arrival of metals, which partly allowed, from 3000 to 2000BC onward, the appearance and development of a social organisation based on the emergence of elites. Once the initial power structure was established, it attempted to perpetuate itself dynastically by increasing social control and building up familial alliances with other chiefs.  Control mechanisms often involved violence. The possibility of using horses – and to lesser extent, camels – as instruments of war determined the success of conquests that would alter the pattern of settlements across Eurasia at the end of the Neolithic. This would at least partially explain how 30 empires or large states that emerged between 3000 and 600BC were all found in the Old World, where these animals roamed. Consequently, tombs with signs of wealth became more abundant in the archaeological record, such as the famous Amesbury Archer, found three miles southeast of Stonehenge in 2002 (near today's Salisbury) and dated to 2300BC. This grave includes more artifacts than any other Bronze Age British burial. Besides numerous arrowheads, three copper knives, four boar's tusks, two stone wrist guards that protected users from their bowstrings, and five pots that conformed to the Bell Beaker tradition, there were two gold hair ornaments – the earliest pieces made of this metal ever found in the British Isles.  The arrival of the Bell Beaker complex to the British Isles is associated with an almost complete replacement of the prior local population and subsequent emergence of social elites. The rise in inequality during this period, both in the Middle East and parts of western Europe, seems to be partly influenced by an increase in population density. This correlation is likely related to a growing complexity in modes of subsistence, trading networks, and political organisation associated with population growth. Although the highest Gini coefficients for past societies determined by the Santa Fe Institute were similar to those found in some present-day European countries (for instance, with values of around 60 in Pompeii and Kahun, an Egyptian settlement from the 12th Dynasty), they remained below the values for the most unequal modern societies such as China and the United States (with Gini coefficients of 73 and 85, respectively), which obviously have larger populations. From a historical perspective this would suggest that an increase in population size brings higher inequality – an issue explored by the economist Thomas Piketty in recent times, but that likely has parallels in Bronze Age populations. Still, the Gini coefficient cannot always be applied since some settlements have grown with time over the destruction of previous ones, piled one atop another like the layers of a cake. Many ancient sites could not possibly be studied in detail. For instance, at Hisarlik – the old Troy – at least 10 cities arose atop their predecessors in just 2,000 years, making them quite difficult to disentangle. In addition to this limitation, whether the Gini coefficient can be transferred between different cultural, geographic, and ecological environments to make direct comparisons has also been a subject of debate since such factors can influence their inhabitants differently. For example, a settlement established in a jagged terrain would favour smaller, more vertical houses than one extending over a vast plain. The economic interpretation of past settlements has received some criticism from among the archaeological community. Some argue that the quality and solidity of the building materials can be as important as the size of the houses. In our modern cities, we're all aware that location – for instance, close to the city centre – is usually more important than size. Finally, the ostentatious wealth – opulent furniture, wall paintings, mosaics, and so on – that can still be found in some excavated houses such as at Pompeii should be taken into consideration too, though such features aren't usually well preserved. One way around these limitations might be to compare the Gini coefficients with the so-called health inequality of each population, since buried human remains are sometimes better preserved than buildings. There are several skeletal indicators (dental cavities, arthrosis, traumas, vitamin deficiencies, etc) that can reflect the health status of the population in each period. The frequencies of these pathological markers are in general higher during periods of higher inequality. For example, the 2006–2013 excavation of cemeteries such as North Tombs Cemeteries at Amarna (an Ancient Egyptian site dating from 1346BC) demonstrated deaths at an early age – mainly of children, teenagers, and young adults – widespread dietary deficiencies, and indications of hard labour, suggesting the poor state of health and substandard working conditions for most of this urban community. For instance, 16% of all children under 15-years-old displayed spine injuries of the sort associated with carrying heavy loads; none of them had any grave goods, and sometimes were buried together with several others, with scant regard for the disposition of the bodies – a grim image that contrasts with the glamorous depictions of the pharaoh's family in the Amarna style. An additional indicator would be evidence of a high infant mortality rate, although the preservation of children's skeletal remains is invariably more difficult than that of adult bones due to differential conservation processes, and this could represent an insurmountable bias in the results. Changes in health status can be used to ascertain cultural and ancestral transitions too. In this sense, probably the most striking change observed is between hunter-gatherers and the first farmers in Europe. The latter not only show signs of poorer health – such as cavities, almost unknown by the former – but also higher infant mortality rates and even lower stature than previous hunter-gatherers. Correlated with this information, recent developments in the stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen ratios in bone collagen can provide information on nutritional status and mobility patterns associated with specific individuals. For instance, the analysis of a high-status burial in Helmsdorf, Germany, related to the Únêtice culture, showed that this person had a higher protein intake than other contemporaneous peers, suggesting as well that diet can be as much an indicator of social status as it is in today's societies. Key to understanding the social panorama of the past is that ancient cemeteries can provide not only potential indicators of inequality in the form of grave goods and even differential health status but also genetic material preserved within human remains. The information retrieved from their DNA can be used, for the first time, to correlate ancestry with social power in each period. Furthermore, a crucial aspect of the accumulation of power is the possibility of bequeathing wealth to biological relatives – something that can be tested as well via the interface between genetics and archaeology, which enables us to reveal family links. Like funerary goods, a privileged resting place could serve as a status marker too. Around 6,500 years ago, the phenomenon of building large funerary stone structures – known as megalithic tombs – emerged, mainly across Europe's Atlantic seaboard, and culminated in the great passage tomb complexes such as Newgrange in Boyne Valley (Ireland), which has a mound almost 300ft (91m) in diameter and 50ft (15m). The origins and meaning of these monuments, which required a heavy investment in labour, have been debated for more than a century, as has the social organisation of the farming communities that built them. The genetic analysis of two-dozen individuals found in various megalithic tombs from Scandinavia to Orkney Island and Ireland yielded some interesting social clues. In some places, notably the British Isles, more males than females were buried in these preeminent spots, pointing to a sex bias. In accordance with this observation, the descent of most individuals with kinship links could be traced through the paternal line. In one case it was possible to find two related males buried in two different megaliths just over a mile apart (Primrose Grange and Carrowmore in Ireland), indicating a geographic expansion of these dominant families. Genetic analyses of skeletal remains discovered within the most intricately constructed chamber of the Newgrange passage tomb revealed that they belonged to the incestuous son of a brother and sister (or a parent and child), and therefore a quarter of his genome had no genetic variation. This kind of first-degree offspring is extraordinary, only having been cited in royal families of the past headed by god-kings such as the Egyptian pharaohs seeking to maintain a pure dynastic bloodline. (It is known, for instance, that Akhenaten married his eldest daughter, Meritaten, and much later, Ptolemy II married his sister, Arsinoe II – hence his nickname, ""Philadelphus"" or ""sibling loving."") It has been suggested that this Neolithic elite may have claimed to possess divine powers to ensure the continuity of agricultural cycles by keeping the Sun's movements going. The findings support the notion that these Neolithic communities were socially stratified and that the massive stone structures were used to bury transgenerational patrilineal members of these clans. Perhaps equally interesting is the fact that in one case relatives were separated by up to 12 generations, pointing to an unusual stability through time of both the funerary tradition and the stratified society where they lived. We have seen several case studies of past inequality correlating funerary archaeology with genetics that might no longer apply today, where legal regulations (and also the exponential increase of cremations) represent a certain degree of standardisation in funeral practices. Nevertheless, an opposite trend could shape the future of the archaeology of death: the trend toward personalised coffins, unconventional funerary memorials, and special grave goods. One way or another, mortuary archaeology will always be an important subfield of this discipline, and one that will need to rely on the hard sciences such as genetics and forensics. Perhaps one encouraging conclusion is that despite what we have seen on the archaeology of past inequality, societies have been able to evolve and change their social stratifications. One example is Iceland – the country has become one of the most egalitarian societies in the world. In 2018, Iceland passed a law that all companies employing more than 25 people will have four years to ensure gender-equal payment because, according to the head of the Equality Unit at Iceland's Welfare Ministry, ""equality won't come about by itself, from the bottom up alone"". * This is an edited version of an article that originally appeared in The MIT Press Reader, and is republished with permission. -- Carles Lalueza-Fox is Research Professor and Director of the Paleogenomics Lab at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (CSIC-Universitat Pompeu Fabra) in Barcelona.

economic indicators,Employment rate in NI reaches record high,2024-09-15,2023-12-12,By John Campbell & Sara Neill,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67690096,"The employment rate in Northern Ireland reached a record high of 72.8% between August and October, official figures suggest. The employment rate is a measurement of the percentage of working age adults who are in a job. The rate was 0.5 percentage points above the pre-pandemic level of 72.3% recorded from November 2019 to January 2020. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell to a new record low of just 2.1%. The August-October period was the first time the unemployment, employment and economic inactivity rates have all been better than the pre-pandemic levels recorded in November-January 2020. However, the most up-to-date jobs market indicator, payroll data for November, suggested the jobs market may have peaked. The HMRC figures suggests the number of workers on company payrolls declined marginally in November from 796,904 to 796,415.  The HMRC data also suggested the sharp rise in cash wages seen in Northern Ireland over the last two years, related to inflation, had levelled off. Typical monthly pay in Northern Ireland was £2,064 in November, an increase of 2.3% over the year and a month-on-month fall of 1.8%. By contrast, typical wages in the UK as a whole showed a 1.2% month-on-month increase in November. That meant Northern Ireland earnings were 11% below UK earnings, the largest difference on record. Jason Calvert, a director at PwC Northern Ireland, said low pay was an ongoing problem in Northern Ireland. ""Wages are continuing to run behind the rate of inflation in the UK,"" he said. ""There are cost-of-living differences here, but this is getting worse, not better. ""There's a whole range of things that are probably linked to that, interest rate hikes, redundancies that we're seeing huge amounts of in Northern Ireland."" The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) also found redundancies in Northern Ireland had tripled. The statistics highlighted there were 410 redundancies in November 2023 and, between December 2022 and November 2023, 2,590 redundancies were confirmed. That is over three times more than in the previous year, when confirmed redundancies stood at 850. Mr Calvert added: ""I think we do need to be prepared for the worst. We have seen some of the big significant steady wage increases over the last two years in cash terms. But then you link that with the interest rates, it's making it harder for businesses to service loans.  ""Some sectors in particular - if you look at finance and business - have seen higher wage growth than other sectors.  ""I think when you put that in the context of the confidence in the Northern Irish market I do think we need to be braced for that to potentially continue into the next year."" A different measurement, the Quarterly Employment Survey (QES), showed the services sector remained the engine of job creation. The QES surveys about 6,000 companies, covering all employers with 25 or more employees and all public sector employers. The latest survey, covering the third quarter of this year, showed the number of employee jobs increased by 19,340 (2.4%) over the year with 17,550 coming from the services sector."
economic indicators,The indigenous recipe for living well,2024-09-15,2021-02-08,Dimitri Selibas,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20210207-buen-vivir-colombias-philosophy-for-good-living,"Chef Anibal Jose Criollo is helping to spread the indigenous idea of ""Buen Vivir"", that one’s wellbeing is intimately connected to that of the environment and community. 50 Reasons to Love the World - 2021 Why do you love the world? “Because there is a lovely moment [in Nariño, Colombia] when the potato or the arracacha is ready to be harvested and you go past in the morning or at night, and you have the smell of the flowers, and they are special because when they don't have pesticides this aroma leaves you wanting to stay there.” – Anibal Jose Criollo, chef and environmentalist More Reasons to Love the World It's 16:00 near lake La Cocha in Colombia's southern department of Nariño, and the kitchen staff at Naturalia are busy at work. Long light rays of an overcast afternoon mingle with smoke wafting in from the trout being prepared in the scullery next door. Indigenous Colombian chef and environmentalist Anibal Jose Criollo presides over the team inside the humble cabin, pausing to greet a neighbour delivering a basket of fruit while his six-year-old niece Helen sits in a corner, playfully sifting blackberries. Between stoves and an immense square table in the middle of the cabin’s creaky wooden centre, Criollo prepares a mix of local and ancient specialities – herido de frutas rojas silvestres (a warmed alcoholic drink made with a mix of wild red berries), trucha ahumada (smoked trout) from the lake, quinoa arepas and a pork caldo (broth) from a pig that formerly resided in Criollo’s shagra (an ancestral indigenous food garden). This region of Colombia, with its cool climate and high-altitude plains, is known for being different to the rest of the nation, culturally far closer to other Andean countries like Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador, which it borders. Here in the furthest reaches of the Incan empire, the Pasto indigenous people stood firm against Emperor Huayna Cápac, leading him to give them the name ""past awá"" or ""people of the scorpion"" because he supposedly said he ""wanted to step on their heads and they bit me with their tail"". After resisting the Incan imperial advances, the Pastos were later overwhelmed by the Spanish colonial invasion and successive waves of Catholic missionaries. ""[The Spanish] took away our culture... and in the process annihilated us,"" said Criollo. ""But one thing they cannot annihilate is the feeling of ownership of a territory, and that attribute of the territory which is food."" Today, Pasto communities still live in what is now Ecuador and southern Colombia, and they are still fighting to maintain their cultures, which is epitomised by the philosophy of Buen Vivir (""Living Well""). ""Buen Vivir in a few words, is learning to value myself as a human being... learning to value the other and learning to value and care for the environment in which one develops themselves,"" said Criollo. Buen Vivir is a pluralistic worldview that's prevalent among indigenous communities across Latin America and whose principles are shared by different cultures around the world. Similar to the concept of ubuntu from South Africa, it holds that an individual’s wellbeing can only be achieved through harmonious relationships with the wider community – including people, the environment, other living beings, their ancestors and the cosmos. Practically speaking, it encompasses themes like food sovereignty, land rights, environmental justice, economic solidarity and the protection of local biodiversity. According to Criollo and other environmental activists, in an era of coronavirus and climate crisis uncertainty, there has been a global awakening that our way of life need to become less individualistic and more sustainable. Now, the guiding social and environmental principles of Buen Vivir are being considered by outside communities. The philosophy resonated powerfully for Criollo when his restaurant Naturalia closed for seven months during the Covid-19 lockdown. Without his primary income, Criollo sustained his family and himself by growing broad beans, potatoes and arracacha (an Andean vegetable that resembles a cross between a carrot and celery root), among other crops in his shagra. He also made yoghurt from his cows and traded with others in his community through a cooperative-sharing system called mindala.

Puenayan describes the mindala system as, ""the things that we don’t consume ourselves we share, also sharing knowledge about planting and gastronomy."" The UN's Food and Agriculture Association worked in the Nariño department with Pasto communities like Puenayan’s and in 2013 prepared the Mindala and Shagra guide, showing to outside communities the viability of these ancestral models to construct and promote autonomy, sovereignty, security and biodiversity. Protecting the environment is also a central mission for the Shagreros of Panam Association, and in 2018 it won an award from the Nariño government, in conjunction with the Global Environment Facility and United Nations Development Program, for its work in planting native trees which helped to protect the area’s water sources. “If I plant a tree, it then takes care of me. It provides me with seeds, it gives me water, clean air. Each tree is an ecosystem, one supporting insects and biodiversity,” said Criollo, who also works with neighbouring families to reforest areas with native plant species. Working with indigenous and peasant farming families, he has helped to ensure that La Cocha lake – which is considered sacred to indigenous communities – received Ramsar status as a protected wetland, and expanded the area's network of around 100 civil society nature reserves – a Colombian conservation model where private individuals devote part of their land to environmental protection. “What are we connecting? Conservation, clean food production, caring for seeds and looking at culture through the lens of food,” said Criollo. And with Covid-19, this interconnectedness has enabled many more people to revaluate their relationship with the planet. “One of the impacts of the pandemic has been to work towards integral health, highlighting the importance of recuperating the balance between man and nature,” said Luis Eduardo Calpa, who works with the Basque Mundukide Foundation to support Criollo and Puenayan by promoting agroecology, community self-management and responsible consumption by connecting small-scale producers with traditional chefs. “Now the proposal of the indigenous communities has much more validity,” Calpa added. Like other indigenous communities, the Pastos’ traditional ways of life have historically been marginalised, first by Spanish colonialists and then by indifferent national governments. But Colombia’s 1991 Constitution recognised indigenous people’s rights to their own territories and legal and economic systems. Additionally, Colombia’s Constitutional Court’s jurisprudence notes how indigenous land is not only the basis for subsistence, but it is also a living entity that is intimately entwined with indigenous communities' cultural and spiritual practices. Now indigenous and farming communities in southern Colombia are increasingly mobilising to grow healthy food, promote supportive local economies, use ancestral seeds and protect the environment, with shagras and the mindala system forming the cornerstones of this revival. Alba Portillo is the founder and coordinator of the local Guardians of the Seed Network, which currently shares and cultivates more than 2,500 traditional, heirloom and non-genetically modified food species with rural farmers and urban consumers. She says seeds are a sacred part of understanding Buen Vivir, and that the spiritual relationship people have with food is nurtured through cultivating and caring for what you eat. Portillo says that a large part of what the network does is to fight the crisis brought about by big agriculture that relies on chemical fertilisers, herbicides, pesticides and genetically modified seeds instead of those whose unique traits were carefully bred over thousands of years. ""We have lost more than 80% of our agro-biodiversity, which means for each one gone, we have lost a story, an inheritance, an identity in the territory,"" said Portillo. The philosophy of Buen Vivir is also gaining wider recognition among non-indigenous Colombians. In November 2020, the Colombian government created a Buen Vivir fund to finance entrepreneurial projects in indigenous communities. Last May, the ground-breaking documentary series El Buen Vivir (“The Good Life”) launched on YouTube and Colombian television. The series showcased how nine Colombian indigenous communities incorporate, live and embody the concepts of Buen Vivir, with each film created and directed by indigenous filmmakers. And while Colombia is regularly ranked by Gallup as one of the happiest countries in the world, Buen Vivir researcher Martin Calisto Friant, says this seems to speak more about how people there have strong community and family structures and are not dependent on the state or a capitalistic market. In a research paper, Fraint notes that Buen Vivir is the opposite of capitalistic consumerism. Those who follow it aspire for a democratic society where happiness is not bound by material accumulation. It focuses on solidarity, reciprocity and citizenship, thus sharing many elements with recent concepts like degrowth and slow economy. In Friant’s native Ecuador, the government of former president Rafael Correa took radical steps to popularise the principles of Buen Vivir, making it a fundamental pillar of the country’s new 2008 constitution and creating a short-lived secretariat in 2013 to support its implementation. Further afield, countries like Iceland, New Zealand and Scotland are exploring alternative indicators to GDP to measure citizen wellness. For decades, the mountain kingdom of Bhutan has used Gross National Happiness (GNH), integrating a mix of spiritual and social markers to measure its citizens' wellbeing. Most recently, on 2 February 2021, the landmark Dasgupta Review on the Economics of Biodiversity was released. Commissioned by the UK Treasury in 2019, the report calls for a transformational change in our economic approach to nature and proposes recognising nature as an asset and reconsidering our measures of economic prosperity. Back outside in his shagra, Criollo walks with his niece Helen, showing her how the scraps from the kitchen get fed to earthworms or pigs. Helen squeals with joy as she holds a cuy (guinea pig), a local regional delicacy, and collects eggs from under a cackling hen. ""This is an education you can’t find in schools,"" said Criollo, who believes that the most important part of Buen Vivir is that it is intergenerational. ""The land nourishes us, it feeds us, it teaches us, it takes care of us, and so we leave it as our inheritance for the next generations.""

economic indicators,How elders energise the workforce,2024-09-15,2019-11-15,Zaria Gorvett,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20191112-how-the-elderly-can-reinvigorate-the-workforce,"The world is ageing. But our oldest workers could help keep the economy afloat. The world is experiencing a mammoth demographic shift, as the post-war baby-boomer generation enter their sixth and seventh decades. In 1960, those older than 65 made up just 4.9% of the global population, but by 2050, they’ll account for a staggering 17%. The world will soon be brimming with sexagenarians, septuagenarians, octogenarians and all the other subsequent genarians – in fact, there will be enough old-age pensioners to populate Germany 24 times over. And there’s one area of life where these numbers are set to have a major impact: the world of work. According to a recent study by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, by 2026, more than one in 10 workers will be older than 75. That’s double the rate in 1996. Similarly, roughly three in ten workers will be aged between 65 and 74, which is comparable to the current situation in Japan – the country with oldest workforce on the planet. The scaremongering about so many elders has already begun. The new era has been described as a “threat”, “grey tsunami”, and “demographic time bomb”. But what’s causing that kind of problematic, alarmist language? And how could elders actually help bolster the workforce? On the decline – but why? In 2016, Nicole Maestas, an expert in healthcare policy at Harvard Medical School, decided to find out. Together with colleagues from the American global policy think tank, the RAND Corporation, Maestas compared the GDP of the 50 US states in the years between 1980 and 2010. Maestas relied on the fact that some states are ageing faster than others as a kind of case study for how the multitude of older workers will affect us when the whole of society has grown up. “We did find that in states that were ageing more rapidly, GDP grew more slowly,” she says. In some places, this is already happening at the national level. In ‘super-aged’ Japan, where pensioners already make up 12.9% of the labour force, GDP has been among the slowest growing for the last 20 years. In fact, the International Monetary Fund have predicted that the ageing population could drag down the nation’s average GDP by 1% over the next three decades. There are two possible reasons that population ageing can be a real weight on the economy. One is that, with an older population, there will be fewer workers in total – and so fewer people contributing to the economy. The other is how productive each person in the labour force is. It wasn’t clear from Maestas’s initial calculations how much one factored in over the other, but when her team analysed the data further, they found that two-thirds of this effect was due to a loss of productivity. Experience and expertise Here, though, the picture starts to get a little bit muddier. It’s tempting to attribute these economic and productivity slow-downs to the fact that older people are past their best, but “it doesn’t necessarily follow that older workers are less productive than younger workers”, says Maestas. Yes, Maestas’ research suggests that workforces tend to become less productive as the population ages, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that’s because of the extra older workers, per se. In fact, she thinks the reasons underlying this trend are the opposite of what the stereotypes would suggest; the problem might not be traithat baby boomer workers are older and therefore less competent now, but that the ones who are leaving the workforce are still impressively productive. While there is an inevitable decline in our mental powers as we age, as our brains literally start to shrivel, these changes mostly affect so-called “fluid intelligence” – things like our ability to solve new problems. On the other hand, “crystallised intelligence”, which includes verbal reasoning and acquired knowledge, actually continues to grow well into our 90s. It’s also important to remember that not everyone ages in the same way, or at the same rate; some 70-year olds will be better at these things than much younger workers. And, contrary to popular belief, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that older workers are inherently less productive. One 2018 study didn’t find any significant links between the overall performance of private sector organisations in the UK and the proportion of older workers that they employed. Instead of explaining away the loss of productivity that threatens ageing societies by blaming shrinking brains, Maestas suggests some alternative explanations – though more research is needed to see if they hold up. The first is that, as skilled older workers leave the economy, younger ones inevitably replace them – and the youngest workers in society aren’t necessarily the most productive. As a report for the Centre for European Economic Research suggests, this is likely to have more of an impact on the sectors that require more acquired knowledge, such as manufacturing. The second is even more intriguing: the most productive members of society tend to be wealthier, and better at planning for their retirement. As more of these older workers are able to leave, the least productive workers are left behind. “Economists think of leisure as something that people want to consume more of, the richer they get. It makes sense that as people earn more and more and more, they might choose to retire earlier, in order to consume more leisure,” says Maestas. Finally, older and younger workers are thought to have skillsets that complement each other. For example, it’s well-established that mixed-age teams can be more productive than those which are less age-diverse. Workers are worth more than the sum of their own abilities – and how they interact with others can have a big impact on the productivity of the organisations that employ them. It’s possible that as the most experienced workers retire, the loss of this collaborative dynamic is reducing productivity – though this hasn’t yet been proven. A ‘tsunami’ of opportunity If you look at earnings – a standard economic proxy for productivity – older workers win hands down in terms of raw economic value. A 2013 study found that those between the ages of 60 and 74 tended to earn 10% to 20% more than their younger counterparts. If this is the case the best thing we can do is try to hold on to as many older workers as possible. But this is not what is happening. A 2018 report by AARP, a US-based not-for-profit for retirees, found that 61% of the older workers it surveyed had seen or experienced age discrimination. More recently, the tech giant IBM was hit by a class-action lawsuit by former employees who allege that they were unfairly dismissed because of their age. According to a report by Bloomberg, the company has fired up to 100,000 people in the last few years – many of them older workers – in a bid to appear as ‘trendy’ and millennial-friendly as its competitors Amazon and Google. According to a recent article by AARP, despite strict anti-discrimination laws in the US, companies filter out older candidates by posting job adverts with coded language. Employers ask for “recent college graduates”, “digital natives” – people born into an era of smartphones and laptops, and those who would be a good “cultural fit” at a young company, or who have “five to seven years of experience” – effectively ruling out those who have been in work for several decades already.   As Cal Halvorsen, an expert in societal ageing from Boston College explains, older workers are still often seen as a burden. “We know that that there’s a lot of ageism in the workplace, whether supervisors or managers realise they’re doing it,” he says. Take training. Many employers fail to offer older employees opportunities for professional development, partly because they think these workers won’t be around for long enough to be worth the investment – and partly because many people underestimate the ability of older workers to learn new skills. Halvorsen thinks this is a mistake. “These things can be learned. It’s just that organisations need to get better at teaching them. And the thing is, if you’re 55 years old, you might be in the workplace for another ten, fifteen, even twenty years,” he says.  Instead, Halvorsen thinks we should view the emerging multi-generational workforce as an opportunity. “There’s research out there which suggests that age diversity might actually stimulate and support creative thinking and innovation. There’s a study which suggests that age diverse teams might actually perform better, and research which shows that people from a variety of generations actually like to work together,” he says. Work hard, work long   Some countries are onto this already. In Japan, prime minister Shinzō Abe has become renowned for his ‘Abenomics’ – a set of practical reforms designed to reinvigorate the sluggish economy. As part of his flagship programme, he has overhauled the nation’s social security system to make it possible for workers to put off collecting their pensions and keep working for longer. For one thing, Abe has also vowed to raise the age of retirement. To incentivise companies to hold on to their staff, he’s making it a legal requirement for them to allow their staff to keep working until the age of 70, should they want to. In Germany, where the number of people of working age is set to shrink by 10% between now and 2040, they’re focusing on training. The innovative Initiative 50 Plus programme was developed to encourage older workers to remain working longer. It includes schemes such as pairing unemployed young people with unemployed old people, to encourage them to learn from each other. It also provides older workers on lower salaries with financial support. These incentives aren’t just about being nice to older people. There are real economic gains to be made by investing in these workers. According to a 2015 report for the UK government by the pensions expert and political campaigner Ros Altmann, holding on to workers for just three years beyond when they would usually retire could add £55 billion to the British economy. As if that weren’t reason enough, the evidence suggests that retaining older workers would also have the tantalising – and rather unexpected – benefit of boosting the wages and employment prospects of younger generations, too. The idea is that if more older people stay in work, they’ll have more money to spend, and this benefits the economy, which is good for everyone. The world’s population might be on an unstoppable course toward old age, but this demographic transformation doesn’t have to come with crippling economic consequences; instead, we can view it as an opportunity. And changing our attitudes towards old age – and the potential of older workers – is the first step."
economic indicators,Will flying get more expensive?,2024-09-15,2020-05-29,John Walton,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200528-will-the-price-of-flights-increase-due-to-coronavirus,"Covid-19 has caused unprecedented turmoil in the aviation industry. What does that mean for pricing when planes take to the skies again? As more countries start to ease their Covid-19 lockdowns, attention is returning to the global aviation industry, almost entirely grounded for months. Some passenger airlines have kept skeleton fleets flying for repatriation missions, some have converted passenger jets to use as cargo planes, but all of them would much rather return to their primary objective: flying people safely around the world. But when planes do take to the skies again, how much impact will the pandemic have on what they charge? “We know airlines want to get planes back in the air and bums back on seats,” says Benjamin Cany from Amadeus, a technology company that provides IT services to the travel industry, including one of its principal booking systems. In the short-term at least, that would point to lower fares aimed at incentivising consumers. Yet look past the next few months and there are factors that could push fares up, from airline bankruptcies that could reduce both supply and competition, to reduced fleets caused by retiring aircraft early. And the great unknown is how quickly passengers will return to flying, with the general feeling in the industry that aviation won’t return to pre-pandemic numbers until 2022, 2023 or beyond.   Airlines, Cany says, usually look at past demand to forecast future trends. But there’s no precedent for the current circumstances. “What are airlines to do when the past data is radically different, or no longer relevant for future calculations?” The pricing equation Airline pricing, explains Cany, is normally based on a combination of scientific calculations and models. This, he says, “is about understanding the customer's motivation to travel and how much they are willing to pay for the ticket. Airlines then balance that against capacity, and a myriad other indicators. The airline wants to strike the best deal for the airline and the traveller.” This is both a science and an art. The science, Cany says, “is in the modelling, machine learning and algorithms behind this calculation” and would usually include “the choice between the different airline products (for example, business versus premium economy) and the various airline itineraries available (departure time, arrival time, trip duration). That needs to be combined with historical data, seasonality, as well as market indicators such as upcoming local events, competition on that same route, and so forth.” The art, meanwhile, comes from “the airline’s pricing and revenue management experts, who adjust these indicators to develop the most accurate forecast. That’s where the technology helps, providing these teams with the tools to improve the forecast accuracy to the highest degree,” Cany concludes. But nobody knows how the models that aviation has been honing for decades will change as a result of the extraordinary Covid-19 challenges, particularly given the situation is still evolving. When will demand return? In the most basic of economic terms, for example, airline fares are set based on a supply curve and a demand curve. Airlines usually have the lever of supply under their control, and it’s generally understood that when they want to stimulate demand to fill capacity, they reduce fares. More people will travel if a ticket is $50 than if it is $100. The X factor right now is that many people are scared to travel because of hygiene concerns, lockdown guidance and quarantine rules.  “Short-term, aircraft will continue to be much less full and airlines will be motivated to price seats to get customers flying safely in a Covid-19 world,” says Joe Leader, chief executive officer of APEX, a trade association whose members include airlines and their suppliers. “Airlines have cut back their flights to absolute connectivity minimums and are losing money on the vast majority of remaining flights… Hopefully, the combination of increased Covid-19 safety measures alongside low prices will encourage a travel rebound.” Paul Simmons, a senior airline executive with experience at numerous airlines worldwide including easyJet and Malaysia Airlines, suggests much will depend on what part low pricing can play as a tool to persuade people to travel. “It could be that airlines find their traditional lever of low pricing to drive bums on seats does not work as well as it used to. People may have higher concerns.” The general view is that domestic travel will recover first, a view with which Peter Foster, CEO of Kazakhstan’s national carrier Air Astana, agrees. “Initial indications from our recently-restarted limited domestic flights are that there is pent-up demand for these routes. We believe that business, worker and student travel will recover well before leisure travel.” IATA, an airline trade association, expects low demand when countries first start to travel again, despite some business travellers needing to fly and a desire for what’s known as VFR — visiting friends and relatives — traffic as people miss their families. On the plus side for airlines, IATA notes that the biggest variable cost in aviation, fuel, will be low: as drivers in many places are noticing, there’s oversupply in the petroleum industry keeping prices down. Will supply fall?  If there are major unknowns on the demand side, there are also evolving factors influencing pricing on the supply side. One of the starkest images for the airline industry has been the sight of line after line of jets parked on runways and put into storage at aircraft recycling ‘boneyards’. While older and less efficient planes will be retired, some of them years ahead of schedule, airline executive Paul Simmons points out that most of the planes taken out of fleets have been stored, not scrapped. “This is an important distinction,” he says. Joe Leader from airline association APEX suggests that “there will be more than enough supply even with all of the early aircraft retirements”. Certainly to start off with, demand will be low enough to be met by the aircraft that haven’t been retired. Airbus and Boeing have both announced cuts to the numbers of new aircraft they’re building every month, but as demand rises again, the aircraft manufacturers can increase production, airlines can extend the life of aircraft they’re using, or older aircraft can be brought back into use from storage. It’s already clear that the airline landscape, and indeed the names painted on the side of the aircraft, are likely to be forever changed. Some airlines have already filed for various forms of bankruptcy protection or indeed have simply gone under. This will, in many cases, lead to less competition – and the possibility of monopoly pricing, which tends not to favour consumers. Yet it’s likely that regulators will come down hard on airlines seen to profiteer, while other carriers will seek to jump into monopoly markets where that is possible, or new entrants will arise. For passengers, that’s likely to mean a fair amount of volatility in fares. “Although some airlines will inevitably go out of business, others will scale up to fill the void,” comments Simmons. “The ‘rightsizing’ of supply and demand may take time, however, leading to higher pricing in the medium term.” No easy answers The watchword for aviation, as for so many industries looking to rebound from Covid-19, is going to be uncertainty. New waves of infection, or treatment breakthroughs, would both influence the future path. So too will political and regulatory responses, as well as the wider global economic fallout that is being forecast. Demand, crucially, is not rising evenly; different government restrictions ­– especially quarantine periods on arrival for travellers from some nations – will have effects that are very complex to model, and will necessarily differ between nations or even within regions of the same nation. The US is an example of how perceptions and thus demand can vary across a nation. Scott DeAngelo, chief marketing officer of niche leisure carrier Allegiant Air, said on an earnings call that customer surveys revealed that “in the Midwest and Mid Atlantic, the Upper West, I got to tell you they don’t share the opinion that the evening news is putting out there” around travel. Pictures over the US Memorial Day holiday weekend have shown leisure destinations in some parts of the country packed with partygoers. It seems likely that travel resumption “bubbles” between neighbouring countries and regions with acceptably low infection rates (where “acceptably” will also vary) will continue, and while these may stimulate demand travellers will also not want to be caught overseas if restrictions return swiftly. The question of whether any travel insurance would cover Covid-19-related issues is also crucial. Airlines also need to start flying for people to start buying tickets even in a reduced demand scenario, and we are only just starting to see a very limited number of airlines resuming very limited schedules. That all makes predicting the effects of the interlocking factors upon which airline pricing is based challenging. The demand side of the curve is particularly tricky for long-haul pricing, says Air Astana CEO Peter Foster, who nevertheless expects that the stronger long-haul airlines are likely to try to kickstart demand with lower fares. Short-haul carriers, meanwhile, may benefit from low oil prices, reduced aircraft prices that enable counter-cyclical orders and lower salaries due to surplus aviation workers. “The prognosis may well be lower airfares on short/medium haul routes for at least 18 months to two years,” Foster expects. And while Covid-19 is unprecedented, he believes the past can offer indicators for future trends. “After every major crisis of the last 20 years – the Asian financial crisis of 1998, 9/11, the global financial crisis – low-cost airlines have emerged faster and stronger because suppressed demand combined with depressed consumer spending power has driven people to them,” he says. “I doubt 2020/21 will be any different.” Aviation journalist John Walton writes about airlines, aircraft and everything aeronautical.

economic indicators,The country getting remote work right,2024-09-15,2020-06-24,Katie Bishop,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200623-what-the-dutch-can-teach-the-world-about-remote-work,"The Netherlands may have figured out something about working from home (pandemic or no) that the rest of the world has yet to learn. If you’ve been balancing your laptop on a precarious stack of cookbooks, or lamented VPN speed from your kitchen table, you’re not alone. Ever since restrictions were put in place to slow the spread of Covid-19, companies have been scrambling to enable colleagues to work from home. As we adapt to the much-cited ‘new normal’, some experts are predicting that remote work might be here to stay. This is leaving many nervously eyeing up our makeshift home desk set-ups, and wondering how on earth we can handle the backache.  But for some, remote working is just another day at the office. Thousands of workers in the Netherlands benefit from the country’s astonishingly flexible work culture. While the percentage of employed persons usually working remotely before the coronavirus outbreak lingered at around 4.7% in the UK, and 3.6% in the US, 14.1% of the Netherland’s workforce reports usually working away from the office. The Netherlands has long led the global shift toward remote work, with only Finland catching up in recent years while other countries lag behind. “When the pandemic started, I suddenly found myself playing the part of a remote-work coach for my wife and our neighbours,” says Yvo van Doorn, an Amsterdam-based engineer. “I was suddenly answering questions about home networks and video conferencing. It was eye-opening because I’d taken these things for granted.” Across the globe, many companies have found that the shift to remote work has been a less-than-smooth transition. Setting up usually office-based staff with computer equipment, and recalibrating working culture to keep employees connected, has been a significant shift for most. But for the Netherlands, the country’s already sizeable remote workforce means that the adjustment has been much less dramatic. “Dutch people had certain advantages when we went into lockdown,” explains van Doorn, whose employer Auth0 gives all workers the option for flexible work, offers a budget to create a comfortable and productive home working set up, and helps to arrange coworking spaces if needed. “We’re fortunate enough to be a country where 98% of homes have high-speed internet access, and the Netherlands has the right combination of technology, culture, and approach to make remote working successful. I’m judged on whether I deliver value, not on the fact that I sit at a desk for nine hours a day. ” A culture ripe for remote work As we begin to tentatively imagine a post-pandemic future, there will be many who find themselves looking wistfully toward van Doorn’s permanent home working set-up. Results of a recent US poll, conducted mid-crisis, suggest that 59% of remote workers would like to continue to work remotely as much as possible once restrictions on businesses and school closures are fully lifted. Major international companies, including Barclays and Twitter, have already suggested that expensive city office space may become a thing of the past. Both have already hinted at an end to the commute for its employees, planning potentially long-term remote work policies for after the pandemic. Aukje Nauta, an organisational psychology professor at the University of Leiden, who is researching how companies can enhance individuals in a dynamic work context, believes that employers could look toward the Netherlands for inspiration as they consider how best to implement remote-work policies and set up virtual offices. “Values such as democracy and participation are deeply rooted in the Dutch working culture, so managers place more trust in their workers than elsewhere in the world,” she says. “For example, ING bank [an influential Dutch company based in Amsterdam] now has a policy on unlimited holidays implemented for pilot groups of workers, who can take as much holiday as they want as long as their tasks do not suffer. Employers elsewhere are now learning that employees can be trusted to work from home, and I believe that in post-corona[virus] times, smart combinations of working from home and meeting in real life will emerge more and more worldwide.” But there are also broader economic and social contexts that enable remote work to flourish in the Netherlands. “Physical infrastructure is well developed, and public and commercial remote-working facilities are plentiful,” says Bart Götte, a business futurist and psychologist based in Amersfoort. “Public libraries have reinvented themselves as massive and comfortable modern working spaces, and there are an enormous number of small, quality coffee shops that service the remote workforce. Employers in the Netherlands have also seized the opportunity to cut costs and become more productive – they need less square metres of expensive office space, and strict sick pay legislation in the Netherlands means that they are motivated to make sure that their workers have healthy working facilities at home.” The explosion of remote working facilities in the Netherlands hasn’t just benefited employees of large companies. Around 1.1 million workers in the Netherlands are self-employed, and the normalisation of the virtual office has made it easy for freelancers and small business start-ups to operate without the need for dedicated office space. “I’m a solo-preneur and currently work from home,” says Lara Wilkens, an event producer in Amsterdam. “Working from home is better for the environment, and we have great paid co-working spaces as well as many free places where you can trade a service for a workspace.” ‘The power to reorganise’ With the Netherlands displaying an admirable level of trust in its employees and an understanding of the digital frameworks needed to support remote work, other countries may now be looking towards the Dutch as they plan a post-Covid future. Many countries struggle with a culture of presenteeism, with 83% of UK employees reporting having observed pressure within their workplace to ‘show up’ regardless of whether their mental or physical health allows it. In the US, around 15% of homes do not have broadband, and one in five employees report feeling guilty about taking time away from the office, worrying that this might make them seem less committed to their job. While the Netherlands displays a combination of attuned infrastructure, investment in a digital future, and culture of trust that makes it an aspirational archetype of a well-oiled remote world, companies in other countries still have much to understand and adapt to as Covid-19 ushers in a less office-based future. “What we have seen over the last few months is the power to reorganise,” says Götte. “We are now working remotely on a massive global scale. I think that we will come out of this crisis more digitally literate, aware that many of us are capable of working remotely, with more autonomy, and perhaps an aspiration to become more independent. Due to the accelerating forces caused by Covid, other countries are in a turbulent learning curve, and people are rethinking old policies, procedures, customs, and values. When circumstances change so massively we simply have to learn by doing, and that is perhaps the most important lesson.”  "
economic indicators,The pandemic’s biggest unknowns,2024-09-15,2020-10-26,Unknown,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20201023-coronavirus-how-will-the-pandemic-change-the-way-we-work,"Covid-19 upended our jobs. We've tried to adapt, but what about the long term? BBC Worklife asks dozens of experts to flag the biggest questions we should be asking in 2020 and beyond.    More than seven months have passed since the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic. Hundreds of millions of people have lived through lockdowns. Many have made the abrupt shift to working from home; millions have lost jobs. The future looks uncertain. We don't know when, or if, our societies might return to normal – or what kind of scars the pandemic will leave. Amid the upheaval, BBC Worklife spoke to dozens of experts, leaders and professionals across the globe to ask: what are the greatest unknowns we face? How will we work, live and thrive in the post-pandemic future? How is Covid-19 reshaping our world – potentially, forever? We’ll roll out these important views from some of the top minds in business, public health and many other fields in several articles over the next few weeks. We'll hear from people including Melinda Gates on gender equality, Zoom founder Eric Yuan on the future of video calls, Lonely Planet founder Tony Wheeler on what’s next in travel and Unesco chief Audrey Azoulay on the ethics of artificial intelligence. Today, we’re starting by looking at the issue of work: how the pandemic has normalised remote work, and what that might mean. Will we go to the office again – and, if so, how often? What impact will a ‘hybrid’ way of working have on how we communicate, connect and create? Will work-from-home be the great leveller in terms of gender equality and diversity? And what will work mean if our offices are virtual and we lose those day-to-day social interactions? We’re also examining what happens to people who can’t work from home as well as those whose jobs depend on a steady flow of traffic into urban hubs. Can we learn from Covid-19 and build better safety nets for the most vulnerable workers? And if the future is digital, how do we make sure swathes of the global population aren’t left behind? “We all know that work will never be the same, even if we don’t yet know all the ways in which it will be different,” says Slack co-founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield. But we’ve started asking the questions – and here’s what our experts had to say. Melinda Gates: Co-Chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation What is the future of gender equality?    Will the world finally get serious about gender equality? That’s a question of long standing, but I’m asking it even more insistently now. Because when the world’s economies were pushed to the brink, it was women who fell over the edge. Women were already clustered in low-paying jobs. When the pandemic hit, they were more likely than men to lose those jobs. According to one study, 1.8 times more likely. That’s just paid work. With billions of people staying home, the demand for unpaid work – cooking, cleaning, and childcare – has surged. Women already did about three quarters of that work; in the pandemic, the breakdown is even more lopsided. Of course, the paid and unpaid economies are intimately connected. (One is a lot more visible, but it’s built on top of the other!) The unpaid work women do is one of the biggest barriers they face to reaching their potential in the workforce. I hope Covid-19 forces us to confront how unsustainable the current arrangement is – and how much we all miss out on when women’s responsibilities at home limit their ability to contribute beyond it. The solutions lie with governments, employers and families committed to doing things more equitably. Stewart Butterfield: CEO and co-founder, Slack  How many people actually want to work in offices? We all know that work will never be the same, even if we don’t yet know all the ways in which it will be different. What we can say with certainty is that the sudden shift to distributed work has provided a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reimagine everything about how we do our jobs and how we run our companies. If we can move past decades of orthodoxy about 9-to-5, office-centric work, there’s an opportunity to retain the best parts of office culture while freeing ourselves from bad habits and inefficient processes, from ineffective meetings to unnecessary bureaucracy. Every leader believes they can do better, and things can move faster: this is their chance. From the employee perspective, the shift is massive and very consequential: people are making new choices about where they want to live and creating new expectations about flexibility, working conditions and life balance that can’t be undone. Our Future Forum research of 4,700 knowledge workers found the majority never want to go back to the old way of working. Only 12% want to return to full-time office work, and 72% want a hybrid remote-office model moving forward. All this change in our methods will go hand-in-hand with a change in our tools. Of course, we think Slack has an important role to play as a new kind of headquarters for a digital first world, but the opportunities for digital transformation are expansive and wide-ranging. Businesses that do it well will drive engagement, achieve organisational agility, maintain alignment and empower teamwork across all disciplines and locations. They will have a competitive advantage in this new era of work. Elisabeth Reynolds: Executive Director, Task Force on the Work of the Future, Massachusetts Institute of Technology  What happens to the workers that remote jobs leave behind? For those who can work from home (approximately 40% of US workers largely from the higher educated quartile), our daily experience of work will change significantly. Commuters will gain an hour back on average in their day and estimates suggest that post pandemic, some portion of the week will involve working from home – from one to three days a week. A hybrid model is likely to emerge that will try to balance the efficiencies gained by remote work with the benefits of social interactions and to creativity and innovation generated by working in person with others. But the greatest challenge that we face regarding work is what happens to the other 60% of workers who can’t work from home. The decline in daily commuters as well as business travel has a knock-on effect on those whose jobs support and serve these workers and offices. A full one-in-four workers are in the transportation, food service, cleaning and maintenance, retail and personal care industries. These jobs, often concentrated in cities and lower paid, are disappearing or are at risk of disappearing in the near term. We need to shore up the social safety net and invest in ways to further skills and increase access to education and training for our most vulnerable workers. Indranil Roy: Executive Director, Human Capital practice, Deloitte Consulting How can companies become ‘virtual first’? More than half of the global workforce is working remotely and as the pandemic continues to threaten health, we are looking at a prolonged period of hybrid working – from home and office in different proportions. Some lessons learned: we can accomplish most tasks remotely without significant drop in productivity or quality. Most employees appreciate flexibility, especially those with long commute times. Over time, however, face-to-face interaction is required to facilitate collaboration, build relationships, solve complex challenges and generate ideas. Continuous remote work extends the work day, diffuses work-life boundaries and reduces mental wellbeing. Given these pros and cons, organisations have to rethink their working arrangements. This re-calibration will eventually settle on a sustainable new normal, likely a hybrid workforce and distributed workplace. Enterprises adopting this new way of working – “virtual-first” – have these characteristics: One, the workplace is distributed across home, office and satellite offices. Employees can choose to work remotely or face-to-face based on their nature of work and teams’ preferences. Two, the teams are virtual ready. Managers know how to manage, coach, collaborate, evaluate performance and motivate their team remotely. Three, the technology enables multiple modes of working. Data is saved on cloud; access and security are tailored for different working modes; and applications allow seamless virtual collaborations. Four, the culture prioritises trust and belonging. Interpersonal bonds are formed with intent and care. With these four critical moves, organisations can transit to a hybrid-workforce model and build a “virtual-first” enterprise. Diane Coyle: Co-Director, Bennett Institute for Public Policy, University of Cambridge What is the role of the state in this new economy? The economic shock caused by the pandemic is making even more pressing some of the questions about the economy that many people had already started to ask. There is a demand to ‘build back better’ as the phrase goes, because it was clear that some things had already started to go wrong and have now gotten worse. For example, one is low pay and terrible conditions of work in the types of jobs we’ve been praising as ‘key workers’, in everything from care homes to delivery drivers and warehouse staff. Another is the terrifying decline in environmental indicators from extreme weather events and loss of biodiversity – both threatening food supplies – to polluted air and the consequences for human health. I would highlight an underlying question about the role of the state in the economy. We have grown used to the idea that government and markets are separate spheres, and the market generally knows best. Yet in the crisis responses across the world, we have a demonstration of how dramatically governments can intervene in managing the economy. It might take years for the state role to unwind even if a government wanted to do so. But, with a focus on new infrastructure investment and green transition, on establishing job schemes, on making up for the educational deficit due to disrupted learning through 2020 and beyond and on supporting key industries such as travel and the arts, I think there will be a lasting change in perceptions of the role of the state. Eric S Yuan: Founder and CEO, Zoom How will video calls continue to shape businesses? Now that the world is familiar with video communications, the way businesses and individuals communicate and connect will be forever changed. Healthcare, education, finance and businesses large and small are growing and improving with the help of video communications. This year alone, hundreds of thousands of small business owners – yoga and piano instructors, therapists, accountants and others – maintained and even grew businesses using video to connect with customers. We believe that model will be a large part of our future, so we’ve made those interactions easier with OnZoom, a new all-in-one solution for Zoom users to create and host free and paid events on Zoom. In the near future, some organisations will adopt a hybrid-work model, with certain days in the office and others remote, and might align employees’ in-office and remote schedules to create equity. Other companies will use video communications to be completely remote. Both models will enjoy increased productivity and deeper collaboration, and the ability to attract a more diverse workforce. Erica Brescia: Chief Operating Officer, GitHub How will workers interact with each other? The future of work will be distributed. We’re going to see a big shift from office by default to remote by default. GitHub has been a predominantly distributed company with people working across the globe, which has helped us learn and evolve quickly. With people in every part of the company working remotely for years, we’ve seen how virtual interactions drive innovation. With Covid-19, we’re rethinking how we design and use our office spaces – making them more about bringing the community in and placing an emphasis on virtual events. Remote by default will also force people to reframe the way they communicate and connect with people at work. Those whose superpower is connecting with people live and bringing energy to conversations will need to become good written communicators. And companies who do not have a strict need for physical interaction are going to have to operate more like open source communities – distributed, asynchronously and online. We will quickly see a material shift in who succeeds in this new mode of working. Robin Dunbar: Emeritus Professor of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford Is remote working overhyped? The last few months has seen a great deal of media hype about new ways of working – the dispersed office and working from home. No more of the drudgery of the morning commute, the arrival home exhausted long after the children have been put to bed. Alas, it is all hype. We have forgotten that we tried it 20 years ago and very quickly gave it up. At the time, big business with expensive London real estate spotted it as a way of radically reducing their overheads. A round of golf over lunch, and collecting the kids from school… what could be better? At a personal level, it probably is better, but it didn’t last long – for three very good reasons. First, the work place is a social environment and business in any form is a social phenomenon. Without face-to-face engagement, and those casual meetings round the coffee machine, the ‘flow’ that makes things work, and work fast, will be missing. Work groups quickly lose focus, and the sense of belonging – and of commitment to the organisation and its aims and objectives – is very quickly lost. Second, we have been in the midst of a loneliness epidemic among the 20-somethings for the better part of the last two decades. It is a particular problem for young new graduates moving to an unfamiliar city on their first job. With no family or friends nearby, work is the only place they can find friends and arrange social events. “We come in to work to see our friends!” has been their response to surveys. Third, the digital world of Zoom and Skype is no substitute for face-to-face meetings. It is easy to hide away reading your emails and newsfeed. People find the virtual environment awkward and very quickly get bored. There is a very strict limit on the size of natural conversations at four people. Anything bigger, and it becomes a lecture dominated by a handful of extraverts. Jean-Nicolas Reyt: Assistant Professor of Organizational Behaviour, McGill University  Could working from home increase gender equality? Even as modern organisation are challenged by attracting, retaining and promoting talented employees, they underutilise one major source of available talent: women. Women account for half of all entry-level employees, yet they compose only a third of senior managers and a fifth of C-suite executives. One of the reasons women have a harder time advancing professionally is that they are much more likely than men to prioritise their family responsibilities over their careers. Giving employees more flexibility in choosing when and where they work can increase gender equality via two pathways. First, research has long established that remote work can help mothers better balance their work and family responsibilities, which makes them less likely to sacrifice one for the other. Second, data collected during the pandemic suggests that working from home may also make the father more involved. More couples share family responsibilities more equally now than they did before the pandemic, according to a survey of American couples. In a survey of Canadian fathers, a majority report doing more household chores and spending more time with their children now than they did before the pandemic. If organisations continued to offer remote work opportunities after the pandemic is over, more women will have a level playing field. Reetika Khera: Associate Professor, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi  Will our jobs still give us value? To me, the most significant realisation due to the pandemic and related restrictions, has been that people have become aware of the – call it ‘social’ or ‘intrinsic’ – value of work in our lives. For many, those much loathed and dreaded three words – ‘going to work’ – is something they crave. I’m not referring to those who have lost work and income and need it to survive. I have in mind those who are comfortably working from home, even rediscovering old loves (such as cooking or sketching), honing new skills (many are baking) and so on. I’m referring to work broadly, including students who are longing for lectures even. There are signs of this across economic classes. Even the admittedly small fraction of domestic workers who continued to be paid through the lockdown were restless to resume work. For different reasons, we’re socialised into thinking that work is about money. With WFH people have continued to enjoy the economic value of work, but they still feel like there is a hole in their lives. The obvious next step is that we value other people’s work, even when it is lower paid. Unfortunately, that has not happened. Karin Kimbrough: Chief Economist, LinkedIn How is remote working changing job searches? We’re seeing a huge increase in demand for remote work on our platform, one that will have a significant long-term impact on the labour market. Globally, we’re seeing four times the number of jobs that offer remote work since March. We also see that trend reflected from jobseekers: the volume of job searches using the “Remote” filter on LinkedIn has increased ~60% since the beginning of March, and the share of Remote Job Applications has increased nearly 2.5 times globally from March. The advent of remote work and an increasingly virtual world seems to have reduced barriers for people to connect and build their networks. Lately, LinkedIn members are more likely to connect with others outside of where they live. With the rise of remote work, one of the most exciting trends that we’re going to see is a democratisation of opportunity and movement of skills all around the globe. Companies may be able to source diverse talent more easily, especially from groups that are underrepresented in their area, or for skills that are locally less available, through remote-work options. Naohiro Yashiro: Professor, Global Business, Showa Women's University Will white-collar workers get more freedom? Covid-19 is reshaping the traditional urban work style in Japan. In Tokyo, 2.4 million people commute in the crowded trains every day. The Covid-19 pandemic forces remote work for many employees, who find it quite efficient and comfortable. However, the flexible combination between work and family life at home is interrupted by the rigid labour law that forces the employer to monitor the working hours of the employees from 9 to 6, including lunchtime break. The law was originally established based on the blue-collar work style, and it mechanically applies to the white-collar jobs. The current official guideline for teleworkers requires the employees to take an hourly paid holiday when they leave temporarily from the work at home. Nevertheless, the expansion of the new workstyle facing the Covid-19 will eventually not only release the white-collar jobs from the restrictions on time and place, but it should change the traditional unspecified job style under a lifetime commitment toward more specific contract-based employment. An increasing number of teleworkers would be an important step toward activating the elderly and handicapped workers and raising the labour productivity of the white-collar workers by letting them free from rigid time-based management in Japan. Jeanna Lundberg: Co-Founder and CEO, Respaces  What is the future of workspaces?   A few months ago, I had the luxury of a beautiful office close to home, and a boss who would allow me to work from home whenever I wanted. My friends were envious, as almost all of them were expected to work from the same desk every day. Then Covid-19 hit, and show-up culture was officially dead. No one was expected to show up anywhere. Suddenly companies were forced to leave the standard office buildings behind, and trust both technology and their employees to truly work remotely. So, what have we learnt so far? If I ask my friends if they would like to go back full-time to working from one office, five days a week – most people say no. They like skipping the obligatory commute, feeling trusted by their bosses, and having the freedom to customise their days to their personal needs. But they also complain that the home office is cramped, boring, and lonely after a while. Companies have discovered that both remote work and trusting employees is not only possible, but in many cases more profitable. Employees remain effective and productive, and they feel better, too. Many are now questioning the need for the big, expensive and static office they used to have. So, if the general population won't be going back full-time to the office, but also won’t be staying at home full-time – what is the future of workspaces? Covid-19 taught us the importance of flexibility and trust, from economic, sustainability and health perspectives. As companies dare to explore options beyond the ‘one-size-fits-all’ office solution, we can start sharing spaces in a new way. Imagine if you could have access to inspiring new locations adapted for different tasks and projects – wherever you are. Rashmi Dhanwani: Founder, the Art X Company  What does employee trust look like?   In the formal economy, we have observed that the impact has been most evident around intangible ideas of trust, accountability and boundaries. In India, we have operated on a trust deficit in the workplace, which made it necessary for specific hierarchical and social structures to be in place. The pandemic, the disruptions it has caused to what we know and the enforced move to work from home has allowed for a multi-polar power dynamic to emerge with power bases shifting from leaders and experienced bosses to younger professionals more adept at adapting to digital working environments. Secondly, with the transparency of processes, allocation and status updates that digital planning tools bestow, employee accountability to tasks is made more visible to everyone across the work chain, leading to challenging the aforementioned trust deficit. Lastly, boundaries between office and personal space, digital and lived experiences and work and play have become far more fluid. It remains to be seen how organisations are able to capitalise on opportunities arising out of this unprecedented situation, while also syncing it into creating a “better normal” for its employees. Karen Mills: Senior Fellow, Harvard Business School and Former Administrator, US Small Business Administration Is being an entrepreneur harder than ever? Small businesses and entrepreneurship are the hidden assets of every democratic society. In the US, they have long been the pathway to the American Dream. But what if this pathway became less available in the future? It’s getting harder to start a business in the US, and entrepreneurship is already on the decline. One way to reverse this trend is by widening access to capital. Fintech [financial technology] lenders can help fill the gaps left by banks in underserved markets and communities, although we must be vigilant that hidden biases in lending algorithms do not exacerbate existing disparities. The future of access to capital remains unclear, but one thing is certain: if entrepreneurship fades, so will economic opportunity and mobility. Jay Van Bavel: Associate Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, New York University Will our behavioural changes last? We have just undergone the largest behaviour-change experiment in the history of humanity. The question is, which new habits will stick around after the pandemic is over? I think it’s safe to say that people will quickly flock back to restaurants and bars, weddings and funerals, vacations and graduations once a vaccine has been developed. But it’s less clear if we will continue to wear masks during flu season – which could save countless lives and better prepare us for a future pandemic – or continue to work from home. The population has had a massive crash course in modern technology, so I think that these new skills and experiences will be the true engine of change. For instance, now that companies have been forced to try telecommuting, I bet that many will decide it’s less expensive and more efficient to allow people to work from home. This has lots of second- and third-order effects that we haven’t considered. One possibility is that it could increase gender equity in the workforce as parents are better able to balance work and home life. Telecommuters might flock to smaller, cheaper cities or rural environments. But if they do, this won’t be the end of big cities – I expect they will rise from the ashes like a phoenix as artists and young parents will suddenly be able to afford life in an urban hub. The restructuring of society might seem frightening, but it provides the opportunity for radically new social arrangements that are not only more efficient, but also more humane. John Trougakos: Associate Professor, Organizational Behaviour and HR Management, University of Toronto  How do we modernise traditional work arrangements? The Covid-19 pandemic has fundamentally shifted the way in which people work. As a result, traditional office jobs may never be the same. The pandemic forced millions of employees to work remotely, and numerous companies have elected to make this move a permanent feature of their business models. However, in order to maximise the benefits of working remotely, ways must be found to ensure people remain productive and connected while not being overburdened. Companies need to look at the pandemic as an opportunity to modernise how people work. This should not only include a shift to having employees working from home, but also being open to alternative schedules including ideas such as four-day work weeks and six-hour work days. At the same time, employees must build resilience and actively preserve boundaries between home and their job, not only to boost performance, but to also maintain personal well-being. One way to help achieve this is to empower workers by giving them more autonomy in determining their working arrangements. Greater control over how and when to work leads to greater satisfaction, productivity and reduced stress. People may choose to work from home, go into the office or find alternate arrangements that work for them. Local neighbourhood Covid-safe remote work spaces, such as those offered by new companies like Toronto-based WorkMode, have arisen specifically to address this growing need. These types of spaces offer alternatives to large crowded office buildings, while providing employees a simple way to deal with their work-home boundary dilemmas. The key is to focus on keeping workers productive and healthy by giving them the freedom to work in ways that suit their needs while also meeting corporate objectives. Proactive and progressive companies will take this opportunity to embrace this new normal and turn it into a competitive advantage while simultaneously improving the lives of their workers. Anna Stansbury: Inequality & Social Policy Scholar, Harvard University  Will all workers now have a voice? For the world of work, one of the biggest effects of the pandemic has been to illuminate the utter lack of voice and influence most people have in their workplace. This is starkest if you consider low-paid essential workers in industries like food production or delivery – working for meagre pay at the best of times, in poor working conditions and during this pandemic often forced to choose between losing their income or risking contracting a disease which could threaten them and their loved ones. But it is also true for employees throughout the income distribution. Healthcare workers – on the front-line in dealing with the pandemic – are dying at alarming rates, and are often forced to go without the information, the protective equipment or the workplace practices needed to stay safe. Employees in retail, in office jobs, in hospitality have hesitated to return to long days of working in enclosed spaces with poor air circulation – but have often had no real choice in the matter. And for many people, this has raised the question: why do I have so little say in my workplace? And: what can we do to change this? This desire for a greater voice in the workplace has manifested itself with strikes and walkouts across industries and countries, from warehouse workers in Milan to bus drivers in Detroit, food packers in Northern Ireland to nurses in Hong Kong. It has manifested itself with calls for greater unionization, or for employee representation on workplace health and safety committees. And, I expect, it will manifest itself over the longer term, in a generation which has viscerally experienced the risks of not having a meaningful voice in their workplace – and who will put substantial emphasis on organizing for, advocating for, and voting for measures to strengthen employee representation and workplace democracy in the future. Chinmay Tumbe: Professor of Economics, Indian Institute of Management  Which divides between workers will deepen?  The pandemic is starkly reframing societal inequalities between those who have good bandwidth connectivity and those who don’t. The former can work from home, choose to live remotely, exercise at home and accumulate their savings in a world with limited opportunities for instant gratification. The latter are either struggling or out of work, stalling mortgage payments, climbing down the nutrition ladder and dipping into their savings. This includes a large class of migrant workers, desperate for normalcy to resume, as work from home is not feasible and work near home is not available. Unemployment and growing inequality could thus herald new political opportunities, if not outright revolutions. The post-pandemic world will also be interesting: a resumption of the consumerist economy with reduced time-horizons (why postpone purchases and exotic vacations when life can be so short) as well as a nostalgia for the possibilities that the lockdown offered us – of streets without cars, of clean air and of spending quality time with family. Expect more suburbanisation and multiple-home-ownership for the wealthy and a strong urge to upgrade digital skills among those not so well-off but who want to thrive in the new age high-bandwidth society. Cary Cooper: Professor of Organisational Psychology & Health at Manchester University  Will presenteeism get worse? The world of work will dramatically change over the next few years, not only because of Covid, but also because of the deep recession we will all be facing. There will, of course, be more flexible working – that is, people working substantially from home if they can and using a central office environment from time to time – but the 9-to-5 in an office environment is dead. Even employers will want this given the recession because it will enable them to substantially downsize their estate costs. Business travel will virtually cease both within the country and between countries as well because people are reluctant to use trains and planes and also employers want to minimise travel expenses – so Zooming, Skyping, etc. will be the future of business relationships. Given the fears of redundancies and a massive increase in job insecurity, we will see a great deal of presenteeism over the coming couple of years, which is likely to reflect itself in the short term by more visits to the central office environment to connect with office politics and to show facetime. But in the medium term, [presenteeism will be reflected] by people working longer hours and creating and attending more virtual meetings – which will not be good for the health of employees and their productivity. And finally, people in management roles will have to undergo a major transformation. We will need more managers from shop floor to top floor who have emotional intelligence and social skills, if we are to manage people more remotely, to identify when people are not coping with their work or suffering from mental ill health and to team build and develop in a virtual world new products and services. In the past, we promoted and hired people to leadership roles based on their technical skills; in the future, we will need managers who have parity between their technical and people skills – this is a major shift in emphasis in the new world of work. Scott Galloway: Professor of Marketing, New York University  The pandemic has accelerated societal change – will it last?   The pandemic’s most enduring impact will be as an accelerant. While it will initiate some changes and alter the direction of some trends, the pandemic’s primary effect has been to accelerate dynamics already present in society – from e-commerce to online education to remote healthcare. The biggest question facing the world as the pandemic recedes will be: will these accelerations stick? Millions of people shifted their grocery purchases online – will they keep that up after it is safe to shop in person? Thousands of colleges invested in distance learning technology, and their teachers and students developed new skills – will they leverage those investments to expand their offerings beyond the traditional ivy-covered walls? And millions of people saw their doctor, their therapist or their psychiatrist online for the first time – will they make future appointments this way, saving time, money, and gas, or will they miss the physical closeness? Beyond the world of business, the pandemic revealed and accelerated stark disparities in income, lifestyle and opportunity. Working class people got laid off, or – if they were deemed “essential workers” – were forced to risk their lives for minimum wage. While office workers relocated to their suburban homes and kept on collecting their $100,000 incomes. Will the generation that came of age into such a world reject the system that produced it, push for reform or decide that ruthless competition is their only hope?   Poornima Luthra: Founder and Chief Consultant, TalentED What will inclusive offices look like? It is the year 2020. What would a futurist in the early 1900s have predicted about the state of equality in the year 2020? It is quite likely that the predictions would have been around absolute equality for all human beings. And yet here we are, in 2020, still struggling with inequality, biases and discrimination in our workplaces. As we design the workplaces of the post-Covid-19 era, we need to put inclusive workplaces for diverse talent at the forefront of how we think about the future of work. This will need us to embrace a broader scope of diversity in our workplaces that includes gender, ethnicity, age, physical disabilities, cognitive diversity, lifestyle choices, sexual orientation and socioeconomic backgrounds. Whether work is done remotely, in our offices or perhaps some hybrid of the two, we need to be asking ourselves if we have inclusive workplace cultures for our diverse talent to thrive? The foot needs to stay on the accelerator. This will require all of us, individually and collectively, to ask ourselves if we are doing enough to be active allies – are we actively creating inclusive workplaces in which all its diverse talent feel that they are valued, appreciated, respected and that they belong. Lila Preston: Co-Head of Growth Equity Investment, Generation Investment Management How can we make work more sustainable? The pandemic had a profound impact on the labour market almost overnight: the equivalent of nearly 500 million full-time jobs disappeared. What happens next is enormously important, and we at Generation are focused on ensuring a sustainable future of work. The pandemic has brought home how many of the current models of work are not sustainable. Employment has dropped across the world, but the young, people of colour and women have been hit hardest of all. As economies reopen, we have the obligation to build back better. We are investors dedicated to sustainability. For us, a sustainable future of work would have three main traits. First, people would receive adequate compensation – not only in terms of their take-home salary each month, but also in terms of retirement savings and healthcare coverage. Second, the world of work must address longstanding issues of underrepresentation of minority groups. Finally, companies must help improve productivity growth, which was weak long before the pandemic and is a fundamental source of societal discontent. A number of young companies are doing important work in this space. Some companies are focused on improving financial inclusion, trying to make it easier for workers to start and build a retirement-savings plan. Other companies in this space reduce the costs of access to benefits including health insurance. These services save small business owners hours of administration – and also immeasurably improve workers' lives. Improving diversity and accessibility is also crucial. For white-collar workers, by removing the requirement to be in a physical office, businesses can open up access to new talent pools like working mothers, veterans and people with disabilities. The opportunity for remote and distributed work can also allow us to challenge human biases that impact recruiting processes. As sustainability investors, we believe that we are at an exciting turning point. The pandemic, despite its many horrors, could be a catalyst for a better world of work. Vinod Kumar: CEO, Vodafone Business  How will emerging tech shape post-Covid-19 offices?   We’re seeing a massive rewriting of the social contracts between employers and employees as a result of Covid-19. The way businesses function and employees work fundamentally changed overnight which forced both to reset their expectations of how work fits into life. The traditional 9-to-5 work day as we know it has also changed, as employers seek to accommodate its employees with flexible windowed hours of working. These new social contracts between employers and workers centre on blending in-person offices with remote capabilities as well as traditional office hours with asynchronous work, all enabled by technology. As a result, when I think about the future of work and how it will evolve in years to come, I believe our workday will be more virtual and automated. The rise of 5G networks and connected machines will enable virtual on-the-go workstations. These virtual stations will provide employees with all the amenities of a digital workplace, from AI-powered assistants that prep whiteboard presentations to virtual reality headsets that put you at the table of a morning meeting with co-workers around the world. Ultimately, businesses will need to create digital workplaces that make it easier for all kinds of employees to work in flexible environments while also living their lives. Vaibhav Gujral: Partner at McKinsey & Company What about the 'heartbeat' of the office? As lockdowns swept through the world earlier this year, the speed with which companies adapted was nothing short of remarkable, switching to a remote work model virtually overnight. Living rooms and kitchen countertops were converted into workspaces, and backgrounds for video calls were carefully curated. Many desk job workers even experienced a productivity ‘honeymoon’, with hours that were erstwhile spent stuck in traffic or airport lines, redeployed to staying on top of a zero inbox and sometimes enjoying mealtime with family. However, as the crisis dragged, we realised that it wasn’t sufficient to measure productivity by the simple yardstick of hours worked. We were missing the ‘heartbeat’ of the workplace: the energy that comes from serendipitous encounters that aren’t boxed into Zoom screens; the creativity that comes from spontaneous collaboration; the trust and relationships that are built through countless and unsaid small gestures and interactions. So, the question that is critical for us to answer – as we eventually emerge from this crisis – is ‘will we work differently?’ Will companies that are announcing permanent work from home policies become beacons for the rest, or remain exceptions? Even small shifts in work patterns could have a profound impact on commercial real estate – most directly on the demand for office space, and inevitably a multiplier effect on urban downtowns that are designed for the 9-to-5 worker. Companies are now reflecting more than ever on their real estate footprint. Does it make sense to keep large HQ spaces in urban centres, or should they adopt a more flexible model? The pressure on demand will create a flight to quality, toward buildings that deliver a better experience for users, and are more technologically advanced. Organisations that get it right may emerge from the crisis ahead in the war for talent, with policies that employees prefer, and workplaces that are purpose-designed to be vibrant, foster collaboration and productivity for the new way of working. Rosanna Durruthy: Vice President, Global Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, LinkedIn  What will become of working parents? Across the globe, it’s apparent, one thing will remain constant: remote work. Whether mandated by an employer or a personal choice, chances are many of us will be working from home for the foreseeable future. For many professionals, this shift is a positive and welcomed change. Our recent survey revealed that 63% of professionals would choose to continue working from home in some capacity even if their employer opened offices because most of them (57%) are not yet feeling safe to return to work. In this environment, having managers and company leaders who also recognize the unique challenges working parents are facing is critical. As a leader, you can foster an environment and culture where working parents are supported by offering flexibility such as moving away from traditional 9-to-5 working hours and encouraging transparency and regular check-ins between colleagues on work schedules and availability. It's also critical that organisations understand the challenges and barriers of returning to work. A LinkedIn study found 30% of working professionals with school-aged children at home right now feel they do not have the necessary childcare available to return to work. And 60% of workers say their employers have not made accommodations to their work schedules to help with parenting duties. As companies look to reopen, they must address the concerns of working parents.

economic indicators,"'We're the country of beef, but we can only afford chicken'",2024-09-15,2024-01-30,By James Menendez and Alba Morgade,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68126858,"Argentina was once one of the richest countries in the world, richer than France or Germany.  And much of that wealth was built on exports of beef, especially to Britain. But that was well over 100 years ago. Now, thanks to a profound economic crisis, it languishes in around 70th place, according to the latest figures from the World Bank. And a growing number of people here simply can't afford to eat beef from the cattle that still roam the fertile grasslands known as the Pampas.  People like Oriana and Samir, a young couple in their early 20s living in a run-down neighbourhood of the capital Buenos Aires. ""It's very difficult,"" Oriana says. ""You're constantly asking yourself - 'how am I going to make ends meet?'. We're the country of beef, but we only eat chicken because it's cheaper."" Even chicken is a treat.  Last year, inflation soared to 211%, the highest rate in three decades. In December alone, prices rose by more than 25%. The family share a small flat with their young daughter Chiara, and also Samir's parents and his brother. Paying the bills is a constant worry.  The costs of food, but also rent, electricity and transport keep rising all the time. Samir is a self-employed delivery driver, but the economic crisis means that demand has dropped sharply. His earnings can't keep up with rising prices. Plus he worries about growing insecurity on the streets, as people get more and more desperate. ""They might kill you just for your cell phone,"" he says. BBC World Service - Under the skin of Argentina's economic crisis At least 40% of the population live in poverty, according to the last set of official government figures. Most suspect the real figure is even higher.   Both Oriana and Samir voted for Argentina's new leader Javier Milei, the radical right-wing libertarian with extravagant hair and an abrasive style. He came from behind in last year's election to win more than 55% of the vote. ""He understands people's problems,"" says Samir, ""I think he's just what Argentina needs… to deal with the inflation."" Others aren't so sure. Claudio Paez used to be a successful businessman with a chain of sweet shops and grocery stores, 12 in all.  Now he's down to just two as the costs of running the shops and the collapse in customers' disposable income ate into his revenues.  And he expects things to get worse, not better. ""If the economic problems continue for three more months, I'll be in trouble and I won't be able to cover my outgoings,"" he says. More and more people in Argentina are having to improvise to survive. Not far from one of Claudio's shops, a small van is parked by the side of the road, the boot piled high with trays of eggs. The cheap price, $1 (79p) for a dozen eggs, has attracted a queue. But the van's owner does not linger long, just in case the police come by. The streets of Buenos Aires may still be lined with the ornate architecture of the country's 19th-Century boom, but they're also teeming with street vendors, delivery app riders and unofficial taxis. Analysis of official figures by the National University of Salta suggests that the informal sector employs nearly half the workforce in Argentina . Added to which, few people actually pay any income tax thanks to a law passed by the previous government, just before the election. And that's bad news for a country that's essentially broke and badly needs to generate income.   Argentina spends far more than it earns, and it already owes eye-watering sums: currently, about $44bn to the International Monetary Fund, making it the organisation's largest single debtor.   President Milei says he has answers to the economic crisis. An economist by training, he's a devout believer in untrammelled free markets and a shrunken state.  On the campaign trail, he garnered plenty of attention by waving a real chainsaw in the air, to signal his commitment to cost-cutting. He also promised to blow up the central bank and get rid of the local currency - the peso - altogether, and replace it with the US dollar. Both those ideas are currently on the back-burner, not least because the government itself is so short of dollars. Instead, President Milei has devalued the peso by half to boost competitiveness. And he's slashed the number of government ministries by a similar amount.  And, with a raft of proposals known as the ""Omnibus"" bill currently before Congress, it's now the turn of public spending. ""For the last 30 years,"" says analyst Sergio Berensztein, ""we've been printing money like maniacs, which is why we have such high inflation. Now, for the first time, we have a president who understands the problem."" The only solution, says Mr Berensztein, is to try to balance the budget, something the government's promised to do by the end of this year.  But it's going to be ""rough"", he adds. And so it becomes a question of politics. Mr Milei may have a clear personal mandate from voters, but he doesn't have a majority in Congress. Nowhere near in fact. His party, Freedom Advances, won just two seats in the 2021 legislative elections.  Add to that, powerful opposition in the shape of the country's trade unions.  They called a general strike last week and organised big demonstrations across the country.  Tens of thousands of people took to the streets in a noisy protest.  Juan Cruz Díaz from advisory firm, Cefeidas Group, worries that the impact of the proposed changes may be too damaging.  ""Most of the people who voted for Javier Milei wanted a change,"" he says. ""But that doesn't mean they support this libertarian approach to the economy and the state."" Congress will vote on whether to approve the president's plan later this week. It's by no means certain it'll pass. And anyway, there's no guarantee that the measures will make any difference to the rate of inflation. And ultimately, that's the only thing that matters to most people here. Mr Díaz believes the president has just a ""few months"" to turn things around and for people to start feeling better off. Mr Milei's political honeymoon is likely to be very short."
economic indicators,New immigration rules condemned by NI parties,2024-09-15,2020-02-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-51557500,"Politicians from a number of Northern Ireland's parties have expressed concern about newly-announced immigration rules. A new points-based system for immigration was announced on Wednesday, meaning low-skilled workers will not receive visas after Brexit. Retail and hospitality representatives said the plans could cause staff shortages in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin, Alliance, the SDLP and UUP all expressed concerns about the plans. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party would lobby the government ""to see if there is scope for regional variations"" after saying the minimum salary threshold for skilled workers coming to the UK might be too high for Northern Ireland's needs. He said the agri-food sector had suggested £22,000 a year would be a more appropriate threshold, rather than the £25,600 proposed by the government. Sir Jeffrey said: ""There are different needs in different parts of the UK and we have the agri-food sector as our biggest industry here."" Sinn Féin MP Chris Hazard described the government's plans as ""nothing but a xenophobic diktat"". He added: ""[The plans are] a very unpopular and unworkable proposal that is going to cause havoc for our local economy and local society."" The plans urge a ""move away"" from ""cheap labour"" from Europe and a push towards automation and retaining staff. The salary threshold for skilled workers wanting to come to the UK would be lowered from £30,000 to £25,600. However, the government says the threshold would be as low as £20,480 for people in ""specific shortage occupations"" - which include nursing, civil engineering, psychology and classical ballet dancing - or those with PhDs relevant to a specific job. Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry said the plans ""posed a particular threat to Northern Ireland"". The North Down MP said: ""A one-size fits all approach doesn't work. ""The salary thresholds will bring challenges for key sectors such as retail, hospitality and tourism, agri-food, and social care - salary levels are not always a reliable indicator of skills."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also branded the changes a ""fundamental threat"" to Northern Ireland's economy and provision of public services. ""The rush to exorcise economies of anything resembling a European influence, regardless of the impact it has on people, communities and businesses is a disgrace,"" said the Foyle MP. Ulster Unionist Party MLA John Stewart said the government had ""already shown scant regard to Northern Ireland through its withdrawal agreement with the EU"". ""I'm very concerned what these proposals will do to the hospitality, retail and agricultural sectors,"" he said. The plans could be ""an absolute disaster for the care sector in particular"", he added. The director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium said it was ""quite clear"" the region was not a priority. Aodhán Connolly said the minimum salary threshold was a higher salary than some architects and solicitors make in Northern Ireland. ""We need to be very, very clear that there is room for lower skilled and lower-qualified workers,"" he said. As part of the new legislation, the number of places for seasonal workers in agriculture is to be expanded to 10,000. He said this figure was ""miniscule compared to the needs"". He referred to figures for Northern Ireland, which showed technical full employment, although higher levels of economic inactivity than other parts of the United Kingdom. Economic inactivity is a measurement of those people who are not in work and not looking for work - that includes students, retired people and sick or disabled people. Mr Connolly said while there was potential for some of these people to come into the workforce, it would not come close to covering the shortfall created by the new immigration rules."
economic indicators,Jab uptake gap between affluent and deprived teens,2024-09-15,2021-09-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-58748325,"Sixteen and 17-year-olds are far more likely to take up the offer of a Covid vaccine in more affluent parts of Wales than they are in more deprived areas. Public Health Wales (PHW) figures showed 61% had been given a first dose of a jab in the most deprived areas of Wales - compared with 78.3% in the least deprived areas. Vaccine offers were made to all 16 and 17-year-olds six weeks ago.  Up to Tuesday night, 71.2% had received a first dose. It is the first time a breakdown of teenage uptake has been available in terms of gender, economic background and ethnic group. Up to 10 September, there were 3,449 young people in the poorest areas yet to receive a first dose. When looking at the uptake among that age group by sex, girls are ahead at 70%, with boys at 66.4%. There is a far smaller gap between 16 and 17-year-olds from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds and their white counterparts - 8.8 percentage points. The widest gap among BAME age groups is for those in their 30s, where 64% have so far had a first Covid vaccine dose, compared with 80.7% of white people in their 30s. PHW produces a monthly analysis of how the vaccine programme is reaching different groups in Wales. Meanwhile, teachers in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan have been told to wear face coverings when moving around indoor communal areas Vale of Glamorgan council said the Cardiff and Vale region was ""in the high risk category"", due to increasing cases in older people, increasing hospital admissions and pressure on the Test, Trace and Protect service locally.   It also said schools in the area should make lateral flow tests available to staff twice a week. The measures will be in place until the October half-term, before being reviewed. Pembrokeshire school pupils aged 10 to 19 over the last 30 days have had more than 200 cases, councillors in the area have been told. Director of education Steven Richards-Downes warned there was an increasing risk of year group closures due to Covid with one secondary school already having to take that step due to staff absences caused by illness, self-isolating and other reasons, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Ensuring a balance between well-being, a more normal school environment and reducing Covid risks was needed, added Mr Richards-Downes, with ""most cases from social contacts outside schools"". He said, particularly for teenagers in their ""formative years"", the challenge was to ""balance the harms of restricting contact and making sure learners are in a space where they can do the kinds of things they would normally do"". In Wales, 648.1 people per 100,000 population have had a positive Covid test in the past seven days.  That is a a slight fall for a second successive day. The daily average number of cases is 2,919 - up from 2,529 a week ago, although the recent rise has been slowing down. Neath Port Talbot is still the local authority area with the highest case rate (935.7 per 100,000) although this has fallen slightly. It has the second highest case rate in the UK and six Welsh council areas are in the highest 10 in the UK, although case rates in England are starting to rise again. Wales continues to have the highest case rate out of all UK nations and regions PHW figures show 59% of positive tests in Wales were in the under-30 age group, with 40% among 10 to 19-year-olds. We have also seen record numbers of positive lateral flow test results in the last week - with 51% or nearly 2,000 involving asymptomatic young people - which, if followed up with positive PCR tests, will have swelled the case numbers we are seeing. There were 13 deaths with Covid-19 reported by PHW on Thursday, all of which occurred on Wednesday. There have been 37 deaths in the past seven days, an average of 5.3 a day. Four of Wednesday's deaths were reported in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, three in Cardiff and Vale, two in Betsi Cadwaladr, one in each of the Cwm Taf Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Swansea Bay health board areas, with one outside Wales. Meanwhile, the first death involving Covid in a child in Wales was registered in the week up to 17 September - a girl aged 14 or under - in Public Health Wales' analysis of latest Office for National Statistics mortality figures. The key indicators around the impact on hospitals show numbers of patients with confirmed Covid has fallen for a ninth successive day. The average - 440 patients - is the lowest for 16 days. Covid admissions are still well below levels we saw during the second wave although the daily average is up to 36. There were 52 new confirmed and suspected hospital admissions on Wednesday, the highest daily figure for 11 days - 17 of them in Cwm Taf Morgannwg."
economic indicators,The week ahead in Parliament,2024-09-15,2020-05-15,By Mark D'Arcy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-52677453,"Week four of the virtual Parliament has passed, and since going online, MPs have held innumerable select committee meetings by video link, the Commons has seen the first remote maiden speech, the first remote personal statement, several online divisions (including the first examples of MPs accidentally voting the wrong way) and at least one all-virtual debate - on an innocuous statutory instrument on pension enrolment.  So the lockdown-beating measures to keep Parliament debating and scrutinising and law-making have proved pretty successful - up to a point.  For ministers the problem area is the passage of legislation. Next week two major Brexit bills, the Immigration Bill and the Trade Bill, will have second reading debates, but then what? In normal times they'd go into committee for several weeks of line-by-line scrutiny, but that kind of scrutiny has not been possible for any bill since Easter, because there is no mechanism in place for votes in virtual bill committees - although creating one should be fairly straightforward. This bottleneck matters because the UK's transitional period before leaving the EU single market is due to end on 31 December and there's a lot of heavy-duty legislating to get done. This is one reason for the ministerial enthusiasm for getting back to normal parliamentary operations, or some semblance of them, after the looming Whitsun recess. The other is that many MPs believe the virtual Parliament, while better than nothing, offers only the palest shadow of the proper scrutiny that comes when a crowded chamber can see the whites of a minister's eyes. But others are worried that it would be premature and unsafe to go back to crowded debating chambers and cheek-by-jowl voting lobbies. So they want to stick with remote voting and online contributions to debates, especially for those MPs who may be vulnerable to the virus. And while there are some wheezes that might allow more MPs into the chamber, like reviving the right to address the House from the upper galleries (which would require some extra microphones and cameras to be installed) the implication is that the current provisions look likely to continue until September. One possible change in June is that MPs may resume sitting for four days a week. With the Lords set to resume sitting for four days a week, it would look odd if the Commons did not, especially while ministers are grumbling about a backlog of legislation. They might even start holding Friday debates on private members' bills, where social distancing was practised long before it was fashionable, and there were rarely more than a handful of MPs in the chamber - the first Friday sitting is due on 12 June.  Here's my rundown of the week ahead, with the usual health warning that very significant statements or urgent questions can be dropped into the agenda at short notice - and, equally, other items can disappear. The Wednesday Liaison Committee motion looks a likely candidate for strategic disappearance.     The Commons opens (14:30) with half an hour of Treasury questions, followed by half an hour of Transport questions, and then, quite possibly a crop of post-weekend statements and urgent questions.  Then, four hours (with a 15-minute suspension in the middle) have been allocated to debate the second reading of the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination Bill. This is a major Brexit measure, repealing EU free movement of persons and other related EU-derived rights in UK law, and making EU, EEA and Swiss citizens subject to UK immigration controls. Irish citizens' immigration rights would remain. What the bill does not do is detail the future points-based immigration system, which will come into force after the Brexit transition period. That will be set out by the home secretary in regulations made under the powers in this bill, which will then have to be approved by Parliament.  The smaller opposition parties have put down ritual amendments to refuse a second reading. The Lib Dems say the bill fails to secure the rights of UK citizens to live, work and study in EU member states and the rights of EU citizens to do likewise in the UK. The SNP says the bill fails to respond to the coronavirus pandemic through a coherent system of visa extensions, the scrapping of no recourse to public funds rules, protection of asylum seekers, relief for families impacted by financial thresholds in the immigration rules, release of immigration detainees and stability for employers recruiting from the EEA. Its amendment also calls for a differentiated migration policy or devolution of powers to Scotland and other devolved nations. Interestingly, though, there is no official Labour amendment (the deadline was 17:00 on Thursday 14 May). Instead, there's an amendment proposed by Campaign Group stalwarts like Bell Ribeiro-Addy, Diane Abbott, John McDonnell, Richard Burgon and Dawn Butler, plus the Greens' Caroline Lucas, which argues that the bill ""usurps parliamentary sovereignty by granting excessive powers to the government to make changes to all immigration law with minimal legislative scrutiny and without primary legislation"". The programme motion calls for the bill to have completed Committee Stage consideration by 25 June, opening the way for what could well be an epic Report Stage.  On the virtual Committee Corridor (14:30) Housing, Communities and Local Government takes evidence on progress in removing dangerous cladding from tower blocks, first from activists and then (15:30) from Lord Greenhalgh, Minister of State at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. The Human Rights Committee (which has peers and MPs in its membership) takes evidence on human rights implications of the government's response to Covid-19 (14:30) including from Adele Green, a mother whose son has learning disabilities, and Andrea Attree, a mother of an autistic daughter. Both children are currently detained. Then they hear from Kevin Cleary, Deputy Chief Inspector of Hospitals and lead for mental health and community services at the Care Quality Commission, along with Kate Terroni, the Chief Inspector for Adult Social Care, and from NHS England. The Education Committee (09:30) looks at the impact of Covid-19 on education and children's services, with witnesses from the National Union of Students, the University Alliance and the Office for Students In the Lords (14:30) questions to ministers include former Home Secretary Lord Blunkett on adjusting the restrictions in place for those isolating due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Greens' Baroness Jones on the privacy concerns around the NHS Covid-19 contact tracing app.  Then peers consider the Draft Human Tissue (Permitted Material: Exceptions) (England) Regulations 2020. This is essentially a list of what parts of a dead person's body may not be removed for transplant purposes under the ""deemed consent"" legislation for England, that was passed last year. Among other things it rules out deemed consent for brain transplants. That is followed by a substantial-looking debate on the International response to COVID-19 - with 48 peers already down to speak MPs begin (11:30) with half an hour of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions, followed by mini-question times for the MPs who speak for the Church Commissioners, the House of Commons Commission, the Parliamentary Works Sponsor Body, the Public Accounts Commission and the Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission. After that, expect the customary crop of coronavirus-related ministerial statements. Then MPs move on to the Human Tissue (Permitted Material: Exceptions) (England) Regulations 2020 - the highly sensitive SI debated in the Lords on Monday. That is followed by the Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2014 (Consequential Modification) Order 2020, which will give the courts in Scotland power to make deductions from the benefits paid to an offender to provide support for their victims.  If MPs notice in time, there may also be some interesting action around a Ways and Means Resolution to allow the Finance Bill to include measures to deal with ""disguised remuneration"", the ultra-controversial IR35 tax provisions. Former cabinet minister David Davis has put down a couple of amendments, the first of which would restrict the government's ability to recoup money from affected taxpayers before 2023-4. His second amendment is a technical one, designed to open the way for MPs to put down amendments to the Finance Bill, in a rather limited kind of way - it is based on a resolution governments used to put down as a matter of routine, which talks about it being ""expedient to amend the law with respect to the national debt and the public revenue and to make further provision in connection with finance,"" wording which provided a little wiggle room for the Commons to influence the working of the Budget. It began to go  out of fashion after Gordon Brown as shadow chancellor in the 1990s used it to ferment a successful rebellion against Chancellor Ken Clarke's fuel duty plans.  The day's committee business includes Digital, Culture, Media and Sport hearing from the UK tourism industry about how the sector has been impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak (09:30). Health and Social Care (09:00) takes expert evidence on the management of the coronavirus outbreak, and Foreign Affairs (14:00) hears from former Foreign Secretary Lord Hague and others on the the FCO and the Integrated Review - which the government bills as the most comprehensive review of Britain's position in the world, since the Cold War. Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (14:00) hears from the Food and Drink Federation, the British Meat Processors Association and the Federation of Wholesale Distributors in its continuing inquiry into Covid-19 and food supply In the Lords (11:00) questions include Labour's Baroness Lawrence of Clarendon asking about progress in implementing the recommendations of the Windrush Lessons Learned Review and Lord Dubs on the improvement in air quality and other environmental indicators since Covid-19 restrictions were introduced  The main business is the detailed Committee Stage scrutiny of the Telecommunications Infrastructure (Leasehold Property) Bill, where there are a number of amendments which would reduce a leaseholder's ability to prevent installation of telecoms infrastructure on their property. The Lords Economic Affairs Committee (15:00) hears from Chancellor Rishi Sunak, which should be fun, given that it includes such luminaries as Lord Burns, the former permanent secretary at the Treasury, Lord Skidelsky, the biographer of Keynes, and keeper of the Thatcherite flame Lord Forsyth The Commons begins (11:30) with Scotland questions, followed, at 12:00 by Prime Minister's Question Time. Then there's more heavy-duty Brexit legislation, with the Second Reading of the Trade Bill, which creates a framework for an independent trade policy and a system for embedding new trade agreements into UK law. Expect all kinds of markers to go down on maintaining existing environmental and workers' rights standards. The Green Party's Caroline Lucas is first through the starting gate, with an amendment to decline a Second Reading to the bill because it contains no provisions for transparency during negotiations or for parliamentary oversight of agreements, and ""leaves UK parliamentarians with less influence over trade policy than their counterparts in other states"".   Lurking at the end of the agenda is the latest exciting episode of the controversy over who should chair the Commons Liaison Committee, the super-committee of select committee chairs, which is best known for its twice-yearly sessions questioning the prime minister (although Boris Johnson has yet to appear before it).  The government is proposing to install Sir Bernard Jenkin - not now a current committee chair - to chair the Liaison Committee, and this is being resisted by the chairs from opposition parties, who are proposing that the chair must be ""a current chair of a Select Committee."" Essentially this is about the government not wanting a perceived troublemaker - Jeremy Hunt, Ton Tugendhat - in a prominent position, given the grief the previous chair, Sarah Wollaston, caused them. The sting in the tail is that a motion to appoint Sir Bernard would be amendable, giving a Commons majority the potential ability to install someone else, and establish that person as a pretty powerful parliamentary player. So keep an eye on the increasingly restive Conservative parliamentary fundamentalists - the Peter Bones and Chris Chopes - who may well see this as an opportunity to remind ministers not to take the Commons for granted, and defy the whip to support an alternative candidate. The government will probably have the votes to get its way (including, probably, the whipped votes of the Conservative committee chairs, who're less than ecstatic about this proceeding) but in doing so, it will be installing the person who is supposed to go into bat for the select committee system, so Sir Bernard may find his colleagues eager to test his mettle.  The day's committee business includes the Work and Pensions Committee (09:30) on the DWP's response to the coronavirus outbreak, with witnesses from the TUC, the Salvation Army, the Prince's Trust and others. Transport (09:30) hears from Unite the Union, the British Air Line Pilots Association and minister Kelly Tolhurst on the transport ramifications of the pandemic, and in the afternoon, the Treasury Committee (14:00) takes evidence from top brass at the Bank of England, including governor Andrew Bailey and members of the Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates.  In the Lords (11:00) the day opens with questions on the response of international institutions to Covid-19 in refugee camps, and inheritance tax avoidance. Then detailed Committee stage scrutiny of the Prisoners (Disclosure of Information About Victims) Bill continues - with signs of guerrilla resistance to the measure from senior lawyers. Watch out for Report Stage.... The Commons is not sitting, but several select committees are in action. Environmental Audit (14:00) takes evidence on Covid-19 and the environment and Scottish Affairs (14:30) talks to Dr Gregor Smith, the Interim Chief Medical Officer for Scotland.  In the Lords (11:00) peers question ministers on guidance given to hospitals about ensuring the safety of patients without Covid-19 who require life-saving emergency treatment, government proposals for the rollout of the UK Shared Prosperity Fund and the changes in global oil markets and the implications of those changes for trade, climate change and international security. Then there are short debates on the contribution made by businesses and the wider private sector in addressing the pandemic, and supporting museums, galleries and historic buildings open to the public, during the pandemic. Neither House is sitting, but the limitations on the number of virtual committees that can be handled on any given day means that a number of select committees are in action.  Home Affairs (09:00) takes evidence on Home Office preparedness for Covid-19, and Public Accounts (13:45) quizzes Sir Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health and Social Care; Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England; and other senior officials on capital expenditure in the NHS, based on this National Audit Office report.  Meanwhile, the Justice Committee (14:00) talks to the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Burnett of Maldon, about the impact of Covid-19 on the prison, probation and court systems (14:30).

economic indicators,Energy costs push four in 10 firms to scale back,2024-09-15,2022-07-28,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-62330411,"With a heatwave and the prospect of drought, inflation rising further and energy bills soaring fastest of all, queues to exit the UK and baggage stuck in a warehouse on your return with global recession looming and Britain facing the worst downturn among industrialised nations other than Russia, it's possible to feel a bit gloomy about the state of the economy. Add to that the tensions and disruption in public services, from NHS backlogs due to Covid and profound problems with health service staffing, to strikes on railways and likely in local councils. The best such workers can hope for is to retain their spending power: most of us face a real terms cut in income. Yet, there are some glimmers of hope, and they come from business people. Their role is not so much to curse the darkness, but to strike a light, and hope that it can help them find a route through tough times.  So the good news is that supply chain blockages are easing up a bit. That's the message from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders this morning, having had months of low production, mostly due to a global shortage of microchips, but also as they go through the transition to new models for an electric future. UK car production for the first half of the year was down 19% on last year, and down 33% on 2019. But June was the second month of increasing output, and there's the prospect of a full-year rise in output as supply chains ease in the second half of 2022. I'm hearing also from construction, where material prices have soared but at least the supplies are getting through. It may help that two new container routes were announced this month, directly linking Grangemouth with Rotterdam and Greenock with China (in both cases, it seems to be Scotch whisky exports that provide sufficient volume to make the ships stack up financially - more on that with this morning's full-year results from Diageo). That easing of supply-chain disruption is also coming through the quarterly monitor carried out by the Fraser of Allander Institute along with legal firm Addleshaw Goddard. To be clear, those supply blockages are only easing. They're not solved. They now affect slightly less than half of businesses, down by four percentage points, and the biggest improvements have been in the Transport and Storage sector. But they help businesses responding to the survey to be more positive than negative about their outlook for the year ahead. There's not much else that's reassuring about the findings of this survey. The other main concerns continue to be the costs of energy and the availability of staff.  Of those firms with vacancies, 86% say they're proving hard to fill. The lack of skills or experience is a problem, but so are the going rates for wages. Plus 40% of businesses surveyed expect to reduce their operations this year due to higher energy prices, up from 33% in the first quarter of this year. What we seem to be seeing is the economy trying to get back to pre-pandemic production while well below capacity. There's still a post-lockdown rebound to be seen in the most recent Scottish government data for output in May, reversing the decline in April. But over a longer period, and around the world, it's running out of momentum. That under-capacity is easily seen in the hospitality trade and retail, where outlets can't get the staff to open for as many days as they used to. A lot of that has to do with recruitment difficulties, greatly exacerbated by the Brexit block on Europe's labour pool. When the Office for Budget Responsibility said Britain would be operating 4% below its trend growth due to Brexit, this is how forecasts translate into reality on the high street. But with a further four in 10 firms cutting back due to fuel bills, that leads through to poor productivity, lower earnings and, probably, fewer jobs. Businesses have not been protected from rising fuel bills by the price caps that apply to domestic customers. But those costs catch up with household budgets as well, and the latest projection of wholesale prices, putting up annual average household dual fuel bills to £3,800 from January, reflect the heightened tensions around Russia's supply of gas to the European Union.  The UK may be out of the union, and only 5% of its gas has been from Russia, but it's not out of the international gas market.  It is impossible for Britain to avoid the impact of lower supplies through the Nordstrom gas pipeline from Russia into central Europe.  They may ease, but more likely is that Russia will use the gas taps to turn the economic screw on the political leadership of Europe. So with prices spiking again - at more than eight times the prices being paid a year ago, and twice the prices last month - next winter's chill is already being felt in energy markets, and by anyone planning a household budget."
economic indicators,Guide: 2018 political party conferences,2024-09-15,2018-10-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"The autumn party conference season is over for another year. Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise.  Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour. In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard. She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty. In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review. On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all.  This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016. Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda. While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made.  These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height. Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"". The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"".  He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval. He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all.  The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum. The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party.  On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business.  There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups. Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference. The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day. She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum. She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless. As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament. Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"". In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped. He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum. Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"". The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"". Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member. UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists. As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes. Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"". The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour.  Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover. Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"". Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"". Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader.  Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union. Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators. If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."
economic indicators,Bank of England shrugs off inflation fears,2024-09-15,2021-06-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57596298,"The Bank of England has shrugged off concerns over a pick-up in inflation as the economy recovers from the pandemic. Consumer price inflation hit a two-year high of 2.1% in the year to May, exceeding the Bank's 2% target. In its latest statement, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it expected inflation to go above 3% ""for a temporary period"". The MPC voted 9-0 to keep interest rates steady at the historic low of 0.1%. Rates have been unchanged since March last year, when they were reduced to help contain the economic shock of Covid-19. ""Financial market measures of inflation expectations suggest that the near-term strength in inflation is expected to be transitory,"" the Bank said. High inflation is ""transitory"" and has not yet affected the need for ongoing stimulus of the economy - that is the judgement of the Bank of England's key interest rate-setting committee. The recovery around the world has been stronger than expected and the UK's growth prospects this year have been upgraded. House prices are strongly up in the year. However, uncertainty over the impact on the economy of the withdrawal of furlough support, the new pandemic variant and other factors means they are keeping their foot on the accelerator pedal.  Only departing chief economist Andy Haldane sounded a note of caution, saying the Bank should buy £50bn less in government bonds. He was again outvoted 8-1. The bounce back is certainly real, but there is a statistical fog about what actually happens in this unprecedented situation. The Bank's decision-makers have decided to wait and see what actually happens to jobs and growth, rather than act now on inflation. The reopening bounce back is not a boom. Not yet. The Bank said it now expected the UK economy to recover faster than it had previously predicted. It said output in June was now expected to be about 2.5% below its pre-Covid level. ""Output in a number of sectors is now around pre-Covid levels, although it remains materially below in others.  The housing market remains strong, and indicators of consumer confidence have increased,"" it said.  The MPC said the direct economic implications of delaying the final relaxation of Covid restrictions to 19 July were likely to be ""relatively small"" compared with the impact of previous stages. ""The Committee's central expectation is that the economy will experience a temporary period of strong GDP growth and above-target CPI inflation, after which growth and inflation will fall back,"" it added.  ""There are two-sided risks around this central path, and it is possible that near-term upward pressure on prices could prove somewhat larger than expected.   ""Taking together the evidence from financial market measures and surveys of households, businesses and professional forecasters, the Committee judges that UK inflation expectations remain well anchored."" MPC members also voted 8-1 to continue with the Bank's existing asset purchase scheme, maintaining its bond-buying target at £895bn. Luke Bartholomew, senior economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, highlighted the fact that departing chief economist Andy Haldane was once again the dissenting voice on the Bank's quantitative easing programme, voting for a reduction in bond purchases. ""It will be extremely interesting to see who replaces [Mr] Haldane in the chief economist role following his imminent departure,"" he said. ""It is likely the Bank will drift back into a more relaxed tone on the transitory nature of any inflation pressure once [Mr] Haldane's voice and vote has moved on."" "
economic indicators,Venezuela rejects vote tampering claim,2024-09-15,2017-08-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40808752,"Venezuela's electoral authorities have dismissed a claim that turnout in Sunday's controversial vote for a new constituent assembly was inflated. The firm behind the voting system said turnout was at least one million fewer than the government figure. But the head of the election council hit back, calling it an ""irresponsible claim, with unfounded estimations"". President Nicolás Maduro has said that the new assembly will be inaugurated on Friday. The opposition see the assembly as an attempt by Mr Maduro to cling on to power. They boycotted the election and also held an unofficial referendum in which they said more than seven million Venezuelans voted against the constituent assembly. Turnout in Sunday's poll is seen as a key indicator of the level of support the government enjoys. The government said more than eight million people, or 41.5% of the electorate, had voted. ""It is with the deepest regret that we have to report that the turnout numbers on Sunday 30th July for the Constituent Assembly in Venezuela were tampered with,"" the boss of Smartmatic, Antonio Mugica, told journalists in London. He said a full audit was needed to establish the exact number of voters but he said the firm estimated there was a difference of at least one million. But Tibisay Lucena of the election council accused Mr Mugica of trying to ""raise doubt over the result of the election"". Mr Maduro said the vote was free and fair and that it would not be tainted by ""a company with its headquarters in London and its bank accounts in the United States"". The opposition-controlled National Assembly has approved a request to open a criminal investigation into Smartmatic's claims. Separately, the Reuters news agency reported it had seen an internal memo from Venezuela's electoral authorities saying fewer than four million votes had been cast just two hours before polls closed. Venezuela's controversial vote explained Despite intense pressure at home and abroad, Mr Maduro is ploughing on with the constituent assembly. The first deputies for the new body have received their credentials, among them Mr Maduro's wife and son. Swearing in has already begun and the assembly's first sitting is due on Thursday. Mr Maduro says the constituent assembly, which has the power to rewrite the constitution and bypasses the National Assembly, is needed to restore order after months of crisis. The opposition is calling for fresh demonstrations with a march planned to coincide with the expected installation of the assembly. Venezuela remains in political and economic turmoil. Tumbling oil prices have hit social programmes hard and scores of people have died protesting against the government. But despite the unrest the government retains the crucial support of the armed forces."
economic indicators,Spain threatens to vote against Brexit deal,2024-09-15,2018-11-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46267684,"Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has said Spain will reject the draft Brexit withdrawal deal without a clarification of the text on future talks on the status of Gibraltar. Spain maintains a claim to the peninsula, ceded to the British crown under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. It wants to ensure that future EU talks with the UK do not cover Gibraltar. ""As things stand today if there are no changes regarding Gibraltar, Spain will vote no on Brexit,"" said Mr Sánchez. Throughout the Brexit negotiations, Spain - along with Ireland and Cyprus - has conducted separate talks with the UK about specific border issues.  On Monday Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said that the draft Brexit deal had failed to make clear that talks on Gibraltar were ""separate negotiations"" and not part of future talks between the UK and EU. Mr Sánchez added his weight to those remarks on Tuesday at a forum in Madrid, emphasising that any future negotiations on Gibraltar had to be bilateral. ""As a country we cannot assume that whatever happens in the future with Gibraltar would be negotiated by the UK and EU - it will have to be negotiated between Spain and the UK,"" he said. Article 184 of the draft Brexit deal says the EU and the UK will seek to ""negotiate rapidly the agreements governing their future relationship"" between the official day of withdrawal on 29 March 2019 and the end of a transition period in December 2020. But Spain believes the article in question is ambiguous and wants to ensure that this does not apply to the future of Gibraltar. It insists on its future right to discuss the status of the peninsula bilaterally with the UK, and is seeking clarity that this draft deal will allow it to do so.  Asked about the Spanish objection to Article 184, a European Commission spokesman said they were aware of Spain's concerns. He said the EU's position on Gibraltar had been made clear in April 2017 guidelines, that after Brexit no agreement between the EU and UK could apply to Gibraltar without the agreement of the UK and Spain. Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo accused Spain of adopting a ""well-known tactic"" of raising issues at the last minute. He said Spain's position ""does little to build mutual confidence and trust going forward"".  A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Theresa May said the draft deal covered Gibraltar as well as ""the other overseas territories and the crown dependencies"". ""We will get a deal that works for the whole UK family."" By Gavin Lee, Europe reporter Spain and Britain have been running parallel negotiations over the future of Gibraltar, alongside the main EU-UK Brexit negotiations. Those talks have led to a ""protocol"" being agreed and three Spanish-British committees being set up to tackle tobacco smuggling, oversee cross-border workers rights, and co-operate on environmental protection and border control.  There seemed to be no drama on the horizon and the Spanish prime minister told me a few weeks ago he had ""no significant concerns over Gibraltar"", that the ""behaviour of the British government was good"" and an agreement could be reached. So what has changed?  The Spanish government says that its ""bone of contention"" is with one specific article in the draft Withdrawal Agreement that was only added last week, just before it was signed off by the European Commission, and wasn't seen by Spanish negotiators.   A senior Spanish diplomat told me that Spain wanted the following words (or similar) added to Article 184: ""This does not apply to Gibraltar, which will be subject to bilateral talks between the UK and Spain."" Underlying all of this is the fact that Spain still disputes that Gibraltar as a British overseas territory. Spanish officials refer to the rock as a ""British colony"" and, although the Spanish government isn't seeking to use the Brexit talks to push that claim, it is making it clear that any decision over the future of Gibraltar can only happen with the approval of Madrid. Though Spain ceded the peninsula under the 1713 treaty, it has tried several times to regain control over it. A referendum in the territory in 1967 saw 99.6% of residents vote to remain British. A proposal for joint sovereignty was also decisively rejected by Gibraltarians in a 2002 vote. Spain closed its border with Gibraltar after the 1967 vote and did not fully reopen it until 1985, the year before Spain joined the European Economic Community - the forerunner of the EU.

economic indicators,Italian PM Draghi resigns after week of turmoil,2024-09-15,2022-07-21,By Paul Kirby,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62249050,"A year-and-a-half after he was appointed as Italy's unelected head of a unity government, Mario Draghi has resigned as prime minister. He told President Sergio Mattarella he was standing down after three parties in his government refused to back him in a confidence vote the night before. The president asked him to remain as caretaker leader and early elections will take place this autumn. Far-right leader Giorgia Meloni is already being tipped to win. Mr Draghi, 74, was a popular choice as prime minister, dubbed Super Mario for his handling of the eurozone crisis as head of the European Central Bank. In February last year, he was given the task of guiding Italy through the Covid pandemic and economic recovery, bolstered by a big EU package conditional on major reforms. Before heading to the presidential palace, the Quirinale, Mr Draghi was given a round of applause in the lower house of parliament. ""Even central bankers have their hearts touched sometimes. Thank you for all the work done in this period,"" he told MPs. He first tendered his resignation a week ago when a populist party in his broad-based government refused to back an economic package for businesses and families. President Mattarella had asked him to stay in the post and, after days of silence, Mr Draghi told the upper house of parliament he would continue - if the political parties were prepared to back a strong, cohesive government: ""Are the parties and you parliamentarians ready to rebuild this pact?"" For several hours, Italians waited with bated breath for the answer, before three of the parties decided they would not back him in a vote of confidence.  The Milan stock market fell for the second day in a row. Another key indicator closely watched in Italy, called the spread, soared 9%: that is the gap between Italian and German 10-year bonds.  President Mattarella said the government would remain in office to handle current affairs, and then dissolved both houses of parliament. Elections were due to take place in the first half of 2023, but will now take place on 25 September. The parties set to benefit most from the political crisis include the far-right League and centre-right Forza Italia and both snubbed Mr Draghi in Wednesday night's crunch vote. However, it is the far-right Brothers of Italy (FdI) party that is topping the opinion polls, and leader Giorgia Meloni is viewed as a possible prime minister. She was not part of the unity government and has repeatedly called for snap elections over the past week. ""I have my own ideas on how this nation should be governed, what should be done, what its industrial strategy should be,"" she said. Italy's political turmoil has also divided leading figures in some of the parties. Two ministers from Forza Italia, Renato Brunetta and Mariastella Gelmini, have quit the party in protest at the decision to snub Mr Draghi. The populist Five Star movement which triggered the crisis last week also saw a defection. Soave Alemanno said she no longer recognised her party and the instability now facing Italy jeopardised EU funding and abandoned reforms."
economic indicators,Sturgeon: Wellbeing as important as economic growth,2024-09-15,2020-01-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-51200821,"People's quality of life should be as important as economic growth, according to Scotland's first minister.  In a speech later Nicola Sturgeon will say that Scotland is ""redefining"" what it means to be a successful nation.  She will tell a conference that Scotland is creating an economy where ""collective wellbeing"" is as fundamental as GDP. GDP, a measure of goods and services, has been criticised for undervaluing quality of life. Ms Sturgeon's speech comes after Scotland fell five places in an index of social and economic wellbeing in developed countries. The Scottish Trends Index Of Social and Economic Wellbeing uses data based on a range of measures including income, education, longevity and inclusivity. It has placed Scotland in the bottom half of 32 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Last year Ms Sturgeon joined with other leaders to promote a ""wellbeing"" agenda. Iceland's prime minister, Katrin Jakobsdottir, and the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, joined Ms Sturgeon in calling for new social indicators to be considered beside traditional GDP data. Ms Sturgeon will tell the Wellbeing Economy Alliance conference in Edinburgh later that Scotland will take centre stage on the issue. It will host a number of events to promote a ""global wellbeing economy"", including a meeting of the Wellbeing Economy Governments (WeGo) - Scotland, Iceland and New Zealand - at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.  ""The goal and objective of all economic policy should be collective wellbeing. This broader approach is at the very heart of our economic strategy which gives equal importance to tackling inequality as economic competitiveness,"" the first minister is expected to tell the conference.  ""It is why we are so committed to fair work and making sure that work is fulfilling and well paid and why we are acting to ensure a just transition to a carbon zero economy where no one is left behind."" Scotland has fallen five places from 16th to joint 21st on the latest Scottish Trends Index Of Social and Economic Wellbeing. The study uses OECD data from 2006 to 2018 based on a range of measures including: Scotland and Wales experienced the joint biggest falls over that 12-year period. The report said this was mainly due to falling GDP and education scores in Scotland. Greece and Finland also dropped down the rankings, while the biggest rises were credited to Estonia and Poland. The first minister has previously made a similar plea for modern economies to put more resources into mental health, childcare and parental leave, and green energy in her TED talk.  Other events to be held in Scotland this year to promote a wellbeing economy include: "
economic indicators,Fashion trucks: Style on the move,2024-09-15,2014-10-21,Joanne Griffith,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20140617-fashion-trucks-style-on-the-move,"Mobile boutiques are all the rage in southern California – and they’re spreading across the US. Joanne Griffith takes a closer look at the phenomenon. Take a clapped out, almost fit-for-scrap van. Scrub the insides well.  Add some shelves, good lighting, hardwood floors and a brightly coloured exterior. Now you have the makings of one of the hottest new trends in Los Angeles: the fashion truck.  The concept is simple – a mobile boutique that delivers style to the masses wherever they congregate: on the roadside, at craft fairs, art walks and farmers' markets. Their unofficial motto?  Have truck, will travel. For the sartorially conscious Angeleno, anything that increases the opportunity to enjoy a spot of retail therapy without sitting in nose-to-bumper traffic is most welcome. Recycling old vehicles for mobile business use is nothing new in southern California. Food trucks have graced the streets of the City of Angels for over five years, serving fusion dishes such as Korean BBQ tacos, Japanese fried chicken and bacon infused waffles served with ice cream. Not surprisingly, food trucks have provided the inspiration for many store-on-wheels owners, including Stace Steffe, co-founder of LA's first mobile boutique, Le Fashion Truck. For a number of years Steffe sold vintage bags at craft fairs and had investigated the possibility of opening her own store when she spotted a food truck at an event. ""It arrived and people just lined up, really excited about being part of this new movement. I was looking for an easier, fun, more creative way of doing business and could see how going mobile could work just as well for fashion."" Steffe and her business partner, Jeanine Romo opened the door to their mobile business in January 2011. Now, almost thirty fashion trucks operate in Los Angeles. It is, says Steffe, a very female oriented affair. ""Around 95% of mobile boutiques in southern California are run by women, selling women's clothes."" Heels on wheels LA is not alone in the expansion of the fashion truck movement. There are now over 300 mobile stores across the United States. This led Steffe to create the American Mobile Retailers Association, a trade body that offers training and advice to would-be truck entrepreneurs.    This growth has caught the attention of veterans in the style trade. ""Fashion trucks are changing the way retailers think about their business"" says Ilse Metchek, president of the California Fashion Association. ""Trucks won't replace brick and mortar stores but they have a strong following in the fast fashion crowd. If you're looking for high-end designers, you won't find them in trucks, but anything that encourages people to try new trends is a good thing."" But getting into the fashion truck business isn't cheap. Updating a commercial truck and launching a mobile venture can cost between $20,000 and $30,000. This includes the cost of inventory, truck and liability insurance, refurbishment and licensing. Even with an initial budget running into the thousands, opening a mobile store is still cheaper than renting space in a shopping mall, which could cost as much as $10,000 per month. Some new truck owners have successfully cut costs, like Monique Cruz, owner of Selvedge Dry Goods, an eco-friendly fashion truck based in Los Angeles. ""I bought my truck from a man in the desert, so it was full of oil and sand. Once it was clean, friends helped to install shelves, flooring, lights and a fitting area. The total start-up cost was $10,000. Little girls love it. They want to live in my truck!"" With a background in children's clothing design and merchandising, Cruz has been able to tackle one of the biggest obstacles to running a successful truck retail business –marketing. With no fixed abode, mobile retailers rely on social media, blog posts and word of mouth to let customers know where they will be on any given day, a challenge in a city where finding a parking spot is the equivalent of winning the lottery. Stopping traffic ""Facebook and Twitter are integral to our business, but we've also made it inviting for walk-in customers. I set out a 'Welcome' sign, along with a few items to let passersby know it's safe to come in, especially men with their wives or girlfriends. But our brightly coloured exterior is one of the best marketing tools we have."" says Cruz. Bright, over the top and so eye-catching, the truck designs are so distinctive you may find yourself admiring the outside of the vehicle rather than stepping inside to peruse the merchandise. ""Wherever you are, you have to be seen. Your truck is your brand, and you have to stand out from the crowd"" says Jordana Fortaleza, co-founder of JD Luxe. Created in 2011, the JD Luxe team started with a bright yellow 1976 electric truck, then upgraded to a tomato red wrapper before settling on a crisp white design complete with a palm tree decal and neon pink writing. There's no way you can miss the 20ft truck. Like any new trend, the fashion truck has its downfalls. Older vehicles can be tempermental and often break down. ""I worry every time we head to an event that's a long way from home,"" says Monique Cruz. ""If you break down in an unknown area, it can be really hard to get out. And expensive."" There's also the issue of permits, parking and staying on the right side of the law. In some parts of southern California, there are no regulations in place for fashion trucks. ""It's all so new,"" says Stace Steffe from Le Fashion Truck. ""Officials at City Hall in Los Angeles recently admitted they'd never heard of fashion trucks, nor did they know so many were on LA's streets. So for now, in some parts of Los Angeles, trucks are restricted to private events and parking lots. This really changes how we do business."" In other areas such as Santa Monica fashion truckers are welcome to trade from the street, but they have to abide by parking regulations, feed the voracious meter and make sure they get a peddler’s permit. ""I love the quirkiness of the fashion trucks and it feels a lot more personal than going to a traditional store,"" says shopper Pamela Dickson. ""I thought the trucks would be cramped inside, but there were around four of us in there, and it was fine – even a space to try stuff on."" So, fashion trucks are a hit with customers, they provide flexibility for owners and even celebrities are intrigued by their existence. But is the fashion truck a movement? Or a moment? ""Fashion trucks are here to stay"" says Ilse Metchek from the California Fashion Association. ""I see it more as a stepping stone to a brick and mortar store for many entrepreneurs, but there are some who are making a viable business out of being strictly mobile. It will be interesting to see how the movement evolves."" The appeal of the fashion truck is evident among three groups of entrepreneurs: first-time business owners; traders who lost their stores due to the economic downturn and are now reinventing their brand; and traditional brick and mortar operations who now use fashion trucks for promotional purposes. ""Every day I get calls and emails from around the world asking, ‘How do I start a fashion truck business?’"" says Stace Steffe from Le Fashion Truck. ""If the number of enquiries we receive everyday is an indicator of interest in this form of running a business, then the fashion truck movement will only continue to grow."" So, if you're thinking of going mobile with your business, just remember it's not for the faint hearted. ""Do it!"" says Monique Cruz. ""Just find a good truck. And a great mechanic!""

economic indicators,The secret behind successful countries,2024-09-15,2018-01-12,Amanda Ruggeri,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180111-how-can-you-measure-what-makes-a-country-great,"More than mere “best country” rankings, data aggregations like the Social Progress Index shape policy, help allocate funding – and even help predict the future For almost a hundred years, two measurements have been used to get a sense of how well a country is doing. One is GDP, or gross domestic product, the amount a country earns. The other is its unemployment rate. But when it comes to figuring out how well a country is serving its citizens, these tools might not only be incomplete: they may not in fact be that helpful at all. On estimates of social progress, for example – which measures aspects like access to education, food and affordable housing – poorer countries often outdo their wealthier counterparts. “Broadly, richer countries have higher social progress, so getting more economic growth is not a bad idea,” says Michael Green, CEO of the Social Progress Index. “But what we also find, very clearly, is that social progress is not completely explained by economic variables. GDP is not destiny.” The Social Progress Index is one of a number of indexes that aggregate data about countries worldwide – and about how well those countries are serving their populations. If we come across them at all, we usually see them being used for the kinds of country rankings that make us daydream about a move to Denmark or New Zealand. Behind the scenes, though, this kind of information is used for much more. It can show surprising relationships that help shape policy. It can determine which countries get help with funding. And it may even be able to help predict the future. One of the interesting ways these kinds of indexes are used is to see how countries have improved or declined – or just stayed the same. There are some who argue the US government is less effective than ever, for example; the US public has lower levels of trust in government since almost any time since 1958. But the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) show that levels of government effectiveness have remained roughly the same every year since 1996. (The measurement analyses outcomes like the condition of highways, primary school quality and the amount of red tape). Other countries have moved a fair amount. Tunisia, for example, saw a steady decline in voice and accountability, which measures aspects like confidence in elections and freedom of the press, from 1996 to 2010. Then the Arab Spring happened. In 2011, Tunisia jumped from the 9th percentile to the 36th and has grown steadily since then; in 2016, it was on par with Hungary at the 57th percentile. For the most part, though, it’s very difficult to move from a very low position to a very high one. Aart Kraay, a World Bank economist who works on the WGI, points to one recent assessment. “One of the things that tells us is that once good governance is established, it tends to be very, very persistent,” Kraay says. “But it’s very hard to get there.” Cash limit One way that doesn’t work, at least on its own, is wealth. The US is one example. Although it is one of the index’s top-five countries in terms of GDP per capita, it ranks 18th in social progress – closer to Estonia than to Canada. Similarly, the Netherlands has a similar GDP to Saudi Arabia; so do Chile and Kazakhstan and the Philippines and Angola. But the Netherlands, Chile and the Philippines far out-perform their peers. When it applied the Social Progress Index framework, the European Union found the same pattern. Its highest-performing region was Upper Norrland, Sweden – which has the same GDP per capita as Bucharest, Romania, but scored far higher. Interestingly, the EU data also showed no relationship between social progress and the unemployment rate. You’d expect that getting a job improves people’s lives. But while the UK’s unemployment rate is at historically low levels, for example, its social progress has flat-lined. “We’ve got traditional measures of how society is doing, and one we’ve relied on for the last 80 years is the unemployment rate,” Green says. “But that may not be telling us the real story about the quality of life of citizens in the way it was 20 years ago because of the changing nature of work.” A zero-hours contract, for example, may be ‘employment’, but it may not be very good at building social progress. On the other hand, there’s Costa Rica. “Costa Rica is a country that is no different to the rest of Latin America. It’s a relatively modest income country,” says Juan Botero, executive director of the World Justice Project. “And yet it has had, for the last 40 or 50 years, very strong institutions. And you see all of the social outcomes in Costa Rica tend to outperform their neighbours: it is a more peaceful, more prosperous society.” So if wealth alone can’t account for how well a country serves its citizens, what can? Botero works on the World Justice Project’s Rule of Law index, which examines ‘rule of law fundamentals’ like government accountability, the protection of human rights and fair legal processes. He’s turned up at least one correlation. “The vast majority of the literature says that for health outcomes, the main social determination is wealth,” Botero says. “We found that the rule of law is a predictor of health outcomes, but it is independent of wealth. The higher the rule of law, the more likely the country, at any level of development, will have high health outcomes in maternal mortality rate, life expectancy, catastrophic diseases – all these standard public health outcomes.” That’s not to say that wealth doesn’t matter. The top performers generally tend to be rich countries. But not all wealthy countries do well, which has led some experts to think that while economic growth doesn’t always serve its citizens, focusing on institutions and other aspects that serve citizens helps economic growth. “When you are wealthier, you can afford better pay for the police officers,” Botero points out. “On the other hand, with a robust legal system, less crime is likely to happen. And so a country becomes more wealthy.” Global effects Given the information these kinds of indexes provide, it’s no surprise that they’re being used in a number of ways. The EU is using the Social Progress Index to help inform policy. Even companies are taking them up: the Disney Corporation, for example, is using the World Bank’s WGI to help decide which countries it will use to manufacture its products. They also can be used to determine how much assistance countries get. The US’s Millennium Challenge Corporation, for example, has invested $11bn (£8.1bn) in financial assistance since it was created in 2004. One of the main criteria for a project’s eligibility? The country’s performance in areas like control of corruption, rule of law or government effectiveness, with data drawn from indexes including the Rule of Law and World Bank. But that can be controversial. The concept of ‘good governance’, which many of these types of indexes try to measure, was developed initially by international financial institutions, says University of Alberta international law professor Linda Reif. Donor countries, like the US, then took it up as a new set of criteria for giving development assistance. “So then one of the criticisms is that this has, to an extent, been imposed on the global south,” she says. “Some scholars… say that the ‘good governance’ approach can be traced back to the colonial structure of the world that also created international law.” Critics also point out that many of the criteria are based on Western values: tolerance for homosexuals, for example, or religious tolerance. Another debate is over how relevant many of the indicators are for half of the world’s population: women. Researchers found, for example, that in all countries except the wealthiest, there was no correlation between rule of law and the status of women. If a country is said to have strong legal systems that ensure fairness and equality, but half of its population still doesn’t have the same access to work, education or healthcare as men, you could argue the measurements are flawed – or at least incomplete. That adds more reason to be cautious with these kinds of indexes, experts say. Depending on who you are, you might experience a very different version of the country than its top-line data. See the future Despite the criticisms, these kinds of indexes make for a good starting point. One of the biggest reasons they’re interesting is that they can point out underlying trends, some of which, left unchecked, may have serious consequences. Tunisia was one example. If you were tracking the decline in its voice and accountability measurement, you wouldn’t be that surprised that one action – a fruit-seller setting himself on fire in protest after being abused by local officials – could set off the chain of events dubbed the Arab Spring. Venezuela is another. Despite much being wealthier than its neighbours in the past, today, it is in severe crisis. Among other sets of data, that could have been predicted by its commitment to the rule of law, says Botero. “Venezuela has been the last in the Rule of Law ranking for several years, even when the government has preserved the appearance of rule of law. Now it seems they have simply abandoned any constraint and the situation is unravelling,” he says. “These fundamentals tend to predict the future.” The reverse can be true, too. Botero points to the US. “The Republicans have both the House and Senate, and in a low-rule-of-law society, the government would be able to do whatever it wanted. That’s not the case in the United States,” he says. “Even priorities which are the stated priorities of the party in power have not been passing, because there are multiple checks on their power. So for the US, it is a story of success – so far.” So what can make for these strong underpinnings – the kind that help make a country stable, safe, fair and provide its citizens with a good quality of life? The main factors seem to be two. Whether it’s social progress or overall quality of governance that a country is after, the important things seem to be the level of commitment to those institutions… and the amount of time it’s had them. “We measure outcomes, not inputs: you can’t change your social progress just by changing the law or spending a bit of money. So a long-term commitment to social progress seems to be one factor” of success, Green says. Similarly, Botero points out, countries that have developed robust government institutions over a long period of time – like the US or UK – have been in less danger of losing those protections. If you’re looking for what makes a country great, it seems, don’t look at its GDP or unemployment rate. Look at its commitment to its citizens – and how long it’s stuck to that commitment for.

economic indicators,The archaeology of inequality,2024-09-15,2022-05-23,Carles Lalueza-Fox,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220520-why-some-ancient-societies-were-more-unequal-than-others,"Inequality affected some ancient societies, but not all. Changes in farming – and the animals used in it – might have been a factor which caused it to spiral. 26 November 1922 marks what is arguably the most famous discovery in the history of archaeology. On that day, the British Egyptologist Howard Carter made a small hole through which he could insert a candle in the sealed doorway of Tutankhamun's burial chamber and thus lit the interior. As his eyes slowly adapted to the darkness, he was able to make out a chamber that had not been disturbed for over 3,000 years. Tutankhamun was just an obscure pharaoh during his lifetime, and there is evidence that he was hastily buried – the second of the three nested coffins seems to have originally belonged to someone else. And yet the inner coffin, in which his mummy was discovered, is made of solid gold, weighing almost 250lbs (113kg). One can barely imagine how impressive the burials of such powerful leaders as Khufu, Thutmose III, or Rameses II must have been. Alas, they were all looted in antiquity. But contrary to popular belief and cinematic glorification, most archaeologists would say that the search for spectacular treasures isn't their main research objective. They want to understand the daily life of past civilisations. Still, both extremes – the fabulous wealth of kings and the hardscrabble existence of common people – contribute to an understanding of what can be argued is one of the main goals of archaeology: to document and study the evolution of inequality in ancient societies. This also involves the question of how to recognise and quantify it. One of the most obvious approaches would be through the assessment of differential goods deposited in graves. But richly furnished graves may not simply be evidence of social differentiation; rather, they may be an attempt to demonstrate the importance and distinction of a family in relationship to other kindreds – a social importance that may not exist in reality. Moreover, social stratification can be based on wealth but can also be based on personal prestige and power. Therefore, it isn't always possible to assess social differences by comparing graves with goods to those without them. Some archaeologists have attempted to apply economic principles to examine social differences at specific sites and, crucially, compare the data from different places. A study led by Samuel Bowles from the Santa Fe Institute and published in Nature in 2017 tried to address this question by applying the Gini coefficient – a single number most commonly used to measure income inequality – across a large number of sites from the archaeological record, both in the Old World and the Americas. You might also like: The list of sites included paradigmatic cities such as Çatalhöyük in Turkey, Pompeii in Italy, and Teotihuacan in Mexico – the authors measured the dimensions of houses as estimated indicators of wealth. Among modern hunter-gatherers, the team found, the Gini coefficient is low – around 17 (on a scale of 0 to 100). This is not surprising as few objects can be carried in nomadic societies, and consequently, personal qualities such as the ability to hunt count for more. This does not mean that some people didn't have a higher social status; material culture was probably so poor – or so different from our perceptions of status – that it is difficult to grasp social differences among past hunter-gatherers. In the ancient farming societies under study the Gini coefficients are estimated to have been between 35 and 46. Interestingly, the real measurements were lower than those obtained from records. For instance, among the ruins of Babylonia, researchers estimated a coefficient of 40, yet an estimate based on information from the Babylonian chronicles resulted in a higher coefficient of 46. The ancient accounts likely overemphasised the size of the largest houses in admiration. This is not unlike what happens when we return from a trip: we sometimes tend to exaggerate the things that we've seen. Nevertheless, the most remarkable differences come from the comparison of the societies of the Old World and those of the Americas, with the latter being much more equal in the Gini coefficient, despite being highly hierarchical in some cases such as the mighty Aztec Empire. Researchers conclude that the root of these differences could be ecological, since there were more and larger animals to be domesticated in Eurasia – such as cows, horses, pigs, sheep, and goats – than in the Americas, with only dogs and turkeys, and this trait alone created a differential system of accumulated wealth. At the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlán, for instance, houses had highly standardised dimensions and were all quite similar. Aztec society, even with its horrific human sacrifices, was at the time of the Spanish Conquest more egalitarian than Mexico 200 years later, when the European elite had created the encomienda system, under which the indigenous population worked in semi-slavery. Within a few generations, the concentration of wealth had almost doubled in the colonial New World, with a consequent increase in inequality. When did these differences between the Old and New Worlds emerge? Early farming societies had the possibility of generating and storing food surpluses, creating potential scenarios for differences in population size along with a certain degree of inter- and intrasettlement inequality. A recent application of the Gini coefficient to 90 sites from the Near East and Europe showed a remarkable increase of inequality thousands of years after the advent of agriculture – a finding that would indicate it was not farming per se that created unequal societies. According to the authors, at some point some farmers were able to maintain specialised plough oxen that could cultivate 10 times more land than other farmers, thereby transforming the economy toward a higher value of land in detriment of human labour. This emerging inequality at the end of the Neolithic could explain a remarkable example of wealth dating from that period: the Varna burial. This burial was found in a Copper Age cemetery in modern Bulgaria and is dated to 4560–4450BC. It contained more gold than the rest of the world possessed at that time. With it were the remains of an adult male – likely a chieftain or king of some sort – who was buried holding a gold war mace. Curiously, he also had a gold penis sheath of unknown meaning. Still, such findings are exceptional, and there is a general consensus that Neolithic societies were more egalitarian than later ones. Inequality clearly increased with the arrival of metals, which partly allowed, from 3000 to 2000BC onward, the appearance and development of a social organisation based on the emergence of elites. Once the initial power structure was established, it attempted to perpetuate itself dynastically by increasing social control and building up familial alliances with other chiefs.  Control mechanisms often involved violence. The possibility of using horses – and to lesser extent, camels – as instruments of war determined the success of conquests that would alter the pattern of settlements across Eurasia at the end of the Neolithic. This would at least partially explain how 30 empires or large states that emerged between 3000 and 600BC were all found in the Old World, where these animals roamed. Consequently, tombs with signs of wealth became more abundant in the archaeological record, such as the famous Amesbury Archer, found three miles southeast of Stonehenge in 2002 (near today's Salisbury) and dated to 2300BC. This grave includes more artifacts than any other Bronze Age British burial. Besides numerous arrowheads, three copper knives, four boar's tusks, two stone wrist guards that protected users from their bowstrings, and five pots that conformed to the Bell Beaker tradition, there were two gold hair ornaments – the earliest pieces made of this metal ever found in the British Isles.  The arrival of the Bell Beaker complex to the British Isles is associated with an almost complete replacement of the prior local population and subsequent emergence of social elites. The rise in inequality during this period, both in the Middle East and parts of western Europe, seems to be partly influenced by an increase in population density. This correlation is likely related to a growing complexity in modes of subsistence, trading networks, and political organisation associated with population growth. Although the highest Gini coefficients for past societies determined by the Santa Fe Institute were similar to those found in some present-day European countries (for instance, with values of around 60 in Pompeii and Kahun, an Egyptian settlement from the 12th Dynasty), they remained below the values for the most unequal modern societies such as China and the United States (with Gini coefficients of 73 and 85, respectively), which obviously have larger populations. From a historical perspective this would suggest that an increase in population size brings higher inequality – an issue explored by the economist Thomas Piketty in recent times, but that likely has parallels in Bronze Age populations. Still, the Gini coefficient cannot always be applied since some settlements have grown with time over the destruction of previous ones, piled one atop another like the layers of a cake. Many ancient sites could not possibly be studied in detail. For instance, at Hisarlik – the old Troy – at least 10 cities arose atop their predecessors in just 2,000 years, making them quite difficult to disentangle. In addition to this limitation, whether the Gini coefficient can be transferred between different cultural, geographic, and ecological environments to make direct comparisons has also been a subject of debate since such factors can influence their inhabitants differently. For example, a settlement established in a jagged terrain would favour smaller, more vertical houses than one extending over a vast plain. The economic interpretation of past settlements has received some criticism from among the archaeological community. Some argue that the quality and solidity of the building materials can be as important as the size of the houses. In our modern cities, we're all aware that location – for instance, close to the city centre – is usually more important than size. Finally, the ostentatious wealth – opulent furniture, wall paintings, mosaics, and so on – that can still be found in some excavated houses such as at Pompeii should be taken into consideration too, though such features aren't usually well preserved. One way around these limitations might be to compare the Gini coefficients with the so-called health inequality of each population, since buried human remains are sometimes better preserved than buildings. There are several skeletal indicators (dental cavities, arthrosis, traumas, vitamin deficiencies, etc) that can reflect the health status of the population in each period. The frequencies of these pathological markers are in general higher during periods of higher inequality. For example, the 2006–2013 excavation of cemeteries such as North Tombs Cemeteries at Amarna (an Ancient Egyptian site dating from 1346BC) demonstrated deaths at an early age – mainly of children, teenagers, and young adults – widespread dietary deficiencies, and indications of hard labour, suggesting the poor state of health and substandard working conditions for most of this urban community. For instance, 16% of all children under 15-years-old displayed spine injuries of the sort associated with carrying heavy loads; none of them had any grave goods, and sometimes were buried together with several others, with scant regard for the disposition of the bodies – a grim image that contrasts with the glamorous depictions of the pharaoh's family in the Amarna style. An additional indicator would be evidence of a high infant mortality rate, although the preservation of children's skeletal remains is invariably more difficult than that of adult bones due to differential conservation processes, and this could represent an insurmountable bias in the results. Changes in health status can be used to ascertain cultural and ancestral transitions too. In this sense, probably the most striking change observed is between hunter-gatherers and the first farmers in Europe. The latter not only show signs of poorer health – such as cavities, almost unknown by the former – but also higher infant mortality rates and even lower stature than previous hunter-gatherers. Correlated with this information, recent developments in the stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen ratios in bone collagen can provide information on nutritional status and mobility patterns associated with specific individuals. For instance, the analysis of a high-status burial in Helmsdorf, Germany, related to the Únêtice culture, showed that this person had a higher protein intake than other contemporaneous peers, suggesting as well that diet can be as much an indicator of social status as it is in today's societies. Key to understanding the social panorama of the past is that ancient cemeteries can provide not only potential indicators of inequality in the form of grave goods and even differential health status but also genetic material preserved within human remains. The information retrieved from their DNA can be used, for the first time, to correlate ancestry with social power in each period. Furthermore, a crucial aspect of the accumulation of power is the possibility of bequeathing wealth to biological relatives – something that can be tested as well via the interface between genetics and archaeology, which enables us to reveal family links. Like funerary goods, a privileged resting place could serve as a status marker too. Around 6,500 years ago, the phenomenon of building large funerary stone structures – known as megalithic tombs – emerged, mainly across Europe's Atlantic seaboard, and culminated in the great passage tomb complexes such as Newgrange in Boyne Valley (Ireland), which has a mound almost 300ft (91m) in diameter and 50ft (15m). The origins and meaning of these monuments, which required a heavy investment in labour, have been debated for more than a century, as has the social organisation of the farming communities that built them. The genetic analysis of two-dozen individuals found in various megalithic tombs from Scandinavia to Orkney Island and Ireland yielded some interesting social clues. In some places, notably the British Isles, more males than females were buried in these preeminent spots, pointing to a sex bias. In accordance with this observation, the descent of most individuals with kinship links could be traced through the paternal line. In one case it was possible to find two related males buried in two different megaliths just over a mile apart (Primrose Grange and Carrowmore in Ireland), indicating a geographic expansion of these dominant families. Genetic analyses of skeletal remains discovered within the most intricately constructed chamber of the Newgrange passage tomb revealed that they belonged to the incestuous son of a brother and sister (or a parent and child), and therefore a quarter of his genome had no genetic variation. This kind of first-degree offspring is extraordinary, only having been cited in royal families of the past headed by god-kings such as the Egyptian pharaohs seeking to maintain a pure dynastic bloodline. (It is known, for instance, that Akhenaten married his eldest daughter, Meritaten, and much later, Ptolemy II married his sister, Arsinoe II – hence his nickname, ""Philadelphus"" or ""sibling loving."") It has been suggested that this Neolithic elite may have claimed to possess divine powers to ensure the continuity of agricultural cycles by keeping the Sun's movements going. The findings support the notion that these Neolithic communities were socially stratified and that the massive stone structures were used to bury transgenerational patrilineal members of these clans. Perhaps equally interesting is the fact that in one case relatives were separated by up to 12 generations, pointing to an unusual stability through time of both the funerary tradition and the stratified society where they lived. We have seen several case studies of past inequality correlating funerary archaeology with genetics that might no longer apply today, where legal regulations (and also the exponential increase of cremations) represent a certain degree of standardisation in funeral practices. Nevertheless, an opposite trend could shape the future of the archaeology of death: the trend toward personalised coffins, unconventional funerary memorials, and special grave goods. One way or another, mortuary archaeology will always be an important subfield of this discipline, and one that will need to rely on the hard sciences such as genetics and forensics. Perhaps one encouraging conclusion is that despite what we have seen on the archaeology of past inequality, societies have been able to evolve and change their social stratifications. One example is Iceland – the country has become one of the most egalitarian societies in the world. In 2018, Iceland passed a law that all companies employing more than 25 people will have four years to ensure gender-equal payment because, according to the head of the Equality Unit at Iceland's Welfare Ministry, ""equality won't come about by itself, from the bottom up alone"". * This is an edited version of an article that originally appeared in The MIT Press Reader, and is republished with permission. -- Carles Lalueza-Fox is Research Professor and Director of the Paleogenomics Lab at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (CSIC-Universitat Pompeu Fabra) in Barcelona.

economic indicators,The benefits of getting older,2024-09-15,2015-10-29,Zaria Gorvett,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151028-the-benefits-of-getting-older,"Most of us dread getting older. But there’s mounting evidence that old age brings happiness, intellect and even better sex. “Growing old is great – when you consider the alternative,” as the saying goes. Welcome to the age of ageing. With more than 800 million people over 60 and more centenarians than the population of Iceland (that’s about 329,000), the world is having to brace itself for the economic – and social – consequences. From a deluge of diseases to sagging skin and  the dulling of the senses, old age is beset with creeping failures, medical interventions, and low expectations. But can there be a silver lining for those joining the grey brigade? Growing old has been synonymous with bodily decay since ancient times. The Greeks had a particularly dire view – many saw ageing itself as a disease. Yet the latest scientific research suggests ageing isn’t a straightforward decline after all. As BBC Future has reported before, life peaks later than you might think. When does old age begin? The poet Dante believed old age started at 45. A survey of the British public concluded that it starts at 59 – the older the respondent, the greater the number of years they considered old. But the United Nations and most scientists define it as any age after 60. Fewer colds It’s not just the brain that gets wiser with age. The human immune system encounters millions of potential dangers every day. As the body’s police force, it needs to learn to spot the dangers. For this, we produce unique white blood cells which are tailored to the molecular appearances of millions of different invaders. When they recognise a foe they stick around, forming an ‘immune memory’. The next time it turns up, they help to rally a rapid response. John Upham from the University of Queensland says this memory can last a long time. “People who have gone through various epidemics, their immune systems can remember the virus for 40 or 50 years in some cases. It does begin to drop off in your 70s or 80s, but there’s a bit of a sweet spot for people – particularly from your 40s through to your late 60s and early 70s – where the immune system remembers the viruses experienced over the years.” This cumulative protection translates into fewer colds. While 20-year olds can expect to catch two or three in a year, over 50s average only one or two. Other immune defences however, tend to weaken with age. The body produces fewer new white blood cells, and they become sluggish. Aged immune systems also produce less antibodies – proteins which stick to pathogens to help identify and eliminate them. But what if this could be life-saving? Outliving outbreaks  The 1918 flu pandemic was the deadliest in human history, killing 50 million people. But it was most lethal for those usually thought of as fit and strong, aged from 20 to 40. The 2009 swine flu outbreak followed the same bizarre pattern, with most fatalities in those under the age of 65. It’s thought that the viruses caused their victims’ immune systems to overreact. Those with the most vigorous immune systems launched the most dramatic, and damaging, responses, in what’s known as a ‘cytokine storm’. A healthy immune response relies on positive feedback – when a pathogen is found, the surrounding tissues release chemical messages, called cytokines, asking for help. As cells arrive on site, they are encouraged to release the chemicals too, encouraging even more cells to arrive. But sometimes the loop gets out of control, killing healthy cells and leading to potentially fatal inflammation. It’s not yet known what triggers the storms, but ongoing research has inspired a new treatment for the flu which acts on the cytokine storm instead of the virus itself. Declining allergies  And there’s good news for those with allergies, too. While the ultimate causes of allergies are still hotly debated, all are mediated by antibodies. The main culprit is Immunoglobulin E and like all other antibodies, its production diminishes with age. Mitchell Grayson from the Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin says the older you get, the less severe the symptoms are likely to be. “Allergic disease peaks in childhood and then seems to decrease throughout late adolescence and into their 20s. In the 30s there is another resurgence until people get into their 50s and 60s when the symptoms tend to get less common.” Cleverer  There’s no shortage of slang terms to describe the destructive effects of ageing on the brain. Yet in a number of vitally important abilities, older brains  actually turn out to be smarter. Michael Ramscar from Tubingen University says we have misunderstood how the brain ages. “The number of neurons in the human brain peaks at around 28 weeks after birth, but as many as half of the neurons produced die by the end of adolescence. Since we don’t usually think of the period from birth to age 18 as one of hideous decline, it seems safe to conclude that brain size as measured in neuronal numbers is not much of an indicator of anything.” The Seattle Longitudinal Study has followed the mental abilities of 6,000 people since 1956. It’s the longest-running study of its kind, with the same volunteers tested every seven years. While older volunteers aren’t as good at maths and are slower to respond to commands, for vocabulary, spatial orientation, verbal memory, and problem solving abilities, they were better in their late 40s and 50s than they were in their 20s. Gary Small, who studies geriatric psychiatry at the University of California Brain Research Institute, says it’s down to the knowledge accumulated thanks to all those extra years. “People develop a greater perspective of what’s important, the ability to problem-solve is streamlined after years of practice. And there’s accumulation of certain types of knowledge – what’s called crystallised intelligence.” It’s a pattern underpinned by biology. Nerve signals are insulated by a fatty material, myelin, which envelops the wiry ends of neurons. It’s important stuff, increasing the speed  electrical signals are transmitted, but it was thought to deteriorate as people got older. Not so. “As people age you find that the insulation around these long wires is actually increased, so axons fire more quickly in middle-aged people than in younger people. There’s a peak performance of these brain cells around that time,” Small says. Better sex Several studies have shown that older people have more – and better – sex than you might think. A study of the sexual activity and satisfaction of women in their 80s found that half still had orgasms ‘always’ or ‘most of the time’ during sex. Other studies have reached similarly striking conclusions – a survey of people over the age of 60 found that 74% of men and 70% of women reported a greater sexual satisfaction than when they were in their 40s. Tara Saglio, a relationship therapist based in London, puts this down to older women having fewer insecurities. “Older women are more confident about expressing their own sexuality. It’s that confidence that makes sex better.” Fewer migraines Migraines can become less of a headache as we age, too. A Swedish study of patients 18 and older found that attacks become shorter, less painful and less frequent as people get older. Of 374 people enrolled in the study, only four developed chronic headaches. Less sweaty Sweat glands shrink and become less numerous as people get older. Research shows that those in their 20s can expect to sweat more than those on their 50s and early 60s. Cheating death Still not convinced? Even at advanced years, the Grim Reaper need not be as close as you might expect. The oldest old are healthier than ever before and still have a good chance of celebrating a few more birthdays. In 2011-2014, the average 25-year-old had a life expectancy of 84 (women) or 80 (men), while a 95 year-old could expect to see their 98th (women) or 97th (men) birthday. Even at 80, women have a 95% chance of living another year.  Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn and Instagram."
economic indicators,South Africa's ANC loses capital,2024-09-15,2016-08-06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36997461,"DA leader Mmusi Maimane: ""For far too long, the ANC has governed South Africa with absolute impunity"" South Africa's governing African National Congress has been defeated by the opposition Democratic Alliance in local polls in the capital Pretoria. The DA took 43% of the vote compared with the ANC's 41% in Tshwane, the municipality that includes Pretoria. The DA will need to form a coalition in order to secure control there. In the country's largest city, Johannesburg, the ANC beat the DA but fell short of an outright majority, with 44% of the vote. The ANC has also lost Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan area in the Eastern Cape, which includes Port Elizabeth, to the DA.  End of racial politics? It is the ANC's worst electoral performance since it was elected to power at the end of apartheid and the replacement of white minority rule by democracy in 1994, and the first time since then that it has lost control of the capital. The DA has won 93 seats in Tshwane while the ANC is second with 89 seats in the 214-seat municipal council. Observers say a host of corruption scandals and internal party squabbles are to blame for the ANC's decline. The South African economy has stagnated since 2008's global financial crisis, and the country has one of the highest rates of economic inequality in the world. Revelations that upgrades to President Jacob Zuma's private home were funded with $20m of public money caused an outcry. The Constitutional Court recently instructed Mr Zuma to reimburse the state $507,000. DA candidate Athol Trollip has been elected mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay The municipal election result is probably the biggest wake-up call the governing ANC has received since it ushered in democracy in South Africa in 1994.  Clearly the ANC still commands huge support across the country but that support is waning. It can no longer take it for granted that the black majority will blindly follow it.  A good example is in the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality, won by the DA, which has a rich history of anti-apartheid struggle. Its new DA mayor is Athol Trollip, who is white. Twenty-two years after the end of apartheid, black people are now voting on issues and not on race. Mr Trollip, who speaks fluent Xhosa, would not be where he is if the vast majority of black people had not voted for him.  The party of late President Mandela, the icon of the struggle against apartheid, still commands strong support with about 54% of the national vote. The DA has received about 27%, while the radical Economic Freedom Fighters party - contesting local elections for the first time - has taken about 8%. The vote is seen as a possible indicator for the general election due in 2019 The DA's leader, 36-year-old Mmusi Maimane, told reporters: ""For far too long, the ANC has governed South Africa with absolute impunity."" He added that the idea that his party - which has its roots in the non-ANC opposition to apartheid - was a white one had been ""completely shattered"". The ANC said it would ""reflect and introspect where our support has dropped"".  In a brief address before the final results were announced, 74-year-old President Zuma praised the conduct of a vote he called largely peaceful, free and fair. ""Our democracy is maturing,"" he said.

economic indicators,ANC suffers major electoral setback,2024-09-15,2016-08-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36985339,"This video can not be played The ruling African National Congress has got the lowest share of the vote since 1994 South Africa's governing African National Congress (ANC) has suffered its worst electoral setback since apartheid ended in 1994. With 99% of the votes counted after Wednesday's municipal elections, the party has lost the key battleground of Nelson Mandela Bay to the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA). The two parties are in a close fight for Johannesburg and Pretoria.  But the ANC is still in the lead nationally, with 54% of the vote. End of racial politics? The ANC has had the main share of the vote in South Africa since the end of apartheid more than two decades ago.  Unemployment and corruption scandals surrounding President Jacob Zuma have tarnished the party's image. The local elections are being seen as an indication of his mid-term popularity. Mr Zuma will be present when the results are officially announced on Saturday evening, at 18:00 local time (16:00 GMT). Named after ANC liberation hero and South Africa's first democratically elected president, the loss of Nelson Mandela Bay is a big blow to the party. Many of the leaders of the struggle against apartheid come from the area. DA leader Mmusi Maimane says his party has given voters a viable alternative to the ANC The DA, which took 46.5% compared to the ANC's 41% in Nelson Mandela Bay, says it is in talks with other parties to form a coalition in the municipality on South Africa's southern coast. Its leader Mmusi Maimane said Nelson Mandela Bay had voted for change. ""I think that to me says that our message got through - it says our people heard us and South Africans still believe in a dream of a non-racial South Africa, South Africans still want our country to prosper,"" he said. The ANC has conceded defeat in Nelson Mandela Bay after initially saying it was going to challenge the result. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa promised the party would learn from the experience: ""They think that we are arrogant, they think that we are self-centred, they think that we are self-serving, and I'd like to dispute all of that and say we are a listening organisation."" It looks like no party will win an outright majority in the economic hubs of Johannesburg or Tshwane, which includes the capital, Pretoria, and coalition negotiations are already underway. BBC South Africa analyst Farouk Chothia says the ANC's urban vote has collapsed with both black middle and working classes switching to DA. It is a historic moment showing the extent to which people are fed up with corruption and the ANC's failure to deliver on its promises, he says. DA candidate Athol Trollip has just been elected mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay The municipal election result is probably the biggest wake-up call the governing ANC has received since it ushered in democracy in South Africa in 1994.  Clearly the ANC still commands huge support across the country but that support is waning. It can no longer take it for granted that the black majority will blindly follow it.  The best example is in the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality, won by the DA, which has a rich history of anti-apartheid struggle. Its new DA mayor is Athol Trollip, who is white. Twenty-two years after the end of apartheid, black people are now voting on issues and not on race. Mr Trollip, who speaks fluent Xhosa, would not be where he is if the vast majority of black people had not voted for him.  Final results are expected later on Friday. By Friday mid-morning, the ANC had 54%, followed by 26% for the DA and 8% for the radical Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). The Inkatha Freedom Party has boosted its support slightly, holding on to parts of KwaZulu-Natal state. Correspondents say a poor ANC performance could embolden Mr Zuma's rivals within the party to challenge him. The next general elections are due in 2019 but Mr Zuma cannot stand for a third term as president. The vote is seen as a possible indicator for the general election due in 2019 This video can not be played What matters to young South African voters? South Africa's economy has also been one of the main issues for voters, with growth expected to be zero this year, and unemployment standing at 27%. Protests demanding better housing and amenities have sprung up across South Africa. Mr Zuma has also had to weather a corruption scandal, after being ordered to repay taxpayers' money spent on his private home. Security was tight for the elections and the electoral commission said voting had passed off smoothly.

economic indicators,How much will benefits increase?,2024-09-15,2022-10-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-63129705,"Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has announced how much benefits will rise in 2024.  The changes will take effect from April.  Most working-age benefits will rise 6.7%, which is in line with September's CPI inflation rate. Inflation measures how fast prices are rising based on the cost of a basket of goods. State pensions will go up in line with the so-called triple lock, which means they rise by inflation, average earnings or 2.5%, whichever is higher. This year, the highest was the rise in average wages, which was 8.5%. In Scotland some disability benefits are devolved, meaning the Scottish government decides how to increase them. Benefits are fully devolved in Northern Ireland, but changes are likely to be similar to those for the rest of the UK. Jeremy Hunt announced that claimants who have not found a job after 18 months would be put on mandatory work placements, ""to increase their skills and improve their employability"". He said that claimants who did not engage with the process after a further six months would have their benefits stopped. In August 2023, 22.6 million people were claiming some form of benefits, in England, Scotland and Wales. In 2023-24, the government is expected to spend £265.5bn on paying pensions and benefits, just over half of which (£134.8bn) goes on benefits to pensioners. By comparison, the government is expected to spend £245bn on health.  After the state pension, universal credit (UC) is the government's highest benefit spend, allocated £59.8bn this year.  In October 2023, 6.2 million people were claiming it, about 38% of whom have jobs. UC is a monthly payment to help with living costs. It was introduced to replace a number of existing benefits, including: What is universal credit and who qualifies for it? It is expected that £14.3bn will be spent on housing benefit this year, which helps people pay their rent. In May 2023, there were 1.3 million working-age recipients and 1.1 million of pension age. Housing benefit is gradually being replaced by UC.  The main benefits for disabled people are: In February 2023 there were: The government is expected to spend £12.6bn on child benefit this year.  Since 2013, claimants earning more than £50,000 gradually have the benefit reduced the more they earn. At £60,000 and above, child benefit is fully withdrawn. And that figure has not been adjusted to reflect rising prices since then, meaning it now affects many more people. In August 2022, seven million families were receiving child benefit. Child tax credit and working tax credit are being replaced by UC.  The government is expected to spend £8.8bn on them this year. Separate from the state pension, pension credit helps people over state-pension age with low incomes with living costs, at a cost of £5bn in 2023-24. More than 1.4 million people currently receive pension credit, although the government says there are significantly more eligible pensioners who do not claim.  The UK spends 12.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) - the total value of goods and services produced in the country - on social benefits, according to the latest data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  That puts it in fifth place on the G7 list of big economies."
economic indicators,"Private sector growth accelerates, survey suggests",2024-09-15,2024-03-11,By John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-68518228,"Northern Ireland's private sector grew at its fastest rate in almost a year during February, an Ulster Bank survey has suggested. The monthly survey of about 200 firms is considered a reliable indicator of the health of the private sector economy. Growth in February came from the manufacturing and services sectors. But retail output was flat and construction showed little recovery from a long period of weakness. Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist, said services recorded their fastest rate of expansion in activity in 22 months. The services sector is the largest part of the Northern Ireland economy and has been the source of almost all growth since the pandemic. Official figures for services and manufacturing output in the fourth quarter of last year are due to be published later this week. The third quarter figures suggested services were growing while a period of weakness for manufacturing was continuing. Some economic forecasters expect the Northern Ireland economy to show little overall growth this year. Ulster University and the professional services firm EY have both forecast growth of less than 1%, pointing to the lingering effects of inflation and higher interest rates."
economic indicators,Ten major events that shaped business in 2023,2024-09-15,2023-12-28,Meredith Turits,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231219-ten-major-events-that-shaped-business-in-2023,"Soaring profits, stellar collapses, court cases and more – this year, big business moments abounded. Amid an uncertain economy, international political tension and leadership shake-ups, 2023 delivered big moments in business that shaped our year. They'll set the stage for the months to come. February: TikTok bans go global Prior to 2023, some governments around the world had banned the use of Chinese tech-company Bytedance's TikTok on devices, citing security concerns around data sharing with the Chinese government. In 2023, these bans spread – quickly. In February, the European Commission, European Parliament and EU Council all imposed TikTok bans on government employee devices; Canada, too, mandated the removal of the app from federal devices. Shortly after, countries including the UK, New Zealand and Denmark made similar moves. Currently, more than a dozen countries have either partial or full bans in place.  In late February, the US government gave employees 30 days to uninstall TikTok from their work devices. More than half of US states have since adopted similar bans, and even some universities and private-sector companies have moved to take these decisions. In March, the Biden Administration pushed Bytedance to sell the app, but the Chinese government swiftly announced their opposition. In May, Governor Greg Gianforte of Montana signed a bill to ban TikTok within the state, but in November, a federal judge granted a temporary injunction to stop the ban, citing First Amendment protections. March and May: Three US banks fail The failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March, and First Republic Bank in May, marked the most consequential US banking crisis since 2008. Combined, the three banks held more than $500bn (£399bn) in assets – a number that, adjusted for inflation, exceeds the holdings of the 25 banks that collapsed during the global financial crisis. The banks failed for various reasons, but their implosion kicked off a crisis of consumer confidence in the US banking system, in an economy already experiencing soaring inflation. The US government took steps to quell the panic, including providing emergency aid as well as a promise that customers beyond the FDIC insurance limit at these financial institutions would be ""made whole"". By May, the crisis seemed widely contained. But some US banks still remain vulnerable to rapid interest-rate increases, and continue to hold onto immense piles of cash amid uncertain economic conditions. Regulators have been making moves, including increasing scrutiny of risk management, to hopefully prevent similar failures in the future. May: 'Summer of strikes' kicks off with the Writer's Guild of America Organised labour was immensely active this year. Across the UK, for instance, workers in sectors including transport, healthcare, law, education and more walked out in droves, looking for higher pay, better conditions and future job security in a changing technological landscape. Perhaps the highest-profile strikes happened in the US, where millions of workers initiated work stoppages across a range of industries including health care, hospitality, education and manufacturing. The summer was a particularly active period, vaulted into the widespread public eye when the Writer's Guild of America (WGA) ­– representing more than 10,000 American screenwriters – clashed with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers over contract terms. It wasn't the union's first strike, but it lasted into September – 148 days, considerably longer than its 100-day work stoppage in 2007. In July, the Hollywood actors' guild (Sag-Aftra) joined in solidarity, then began pushing for their own contract improvements soon thereafter. Meanwhile, on 15 September, tens-of-thousands of labourers in the United Auto Workers union (UAW) began a six-week rolling strike across the three major US auto manufacturers: GM, Ford and Stellantis. The scale of the collective action was staggering, but so were workers' gains after negotiations. In many cases, global workers scored unprecedented pay rises and job-security protections, especially in an environment of rising living costs and rapid technological advancement.  May: Nvidia hits $1tn ($797bn) market cap There are few companies with a $1tn market value around the world, and in May, chipmaker Nvidia joined the vaunted club. On 30 May, the company exceeded the mega milestone, making them only the fifth in the US – joining Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon – with such a market cap. It's an important signifier for where analysts think business is heading. Nvidia makes about three-quarters of the chips for computers that power generative artificial intelligence, and the company's ascension in such a short period of time reflects the changing tech landscape around the world, as investors are betting big on the AI boom. July: Twitter becomes X In October 2022, after an excruciating period of back-and-forth negotiations, Elon Musk closed a deal to own Twitter, to the tune of $44bn (£35.1bn). The takeover began as a hostile one; within a couple weeks, the company began layoffs of nearly half its workforce. It was a startling way to cap Twitter's wild year – and only laid the foundation for what came next. Many of the biggest changes began to hit in summer 2023, beginning with the appointment of Linda Yaccarino as CEO in June, amid a crisis of dwindling advertisers ­and dwindling revenue. But the public really felt the effect in July, when Musk declared the ""Twitter"" name a relic, renaming the platform ""X"". It was a move both analysts and users panned – experts say the switch may have cost Musk essential, singular brand equity.   Since then, Musk's ownership has continued to be the subject of immense controversy and financial tumult. In October, X's value dropped to more than half of the purchase price. The platform has not only lost users, but haemorrhaged tens-of-millions of advertising dollars. Musk's response to the attrition came in a 23 November interview with DealBook's Andrew Ross Sorkin, in which the billionaire launched a profane attack slamming the brands that have left.  Another problem has just popped up for Musk and his X – in late December, the EU formally announced it suspects the platform has breached its rules in areas including disinformation and countering illegal content. September: Rupert Murdoch steps down After a shaky year in business, 92-year-old Rupert Murdoch announced he was stepping down as chairman of the board of both News Corp and Fox. Settling a Succession-esque battle, Murdoch's son Lachlan became chairman of both companies, alongside his role as Fox's CEO and executive chair. In April, Rupert Murdoch's Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit from the voting-machine company, Dominion, over its reporting of the 2020 presidential election, at the cost of  $787.5m (£620m). The billionaire global media mogul leaves during a critical time, as the 2024 US election approaches. It remains to be seen how much the business will change – if at all – under the stewardship of Lachlan, whose management style may mirror his father's. October: FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried goes on trial Throughout the past few years, experts hailed Sam Bankman-Fried as an economic pioneer – even saviour. As the founder and CEO of Bahamas-based cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Bankman-Fried legitimised the turbulent crypto market, spurring investors to infuse billions into the company. However, after running into a liquidity crisis in November 2022, the once exalted company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  In October 2023, former billionaire Bankman-Fried and several employees of FTX and crypto hedge fund Alameda Research went on trial to face charges including wire fraud, securities and commodities fraud and money laundering. Several employees pled guilty, while Bankman-Fried went on trial for a month in New York City. After testifying, 31-year-old Bankman-Fried was swiftly found guilty on all seven charges he faced. He awaits sentencing.  Since FTX was such a household name, Bankman-Fried's conviction has left a stain on the cryptocurrency industry. Others in the space are trying to move on, but it's proving difficult. Investors are sceptical and largely gun-shy to infuse capital into industry, and regulators have a close eye on what will happen next.  One additional issue eroding confidence is the November resignation of Changpeng Zhao (CZ) as CEO of massive global crypto exchange Binance. Shortly after Bankman-Fried's conviction, Zhao pled guilty to money laundering violations. The US government has ordered him to pay a $50m (£39.8m) fine, and he faces up to 18 months in prison – if not more. October: Microsoft acquires Activision Blizzard Despite the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)'s attempt to block Microsoft's acquisition of video-game developer Activision Blizzard, the $68.7bn (£54.7bn) deal closed in October. As Microsoft's largest-ever purchase, the move bolsters the company's power and profile in the gaming space.  Perhaps more importantly, however, the completion of the acquisition dealt a blow to the Biden administration's wide-reaching plans to fight mergers and acquisitions that could cause price hikes for consumers. Since October, more than $170bn (£135.4bn) worth of mergers have gone through, leaving questions open as to whether President Biden's anti-trust efforts are working.  In December, the FTC the once again challenged the legality of the merger, though anti-trust lawyers say they face a major uphill battle in their newest appeal. November: WeWork files for bankruptcy protection  Once valued at $47bn (£37.4bn), global coworking giant WeWork filed for bankruptcy protection on 6 November. Shares tumbled, leaving the troubled company valued at less than $50m (£41m). The spectacular fall had been years in the making, especially after its failed attempt at IPO in 2019, but experts still saw its downfall as stunning. Although WeWork's bankruptcy was largely due to a flawed business model that relied on excessive real estate holdings, the bankruptcy has left a question hovering over the coworking industry: does anyone still want these spaces? Experts who study work trends and entrepreneurs in the industry both say yes. Hybrid-working patterns are still leaving people wanting connection, and growing revenue figures in the industry indicate sustained demand. December: Purdue Pharma settlement reaches the US Supreme Court At year's end, the high profile lawsuits against US OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma found their way to the Supreme Court. The justices are currently deliberating whether to allow a multibillion dollar bankruptcy plan to move forward. If it does, the Sackler family – which owns the pharmaceutical company – would be shielded from any civil liabilities going forward, after a March 2022 agreement to pay out $6bn (£4.78bn) of personal holdings. The outcome of this case may set a precedent for how US corporations can use bankruptcy law to protect themselves from civil litigation. Arguments are ongoing, with a decision that will likely drag into 2024. If 2023 serves as an indicator for 2024's business landscape, there will be a lot to watch in the new year."
economic indicators,What Hong Kong can expect from 'Beijing's enforcer',2024-09-15,2022-05-14,By Zubaidah Abdul Jalil,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-61267496,"It is a turn of events that, to some, comes as no surprise. This week, pro-Beijing hardliner John Lee was elected as Hong Kong's new leader, replacing Carrie Lam. The 64-year-old former security chief ran uncontested in the chief executive election, and was essentially handpicked for the role by a mostly pro-Beijing election committee. With China increasingly clamping down on Hong Kong, his appointment is a clear indication of Beijing's desire to keep the city on a tight leash, say analysts. ""John Lee's background is that of a policeman, a law enforcer,"" says Dr Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore. He points out that Mr Lee oversaw the crackdown on Hong Kong's 2019 protests, and the introduction of the controversial national security law which prohibits acts of treason, secession, sedition or subversion against China. ""This suggests that Beijing places its view of law and order at the front and centre of ruling Hong Kong."" Professor Steve Tsang, Director of the China Institute at SOAS agrees, calling Mr Lee ""Beijing's enforcer"".  His appointment confirms that ""Beijing intends to have its man in Hong Kong toe the party line and do what Beijing expects it to do."" Analysts also say Mr Lee's lack of popular support leaves little choice for him but to continue relying on Beijing to secure his political position.  ""Given he was one of the top officials responsible for transforming the Hong Kong police from a respected local institution into the most hated and despised of government departments, this background does not give him much of a power base,"" said Prof Tsang.  ""It means he does not have wide support and is beholden to Beijing for his office."" Mr Lee is not due to take the reins of power until 1 July.  But in the days following his selection, several individuals - including 90-year-old retired bishop Joseph Zen - were arrested for running a fund in 2019 to provide legal assistance to detained protestors, on suspicion that they broke the national security law.  Three of the others were former legislator Margaret Ng, pro-democracy activist Denise Ho, and academic Dr Hui Po Keung.  So what will Hong Kong look like under John Lee? In a 44-page manifesto, Mr Lee pledged to strengthen governance and tackle chronic housing problems. He has also pledged to enact legislation to bolster the national security law - a move that could potentially see him criminalising other areas not already covered under the Beijing-imposed law.  ""It will be another indicator of a further erosion of Hong Kong's civil liberties,"" says Kwong Chung Ching, the campaigns coordinator of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China.  In December last year, pro-democracy media organisation Stand News was raided by the police, and its senior staff arrested. Mr Lee had then announced that he supported the move. Numerous other independent news outlets have closed in Hong Kong - once a beacon of press freedom in Asia.  ""Anybody who attempts to make use of media work as a tool to pursue their political purpose or other interests [and] contravenes the law, particularly offences that endanger national security, they are the evil elements that damage press freedom,"" Mr Lee has said.  Hong Kong is also more likely to become ""more integrated into the mainland"", says Prof Tsang. ""The old Hong Kong, which existed prior to 2020, will not have a chance of re-emerging.""  Mr Lee also faces the daunting task of restoring Hong Kong's status as a glittering hub for business and finance, something he vowed to do in his manifesto. The massive, sometimes violent, protests that erupted in 2019 scared away tourists and spooked investors. Stringent Covid restrictions felled the economy further, resulting in a 4% economic contraction in the first quarter of 2022.  According to Eurocham, a net 130,000 people have left Hong Kong since 1 February, with employers reporting difficulties in attracting talent back into the city. Nearly half of all European businesses and 44% of US businesses in Hong Kong are considering relocating in the next year. With a career in the police force spanning more than four decades, Mr Lee stands in contrast to previous chief executives who had backgrounds in business and the civil service.  Analysts say it remains to be seen whether he will be able to repair Hong Kong's reputation. Dr Chong argued that a return to business confidence would require a degree of freedom of information and a restraint on authority.  ""Hong Kong used to be able to provide that in ways that the mainland could not,"" he said.  Furthermore, Mr Lee's appointment raises questions as to whether he will be expected to fall in line with China's zero-Covid policy, as Hong Kong battles one of its worst outbreaks yet.  The city has charted 5,600 deaths in the first quarter of the 2022 alone, compared to just 200 in the first two years of the pandemic, exacerbated by low vaccination rates amongst the city's elderly. ""As long as [Chinese President] Xi insists on zero-Covid, Mr Lee will be expected to implement it, though he has some latitude to reduce its adverse effects,"" says Prof Tsang. But analysts say achieving zero-Covid - or some approximation of it - is a goal that appears to run contradictory to Mr Lee's pledges to re-open the country.  Dr Chong says: ""Mr Lee has stated an intention to open up - but how to square these two cross-cutting demands and in what timeframe is less clear."""
economic indicators,Badenoch dismisses speculation about ousting Sunak,2024-09-15,2024-03-18,By Becky Morton,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68595286,"Conservative MPs speculating about ousting Rishi Sunak as prime minister should ""stop it"", Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch has said. Reports have been swirling in recent days that some Conservative MPs want Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt to replace him.  But Ms Badenoch told BBC Breakfast this was only ""a small minority of MPs"". It comes after a difficult week for the PM, with former Tory deputy chairman Lee Anderson defecting to Reform UK.  Mr Sunak also faced criticism over the way he handled allegations of racist comments made by a major Tory donor.  Asked about reports that support was gathering around Ms Mordaunt as a potential replacement for the PM, Ms Badenoch said: ""I'm sure if Penny was here she would be distancing herself from those comments.  ""I've been saying for a long time that the small minority of MPs who think that this is something to be talking about should stop it."" She added: ""I don't think there is very much to these rumours... We need to make sure one or two MPs cannot dominate the news narrative, when 350 plus MPs have different views."" Currently only two Tory MPs have publicly called for Mr Sunak to resign - Sir Simon Clarke and Dame Andrea Jenkyns. Asked about calls from some Tories for him to quit, the prime minister insisted his party was ""united in wanting to deliver a brighter future for our country"".  ""I'm not interested in Westminster politics, it doesn't matter. What matters is the future of our country,"" he added.  Those close to Ms Mordaunt believe responding to rumours of a leadership plot publicly would give them more credence than they deserve. Popular with the party's grassroots, she previously stood to be party leader in both contests in 2022. As leader of the House of Commons, her public profile was raised when she played a key role in the King's Coronation, holding a ceremonial sword for more than an hour.  Former Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said it was ""too late"" to replace Mr Sunak as PM.  ""There comes a moment in time in the electoral cycle where you effectively put on your best suit, you stand up and you march towards the sound of the guns and you get on with it,"" the Tory MP told Times Radio.  In an attempt to shift the focus to the economy, Downing Street issued a statement from Mr Sunak on Sunday night vowing that 2024 ""will be the year Britain bounces back"".  The PM said he hoped to see ""more progress"" on inflation when the latest official figures are released on Wednesday.  ""There is now a real sense that the economy is turning a corner with all the economic indicators pointing in the right direction,"" he added.  However, some Tories are concerned the cut to National Insurance in the Budget failed to boost the party's poll ratings.  On Monday Mr Sunak also set out a series of reforms to create up to 20,000 more apprenticeships and cut red tape for small businesses at a conference in Warwickshire.  From 1 April, the government will pay the full cost of apprenticeships for people aged 21 or under at small firms, backed by £60m of new investment for next year.  Last week the prime minister came under pressure over his response to comments allegedly made by Tory donor Frank Hester about Diane Abbott. Mr Hester, who has donated at least £10m to the party, reportedly said the MP made him want to ""hate all black women"". The businessman apologised for making ""rude"" comments but said his words ""had nothing to do with her gender nor colour of skin"". Downing Street initially declined to describe the remarks as racist but later did. It came after Ms Badenoch, who also serves as equalities minister, had already said the comments, as reported, were racist and ""appalling"". The PM has rejected calls from opposition parties to return the money Mr Hester has donated to the Tories, arguing he had apologised and his ""remorse should be accepted"". Asked if she was comfortable with her party keeping the donations, Ms Badenoch said: ""Yes… I thought that the comments were racist but he has apologised. I think when people apologise, we need to accept that and move on."" She added that the row was ""a distraction"" and ""nowhere near the priorities of any of my constituents""."
economic indicators,Is Russia still a key world power?,2024-09-15,2015-12-21,James Nixey,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34857908,"Russia has been eclipsed as a world power by China Whether Russia, one of 15 successor states to the USSR, which broke up in 1991, is still a genuine world power in 2015 is open to question.  It remains the world's largest country and the largest oil producer It retains its permanent seat on the UN Security Council (one among five) Its nuclear arsenal (in Cold War times one of five countries, but now one of nine) has been progressively modernised Sustained increases in defence spending have brought it close to its goal of escalation dominance in local and regional war But the economic base for these capabilities is steadily declining.  Russia's economy is the 10th largest in the world, producing little of value beyond hydrocarbons.  Corruption and rent-seeking extract an enormous economic toll.  It remains burdened with Soviet era infrastructure, and its ability to meet the educational and medical needs of its population is rapidly declining.  Whatever one's view, two further points for and against Russia's global standing are undeniable:  Russia regards itself as a great power - it is not in question anywhere inside the country China has long since eclipsed Russia as the world's number two power behind the US  Yet for all Russia's pretence about a rebalancing of priorities towards Asia, since the fallout over Ukraine, it still measures itself against the West, and America in particular.  Regardless of hypothetical rankings or real-world measurements, Russia has carved out a niche for itself as a distinct Eurasian pole in world politics, allied to neither Europe nor Asia but seeking influence there and beyond.  Its membership of the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) group of rising powers suggests an acknowledgement that Russia has not quite arrived (there is no contradiction for Russia between this and pre-existing great power status) but also that is it is civilisationally distinct from Europe.  Oil is hugely important to the Russian economy Certainly, there is no current desire to be part of most prominent Western-led organisations such as the European Union.  Indeed, Russia has striven to come up with its own alternatives over the years, the latest of which, a Eurasian Union, is designed precisely as a counterweight but free of the burden of Western norms and values.  Whether it will have a longer life than its antecedents, considering Russia's failing economic fortunes and other countries' evident reluctance to be joined too closely, remains to be seen.  Russia's mission beyond the quest for influence is hard to discern.   It is the world's most ostentatious foe of democracy promotion.   But its foreign aid is minimal (especially beyond the other former Soviet states - where its purpose is often regarded as a double-edged sword), and its contribution to UN-led peacekeeping has withered since the 1990s.  US: 17,419,000  China: 10,360,105  Japan: 4,601,461  Germany: 3,852,556  UK: 2,941,886  France: 2,829,192  Brazil: 2,346,118  Italy: 2,144,338  India: 2,066,902 Russian Federation: 1,860,598 Until the recent campaign in Syria, Russia had talked of itself as a global power, but behaved like a regional power.  Russia's greatest challenge is to preserve its global importance while most of the relevant indicators are dropping and its allies are few and far between (dictators, largely).  For some, Russia's natural and historical pre-eminence mean it will always be a key player.  Others fear Russia may compensate for weakness with risky foreign adventurism. Indeed, for many, it is already doing just that.  James Nixey is head of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, external.

economic indicators,"Portugal: Two steps forward, one step back",2024-09-15,2014-05-16,Alison Roberts,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-27432712,"Portugal formally exits its eurozone bailout this weekend after three years of painful austerity that was the condition for it to receive 78bn euro (£63bn) in loan guarantees from the European Union and International Monetary Fund. To mark the date, the right-of-centre government called an extraordinary cabinet meeting whose single agenda item was the approval of a medium-term economic strategy. Opposition parties accused the governing coalition of blatant electioneering in calling the cabinet in on a Saturday, barely a week before elections for the European Parliament.  Two formal complaints were submitted to the National Elections Commission, but were struck down. The government denies it is acting with an eye to next week's European vote, but is quite open about the fact that it is seeking to capitalise on media interest in Portugal's bailout exit. ""There will be a natural attention on the ending of the Portuguese programme,"" the cabinet office minister, Luis Marques Guedes, said at a briefing following Thursday's regular cabinet meeting.  ""The Portuguese government intends to make use of these spotlights to make known, through the media, its strategy for reforms in the medium term."" Indeed, the document was originally written in English, according to officials - as part of efforts to convince foreign investors that Portugal is back on ""the path to growth"". The latest economic indicators have, however, somewhat tarnished the image of a country that has left the crisis behind.  Portugal's economic output, or gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 0.7% in the first quarter, even as euro-zone GDP swelled by just 0.2%, according to figures from Eurostat, the EU's statistical unit. Recovery had appeared to be well under way, with the country's economy growing since the second quarter of 2013, when Portugal had the fastest growth in the EU.  Exports have been the main engine of that growth, and it was the fact that they faltered - indeed fell - in the first quarter of 2014 that send the economy into reverse. So what is in prospect for Portugal now? Portugal's footwear industry exports about 95% of its products Some traditional sectors have come through the crisis fighting, with many firms responding to slumping domestic demand by looking abroad for the first time - or by seeking out non-EU markets while Europe stagnated. The footwear industry, which exports 95% of its output, has seen its foreign sales jump by some 40% over the past four years, and the pace of growth has continued in recent months.  Brands such as Fly London, which despite its name is produced by a company based in Guimaraes in northern Portugal, exemplify a move upmarket by many Portuguese shoe manufacturers - a trend that has lifted their average sale price to a point at which they rank behind only those made in Italy. Tourism has also been growing strongly, particularly in the capital, with an increasing diversification away from traditional beach holidays in the Algarve - and this summer is expected to set a new record in terms of visitor numbers. Portugal's prospects are looking better, says Teleperformance Portugal's Joao Cardoso Some other services are also doing well. Teleperformance Portugal, the country's largest contact-centre operator, has maintained its pace of doubling in size roughly every three years even in the crisis, according to its chief executive, Joao Cardoso. The company's innovative approach, not only to customer service but also to helping its local and multinational clients make improvements in their businesses, has won it a string of international awards. ""The world is so open that we now have more opportunities than at any time in the past,"" says Mr Cardoso. ""Portugal is very favourable for this kind of service."" Not only is it relatively easy to persuade native English, German, Swedish or Dutch speakers to move to sunny Portugal, but the company can draw on a large Portuguese diaspora whose members grow up speaking at least two languages.  One-fifth of the 800 people it has hired from abroad in the past two years are emigrants or the children of emigrants. Mr Cardoso is optimistic about his country's prospects, too. ""Portugal's economy is very open - and exports have been growing very fast. ""People are more optimistic now and that means they will take more risks."" Many still object to the government's austerity measures So far as taking risks goes, the 120,000 Portuguese who the government estimates left the country last year in search of work, are certainly proof that there is a widespread readiness to do so.  Portugal's jobless rate has been falling very gradually, but at 15.2% it is still twice the level of a decade ago, and youth unemployment actually rose slightly in March - to a shocking 35.4%. As for the kind of risk that worries investors, international ratings agencies have of late been making positive noises about the outlook for Portugal, but all still rate its sovereign debt as ""junk"".  While its bond yields are at their lowest levels in years, that is in part because of investors' frantic search for decent returns - and the famously reassuring words back in 2012 of the European Central Bank's president, Mario Draghi, that it would do ""whatever it takes"" to ensure the euro's survival. Economist differ on whether Portugal's debt mountain - which the government says will peak this year at 127.5% of GDP - is sustainable. But they do agree that the country's ability to bear and ultimately reduce this burden will depend on the future pace of economic growth.

economic indicators,People rushed to shops in January for new year deals,2024-09-15,2024-02-16,By Dearbail Jordan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68314197,"Shop sales rebounded in January as shoppers flocked to stock up on food at supermarkets and take advantage of new year bargains. Official figures revealed a 3.4% jump in sales following a record drop in December. Food sales at supermarkets rose strongly while department stores reported a positive impact from January sales. However, inflation remained elevated with people paying more for less. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that the value of goods people bought in January went up 3.9%, compared to the 3.4% increase in the volume of products they purchased. Inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, has slowed significantly but at 4% it remains higher than the Bank of England's 2% target. It had been raising interest rates to cool rising prices. ""Sales increased across nearly all retail sectors and it was a particularly strong month for supermarkets,"" said Heather Bovill, deputy director for surveys and economic indicators at the ONS.  ""Household goods stores, sports shops and department store retailers were among those reporting robust trading due to January sales promotions."" Shop sales fell sharply in December which the ONS attributed to people shopping earlier for Christmas during Black Friday sales in November.  But it also said that 46% of nearly 2,400 people that it surveyed last year said they planned to spend less on Christmas food or gifts ""because of the rising cost of living"". The fall in retail sales during December also contributed to a fall in gross domestic product - a key measure of a country's economic health. It was confirmed on Thursday that the UK fell into recession at the end of last year. Economists and commentators were divided on whether January's bounce signalled a turning point for the UK's retailers and consumer spending. Joe Maher, assistant economist at research firm Capital Economics, said: ""The strong pick-up in sales suggests the worst is now behind the retail sector and falling inflation and rising wages in 2024 will provide a strong platform for recovery."" He said the increase was stronger than expected ""and suggests the drag from higher interest rates on consumer spending is fading fast and points to the economy soon moving out of recession"".   But Lisa Hooker, leader of industry for consumer markets at accountancy firm PwC, said: ""Consumers remain cautious about spending, particularly in discretionary and big ticket categories, and we do not predict a sustained recovery until the second half of 2024.""  Consumer spending has been under pressure because of inflation, which measures how quickly prices rise. It hit a four-decade high of 11.1% in October 2022 and the Bank of England carried out a number of interest rate rises in a bid to tackle soaring costs. Raising interest rates helps cool inflation because it means people have less money to spend. Borrowing, such as mortgages and credit cards, becomes more expensive but it should also encourage people to save more as banks, theoretically, pass on higher saving rates to customers. After raising interest rates to 5.25% last August, the Bank of England has kept them on hold. Financial markets are expecting the Bank to cut rates this year but the question is when that will happen. Economic data revealing that the UK had slipped into recession in 2023 raised the prospect that the Bank could make a cut in the spring, easing the burden for some households. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who will announce his Budget on 6 March, said on Thursday: ""While interest rates are high - so the Bank of England can bring inflation down - low growth is not a surprise."" But he said he believed the economy was ""turning a corner"". At its last interest rate meeting in early February, the Bank of England appeared to open the door to a cut. One of its nine-member Monetary Policy Committee which decides on interest rates, voted for a reduction. While the Bank's governor Andrew Bailey said he was ""optimistic"" that inflation was heading in the right direction, he said: ""We need to see more evidence that inflation is set to fall all the way to the 2% target, and stay there, before we can lower interest rates.""

Here's our daily business round-up: China posted its largest trade deficit in at least a decade in February, after imports of commodities jumped as companies built up supplies. The deficit was $31.5bn (£20bn) after imports rose 39.6% from a year earlier and exports rose 18.4%, the customs bureau said. Analysts said the widening trade gap could signal deeper economic issues that China would need to address. China has an export-led economy, but global economic growth remains slow. Elsewhere in Asia, Japan's economic recovery has received a boost as core machinery orders, a key indicator of capital expenditure, rose more than expected in January. Orders rose 3.4% from the previous month, up from a 7.1% decline in December, latest data showed. There have been fears that some manufacturers might shift production out of Japan in the wake of weak domestic demand and a strong yen. Last month, Japan reported a 2% jump in factory output in January. And there was also good economic news in India where industrial production grew by 6.8% in January from a year earlier, easing concerns about a slowdown in its economy. The growth was led by an 8.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector. This comes just days after data showed India's economy grew by 6.1% in the last three months of 2011, its weakest pace in nearly three years. A global slowdown and a series of interest rate rises aimed at reining in high prices have hurt India's growth.

Public Health Wales (PHW) figures showed 61% had been given a first dose of a jab in the most deprived areas of Wales - compared with 78.3% in the least deprived areas. Vaccine offers were made to all 16 and 17-year-olds six weeks ago.  Up to Tuesday night, 71.2% had received a first dose. It is the first time a breakdown of teenage uptake has been available in terms of gender, economic background and ethnic group. Up to 10 September, there were 3,449 young people in the poorest areas yet to receive a first dose. When looking at the uptake among that age group by sex, girls are ahead at 70%, with boys at 66.4%. There is a far smaller gap between 16 and 17-year-olds from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds and their white counterparts - 8.8 percentage points. The widest gap among BAME age groups is for those in their 30s, where 64% have so far had a first Covid vaccine dose, compared with 80.7% of white people in their 30s. PHW produces a monthly analysis of how the vaccine programme is reaching different groups in Wales. Meanwhile, teachers in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan have been told to wear face coverings when moving around indoor communal areas Vale of Glamorgan council said the Cardiff and Vale region was ""in the high risk category"", due to increasing cases in older people, increasing hospital admissions and pressure on the Test, Trace and Protect service locally.   It also said schools in the area should make lateral flow tests available to staff twice a week. The measures will be in place until the October half-term, before being reviewed. Pembrokeshire school pupils aged 10 to 19 over the last 30 days have had more than 200 cases, councillors in the area have been told. Director of education Steven Richards-Downes warned there was an increasing risk of year group closures due to Covid with one secondary school already having to take that step due to staff absences caused by illness, self-isolating and other reasons, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Ensuring a balance between well-being, a more normal school environment and reducing Covid risks was needed, added Mr Richards-Downes, with ""most cases from social contacts outside schools"". He said, particularly for teenagers in their ""formative years"", the challenge was to ""balance the harms of restricting contact and making sure learners are in a space where they can do the kinds of things they would normally do"". In Wales, 648.1 people per 100,000 population have had a positive Covid test in the past seven days.  That is a a slight fall for a second successive day. The daily average number of cases is 2,919 - up from 2,529 a week ago, although the recent rise has been slowing down. Neath Port Talbot is still the local authority area with the highest case rate (935.7 per 100,000) although this has fallen slightly. It has the second highest case rate in the UK and six Welsh council areas are in the highest 10 in the UK, although case rates in England are starting to rise again. Wales continues to have the highest case rate out of all UK nations and regions PHW figures show 59% of positive tests in Wales were in the under-30 age group, with 40% among 10 to 19-year-olds. We have also seen record numbers of positive lateral flow test results in the last week - with 51% or nearly 2,000 involving asymptomatic young people - which, if followed up with positive PCR tests, will have swelled the case numbers we are seeing. There were 13 deaths with Covid-19 reported by PHW on Thursday, all of which occurred on Wednesday. There have been 37 deaths in the past seven days, an average of 5.3 a day. Four of Wednesday's deaths were reported in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, three in Cardiff and Vale, two in Betsi Cadwaladr, one in each of the Cwm Taf Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Swansea Bay health board areas, with one outside Wales. Meanwhile, the first death involving Covid in a child in Wales was registered in the week up to 17 September - a girl aged 14 or under - in Public Health Wales' analysis of latest Office for National Statistics mortality figures. The key indicators around the impact on hospitals show numbers of patients with confirmed Covid has fallen for a ninth successive day. The average - 440 patients - is the lowest for 16 days. Covid admissions are still well below levels we saw during the second wave although the daily average is up to 36. There were 52 new confirmed and suspected hospital admissions on Wednesday, the highest daily figure for 11 days - 17 of them in Cwm Taf Morgannwg."
economic indicators,New immigration rules condemned by NI parties,2024-09-15,2020-02-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-51557500,"Politicians from a number of Northern Ireland's parties have expressed concern about newly-announced immigration rules. A new points-based system for immigration was announced on Wednesday, meaning low-skilled workers will not receive visas after Brexit. Retail and hospitality representatives said the plans could cause staff shortages in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin, Alliance, the SDLP and UUP all expressed concerns about the plans. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party would lobby the government ""to see if there is scope for regional variations"" after saying the minimum salary threshold for skilled workers coming to the UK might be too high for Northern Ireland's needs. He said the agri-food sector had suggested £22,000 a year would be a more appropriate threshold, rather than the £25,600 proposed by the government. Sir Jeffrey said: ""There are different needs in different parts of the UK and we have the agri-food sector as our biggest industry here."" Sinn Féin MP Chris Hazard described the government's plans as ""nothing but a xenophobic diktat"". He added: ""[The plans are] a very unpopular and unworkable proposal that is going to cause havoc for our local economy and local society."" The plans urge a ""move away"" from ""cheap labour"" from Europe and a push towards automation and retaining staff. The salary threshold for skilled workers wanting to come to the UK would be lowered from £30,000 to £25,600. However, the government says the threshold would be as low as £20,480 for people in ""specific shortage occupations"" - which include nursing, civil engineering, psychology and classical ballet dancing - or those with PhDs relevant to a specific job. Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry said the plans ""posed a particular threat to Northern Ireland"". The North Down MP said: ""A one-size fits all approach doesn't work. ""The salary thresholds will bring challenges for key sectors such as retail, hospitality and tourism, agri-food, and social care - salary levels are not always a reliable indicator of skills."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also branded the changes a ""fundamental threat"" to Northern Ireland's economy and provision of public services. ""The rush to exorcise economies of anything resembling a European influence, regardless of the impact it has on people, communities and businesses is a disgrace,"" said the Foyle MP. Ulster Unionist Party MLA John Stewart said the government had ""already shown scant regard to Northern Ireland through its withdrawal agreement with the EU"". ""I'm very concerned what these proposals will do to the hospitality, retail and agricultural sectors,"" he said. The plans could be ""an absolute disaster for the care sector in particular"", he added. The director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium said it was ""quite clear"" the region was not a priority. Aodhán Connolly said the minimum salary threshold was a higher salary than some architects and solicitors make in Northern Ireland. ""We need to be very, very clear that there is room for lower skilled and lower-qualified workers,"" he said. As part of the new legislation, the number of places for seasonal workers in agriculture is to be expanded to 10,000. He said this figure was ""miniscule compared to the needs"". He referred to figures for Northern Ireland, which showed technical full employment, although higher levels of economic inactivity than other parts of the United Kingdom. Economic inactivity is a measurement of those people who are not in work and not looking for work - that includes students, retired people and sick or disabled people. Mr Connolly said while there was potential for some of these people to come into the workforce, it would not come close to covering the shortfall created by the new immigration rules."
economic indicators,‘It’s like an oven’: Life in Britain’s hottest areas,2024-09-15,2022-07-18,"By Harriet Bradshaw, Rob England & Deirdre Finnerty",https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-62126463,"The temperature inside Jorda's flat has hit 30C before midday for the past three days. Though she keeps the blinds closed and a fan whirring in the corner, her home feels stuffy and airless. With the UK recording its warmest day ever on Tuesday, she's struggling to cope.  ""The flat gets boiling hot,"" she says. ""It's like an oven."" Jorda is 43 and lives on the top floor of a new-build block in west London with her two young daughters. Her small, concrete balcony, overlooking a neighbouring block and a stretch of busy road, has no shade. Even after the sun sets, traffic noise and exhaust fumes make it difficult to use the space.  ""There is still no air, and there is so much dust,"" she explains. Instead, she shelters in the bathroom, cooler than the rest of the flat.  Jorda's neighbourhood, with a high proportion of people on low incomes or out of work, is one of the most deprived areas of the country. And people living in places like these across Britain are most at risk from severe heat.  Analysis by the BBC of satellite data from 4 Earth Intelligence and figures on relative poverty in England, Scotland and Wales, suggests people in deprived areas are more than twice as likely to live in places which are significantly hotter than neighbouring places. The difference is down to a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect, where buildings and roads absorb and retain heat, and become significantly hotter than surrounding areas with shade or green space.  If you can't view the postcode lookup, click here. For Jorda, the heat is very challenging. She is frequently hospitalised with asthma attacks that leave her gasping for breath, and her symptoms are made worse by hot weather. Her condition has meant she had to give up the hair-styling job she loved and has limited her ability to leave the house. ""At any moment I could get a severe asthma attack."" In the summer, she can't relax inside or outside her flat. ""I live in fear,"" she says. ""That's not what you call a life.""    Her neighbourhood is particularly susceptible to heat. According to 4 Earth Intelligence's heat hazard scale that goes from one to five, Jorda's postcode area is a five. On one day last July, the area where she lives was a full 5C hotter than in a nearby park. BBC analysis estimates that six million people live in places at risk of higher heat across Britain during the summer months. And it's likely to get worse. Climate change is causing temperatures to rise across the UK, which is experiencing longer and more frequent heatwaves.  Extreme heat is dangerous to everyone, causing heat exhaustion and heat stroke, and increasing the risk of a heart attack. But some people are affected more than others.  ""Anyone with severe illness or underlying conditions, older people, babies and the disabled can get overheated quite quickly,"" says Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London.  ""If you're in a top floor flat, if you're homeless, if you work outside and you have to do a lot of physical exertion, you are very vulnerable,"" he says. And people who live in deprived areas tend to have poorer health to begin with, and higher rates of chronic conditions associated with greater vulnerability to heat.  For Andrea Moore, 150 miles away in Cardiff, hotter summers are an increasing concern. The former catering worker has COPD, a chronic lung condition that causes difficulty breathing, chest pain and chest infections. Like Jorda, Andrea's condition worsens in the heat and during a heatwave, she just sits indoors.  ""There's a lot more traffic around and heat radiates off the buildings,"" Andrea says. ""I close the curtains, and if it gets really bad, on comes the fan with a bottle of frozen water in front of it.""  More than one in six neighbourhoods in Cardiff are classified as heat/high deprivation hotspots according to BBC analysis, and Andrea's first-floor flat falls within one of them.  Her neighbourhood has a high number of people with poor health and unsuitable housing, and one day last summer, it was 5C hotter than the nearby Sevenoaks Park. While staying indoors helps, our homes are not built for more frequent heatwaves, says Rohinton Emmanuel, professor of sustainable development at Glasgow Caledonian University. Changing how cities and towns are built could help us to cope better, he says. That means having buildings at different heights to create shade and create a breeze, for example, and planting more trees. Green roofs and green walls can reduce the amount of heat absorbed by buildings, as can using less glass and retrofitting buildings with lighter coloured and more reflective materials. ""Cities take considerable time to change. We are already late,"" he says. ""We need to take action now.""  As many as 4.6 million homes overheat in England, suggests a recent survey from Loughborough University. But until this summer, no rules governed overheating in new buildings. The UK's Climate Change Committee, which tracks the government's progress on its climate commitments, predicts that heat-related deaths could triple over the coming decades without government action. The summer of 2020 saw the most deaths related to heatwaves since records began in 2004, with more than 2,200 deaths in over-65s when temperatures hit 33C. Scotland is not known for its hot weather, but when the sun blasts through the windows of Liz Andrews' flat five miles from Glasgow centre, it can quickly become intolerable. ""You can literally feel the heat as you walk through the front door,"" she explains.   Liz lives on the ground floor of a 1930s tenement block in Yoker, in a neighbourhood where lots of people live in poor quality housing. Over the years, front lawns have been covered over with gravel, and she says it makes her home sweat in the summer.  As the cost of living rises, simple solutions like turning on the fan are more complicated. Liz is on a pre-paid meter and has seen her energy prices soar to about £40-£50 a week. Shutting the blinds brings the added expense of switching on the lights. And travelling to the nearest big park means spending money on bus fares.  ""We really feel the pinch with the heat. It's all very well to say have an ice lolly but sometimes you can't afford ice lollies,"" Liz says.  Glasgow City Council says protecting residents against overheating is a key concern. It has recently introduced a climate plan which notes that the city's housing is underprepared for hotter temperatures and acknowledges the need to address equality of access to green spaces.   It's a problem Liz is keenly aware of. Her son Simon, who has a learning disability, is supported to tend a community allotment in Drumchapel - it's cooler there, but it is a 25-minute bus-ride away from their home. Liz wants more open spaces ""on her doorstep"".  ""All the wee spaces, they're just building houses on them,"" she says.  In Harlesden, Jorda faces similar issues. For the moment, she doesn't want to move away from the hospital that has been treating her asthma when the next attack could be just around the corner.  But she says she feels unsafe in the small green space near her home with little grass, and thinks a more accessible park or community garden might help.  ""I don't mind living in an area like this if I could breathe. Just to be in a bit of fresh air… it would be better than this."" Where is the data from? The potential heat hazard score for each postcode area and another small geographical area - known as a Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) - was calculated by 4 Earth Intelligence, who measured the average land surface temperature over a sample of days in the past three summers across Great Britain. Deprivation data was taken from the latest English, Scottish and Welsh Indices of multiple deprivation (IMD). Each IMD is the nation's official measure of relative deprivation, or poverty, and is weighted heavily towards income, employment, education, and health. What does each heat hazard score mean? Each score, ranging from one to five, is an indicator of how likely it is that your area will experience high temperatures during hot weather, when compared with other areas in your surrounding neighbourhood. How was the score calculated? A statistical method published by academics was used to standardise land surface temperatures for each postcode area, which involved combining satellite images for different dates over the past three years. The temperature data was then adjusted to consider the different average temperatures of each region, to highlight hotter areas across the country, despite varying climates and temperatures. Each heat hazard score represents different sized groups, as described below. How did you combine heat and deprivation data? The heat hazard score was calculated for LSOAs, which also have a population estimate and a deprivation score in its nation's IMD. IMD scores are split into five even groups by nation, or quintiles, and each area is given a score from one to five based on its level of deprivation. One being the most deprived, or poorest, areas and five being the least. The BBC then combined the heat data by nation with the population estimates to calculate the number of individuals estimated to live in each heat hazard score. Taking the areas with a heat hazard score of four or five, the top 10% of heat hazard scores, and also areas with deprivation scores of one and two, the 40% most deprived areas, a calculation was then made to reveal the percentage of people living in higher hazard areas which were also more deprived.

economic indicators,The megafloods coming to California,2024-09-15,2024-02-07,Lucy Sherriff,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240207-climate-change-will-bring-a-megaflood-to-california,"Climate change is making it a matter of time before a megaflood hits the state. The Santa Barbara police car blocked access to the bridge, lights flashing as the thundering, swollen brown river rampaged below. The water was running so high in this Southern California county that it gushed through the railings of the bridge, and poured out onto the road. This region is familiar with water scarcity – usually battling extreme heatwaves, wildfires, and drought. Now, Southern California is confronting an overabundance of water, in the form of torrential rain and life-threatening floods. Earlier this week, around half a year's worth of rain was predicted to fall in Los Angeles and the surrounding areas in just one day.   The city recorded its rainiest day ever on Monday, and it wasn't better news for the rest of California either. A state of emergency was declared and evacuation orders were issued. Mudslides hit neighbourhoods, drivers were stranded, and half a million residents lost power. About 37 million residents, or 94% of the state's population, are under flood alerts. The already-deadly storm is caused by an atmospheric river, a corridor of water vapour in Earth's lower atmosphere which is carried along by the wind, forming long currents – a kind of sky river. The consequences can be dramatic. The precipitation that falls is comparable to the rain brought by hurricanes making landfall on the Gulf Coast.

These severe floods in California are a ""broadly underappreciated risk"", according to a 2022 paper, co-authored by Daniel Swain and Xingying Huang, scientists at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. ""I think we're reasonably prepared for what we're seeing right now,"" says Swain. ""But the kinds of events we're talking about in that paper are far greater – they're longer in duration, more extreme and more widespread. Pretty much every dimension you could add to it. […] I don't think that California has fully prepared to face the realities of these events,"" says Swain. Climate change is increasing the risk of a California megaflood, Swain's study warns. This extreme storm scenario would produce runoffs 200-400% greater than anything seen before in the Sierra Nevada, the sprawling 400-mile (650km) mountain range that traverses 24 of the 58 counties in California. You might also like: The last such megaflood happened in 1861, inundating a 300 mile-long (483km) stretch of the Central Valley and large portions of modern-day Los Angeles with water. It could happen again, any time. And, the extremity of such a flood is increased by around 10% per 1C of global warming, because the warmer the planet the more capacity the atmosphere has to hold water vapour. ""Imagine that what's unfolded over the past 48 hours [in California], just kept recurring for weeks. That's the kind of scenario we're talking about,"" says Swain. How cities are adapting to flooding Climate change is bringing extreme rainfall to parts of the world. How can cities adapt? Sponge cities: Widespread concrete cover can exacerbate flooding. In Auckland, New Zealand, a network of parkland turns the city into a ""sponge"" to help it cope with rainfall. Read how Auckland became the model sponge city. Landslides: Alerting local residents of likely landslides can save lives. Hong Kong, prone to land slippage, has pioneered an advanced early warning system following a series of deadly landslides in the 1970s. Read how Hong Kong cut landslide fatalities. Relocation: Some towns are becoming uninhabitable due to repeated floods. But relocating doesn't have to mean loss of identity. Read how citizens of Valmeyer, Illinois, and Isle de Jean Charles, Louisiana, rebuilt their communities on safer ground. It's difficult to quantify this kind of event, but one noticeable incident from 2023 that stands out is Tulare Lake, an ancient lake bed that was drained in the 1920s for agriculture. In March, the dry lake began to refill due to the atmospheric river storms that pummelled the state. Heavy farm machinery, orchards, and entire warehouses sunk beneath the water, a kind of modern-day farmyard Atlantis. The intense rainfall in 2023 also caused landslides and floods that devastated entire communities, killed at least 22 people, and caused billions in damage. These kinds of extreme weather events disproportionately impact people of colour and low-economic status, like those in Pajaro, a community in Monterey County, which was flooded after a levee, a type of flood wall, failed. Flooding in Southern California in January 2024 only reiterated the vulnerability of these groups. ""San Diego flooding two weeks ago showed again that disadvantaged communities bear the brunt of flood impacts when infrastructure is overtopped,"" says Brett Sanders, professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Irvine. ""If this storm ends up causing mainstem flood channels to overtop, then once again there will be low-income communities impacted, leaving people scrambling to salvage their belongings and find a place to live while not losing their job from missed work."" What California has experienced so far though, is nothing compared to what might be in store for the region. ""I don't think we can point to recent events as a good indicator of the impacts to come,"" says Swain, ""because these events will be far, far greater – larger, higher impact and more dangerous than what we're seeing now."" The state is beginning to experience what scientists are calling ""hydroclimate whiplash"" – essentially the climate veering wildly between extreme dryness, and extreme wetness. The swings of the pendulum will become greater as the climate warms, increasing these kinds of weather events – meaning Californians will need to adapt to both a drier, and wetter, world. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

economic indicators,Is your postcode area vulnerable to high heat?,2024-09-15,2022-07-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-62243280,"Rising summer temperatures are causing longer and more frequent heatwaves across Great Britain, according to the Met office. BBC analysis estimates that six million people live in places at risk of higher heat during the summer months. Using satellite data from 4 Earth Intelligence, the BBC mapped how vulnerable postcode areas were to extreme heat in England, Wales and Scotland during periods of hot weather over the past three summers - shown with a heat hazard score. If you can't view the postcode lookup, click here. The difference in heat between areas is often due to a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect, where buildings and roads absorb and retain heat and become significantly hotter than surrounding areas with shade or green space. This can be seen in part of Brent, London, seen below. Postcodes next to or near green spaces, such as Roundwood Park, are generally cooler than those surrounded by other buildings over the past three summers, according to the data from 4 Earth Intelligence. A similar effect can be seen with bodies of water in Cardiff Bay. One of the postcodes below, which includes buildings next to the River Taff and a wildlife reserve, are cooler than those in more built up areas nearby. Where is the data from? The potential heat hazard score for each postcode area was calculated by 4EI, who measured the average land surface temperature over a sample of days in the past three summers across Britain. What does my heat hazard score mean? Each score, ranging from one to five, is an indicator of how likely it is that your area will experience high temperatures during hot weather, when compared with other areas in your surrounding neighbourhood. How was the score calculated? A statistical method published by academics was used to standardise land surface temperatures for each postcode area, which involved combining satellite images for different dates over the past three years. The temperature data was then adjusted to consider the different average temperatures of each region, to highlight hotter areas across the country, despite varying climates and temperatures. Each heat hazard score represents different sized groups, as described below. 1 = 40th percentile and lower, if you lined up all the postcodes by heat hazard score, your postcode is in the coolest 40%. 2 = 40th - 70th percentile, your postcode is in the mid-range. 40% of postcodes have a lower heat hazard than yours but 30% have a higher one. 3 = 70th - 90th percentile, your postcode is towards the upper end of the scale. 70% of postcodes have a lower heat hazard than than yours but 10% have a higher one. 4 = 90th - 99th percentile, nine out of 10 postcodes have a lower heat hazard than yours and only 1% have a higher one. 5 = 99th percentile, your postcode area has among the highest heat hazard scores. Why does my postcode show a square block? A single building can contain more than one postcode, such as a block of flats, this is known as a vertical street. On the heat hazard map, postcodes that are part of vertical streets are represented by a square shape. Vertical street postcodes which sit away from the main postcode area, or inside other postcode areas have inherited the heat hazard score from the main postcode they originally belong to. I live in Didcot or Northampton, why is there no data for my area? Postcodes in Didcot and Northampton do not have a heat hazard score.

economic indicators,"Move over, GDP",2024-09-15,2014-04-03,Joe Miller,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-26682206,"Poor GDP.  Everyone seems to be rounding on the once highly regarded economic measure.  Gross domestic product - a measure of the value of goods and services a country produces - is perhaps the most powerful statistical indicator in history, and has a huge influence on global policy.  Yet the main criticism of GDP, raised by none other than Bobby Kennedy back in 1968, is that it ""measures everything... except that which makes life worthwhile"".  In other words, it is hopelessly flawed as a yardstick of human welfare. Indeed, as far back as the 1930s, Simon Kuznets, an early pioneer of GDP, warned that ""the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measure of national income"". But despite several attempts at dethroning GDP, which rose out of the Great Depression and World War Two as an attempt to stabilise economic forecasting, the indicator remains the central measure of a country's success. Enter the Social Progress Imperative, external, an organisation led by Harvard economist Michael Porter. It exists neither to bury nor praise GDP, but to complement it - by compiling an index which measures everything but economic output. ""If you strip out economic indicators,"" says Michael Green, the group's executive director, ""[you can] look at the relationship between economic and social progress and understand it much better."" Mr Green, who worked in international development for many years, proposed the index together with the Economist's New York bureau chief, Matthew Bishop, at a World Economic Forum meeting. The Social Progress Index (SPI) began by gathering data on 54 distinct welfare indicators, all of which broadly fell under three questions:  Does a country provide for its people's most essential needs? Are the building blocks in place for individuals and communities to enhance and sustain wellbeing? Is there opportunity for all individuals to reach their full potential? The resulting table, external, of the 132 countries from which robust data could be sourced, is perhaps least surprising at the top.  All the Nordic countries are in the top 10, along with advanced liberal democracies such as New Zealand, Australia and Canada. Events like the unrest in Egypt could be easier to predict with the SPI The second tier is much more interesting. It includes five members of the G7 - Germany, the UK, Japan, the US and France. Japan's strength, for example, is in the area of basic human needs, but it fares below average on wellbeing and opportunity, and particularly low on tolerance and inclusion.  By contrast, the US scores low on basic human needs - it is 23rd in the world - but is fifth best at providing opportunity. And for a country that spends the most in the world on healthcare, the US performs badly on life expectancy.  Countries with the darkest colours on this map performed best on social progress Although much of the data gathered by the organisation has yet to be processed into meaningful conclusions, the index is providing some interesting lessons about the distinction between economic and social structures. ""Take the Arab Spring,"" says Mr Green. ""You had a bunch of countries who were performing really well economically, and then suddenly this social collapse. ""Clearly a policy based simply on economic growth wasn't working for social harmony."" But a quick glance at the SPI shows the unrest might have been predictable.  Bobby Kennedy said GDP ""does not allow for the health of our children... or the joy of their play"" ""The north African countries all do worst on opportunity,"" Mr Green added. ""It wasn't necessarily material needs that weren't being met, it was the chance to take your life forward - rights, freedoms, choices, tolerance and inclusion."" ""Freedom,"" the famous Labour figure Nye Bevan once said, ""is the by-product of economic surplus"", but the SPI partly contradicts his theory.  While the index does show that extreme poverty and poor social performance go hand-in-hand, the correlation stops once countries reach a certain level of prosperity.  The bottom of the index is the preserve of struggling economies, but oil-rich countries such as Russia and Saudi Arabia also do very badly on social progress.  And New Zealand and Italy, who are very close in terms of GDP, are 29 places apart on the SPI table.  In other words, as Mr Green puts it, ""GDP is not destiny."" There have been several other attempts at complementing or replacing GDP. This video can not be played Sir Gus O'Donnell explains the impact wellbeing research is having on political policy. The UN implemented the human development index, the OECD has a ""better life index"" and even the UK's own Office for National Statistics measures national wellbeing. Recently, Sir Gus O'Donnell, a former senior civil servant in the UK, published a wellbeing and policy report, which investigated the main economic, social and personal drivers of happiness. But the key strength of the SPI, Mr Green claims, is the number of different indicators it measures, and the fact that they can all - from religious tolerance to electricity supplies - be compared with GDP growth. Take political economist Francis Fukuyama's famous problem of ""getting to Denmark"", by which he meant creating societies which mirrored the supposedly peaceful and prosperous Nordic states. ""You can say Denmark is happier than Britain, but what does that mean?"" says Mr Green. ""Do I have to speak Danish? Do I have to watch more episodes of Borgen?"" Analysing which SPI indicators correlate with a rise in happiness could help answer such questions. But there are those who resist the idea that GDP cannot map welfare. Nick Oulton, of the London School of Economics, argues that economic growth can be a good measure of a country's wellbeing. ""It won't solve all problems, but a rise in wealth can lead to declines in infant mortality, increased life expectancy, and people getting healthier because they can afford to eat more food,"" he says.  The anti-GDP camp, he adds, are ""in danger of prompting intrusive policies"". It is almost as if they are saying ""you might think you know what's good for you, but we know better"", he contends. Ultimately, the success of the SPI will be measured by one indicator - its effect on policy decisions. Some countries are already taking notice. In July last year, Paraguay became the first country to officially start using the SPI as a basis for policy decisions.  Representatives from the Social Progress Imperative met Paraguay's president last year; the country has officially adopted the SPI But the real utility of the index will come with comparisons to other data.  Plotting the SPI against government expenditure, for example, may help to finally settle the big versus small government debate. Another test would measure income inequality against social progress, to test the ""spirit level hypothesis"" - does greater income equality foster health and happiness? Meanwhile, experimenting with the data is something the Social Progress Imperative is very keen on indeed. How the US economy is being recalculated What is GDP and how does it affect me?

economic indicators,UK growth rebound eases recession fears,2024-09-15,2019-09-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49632627,"The UK's economy grew faster than expected in July, easing fears that it could fall into recession. The economy grew 0.3% in July, the UK's official statistics body said, helped by the dominant services sector. Growth was flat over the three months to July, but this was an improvement on the 0.2% contraction seen in the April-to-June quarter. This contraction, coupled with some weak business surveys, raised concerns the UK was heading for recession. An economy is generally deemed to be in recession if it contracts for two quarters in a row. However, while growth in the services sector - which accounts for about 80% of the UK economy - helped to drive July's stronger-than-expected growth figure, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) warned that the sector remained weak. ""While the largest part of the economy, the services sector, returned to growth in the month of July, the underlying picture shows services growth weakening through 2019,"" the ONS said. The pound rose in reaction to the figures, rising 0.6% against the dollar to $1.2357. The return to growth in the economy in the month of July will be a political relief for a troubled government keen to avoid recession headlines in early November. It makes unlikely the notion of another consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September, the definition of a recession.  But that does not make the economic reality rosy. In the three months to July, the economy did not grow. Even with a Q3 registering 0.3% growth, it would be the weakest first three quarters of a year since the financial crisis.  Over nine months, much of the volatility around no-deal - stockpiling effects and car industry shutdowns - should have been stripped out too. There is some evidence in the figures that firms are beginning to restart stockpiling in anticipation of the rising possibility of no-deal Brexit next month.  It is difficult to predict how the current political impasse affects those patterns. But a prolonged squeeze on business investment was always going to hit productivity and growth.  The global context is far from benign too, with the German economy looking likely to be in recession and the eurozone as a whole growing sluggishly.  Other survey indicators for the UK look more difficult too. But if July's pattern continued last month and into this, the government should, when full Q3 figures are released in November, be able to avoid the R-word, for now.  The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) also said that concerns remained. ""Although there was a rise in GDP between June and July, the zero growth recorded on the underlying three-month measure points to an economy under pressure from uncertainty over Brexit and weakening global economic conditions,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC. ""The manufacturing sector remains an area of concern, with tightening cash-flow, concerns over disrupted supply chains and weakening demand in key markets weighing on activity in the sector."" Last week, a series of downbeat surveys of various sectors of the economy had raised fears that the UK was at risk of slipping into recession. However, analysts said the latest GDP figures appeared to have dampened these concerns. ""The pick-up in GDP in July is a reassuring sign that the economy is on course to grow at a solid - perhaps even above-trend - rate in Q3,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, adding that figures ""substantially"" weakened the case for any cuts in UK interest rates ""before Britain's Brexit path is known"". ""The upside surprise came from the services sector, which displayed broad-based strength and did not seemingly benefit from any one-off stimuli,"" Mr Tombs said. Analysts also noted that August's growth figure should be boosted by car manufacturers, which were operating last month, contrary to normal practice. Many carmakers had brought their annual shutdown forward for the original Brexit date in March. ""GDP will get a further boost of about 0.2% in August, when car manufacturers will be at work when they are usually on holiday,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. ""Overall, the economy is still fairly weak - we estimate that the underlying pace of growth is around +0.2% quarter-on-quarter - but it's not in recession. Political chaos, yes. Economic chaos, no."""
economic indicators,UK economy grows on camping and dining out,2024-09-15,2021-10-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58894904,"The UK economy grew by 0.4% in August as more people dined out, went on holiday and attended music festivals. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the services sector made the biggest contribution to economic growth in the first full month after all Covid restrictions were lifted in England. It said arts, entertainment and recreation grew 9%, boosted by sports clubs, amusement parks and festivals. There was also more demand for hotels and campsites.  Restrictions on social distancing were eased from 19 July. The ONS said the economy is now 0.8% smaller than it was before the pandemic. ""The economy picked up in August as bars, restaurants and festivals benefited from the first full month without Covid-19 restrictions in England,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""However, later and slightly weaker data from a number of industries now mean we estimate the economy fell a little overall in July."" The ONS said economic growth fell by 0.1% in July compared with initial estimates of 0.1% growth.  Activity in accommodation and food services rose by 10.3% in August, within which hotels and campsites recorded 22.9% growth. In travel, air transport and rail both grew in August as Covid-related measures eased, however both industry are still trading far below pre-pandemic levels.  Emma-Lou Montgomery associate director at Fidelity International, said that while August's growth ""marks a small rebound"" on July, ""the worry remains that economic growth won't even be in touching distance of pre-pandemic levels until well into next year"". She said supply chain disruption risks dampening consumer confidence. ""This all comes in the crucial lead up to Christmas, when suppliers and retailers should be firing on all cylinders,"" Ms Montgomery said.""But with households facing steep price rises for everyday items, from the food shop through to the gas bill, there will be little desire - or capacity - to spend, spend, spend."" Growth in the economy - everything produced, from new cars to haircuts to restaurant meals - isn't at all slow by normal standards at 0.4% in a month. But we're supposed to be bouncing back with growth of 7% this year.  What's becoming increasingly clear, is that it's not a lack of demand for goods and services that's holding the recovery back but the inability of firms to supply that demand.  A big part of the reason? Shortages. In construction, for example, where business is not growing but shrinking, firms reported to the ONS that they've got healthy order books. But they can't meet more orders, partly because of a shortage of materials in August (for example, wood and steel) and partly because of a shortage of skilled staff.  The ONS reports evidence that the shortage of haulage drivers is slowing down industries from pharmaceuticals to electric lighting. Exports of goods, too, are down by 13% compared with 2018.  Some of these shortages may be due to supply bottlenecks related to the post-pandemic global surge in activity. But without doubt some, notably the ongoing shortage of lorry drivers, are in large part related to Brexit.  Elsewhere, economic growth was uneven with some sectors hit by shortages of materials. Output in construction fell by 0.2% in August and the sector remains 1.5% below pre-pandemic levels. The ONS said: ""This reflects recent challenges faced by the construction industry from rising input prices and delays to the availability of construction products - notably steel, concrete, timber and glass."" The manufacturing sector expanded by 0.5% in August following a 0.6% in July. The ONS said growth was led by an increase in vehicle production ""as it continues to recover following supply side challenges predominantly caused by the global microchip shortage disrupting car production"". But it said the output in the manufacture of motor vehicles remains 14.5% below a peak in February this year. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""Such drags may have become more widespread and significant in September and October, with the fuel crisis preventing some people from getting to work."" He said Capital Economics' activity indicator ""suggests that GDP may not have increased at all in September"". Martin Beck, economist at professional services firm, EY,said: ""The recovery is certainly facing more headwinds. ""Rising inflation, driven by significant increases in energy prices, and the recent cut in Universal Credit are squeezing consumers' spending power."""
economic indicators,Japan's economy falls into recession,2024-09-15,2014-11-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30077122,"Japan's economy contracts for a second quarter in a row Japan's economy unexpectedly shrank for the second consecutive quarter, leaving the world's third largest economy in technical recession. Gross domestic product (GDP) fell at an annualised 1.6% from July to September, compared with forecasts of a 2.1% rise. That followed a revised 7.3% contraction in the second quarter, which was the biggest fall since the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Economists said the weak economic data could delay a sales tax rise. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is widely expected to call a snap election to seek a mandate to delay an increase in the sales tax to 10%, scheduled for 2015. The tax increase was legislated by the previous government in 2012 to curb Japan's huge public debt, which is the highest among developed nations. April saw the first phase of the sales tax increase, from 5% to 8%, which hit growth in the second quarter and still appears to be having an impact on the economy. The economy shrank 0.4% in the third quarter from the quarter previous.  The data also showed that growth in private consumption, which accounts for about 60% of the economy, was much weaker than expected.  The next tax rise had already been put in question by already weak economic indicators.  ""The Japanese economy is in recession and has now contracted in three of the last four quarters,"" said Glenn Levine, senior economist at Moody's Analytics.  ""The most likely course is now a snap election in December in which voters choose, naturally enough, to delay the tax increase.""  Speculation had been growing that the Japanese prime minister would call an election next month to gain support just two years after his election. Local media are now reporting that Mr Abe could announce the next election as early as Tuesday to be held on 14 December. There is growing speculation that Mr Abe could call an early general election The Japanese government's chief spokesperson Yoshihide Suga said on Monday that Mr Abe was expected to decide on various steps to take amid the ""severe economic situation"". While Mr Abe's popularity has fallen since he took office in 2012, he is expected to win if an election were called, because the opposition remains divided. In reaction to the negative economic data, the dollar went above 117 Japanese yen before settling back at 115.69. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index, meanwhile, closed down almost 3% to 16,973.80, marking its biggest one-day drop since August. Where did Abenomics go wrong? In the spring of 2013, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe launched an ambitious growth strategy that rapidly became known as Abenomics.  Its aim was to drag Japan's economy out of 20 years of deflation and put it back on the road to growth. Billions of dollars were pumped into the economy through stimulus spending. The Bank of Japan went on an even bigger spree, printing hundreds of billions of dollars of new money and using it to buy government bonds.   This had two effects. First, it pushed down the value of the yen, which made Japanese exports cheaper. Second, it pushed investors out of bonds and in to stocks. The Tokyo stock market soared. By mid-2013 Japan's economy was back in what looked like solid growth.  Then, in early 2014, Mr Abe's government took a calculated gamble. With the economy growing he could risk putting up taxes for the first time in nearly 20 years. Consumption (purchase) tax would rise from 5 to 8%. The tax rise was urgently needed to plug the giant hole in Japan's public finances.  But the gamble has not paid off. Japanese consumers have stopped spending and the economy is back in recession. Why? The fall in the yen gave a huge cash windfall to Japanese exporters. But instead of increasing the wages of their employees, they have sat on the money.  The huge stock market rise only benefited a minority of rich people. 80% of Japanese people do not own any shares. Instead, their incomes are stagnant or falling, and the tax rise has made them feel even poorer. Hence they have stopped spending.

economic indicators,Is Donald Trump winning?,2024-09-15,2017-12-05,Jon Sopel,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42242839,"This president has played a lot of golf since he won the election. He seems to do a lot of his business on the lush Trump properties - senators are invited to come and play a round while he can bend their ear to back this or that cause.  The way the president does business is not always pretty. There seems to be unnecessary noise and more collateral damage than there needs to be.  But who cares that you shanked the ball off the 3rd or hit the ball into the trees on the 5th and found the water on the 14th? It's all about how you get yourself out of the rough.  The recovery shot. The scramble out of trouble. And every time you think that President Trump finds his ball buried under the sand in a huge bunker, he seems somehow to chip the ball into the hole and emerge smiling. The headlines have been dominated in recent days - understandably - by what is unfolding with the investigation of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, into whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  We have seen former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn pleading guilty to lying to the FBI, but more interesting is the fact that Flynn is now co-operating with the Mueller investigation.  And we have seen some rather odd tweets from the president's account, which now we're being told weren't written by him.  Every day - sometimes it seems every hour - there is a new development that will dominate the news cycle. Stories that you think will last a week because of their seeming enormity come and go like passing spring showers, as we await the next downpour.  President retweets videos from a far-right British group and gets into spat with Theresa May - been and gone.  He says FBI reputation is in tatters - a passing squall.  Supporting Roy Moore for the vacant Alabama Senate seat, even though he's an alleged paedophile (which he denies)? Whatever.  Rows with basketball players for not being grateful enough barely make a puddle.  And it's my suspicion that in millions of homes across America (particularly those that voted for Donald Trump just over a year ago) this is all filtered out as so much noise and static.  Of more interest will be the Senate passing a tax reform bill. And yes, while it will help billionaires more than it will low-paid America (I suspect not that many will benefit from the tax relief on private jets), it will nevertheless benefit them a bit.  And there are signs that wages are picking up for blue-collar workers. Unemployment is very low, which means in some sectors there are labour shortages, which in turn means that pay is having to rise to attract workers.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics is seeing big growth in demand for production and transportation jobs.  Meanwhile, big business America is promising that the slashing of the corporation tax rate that Congress is promising will filter through to greater investment, which in turn will lead to more jobs and higher wages. There is a buoyancy out there.  And if you are someone whose pension is tied up in the stock market, you will be looking at the performance of Wall Street and thinking that every day is Christmas, as this president will repeatedly remind you.  The performance of shares (a fickle indicator) has been extraordinary. Confidence is returning.  OK, if you are being pernickety then yes, this bull run on the stock market predates Donald Trump coming to power - the market has been on an upward tick for years.  And ditto - the promise of trickle-down economics has been made before with decidedly mixed results.  But President Trump is nothing if not a great marketeer - and he will make sure he owns every favourable economic indicator that emerges.  And he will make sure every American will be told to believe it is all down to him. Just look at his Twitter feed - the multiple exclamation marks tell you what he thinks. And then you look at the president's travel ban from six Muslim-majority countries - something which has caused a good deal of outrage around the world, but which was one of his populist key promises during the campaign.  The battle is not finished yet, and it may be months or even years before the Supreme Court delivers a final verdict.  But the justices gave the president an important fillip this week. They voted by seven to two to allow the wholesale implementation of the measure, pending the outcome of the various legal challenges. That was an important legal victory.  And there are a whole range of smaller ticket items where the president has slashed at regulations that were unpopular with his grassroots supporters. For these people he is doing what he promised.  I suspect the latest twist in the Russia probe is being met with a barely stifled yawn. And this is having a positive effect on all those jittery Republican lawmakers, as they eye the midterms next November.  There is a bit of a change in mood... if tax reform gets through, if the markets continue to rise, if the president can stay out of too much trouble (he's never going to be a choirboy, they accept) then maybe there are more victories to be had. Going back to golf, one of the great sayings is that there are no pictures on a scorecard. In other words it may not be elegant, your swing may be a heave, you might get lucky with the ball rebounding off the tree - you can win ugly, but as long as you win, that's all the scorecard is going to record.  This president only cares about the scorecard."
economic indicators,Bank of England says interest rates close to peak,2024-09-15,2023-09-06,Tom Espiner & Dharshini David,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66733193,"Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has said interest rates are close to their peak, but that they may still have further to rise. He told MPs ""we are much nearer now to the top of the cycle"" of rate rises. The Bank has hiked rates 14 times in a row as it tries to slow the fastest pace of price rises among the world's big economies. It is expected to raise borrowing costs again later this month, taking the Bank rate to 5.5%. The theory is that raising interest rates makes it more expensive to borrow money, meaning people have less to spend, reducing demand and slowing inflation, which is the rate at which prices rise. But the Bank rate is currently at its highest level for 15 years, and inflation has remained stubbornly high. Although inflation fell to 6.8% in the year to July - down from 7.9% in June - it is still much higher than the government's target of 2%. Speaking to MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Bailey said there was evidence that it may be slowing. But it was not clear how much that would reduce the pace of wage growth, which recently hit a record high. Wage growth can bolster inflation.  ""Many of the indicators are now moving as we would expect them to move, and are signalling that the fall in inflation will continue and - as I've said a number of times - I think will be quite marked by the end of this year,"" he said. ""The question now is as headline inflation comes down, will we see inflation expectations continue to come down? And will that be reflected into wage bargaining?"" he added. Britain's economic activity may be cooling after the sharp rise in borrowing costs, but quickly rising wages have been a focus for the Bank. Mr Bailey's remarks may mean a smaller increase in rates in the coming months than markets had expected.But he emphasised that the next decision, on 21 September, will still depend on the latest evidence, including data on jobs, growth, wages and inflation. He also said again that interest rates may stay high for a while, echoing earlier comments. More than half of mortgage holders have been hit by the higher rates so far and many more are set to be squeezed as their fixed rate deals expire in the coming months. They may face a rise in monthly repayments of hundreds of pounds or more."
economic indicators,NI economy 'performs solidly' but pressure builds,2024-09-15,2022-05-09,John Campbell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-61355179,"The Northern Ireland economy continued to perform solidly in April, an Ulster Bank survey has suggested. However, inflation and supply chain issues are continuing to build. The bank's monthly survey of private sector activity is considered to be a reliable indicator of the economy. It suggests retail, services and manufacturing all saw continued growth in April. However, construction reported another fall in output. It has been most exposed to supply chain problems, The bank's chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said manufacturing and services are ""running into capacity constraints"". ""Skills shortages, coupled with strong demand, have resulted in backlogs mounting at rapid rates,"" he added. ""Lengthening supplier delivery times are adding to these difficulties. These backlogs should guarantee relatively strong rates of growth in business activity in the near term. ""But optimism for the year ahead remains relatively muted with the cost of-living crisis making retailers the least optimistic for the year ahead."" The survey comes amid darkening prospects for the UK economy. Last week, the Bank of England warned the UK faced a ""sharp economic slowdown"" this year. The bank's policymakers expect the UK economy to shrink rather than expand in the final three months of this year.  It is also expects the economy to contract by 0.25% in 2023, down from its previous forecast of 1.25% growth. While that would not technically be a recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive quarters - it would leave the UK at a real risk of one."
