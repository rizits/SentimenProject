Debt Market Sentiment,Why this US jobs report matters and what to watch,2024-09-14,2024-09-05,Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyne60ln20o,"If you care about where the US economy is headed, you might want to keep an eye on events on Friday. At 08:30 ET (13.30 BST), the US Labor Department will release the results of its monthly jobs surveys of employers and households. The report is one of the most important gauges of the state of the world's largest economy - and it is coming at a critical time. The US presidential campaign, in which voters have identified the economy as a top concern, is under way. And after several years focused on inflation worries, attention is starting to turn to the job market. Last month, the Labor Department reported the unemployment rate had hit 4.3% in July, up from 3.5% a year earlier, as jobs growth slowed. The news helped to fuel several days of stock market turmoil. If Friday's report shows further cracks forming in the job market that would be bad news for Democrats, undermining the story they have been telling of an economy that is healthy, if slowing, and returning to sustainable growth, after a post-pandemic boom.  How much we should worry is still up for debate.  Such an increase in unemployment often signals an economic recession - but forecasters say that prediction is less certain this time, noting factors like a surge in immigration that have complicated the picture.  Other data suggest the rise in unemployment rate has been driven by more people looking for work, rather than a sharp rise in job cuts.  Friday's report will help to flesh out that puzzle, offering a key piece of evidence as voters' impressions start to cement ahead of the November vote.  Republicans have been keen to point to any bad news – a stock market stumble, lower growth figures, slowing business investment and a dip in hiring – as evidence that a change of leadership in Washington is necessary. Part of what has kept Democrats on the defensive about the economy is the unusual mix of forces at play right now.  The US central bank raised borrowing costs sharply two years ago, responding to prices that were jumping at the fastest rate since the 1980s.  The Federal Reserve said the moves - which brought its key lending rate to a roughly two decade high of 5.3% - would help get inflation under control.  But the way they do that is by discouraging business expansions and other big spending and dampening the pressures pushing up prices.  Put more simply, the Fed is deliberately slowing the economy. That often doesn't end well.  Historically, a big jump in rates typically ends in a recession - and the stock market has been jittery over any signs that the economy is headed for a ""hard landing"". Donald Trump has fanned the fears, for months predicting an economic ""crash"" - especially if his opponent is elected. Polls suggest a majority of Americans have already spent much of the last few years believing the economy is in recession - a downbeat assessment at odds with the country's 2.5% growth last year. Many analysts blame the disconnect on inflation, as households balk at prices that have jumped nearly 20% over four years.  But the urgency of that issue has abated, as wages rise and inflation subsides, dropping to 2.9% in the most recent official reading - the slowest pace since March 2021. That has set the stage for the Fed to lower interest rates for the first time in four years, which could bring further financial relief, leading to lower borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, credit cards and other forms of debt. Friday's job report will be key to confirming the timing and size of the cut - and if it is actually likely to end up boosting sentiment and helping Democrats, as expected.  For now, most analysts expect a cut of 0.25 percentage points, which would signal an ongoing, orderly slowdown.  If the figures fuel worries about the economy, however, a bigger cut might be in order - though a cut driven by a stuttering economy and Americans losing jobs would hardly prove a benefit to Democrats.  Conversely, booming jobs numbers might make the bank rethink whether the economy is still running too hot and a cut is necessary at all.  That has left the Harris campaign in a peculiar position - hoping for a good jobs report, but not a great one.  In a closely watched speech last month, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell left his options for how big a cut might be on the table.  Friday's jobs report may start closing some doors. "
Debt Market Sentiment,"High mortgage rates pricing out buyers, says Nationwide",2024-09-14,2024-07-01,Nick Edser,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp081z9vre4o,"High mortgage rates mean affordability is still ""stretched"" for many home buyers, according to the Nationwide. The building society said that while earnings had been rising faster than house prices in recent years, this had not been enough to offset the impact of more expensive mortgages. Its comments came as it said house price growth had been ""broadly stable"" in June, with prices up 0.2% from the previous month. The average house price is now £266,064, the lender said. Prices were up 1.5% from a year earlier, but Nationwide said activity in the housing market had been ""broadly flat"" over the past 12 months, with transactions down by about 15% compared with 2019. The lender said the market was still being affected by the increase in mortgage rates, which started climbing after the Bank of England began to raise its key interest rate in late 2021. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that mortgage rates are ""still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic"". ""For example, the interest rate on a five-year fixed rate mortgage for a borrower with a 25% deposit was 1.3% in late 2021, but in recent months this has been nearer to 4.7%. ""As a result, housing affordability is still stretched."" Nationwide's figures are based on the building society's own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales. The impact of higher borrowing costs can be seen in the fact that transactions involving a mortgage are down by nearly 25% over the past year, Nationwide said. Meanwhile the number of cash transactions for properties is about 5% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Across the UK, Northern Ireland saw the biggest price increases, up 4.1% from a year earlier. Wales and Scotland both saw a 1.4% annual rise. Prices in England climbed by 0.6%, with northern regions seeing bigger increases in general than the south. Despite some major lenders cutting their mortgage rates last week, home loan costs remain far higher than pre-pandemic levels. According to financial information service Moneyfacts, the average rate on a two-year fixed mortgage deal stands at 5.95%, while for a five-year deal the average is  5.53%. The focus is now on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, to see if it decides to cut at its next meeting on 1 August. June's MPC meeting saw a change in tone from policymakers, with suggestions that the Bank could vote for a rate cut next month. ""Buyers may find their mojo again when we get a rate cut from the Bank of England,"" said Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""This could come as early as August, although sticky services inflation and higher wages could mean we need to wait until the autumn. ""Either way, we’re not expecting massive overnight drops in mortgage rates, so the reaction is more likely to be a muted upturn in sentiment than an overwhelming wave of optimism."" Last week, the Bank said that about three million households are set to see their mortgage payments rise in the next two years. These are homeowners who arranged mortgage deals before the Bank started to lift rates in 2021. These deals are now expiring, and the Bank said the majority will finish before the end of 2026. For the typical household looking for a new deal, monthly mortgage repayments are forecast to increase by about £180, or about 28%, the Bank said. However, for around 400,000 households, monthly payments could jump by 50% or more. Bank of England figures released on Monday showed a small fall in the number of mortgages approved in May, down to 60,000 from 60,800 in April. However, the data also showed the amount borrowed through mortgages dropped sharply to £1.2bn in May, from £2.2bn the month before, although this does not include those remortgaging with the same lender.

Debt Market Sentiment,Stratford market traders: 'It's good to be back',2024-09-14,2024-05-17,Barry Caffrey & James W Kelly,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnkekl1nj23o,"Traders at an east London market saved from closure have expressed their relief at being able to reopen. Stratford's Market Village was forced to close in January after the company that ran the site went into administration. Newham Council has now agreed to take on a 15-year lease for the site thanks to a £700,000 grant from the mayor of London's Good Growth Fund. The market, which has about 60 traders, reopened last Friday. Caribbean takeaway owner Samantha Scott said she was ""grateful and thankful"" to be able to reopen. ""It's good to be back - it feels like we were taken away from our home,"" she said. As part of the agreement, the council will be able to operate the market itself or assign the lease to another market operator. The market has been serving customers out of Stratford Centre since 1974. Abdul Qadir, who has run a phone shop in the market for 24 years, said: ""The feeling is good.  ""I'm soon going to be out of debt, I can pay my staff and my livelihood is going to be good."" He added: ""We feel like [the closure] was a bad dream."" Angela Akbas, who has run the Centre Cafe for more than 20 years, said the market acts as a community hub for many people.  ""This would have been a big loss to the community,"" she said.  ""This market brings entrepreneurship, diversity, it's multicultural and caters for everybody's needs."" ""We get people that come in with no families and nobody to talk to. They come in and have a chat with me and it makes them feel good,"" she added. The sentiment is echoed by some of Ms Akbas's customers. Maureen told BBC London she was ""very glad"" the market had reopened and gave Ms Akbas ""a cuddle"" when the cafe returned to business. ""This shopping centre is vital because these are small independent businesses,"" adds Michelle, another market customer. ""They depend on locals to support them.""

Debt Market Sentiment,How it went wrong for Project Sunak,2024-09-14,2024-05-15,Laura Kuenssberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy6332vx5n8o,"""He's like a children’s TV presenter - the more people see, the more they don't like."" This comment comes not from an opponent of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak but a supporter, who acknowledges things have not gone as they would have liked. In a wide-ranging speech earlier this week, the prime minister attempted to draw vivid dividing lines between his government and Labour. It was a reminder that we are hurtling towards an election sooner rather than later. The Conservatives had hoped they'd be closing the gap by now. So why has project Sunak failed to fire? Is it his personality, is it the battered party he took over or is it that the public has simply had enough? I've spent the past fortnight speaking to 20 people who have worked up close with Rishi Sunak. These are not disgruntled MPs or those who wished him ill from the start. They are ministers, staffers and officials (either current or former), who believed the Sunak project had a chance of turning things around, however slim that chance. A few genuinely believe Mr Sunak may yet be his party's saviour and others stress that he inherited appalling political gravity. But others are not so kind. Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you. After the meltdown of the Liz Truss administration, he formed a government, kept the markets happy and worked out Northern Ireland, one insider points out. If you think back to the wild moments of autumn 2022, that is no mean feat. ""He followed advice to treat it like a coalition government at the start, to stabilise the ship,"" a former minister tells me. One Whitehall insider said they ""slept easier"" when he moved into No 10. ""He is a decent man who is not in it for himself. He is all duty and hard work. I never saw him try to play the upside to gather power."" Many of the sources I spoke to told me he is ""the cleverest person in the room"", or the ""smartest person in the meeting"". One of his colleagues reckons he is ""frighteningly well briefed... he's unmatched"". Rishi Sunak is an unusual politician. One example is the story of Carol and Jo.  During the early part of the pandemic, Rishi Sunak made almost hourly calls to them. They were relatively junior civil servants working on designing and building the new system for furlough. This was the chancellor taking personal and painstaking care with the details of an important new policy. He'd host massive Zoom calls, and ask for tiny details from the desk officers directly responsible for particular pieces of policy, rather than rely on more senior civil servants. I can't emphasise enough, for a top level politician, this is not normal behaviour. They normally prefer making decisions to trying to master all the details. But his style of including officials no matter their status, meant ""the Treasury loved him from day one"", according to a senior figure. When Rishi Sunak arrived in No 10, the details man, apparently shorn of the ego of so many at Westminster, made politics a little more normal again. His style had made him extremely popular as the Chancellor. There was a point when he ""had net favourability in every part of the country"", one insider recalls. He was more popular than the Tory Party and the hope was that he could pull the party's ratings up to his level. But it is the opposite that has happened. One of Rishi Sunak’s mantras is ""Politics is like the stockmarket – believe in the fundamentals, not the noise"", a hangover from his past as a hedge fund manager. He reckons the small ups and downs of Westminster don't matter compared with the long-term trends. And after three months in office, in January 2023, it was time for Mr Sunak to define the substance. He announced his now famous five pledges: he vowed to halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce national debt, cut waiting lists and stop the small boats. The thinking was to show an unflashy politician who would calmly make vows and keep them. He would under-promise and over-deliver, in his typical mashup of political and management speak. ""The people's priorities are the Government's priorities,"" the PM said. There are those who insist this wasn't merely politics by polling metrics. According to one Cabinet minister: ""It was a bit of both - what focus groups wanted and what he believed in."" But others point to this moment as where things started to go wrong. Some colleagues believe it was a shopping list of pledges that was never going to excite or persuade. ""The five pledges were rushed out the door in January,"" a party veteran tells me. ""He should have gone harder and bolder."" Others reckon Mr Sunak picked the right issues, but that his central message has failed because while inflation has halved, he hasn't yet been able to tick all five things off his list. ""He chose hard things, and he sticks to his guns, even if it’s harder and takes longer,"" a defender says. After Boris Johnson’s bluster, and Liz Truss' hundred-mile-an-hour ideological experiment, Rishi Sunak’s business-like, non-ideological approach could have seemed like an advantage – thank God for a grown up, eh? But for some, there's the problem. ""The most successful politicians at the very top level are the ones who have very strong beliefs and instincts – his approach looks like a series of transactions or problems to be solved,"" a former official who admires Sunak told me. Another source who worked closely with him said: ""He thinks that working really hard and being good is enough. Being PM is art, not science - and he is no artist."" ""We’re like a government of civil servants,"" a serving minister tells me. What started out as Rishi Sunak’s advantage now often seems like a negative. It's not been an easy journey for a prime minister whose life has been defined until now by hard work and success. With those sky-high ratings as chancellor came ""a belief that you are amazing and good"", according to one insider. There is a sense of frustration around his operation that somehow it's not quite fair that his hard work hasn't come good. ""He is thin skinned, he can't cope with people disagreeing with him,"" one source said. ""He’s surrounded himself with people who are friends and think he's great. So they all just reinforce each other."" ""There's an awful bunker mentality – it's a very weird time,"" another minister says. The lack of political progress is not for want of trying. In the summer of 2023, No 10 decided to try to set a new narrative: the country would see the ""real Rishi"". It would be a chance to create his own agenda rather than be just the PM who cleared up the mess. It was always a stretch to bill Mr Sunak as the ""change"" candidate, when the Conservatives had been in power for so long, but Boris Johnson had pulled it off. Sunak ""sat down in the summer to think about what his legacy should be"", a minister at the time tells me. He came up with what the minister described as a series of ""eclectic ideas"" that included banning smoking, long-term reform of A-Levels in England and scrapping a major chunk of HS2, all co-ordinated with a big conference rebrand. Despite weeks of build-up, it fell flat. ""I don’t know a single MP who wanted to put any of those things on their leaflets. It just showed he didn't really know where he wanted to go."" ""It was one of those moments where you look at it,"" another current cabinet minister told me, ""and think I'm not sure I object to any of it, but I'm not sure I see the point of it."" There was a palpable sense that week among Conservative ranks, if this is the real Rishi, is that really it? It's not even clear it made the main man himself happy. ""He started to sound a bit more self-pitying,"" another politician who knows him well tells me. ""He felt like the world was on his shoulders. He had nobly stepped up to do it when no-one else wanted it. No-one is forcing you to do it. That’s just an annoying approach."" What nobody disputes is that Rishi Sunak inherited a political party in a huge mess. Many of the sources I've spoken to say the state of the Conservative Party is Rishi Sunak's number one problem. There's a whole generation of MPs who learned the habit of sniping at each other in public. ""The number of scars that everyone carries, that’s been the hardest thing to overcome,"" one No 10 insider says. Another former minister suggests Sunak's appeal for discipline and order in the party was destined to fall on deaf ears because many believe he was part of the effort to unseat Boris Johnson. One cabinet minister talks me through all the factions in the party, none of them tied particularly to Rishi Sunak, each more grumpy than the last. ""The red wall lot who are proper panickers; 100 or so ex-ministers on the backbenches, most of whom think they should be PM; the Truss gang who just want Rishi to be embarrassed; and the Johnson gang who still blame Sunak for their hero’s downfall."" One minister tells me the prime minister is not particularly a creature of the party: ""No-one feels Rishi is a leader, even if he is trying his best."" But has he done enough to try? Rishi Sunak's choices at his autumn reshuffle last year might have been a moment when he had a chance to shake the party out of its doldrums. Bringing back David Cameron grabbed plentiful headlines and reassured some parts of the Tory party that ""the grown ups are back"". He hung on to Jeremy Hunt, and experienced ministers like Grant Shapps and Steve Barclay. He promoted a few younger allies, like Clare Coutinho and Laura Trott. But in terms of public perception, did the return of David Cameron achieve much other than undermining Rishi Sunak’s claim to be the ""change candidate""? ""It was the turning point,"" one cabinet minister tells me - but not in a good way. ""If you are going to show change and reset and refresh, you have to appoint more people like Clare Coutinho, not Grant Shapps."" The diplomatic way of describing the atmosphere in the Tory party in 2024 according to a loyal Sunak insider is this: ""We have to work to counter a lot of noise from lots of bits of the party. ""When you are in charge during a difficult time, people are frustrated, the leader will always get some blame for that. I think people think he is a decent guy who is trying hard."" By any measure, the party has been consumed by grudges and unhappiness. There's a joke doing the rounds in Westminster. Have you heard the one about the Conservative MP who has just published a letter? It says he is standing at the general election! More than 60 Conservative MPs have announced they're not standing again, sometimes because of retirement or the prospect of losing, but many of them are simply exhausted by the tensions and the tantrums. And here’s the irony: one of Rishi Sunak’s strengths early in his political career was that he wasn’t identified with one particular political faction or tribe. He was seen as highly competent, pleasant, destined for high office, not invested in the nonsensical game-playing of SW1. Yet while he has a strong and powerful group of loyal advisers and officials, and a core of the party who thinks he is highly capable, there is no sense of a political army who will battle to win. The broad coalition of voters that Boris Johnson was able to create was a stretch that perhaps no-one would have been able to hold together. ""You can’t dump Theresa, Boris, Liz and install another leader and expect the public to go 'thanks very much, you’ve done a great job',"" says one of those I spoke to. ""That has created utter carnage."" Mr Sunak's most ardent backers say that after the Tory party’s many bouts of political madness in the past few years, ""the public just doesn’t want to listen"". ""It's just about the pendulum swing - it is not about the party, and the PM's personality is fine,"" one loyalist tells me. Another felt things were negative, despite progress on those early pledges. ""There is just a cynicism, which applies to all parties."" Nobody is claiming that turning the mood of a public that feels hard up and cross is easy. But Mr Sunak's style, one of his admirers says, has felt like an uncomfortable clash with that: ""You see a very happy, wealthy person - in a national context that is not appropriate."" One source told me: ""You can't blame the public, if you voted for us in 2019 and you thought we'd build you a new hospital and you look across your road and we haven't, then that's not on the public. They are disappointed."" So what happens next? Mr Sunak and his team are putting a lot of stock in being able to show the economy is shifting for the better. They need that to cut through. ""He's happiest when he’s doing stuff,"" one of his confidants tells me. He has a spring in his step with recent announcements on welfare, defence, and much better numbers on the economy, they tell me. Mr Sunak’s set piece speech on Monday marked another attempt to shift the argument, to turn the fire on Labour, inviting comparisons between himself and Keir Starmer. It is true that a lot could go wrong for Keir Starmer. The economy going ""gangbusters"" (not my word, that was the ONS Chief Economist Grant Fitzner last week) may yet carry real sway with the public. Voters in the 2020s are volatile. But does the eternally outwardly cheerful Rishi Sunak really think he can pull it back? ""I think he is fairly sure that going from where he is now to winning is a stretch,"" says one source. Other Conservatives hope that under the crazy pressure of a general election campaign, the public will be less impressed with Keir Starmer than the polls currently suggest. ""He’s like a plastic tree - he looks good from a distance but the closer you get, you realise he’s not the real thing,"" they snipe. As things stand though, there is no doubt the initial hopes of Project Sunak have been dashed. Remember that by this stage they reckoned they would have been closing the gap on Labour, and looking competitive in an election. That may yet come. But the sense that Rishi Sunak could have represented a powerful fresh start has gone. ""He could have been that game-changer leader,"" one of those who believed in him told me. ""The Tories choosing an Asian leader is such an amazing opportunity potentially, and perhaps it's yet again another example,"" adding with a brutal comparison ""that as with Gordon Brown, the guy who is the number two is actually the number two."" Rishi Sunak will not give up without a fight. The shopping list of demands was always a hefty one - a leader required to settle the nerves of the financial markets and the country after weeks of market chaos, to pull together a political party after years of fighting amongst itself, and then to win over a cynical and exhausted public after waves of crises and self-inflicted calamity. The common denominator of political events in the last five years is they have been hard to predict. Despite the polls it is way too soon to say it's game over for Project Sunak. Some reflect it was a job that was perhaps always going to be bigger than just one man. Others still wonder if that had to be the case. But in the end, politics is not like the stock market. Its fundamentals are a tangle of philosophy, sentiment, emotion and argument about what has gone before, as well as the now. Put like that, for many around Rishi Sunak, the fundamentals don't look so good after all.

Debt Market Sentiment,Domestic tourism soars in China but foreigners stay away,2024-09-14,2024-05-09,By Stephen McDonell,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-68982645,"With the Chinese economy facing massive challenges, there have been concerns over its growth potential, at least in the immediate future. Yet a key exception is emerging in the form of domestic tourism. Last week's five-day public holiday to mark labour day saw 295 million trips made within China, according to figures from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. This was 28% higher than pre-pandemic figures recorded in 2019. The Transport Ministry's figures are also staggering: 92 million rail trips; almost 10 million air trips and 1.25 billion highway journeys. However, this comes as international arrivals continue to lag, with foreigners currently entering China at barely 30% of 2019 levels. Why the disparity? The beautiful historical river town of Wuzhen, a short drive from Shanghai, is considered one of China's top visitor sites for travellers of all types. When we arrive the little pathways and old bridges which cross narrow waterways are filled with visitors. A popular thing to do in Wuzhen is to pose for photos dressed in traditional hanfu clothing - as if you have really been transported back hundreds of years. Two women in their 20s, friends since high school, are visiting from Jilin Province in the north east. After arriving, they spend an hour getting their hair done in an elaborate imperial-era style - and they are full of praise for Wuzhen's classical beauty.  We ask if, following the post-Covid opening up, many of their family and other friends have been travelling much? ""Of course, after the pandemic, we're all visiting other places."" Nearby a local man who is selling ice-creams also says tourist numbers are ""not that bad lately"". As good as before Covid? ""Almost the same,"" he replies. Shopkeeper Wang Ying, who sells traditional snacks, echoes this sentiment with a big smile on her face. ""Business is going well, and it'll only get better."" All this will be seen as good news for the Chinese government. It's been saying that a push on domestic consumption can counter the significant faltering portions of the economy. Major players in the once-mighty property sector are struggling to stay afloat, local government debt continues to rise, and persistent youth unemployment has left highly qualified university graduates uncertain of their future. Amid all these challenges, the Communist Party has set a target of ""around 5%"" GDP growth for this year. Apart from the fact that analysts have long questioned the veracity of the country's official growth figures, economists are also asking how such a target can be reached, in any genuine sense, in 2024 without significant extra stimulus. One lifeline could be a more buoyant travel scene which could bring broader business opportunities and greater service industry employment. Schubert Lou, chief operating officer at travel agency Trip.com, told the BBC: ""We've seen very strong domestic travel demand with search volumes in hotels up 67% compared to last year, and flight volumes up 80%."" Tourism industry consultant Peng Han from Travel Daily is following the investment trail to see how the business community really views the possibilities in the sector. ""With famous international hotel brands - like Intercontinental, Marriott and Hilton - you just have to look at their growth in China in 2023,"" he says. ""Then check the performance goals for these large hotel groups in 2024 which have also been set relatively high. This shows that they are very optimistic about the growth potential of the Chinese market."" But, while the volume of local travellers might be up, Mr Peng does point to the problem of per capita consumption which remains persistently low. He says general uncertainty about the Chinese economy is putting more emphasis on saving, so people are looking for good value options. They are going on holidays and paying for things but doing so much more frugally. This is where an increase in big-spending foreigners could help. But they are simply not travelling to China in the numbers they used to.  In 2019, nearly 98 million international visitors came to the country. Last year it was only 35 million - including business trips, students and the like. Mr Lou describes the domestic versus international market as ""uneven"". For many in the tourism industry here specialising in services for foreign travellers, ""uneven"" would be an understatement. Three years of harsh Covid prevention measures drove down arrivals from other countries, but that alone can't account for the current situation. Huang Songshan, the head of the Centre for Tourism Research in the School of Business and Law at Australia's Edith Cowan University, blames this weakness in part to ""the shifting geopolitical landscape globally"". In the peer-reviewed East Asia Forum, he pointed to a 2023 survey carried out by the Pew Research Centre, writing that, ""Most individuals in Western nations hold unfavourable views towards China. The Chinese government's tightening grip on societal regulations could potentially cause discomfort for foreign travellers in China."" Official travel advice from some governments echo this sentiment, at times quite harshly. Washington warns potential travellers to ""reconsider travel to Mainland China due to the arbitrary enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans, and the risk of wrongful detentions"". Australia advises ""a high degree of caution"" warning that ""Australians may be at risk of arbitrary detention or harsh enforcement of local laws, including broadly defined National Security Laws"". The political environment has also taken a toll on flight availability and price. This is especially the case with connections to and from North America. Last month's 332 scheduled round trips between China and the US contrasts with 1,506 in April 2019. As a result, finding a seat on a direct flight can be extremely difficult and those that are available are very expensive. President Xi Jinping made a speech at a dinner on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in San Francisco last November addressing this point. ""Today, President Biden and I reached important consensus,"" he told the crowd. ""Our two countries will roll out more measures to facilitate travels and promote people-to-people exchanges, including increasing direct passenger flights, holding a high-level dialogue on tourism, and streamlining visa application procedures. We hope that our two peoples will make more visits, contacts and exchanges and write new stories of friendship in the new era."" Washington has since increased the number of Chinese airline flights permitted to land - but only from 35 per week to 50. It is still well short of the 150 weekly trips pre-Covid. The Biden administration is coming under pressure from unions and US airlines to not increase this any further because, they argue, Chinese airlines have an unfair advantage over them as they have state support; don't face the same onerous Chinese regulations; and, crucially, can fly over Russian airspace, making trips shorter and cheaper. A letter to the US government from the Chair of the House Committee on China, Mike Gallagher, and the committee's top Democrat representative, Raja Krishnamoorthi, reads: ""Should the US-China passenger carrier market expand without the US government addressing these significant issues, US aviation workers, travellers and airlines will pay a hefty price tag."" Mr Lou says the frequency of international flight connections is definitely having an impact. ""What we are seeing right now, based on civil aviation data, is that inbound flight capacity won't get back to even 80% of 2019 [levels] by the end of 2024."" Then there are other potential turnoffs for those considering travelling in China, like the country's state-of-the-art phone app payment and booking systems which work very smoothly for Chinese citizens and residents, but which can be an enormous headache if you have just arrived. There are certain sites, transport options, and purchases which can only be accessed via Chinese electronic apps which are, at times, only available in Chinese. Professor Chen Yong at Switzerland's EHL Hospitality Business School is an authority on the economics of tourism in China. He thinks that hurdles relating to payment and booking apps can pose a real problem. ""Technologies such as social network websites, online maps, payment apps, among others, which foreigners have long been accustomed to using, are either unavailable or inaccessible when they travel to China,"" he says.  ""On the other hand, there are Chinese alternatives to these technologies that remain inaccessible to foreigners due to language barriers and differences in user habits. We need to bridge this divide because it affects the tourist industry badly."" Back in Wuzhen, the presence of international travellers is much smaller than in years gone by, but there are still a few foreign faces in the crowd. An Italian couple says the process of linking up to and using China's payment apps was a challenge but that it was not insurmountable, though they add, with a laugh, that it is ""much, much, much easier"" if you have a Chinese friend to help you. Eliseo, from California, says he has had problems making payments to small vendors who don't accept credit cards and really no longer deal with cash. Another hurdle for him has been his bank at home which has blocked some payments, flagging them as potentially fraudulent coming from China. Chinese officials have acknowledged that the foreign traveller numbers have been low but they are now trying to turn this around. One way they're attempting to attract more foreign visitors is by increasing the number of countries whose citizens don't need a visa to enter. Trip.com says this resulted in an almost immediate increase in passenger arrivals from Southeast Asia. In 23 Chinese cities, transit passengers from more than 50 countries are also able to stay for a few days visa free if they have an onward ticket. In Shanghai, hotels above a three-star level have been told that they should prepare to deal with international credit cards and an initial batch of 50 taxis have also started accepting them. However, Professor Chen says ""it would be too optimistic to envision a long-term growth in China's inbound tourism"". ""The key is to establish a culture that puts service providers in the shoes of foreign tourists. They should imagine themselves being a foreigner who can't speak or read Chinese and who doesn't have a Chinese mobile number, payments apps and so on."" He says that the culture around this can't be changed overnight. Yet, in places like Wuzhen - where the local travellers have already returned - the tourism companies are hoping that incredible sites like theirs will eventually be too much for foreigners to resist as well."
Debt Market Sentiment,What has Trump said about your country?,2024-09-14,2017-04-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39732845,"You can read an updated version of this page here.  Donald Trump is a man who prefers plain speaking to the language of diplomacy.  Find out what he has said about your country, which foreign leaders he has met or called since taking office, and which countries he has mentioned in his tweets.  Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country. Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated. Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and President Trump praised his armed forces for ""another successful job"". Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzai said the country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"". Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied. Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House. Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia. A Washington Post report said Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer, footage leaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before — maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" Events passed off without incident on Mr Trump's first visit to Belgium as president in May 2017, when he met King Philippe and Queen Mathilde before taking part in a Nato summit. Mr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions the fight against the Islamic State group and noting the ""critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria"". He also took the chance to remind him of ""the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,"" and to meet Nato spending commitments - a topic Mr Trump raised again at the 2018 Nato summit in Brussels.No one seems to have mentioned his campaign trail claims that Brussels was a ""hellhole"" or the geographically dubious ""Belgium is a beautiful city"". Despite being South America's most influential country, Mr Trump has had little to say about Brazil so far. The president has met Michel Temer, his Brazilian counterpart, just once  - at a working dinner he hosted in New York with representatives from Colombia, Panama and Argentina to discuss the situation in Venezuela. Vice-President Mike Pence did speak to Mr Temer on the phone in June this year but the topic of conversation was not Venezuela but rather ""Brazil-US cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space"". Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language.As the African Union expressed ""shock, dismay and outrage"" and demanded an apology, Botswana summoned the US ambassador and asked the envoy ""to clarify if Botswana is regarded as a 'shithole' country given that there are Botswana nationals residing in the US."" According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump's fierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada. Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec. When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade before tweeting that the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president. With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. Mr Trump spoke to President Sebastian Pinera, a conservative like himself, in January to congratulate him on his election win. President Trump emphasised his desire to work with President Pinera on ""issues of mutual interest,"" according to a read-out of the call.The two billionaire presidents - Mr Pinera's estimated personal fortune is about $2.7bn (£2bn) - also discussed their ""desire to see democracy restored for the Venezuelan people."" Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned into a meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US. Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"". He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power and banned the Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off. President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"". The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June. But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods. ""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" he tweeted in March. China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake. The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017. Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. Mr Trump said he was ""cancelling"" President Barack Obama's deal to thaw relations with Cuba, saying he was re-imposing certain travel and trade restrictions eased by his predecessor. But the president's approach has not scrapped all of the Obama-era policy regarding the island nation. Both countries will keep their embassies open in each other's capitals, commercial flights will continue and US tourists can still return home with Cuban goods. During a speech in Miami's Little Havana neighbourhood, where Mr Trump signed a directive outlining his policy, he lambasted the deal with the ""brutal"" Castro government as ""terrible"" and ""misguided"".He said the US would not lift sanctions on Cuba until ""all political prisoners are freed"" and vowed to ""help the Cuban people themselves form businesses and pursue much better lives"". Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was one of the first world leaders to meet Donald Trump at the White House. Their talks at the end of March 2017 focused on the future of the Nato alliance and President Trump ""urged"" the Danish leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence. The meeting appeared to go well, with Mr Rasmussen saying afterwards that he was ""more positive"" about Denmark's relationship with the US than when he ""evaluated the situation right after the [US] election."" Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013. Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group. Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on a glowing orb at the meeting also set social media abuzz. The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.Mr Trump's administration announced in January 2018 that it would cancel permits that allow nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to live and work in the US.They were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) after earthquakes rocked the Central American country in 2001.Salvadoreans now have until 9 September 2019 to leave or face deportation, unless they find a legal way to stay. Mr Trump met the president before his face-to-face meeting in Helsinki with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on 16 July. President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president . Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in a tweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckled handshake with Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"". But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"". President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel. But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. President Trump has yet to formally meet with or call the Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, though he did pose for a photo and tweeted a welcome message when the leader visited Washington and met with Vice-President Mike Pence. During his White House visit, the Trump Administration thanked Mr Kvirikashvili for Georgia's sacrifices fighting with NATO forces in Afghanistan and also vowed to explore better trade relations between the two countries. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world. Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017. President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, he took to Twitter to describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year. The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"". The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit with one eye-catching moment of awkwardness - but some reports suggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.  On immigration, Mr Trump tweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, he tweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"". While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix, according to BBC Reality Check. The visit of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October could have been awkward, after he openly criticized Mr Trump during the campaign and even called him ""evil"".But the two held a cordial joint press conference and Trump joked about the Greek leader's past remarks: ""I wish I knew before my speech"". He added: ""The American people stand with the Greek people as they recover from the economic crisis that recently afflicted their nation."" The Greek leader said the two had a productive exchange and he shared common values with the US. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. He tweeted that he had ""never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said 'take them out.'""  Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump reportedly asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language.According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security announced that Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation, granted to Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, would end in July 2019.Haiti's US Ambassador Paul Altidor told the BBC the idea that ""we're simply immigrants who come here to take advantage of the US"" is wrong. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In June of this year, the Trump administration announced that it was ending the temporary protection status that had granted nearly 60,000 Hondurans the right to live in the US, meaning they could be forced to leave the the country by 5 January 2020.Hondurans were granted this status after Hurricane Mitch hit the Central American country in 1998, but the Department of Homeland Security said conditions in the country had ""notably improved"" since the disaster. The move came a couple of months after Mr Trump has complained that a ""caravan"" of migrants from Honduras were making their way towards the US, tweeting: ""Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the US is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL."" President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November. At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"". She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authorities reported to have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. Mr Trump has held one meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo so far, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017. The two leaders also attended the Riyadh Summit in Saudi Arabia in May 2017, but they did not have a one-on-one meeting. Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration, but Indonesian businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and the president's relationship with him has raised eyebrows in the US. Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a Trump Hotel in West Java and another resort in Bali and recently told an Indonesian magazine that he has ""close access"" to the US president. While Donald Trump hasn't spoken to Iran's leader since coming to power, he has spent a lot of his time talking about the country. One of his administration's first moves was to impose new sanctions against the country in response to a ballistic missile test, which Tehran said had not violated a UN resolution on its nuclear activities.The US confirmed that Tehran was continuing to comply with the UN agreement but Mr Trump labelled it a ""terrible deal"" and ordered a review into it nonetheless. During a trip to Israel in 2017, Mr Trump said Iran ""must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon - never, ever - and must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias.""He later claimed in a tweet that Iran was working with North Korea to develop nuclear weapons.Then in May this year, President Trump finally decided to pull out of the UN agreement with Iran, saying: ""It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of this deal.""Going against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015. Continuing his hardline stance, in June the US threatened to enforce sanctions on countries that have not stopped importing Iranian oil by November 2018. Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives. However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq. The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trump over the phone on 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters. Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trump told reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year, saying there were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear. Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends — fast friends — over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.  At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders also discussed their continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. In August, Mr Trump tweeted that ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers. The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough. But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June. After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Amid the NFL national anthem controversy, President Trump singled out Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt as an example for other sportspeople to follow.He tweeted: ""Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time, showed RESPECT for our National Anthem!""Mr Trump had criticised NFL players who kneel during the national anthem as a protest, to highlight the treatment of black Americans. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan. Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions. The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he took a tumble into a bunker on the course. Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea. Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis. Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now. In June, he tweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well. Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help. ""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. US relations with Kenya are likely to be very different under Donald Trump to how they were under Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan. Mr Trump's decision to speak to the leaders of three African nations - Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa - before speaking to Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta was taken as a snub by some in the country. The two leaders discussed security in the region and President Trump praised Kenya's ""significant contributions"" to the African Union force fighting against the al-Shabaab group in neighbouring Somalia. The US in May suspended $21m of funding to Kenya's ministry of health over corruption allegations and weak account procedures, according to the state department. Kenya has said it would strengthen its accounting. President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according to Politico. Mr Trump cited Libya as an example of the failure of Western military intervention regularly on his way to winning the US election, but the record shows he backed it at the time.The country has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Fighters aligned to the so-called Islamic State group (IS) have threatened to cause further chaos in recent years.President Trump held a meeting with Libya's prime minister, Fayez Al-Sarraj, at the White House in December last year during which they discussed political reconciliation in the country and the threat from IS. But the US leader is keen to take a less engaged approach to the country, telling reporters he did not ""see a role"" there for the US. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!"" It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017. Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall."" More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall."" Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president. The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall. Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr López Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump. How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Did Mr Trump mistake New Zealand's prime minister for the wife of Canadian leader Justin Trudeau at November's APEC meeting in Vietnam?PM Jacinda Ardern denied Mr Trump had made that error, telling TVNZ that ""Someone observed that they thought that it happened, but in all my interactions, certainly President Trump didn't seem to have confused me when I interacted with him. But someone else observed this.""Mr Trump certainly seems to have recognised her when he patted her on the shoulder at a gala dinner during the summit and declared ""This lady caused a lot of upset in her country"".""I said, 'You know', laughing, 'no-one marched when I was elected',"" she told the website newsroom.co.nz. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.Mr Trump's administration announced in November 2017 that it would remove the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation for Nicaragua, introduced in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America.Thousands of Nicaraguans living in the US will now have until 5 January 2019 to seek ""an alternative lawful immigration status"" or leave. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year. During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade. Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". President Trump made history in June when he became the first sitting US president to meet with a North Korean leader. It was an event few could have imagined just a few months after Mr Trump had threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea if it endangered the US. The heated rhetoric from Mr Trump was in response to North Korea's repeated testing of long-range missiles in its pursuit to establish itself as a nuclear power. North Korea responded by vowing to launch a ""nuclear pre-emptive strike"" if it felt at risk. President Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed. In January, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down and talk with Mr Kim and a couple of months later the two sides said they had agreed to a meeting. ""Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Mr Trump tweeted in March. Although the mooted summit was briefly cancelled by Mr Trump, it did eventually happen in Singapore in June, with the US president describing it as a ""tremendous success"". The pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang.In a sign of possible trouble ahead though, North Korea accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks in July.But this was followed by a letter sent to Mr Trump by Mr Kim, which the US president tweeted. Part of it read: ""I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach of myself and Your Excellency Mr President aimed at opening up a new future between the DPRK and the US will surely come to fruition."" When Prime Minister Solberg met Mr Trump in Washington he may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jet only available in Call of Duty, a computer game.  A day later Norway was reportedly mentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal.    Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics.  According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told the lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, or Asian nations. Tensions between the US and its historical ally have been strained for years, but they reached a new low in January 2018, when Mr Trump threatened to withdraw US assistance. Previously he had put Pakistan on notice as he unveiled his new Afghan strategy in August 2017.""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order and peace.""But he had warmer words when Islamabad helped secure the release of an American-Canadian couple held hostage in the country for five years. Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017. He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During a visit to Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace. In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"". The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914. ""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"". During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has already had a substantial amount of contact with President Trump. The two men have spoken several times over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the White House. As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the Peruvian president is particularly interested in persuading the US to deport its fugitive ex-leader Alejandro Toledo.Mr Toledo, who is believed to be in San Francisco, is accused of taking $20m (£16m) in bribes. He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr Trump to ""evaluate"" the situation.In March, Mr Kuczynski spoke to Mr Trump about tackling the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.  Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world."" Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila. His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far. After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. Donald Trump is a big fan of Poland and its people. During a visit there in July last year, he described Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, warning against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"".Mr Trump spoke of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war"" during his speech in Warsaw.He also thanked the country for buying Patriot missile defence systems from the US in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the Nato alliance. ""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people,"" he declared. The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initial credit for applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism, tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar – look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia. At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election. ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia. A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia. In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing…""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump. Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when he took part in a ceremonial sword dance during the trip. Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June. Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder. Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America. Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion. Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" While President Trump has not spoken to Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, he has tried to ban Somalis from entering the US. The proposed ban has been partly reinstated by the Supreme Court after it was twice by rejected judges in the US, allowing Mr Trump to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. He has described the affected nations as ""terror-prone countries"".In May last year, a member of the US military was killed in Somalia, the first confirmed combat death there since the 1993 disastrous Black Hawk Down incident. There was another fatality in June this year. The deaths came after the US announced in April 2017 that it was sending dozens of troops to Somalia to train forces fighting Islamist group al-Shabab. Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about South Africa, tweeting that the country was a ""mess"". He took a slightly different approach as president though, telling President Jacob Zuma that he hopes to ""expand cooperation and trade"" between the two countries. The two leaders spoken once on the phone, mainly to discuss new opportunities to boost trade. According to the President Zuma's government, there are 600 US companies operating in South Africa.Mr Zuma also met President Trump once, before he was forced to resign in February. Mr Trump held a working lunch for African leaders, including Mr Zuma, in New York in September. During the meeting, Mr Trump reportedly said: ""Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich.""South Africa's new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is yet to meet Mr Trump. President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table. After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well. Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US. In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel. South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year. Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year. At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence. Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"". Pedro Sánchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. Sudan is another of the predominantly Muslim countries that Donald Trump has included on his travel ban list. The Supreme Court partly reinstated the ban after it was twice rejected by judges in the US. It means people without ""close"" family or business relationships in the US could be denied visas and barred entry. More recently, Mr Trump postponed a deadline on whether to permanently lift US sanctions against Sudan so he could have more time to ""establish that the government of Sudan has demonstrated sufficient positive action"" on counter-terrorism efforts, providing humanitarian relief and securing a ceasefire in conflict areas.The US has issued sanctions against Sudan since the 1990s, when it was accused of state-sponsored terrorism.Mr Trump has yet to appoint a special envoy for Sudan. President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February. ""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes. It later emerged that Mr Trump had been referring to a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013. But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context and data didn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape. Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he did phone the Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. Syria is another country that Donald Trump has changed his views on quite substantially since becoming the US president. When his predecessor was considering military action in Syria back in 2013, Mr Trump was a vocal critic against intervention.""Again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack Syria - if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the US gets nothing,"" Mr Trump tweeted in September 2013. But just over two months into his presidency, President Trump said he was so moved by images of children in the aftermath of a chemical attack by Syrian forces that he was taking military action. ""Using a deadly nerve agent, [Syrian President] Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children,"" Mr Trump said. ""No child of God should ever suffer such horror.""Two US Navy ships fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian air base from their positions in the Mediterranean. It was the first direct US military action against the Syrian president's forces.Mr Trump deployed his military again in April this year, with 100 missiles targeting suspected government chemical weapons facilities in response to a suspected deadly chemical attack on the town of Douma.After the strikes, Mr Trump tweeted: ""A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!"" President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Perhaps the unlikeliest country to have made our list, Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Keith Rowley spoke to Donald Trump on the phone in February 2017 to discuss ""shared priorities"". One of those priorities is terrorism, with some US officials worried that the small Caribbean island could become a ""breeding ground for extremists"", according to the New York Times. The island's former US ambassador John Estrada told the newspaper that more than 100 people have travelled from there to fight with the so-called Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. When Donald Trump announced a ban on people entering the US from several predominantly Muslim countries, some analysts were surprised not to see Tunisia on the list. The Arab Spring began there in 2010, but it has become a breeding ground for the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in recent years - more Tunisians have joined them to fight in Iraq and Syria than any other nationality. President Trump appears to have decided that a close relationship with Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi is important in the fight against IS and he praised the country's ""stability and security"" in a phone call with its leader in February. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on. Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012. Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point). But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, when clashes broke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel. US Congress has called for criminal charges against those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC. Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State. Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.  While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan reaffirmed their rejection of the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017. The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments. Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say. But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift the sanctions would be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko and encouraged the European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke with Donald Trump on the phone just a few days after the former businessman became the new US president. The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the White House, the crown prince backed Mr Trump's idea of safe zones for refugees in the Middle East. The UAE was not one of the countries that Mr Trump tried to ban people travelling to the US from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few Middle East officials to defend the move. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan described Mr Trump's proposed ban as a ""sovereign decision"" and said some of the countries on the list ""face structural problems"" that need to be dealt with. In May last year, Mr Trump met the Crown Prince at the White House, where the two leaders discussed ""bilateral defense cooperation, counterterrorism, resolving the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and the threat to regional stability posed by Iran."" Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July. His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication of an interview the US president gave to The Sun newspaper. In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead. ""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"". Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit. He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled. Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" Mr Trump spoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate the New York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. Human rights have not been at the top of President Trump's agenda so far, but he has called for the release of a political prisoner in Venezuela. ""Venezuela should allow Leopoldo Lopez, a political prisoner & husband of @liliantintori out of prison immediately,"" he tweeted in mid-February. Venezuela is in the middle of an economic and political crisis, with the country deeply divided between those who support the government of the socialist President Nicolas Maduro and those who blame him. Mr Trump has discussed the situation in Venezuela on the phone with leaders of neighbouring countries, including Brazil and Colombia, but he has not spoken directly to President Maduro. In an October tweet, Mr Trump called ""for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela."" The tweet reflected statements made by Mr Trump at a dinner with Latin American leaders in which he thanked them for supporting the Venezuelan people and condemning the Maduro ""dictatorship"".Mr Maduro, however, has sent a word of warning to President Trump, saying in a televised speech: ""Don't repeat the errors of Obama and Bush when it comes to Venezuela and Latin America.""In April 2017 it emerged that Citgo Petroleum, the state oil company, gave half a million dollars to Trump's inaugural committee and a General Motors plant in the country was seized by the state.Mr Trump celebrated the release of an American man in Venezuela in May this year, tweeting: ""Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela."" The man, a Mormon missionary from Utah, had been held without trial on weapons charges since 2016. Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.
                    
Mr Trump tweeted his thanks for ""a wonderful visit"".
                    
Mr Trump was keen to highlight a $12bn (£9bn) purchase of Boeing aircraft in a joint statement after the visit. President Trump's main focus in Yemen has been his ban on its citizens from travelling to America.In December 2017, the US Supreme Court ruled President Donald Trump's travel ban on six mainly Muslim countries could go into full effect, pending legal challenges.Mr Trump has also called on Saudi Arabia to ""allow food, fuel, water, and medicine to reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it,"" in response to the humanitarian crisis linked to the ongoing Saudi campaign and blockade against Houthi rebels.Yemen was the site of the first military operation authorised by Mr Trump, in which a special forces team raided the compound of a suspected terrorist leader. The mission didn't go to plan. The US Navy Seals came under fire from fighters belonging to the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula group (AQAP) and one member of the elite team was killed. It later emerged that a number of civilians were also killed in the operation, which had been drawn up in November 2016 but approved by Mr Trump. In an interview with Fox News, Mr Trump appeared to lay blame for the death of Navy Seal William ""Ryan"" Owens on military leaders.  ""This was a mission that was started before I got here,"" Mr Trump said. ""They came to see me and they explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected... And they lost Ryan."" A New York Times article claimed the Navy Seals found out their mission had been compromised after intercepting AQAP communications but they ""pressed on toward their target"" nonetheless.  Mr Trump responded to criticism by tweeting that it had been ""a winning mission... not a failure"". A White House statement said it was a ""successful raid"" that yielded ""important intelligence"". Carryn Owens, the widow of the Navy Seal, was invited to Mr Trump's joint address to Congress. She got a standing ovation and as the room applauded, the president said her husband's legacy was ""etched into eternity"". Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan. Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions. The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he took a tumble into a bunker on the course. Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea. Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis. Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now. In June, he tweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July. His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication of an interview the US president gave to The Sun newspaper. In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead. ""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"". Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit. He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled. Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president . Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in a tweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckled handshake with Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"". But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"". President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel. But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.  At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders also discussed their continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. In August, Mr Trump tweeted that ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world. Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017. President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, he took to Twitter to describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year. The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"". The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit with one eye-catching moment of awkwardness - but some reports suggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.  On immigration, Mr Trump tweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, he tweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"". While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix, according to BBC Reality Check. Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned into a meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US. Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"". He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power and banned the Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off. President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"". The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June. But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods. ""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" he tweeted in March. China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump's fierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada. Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec. When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade before tweeting that the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president. With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well. Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help. ""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June. Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder. Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America. Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion. Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers. The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough. But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June. After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013. Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group. Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on a glowing orb at the meeting also set social media abuzz. The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House. Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia. A Washington Post report said Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer, footage leaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before — maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table. After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well. Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US. In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel. South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year. Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017. He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During a visit to Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace. In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"". The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia. At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election. ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia. A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia. In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing…""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump. Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when he took part in a ceremonial sword dance during the trip. Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017. The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments. Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say. But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift the sanctions would be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko and encouraged the European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on. Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012. Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point). But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, when clashes broke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel. US Congress has called for criminal charges against those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC. Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State. Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.  While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan reaffirmed their rejection of the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year. At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence. Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"". Pedro Sánchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November. At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"". She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authorities reported to have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year. During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade. Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.
                            
Mr Trump tweeted his thanks for ""a wonderful visit"".
                            
Mr Trump was keen to highlight a $12bn (£9bn) purchase of Boeing aircraft in a joint statement after the visit. President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914. ""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"". During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initial credit for applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism, tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar – look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake. The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017. Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year, saying there were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear. Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends — fast friends — over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!"" It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017. Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall."" More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall."" Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president. The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall. Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr López Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump. How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Despite being South America's most influential country, Mr Trump has had little to say about Brazil so far. The president has met Michel Temer, his Brazilian counterpart, just once  - at a working dinner he hosted in New York with representatives from Colombia, Panama and Argentina to discuss the situation in Venezuela. Vice-President Mike Pence did speak to Mr Temer on the phone in June this year but the topic of conversation was not Venezuela but rather ""Brazil-US cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space"". President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February. ""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes. It later emerged that Mr Trump had been referring to a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013. But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context and data didn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape. Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he did phone the Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. President Trump has yet to formally meet with or call the Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, though he did pose for a photo and tweeted a welcome message when the leader visited Washington and met with Vice-President Mike Pence. During his White House visit, the Trump Administration thanked Mr Kvirikashvili for Georgia's sacrifices fighting with NATO forces in Afghanistan and also vowed to explore better trade relations between the two countries. Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country. Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated. Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and President Trump praised his armed forces for ""another successful job"". Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzai said the country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"". Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. The visit of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October could have been awkward, after he openly criticized Mr Trump during the campaign and even called him ""evil"".But the two held a cordial joint press conference and Trump joked about the Greek leader's past remarks: ""I wish I knew before my speech"". He added: ""The American people stand with the Greek people as they recover from the economic crisis that recently afflicted their nation."" The Greek leader said the two had a productive exchange and he shared common values with the US. President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according to Politico. Mr Trump cited Libya as an example of the failure of Western military intervention regularly on his way to winning the US election, but the record shows he backed it at the time.The country has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Fighters aligned to the so-called Islamic State group (IS) have threatened to cause further chaos in recent years.President Trump held a meeting with Libya's prime minister, Fayez Al-Sarraj, at the White House in December last year during which they discussed political reconciliation in the country and the threat from IS. But the US leader is keen to take a less engaged approach to the country, telling reporters he did not ""see a role"" there for the US. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied. Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. Did Mr Trump mistake New Zealand's prime minister for the wife of Canadian leader Justin Trudeau at November's APEC meeting in Vietnam?PM Jacinda Ardern denied Mr Trump had made that error, telling TVNZ that ""Someone observed that they thought that it happened, but in all my interactions, certainly President Trump didn't seem to have confused me when I interacted with him. But someone else observed this.""Mr Trump certainly seems to have recognised her when he patted her on the shoulder at a gala dinner during the summit and declared ""This lady caused a lot of upset in her country"".""I said, 'You know', laughing, 'no-one marched when I was elected',"" she told the website newsroom.co.nz. Events passed off without incident on Mr Trump's first visit to Belgium as president in May 2017, when he met King Philippe and Queen Mathilde before taking part in a Nato summit. Mr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions the fight against the Islamic State group and noting the ""critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria"". He also took the chance to remind him of ""the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,"" and to meet Nato spending commitments - a topic Mr Trump raised again at the 2018 Nato summit in Brussels.No one seems to have mentioned his campaign trail claims that Brussels was a ""hellhole"" or the geographically dubious ""Belgium is a beautiful city"". Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was one of the first world leaders to meet Donald Trump at the White House. Their talks at the end of March 2017 focused on the future of the Nato alliance and President Trump ""urged"" the Danish leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence. The meeting appeared to go well, with Mr Rasmussen saying afterwards that he was ""more positive"" about Denmark's relationship with the US than when he ""evaluated the situation right after the [US] election."" President Trump made history in June when he became the first sitting US president to meet with a North Korean leader. It was an event few could have imagined just a few months after Mr Trump had threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea if it endangered the US. The heated rhetoric from Mr Trump was in response to North Korea's repeated testing of long-range missiles in its pursuit to establish itself as a nuclear power. North Korea responded by vowing to launch a ""nuclear pre-emptive strike"" if it felt at risk. President Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed. In January, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down and talk with Mr Kim and a couple of months later the two sides said they had agreed to a meeting. ""Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Mr Trump tweeted in March. Although the mooted summit was briefly cancelled by Mr Trump, it did eventually happen in Singapore in June, with the US president describing it as a ""tremendous success"". The pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang.In a sign of possible trouble ahead though, North Korea accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks in July.But this was followed by a letter sent to Mr Trump by Mr Kim, which the US president tweeted. Part of it read: ""I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach of myself and Your Excellency Mr President aimed at opening up a new future between the DPRK and the US will surely come to fruition."" When Prime Minister Solberg met Mr Trump in Washington he may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jet only available in Call of Duty, a computer game.  A day later Norway was reportedly mentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal.    Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics.  According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told the lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, or Asian nations. Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about South Africa, tweeting that the country was a ""mess"". He took a slightly different approach as president though, telling President Jacob Zuma that he hopes to ""expand cooperation and trade"" between the two countries. The two leaders spoken once on the phone, mainly to discuss new opportunities to boost trade. According to the President Zuma's government, there are 600 US companies operating in South Africa.Mr Zuma also met President Trump once, before he was forced to resign in February. Mr Trump held a working lunch for African leaders, including Mr Zuma, in New York in September. During the meeting, Mr Trump reportedly said: ""Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich.""South Africa's new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is yet to meet Mr Trump. Mr Trump spoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate the New York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. Mr Trump has held one meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo so far, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017. The two leaders also attended the Riyadh Summit in Saudi Arabia in May 2017, but they did not have a one-on-one meeting. Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration, but Indonesian businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and the president's relationship with him has raised eyebrows in the US. Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a Trump Hotel in West Java and another resort in Bali and recently told an Indonesian magazine that he has ""close access"" to the US president. Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has already had a substantial amount of contact with President Trump. The two men have spoken several times over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the White House. As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the Peruvian president is particularly interested in persuading the US to deport its fugitive ex-leader Alejandro Toledo.Mr Toledo, who is believed to be in San Francisco, is accused of taking $20m (£16m) in bribes. He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr Trump to ""evaluate"" the situation.In March, Mr Kuczynski spoke to Mr Trump about tackling the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.  Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world."" Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila. His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far. After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. Donald Trump is a big fan of Poland and its people. During a visit there in July last year, he described Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, warning against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"".Mr Trump spoke of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war"" during his speech in Warsaw.He also thanked the country for buying Patriot missile defence systems from the US in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the Nato alliance. ""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people,"" he declared. President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives. However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq. The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trump over the phone on 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters. Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trump told reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. The Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke with Donald Trump on the phone just a few days after the former businessman became the new US president. The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the White House, the crown prince backed Mr Trump's idea of safe zones for refugees in the Middle East. The UAE was not one of the countries that Mr Trump tried to ban people travelling to the US from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few Middle East officials to defend the move. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan described Mr Trump's proposed ban as a ""sovereign decision"" and said some of the countries on the list ""face structural problems"" that need to be dealt with. In May last year, Mr Trump met the Crown Prince at the White House, where the two leaders discussed ""bilateral defense cooperation, counterterrorism, resolving the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and the threat to regional stability posed by Iran."" Mr Trump met the president before his face-to-face meeting in Helsinki with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on 16 July. While President Trump has not spoken to Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, he has tried to ban Somalis from entering the US. The proposed ban has been partly reinstated by the Supreme Court after it was twice by rejected judges in the US, allowing Mr Trump to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. He has described the affected nations as ""terror-prone countries"".In May last year, a member of the US military was killed in Somalia, the first confirmed combat death there since the 1993 disastrous Black Hawk Down incident. There was another fatality in June this year. The deaths came after the US announced in April 2017 that it was sending dozens of troops to Somalia to train forces fighting Islamist group al-Shabab. President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president . Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in a tweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckled handshake with Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"". But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"". President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel. But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan. Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions. The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he took a tumble into a bunker on the course. Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea. Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis. Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now. In June, he tweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July. His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication of an interview the US president gave to The Sun newspaper. In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead. ""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"". Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit. He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled. Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table. After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well. Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US. In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel. South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year. Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump. Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when he took part in a ceremonial sword dance during the trip. Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump's fierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada. Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec. When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade before tweeting that the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president. With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world. Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017. President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, he took to Twitter to describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year. The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"". The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit with one eye-catching moment of awkwardness - but some reports suggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.  On immigration, Mr Trump tweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, he tweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"". While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix, according to BBC Reality Check. Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned into a meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US. Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"". He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power and banned the Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off. President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"". The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June. But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods. ""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" he tweeted in March. China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013. Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group. Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on a glowing orb at the meeting also set social media abuzz. The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initial credit for applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism, tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar – look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia. At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election. ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia. A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia. In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing…""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on. Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012. Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point). But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, when clashes broke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel. US Congress has called for criminal charges against those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC. Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State. Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.  While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan reaffirmed their rejection of the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!"" It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017. Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall."" More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall."" Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president. The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall. Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr López Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump. How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied. Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. The Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke with Donald Trump on the phone just a few days after the former businessman became the new US president. The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the White House, the crown prince backed Mr Trump's idea of safe zones for refugees in the Middle East. The UAE was not one of the countries that Mr Trump tried to ban people travelling to the US from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few Middle East officials to defend the move. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan described Mr Trump's proposed ban as a ""sovereign decision"" and said some of the countries on the list ""face structural problems"" that need to be dealt with. In May last year, Mr Trump met the Crown Prince at the White House, where the two leaders discussed ""bilateral defense cooperation, counterterrorism, resolving the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and the threat to regional stability posed by Iran."" Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has already had a substantial amount of contact with President Trump. The two men have spoken several times over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the White House. As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the Peruvian president is particularly interested in persuading the US to deport its fugitive ex-leader Alejandro Toledo.Mr Toledo, who is believed to be in San Francisco, is accused of taking $20m (£16m) in bribes. He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr Trump to ""evaluate"" the situation.In March, Mr Kuczynski spoke to Mr Trump about tackling the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.  At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders also discussed their continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. In August, Mr Trump tweeted that ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November. At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"". She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authorities reported to have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives. However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq. The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trump over the phone on 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters. Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trump told reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well. Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help. ""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake. The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017. Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June. Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder. Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America. Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion. Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country. Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated. Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and President Trump praised his armed forces for ""another successful job"". Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzai said the country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"". Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according to Politico. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House. Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia. A Washington Post report said Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer, footage leaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before — maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017. He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During a visit to Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace. In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"". The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. Did Mr Trump mistake New Zealand's prime minister for the wife of Canadian leader Justin Trudeau at November's APEC meeting in Vietnam?PM Jacinda Ardern denied Mr Trump had made that error, telling TVNZ that ""Someone observed that they thought that it happened, but in all my interactions, certainly President Trump didn't seem to have confused me when I interacted with him. But someone else observed this.""Mr Trump certainly seems to have recognised her when he patted her on the shoulder at a gala dinner during the summit and declared ""This lady caused a lot of upset in her country"".""I said, 'You know', laughing, 'no-one marched when I was elected',"" she told the website newsroom.co.nz. In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers. The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough. But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June. After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year. At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence. Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"". Pedro Sánchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. Mr Trump spoke to President Sebastian Pinera, a conservative like himself, in January to congratulate him on his election win. President Trump emphasised his desire to work with President Pinera on ""issues of mutual interest,"" according to a read-out of the call.The two billionaire presidents - Mr Pinera's estimated personal fortune is about $2.7bn (£2bn) - also discussed their ""desire to see democracy restored for the Venezuelan people."" Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.
                            
Mr Trump tweeted his thanks for ""a wonderful visit"".
                            
Mr Trump was keen to highlight a $12bn (£9bn) purchase of Boeing aircraft in a joint statement after the visit. Mr Trump has held one meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo so far, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017. The two leaders also attended the Riyadh Summit in Saudi Arabia in May 2017, but they did not have a one-on-one meeting. Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration, but Indonesian businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and the president's relationship with him has raised eyebrows in the US. Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a Trump Hotel in West Java and another resort in Bali and recently told an Indonesian magazine that he has ""close access"" to the US president. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year. During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade. Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914. ""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"". During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.  Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world."" Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila. His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far. After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year, saying there were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear. Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends — fast friends — over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about South Africa, tweeting that the country was a ""mess"". He took a slightly different approach as president though, telling President Jacob Zuma that he hopes to ""expand cooperation and trade"" between the two countries. The two leaders spoken once on the phone, mainly to discuss new opportunities to boost trade. According to the President Zuma's government, there are 600 US companies operating in South Africa.Mr Zuma also met President Trump once, before he was forced to resign in February. Mr Trump held a working lunch for African leaders, including Mr Zuma, in New York in September. During the meeting, Mr Trump reportedly said: ""Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich.""South Africa's new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is yet to meet Mr Trump. US relations with Kenya are likely to be very different under Donald Trump to how they were under Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan. Mr Trump's decision to speak to the leaders of three African nations - Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa - before speaking to Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta was taken as a snub by some in the country. The two leaders discussed security in the region and President Trump praised Kenya's ""significant contributions"" to the African Union force fighting against the al-Shabaab group in neighbouring Somalia. The US in May suspended $21m of funding to Kenya's ministry of health over corruption allegations and weak account procedures, according to the state department. Kenya has said it would strengthen its accounting. President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February. ""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes. It later emerged that Mr Trump had been referring to a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013. But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context and data didn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape. Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he did phone the Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Perhaps the unlikeliest country to have made our list, Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Keith Rowley spoke to Donald Trump on the phone in February 2017 to discuss ""shared priorities"". One of those priorities is terrorism, with some US officials worried that the small Caribbean island could become a ""breeding ground for extremists"", according to the New York Times. The island's former US ambassador John Estrada told the newspaper that more than 100 people have travelled from there to fight with the so-called Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. When Donald Trump announced a ban on people entering the US from several predominantly Muslim countries, some analysts were surprised not to see Tunisia on the list. The Arab Spring began there in 2010, but it has become a breeding ground for the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in recent years - more Tunisians have joined them to fight in Iraq and Syria than any other nationality. President Trump appears to have decided that a close relationship with Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi is important in the fight against IS and he praised the country's ""stability and security"" in a phone call with its leader in February. Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017. The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments. Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say. But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift the sanctions would be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko and encouraged the European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Despite being South America's most influential country, Mr Trump has had little to say about Brazil so far. The president has met Michel Temer, his Brazilian counterpart, just once  - at a working dinner he hosted in New York with representatives from Colombia, Panama and Argentina to discuss the situation in Venezuela. Vice-President Mike Pence did speak to Mr Temer on the phone in June this year but the topic of conversation was not Venezuela but rather ""Brazil-US cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space"". Mr Trump spoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate the New York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia. At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election. ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia. A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia. In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing…""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. President Trump made history in June when he became the first sitting US president to meet with a North Korean leader. It was an event few could have imagined just a few months after Mr Trump had threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea if it endangered the US. The heated rhetoric from Mr Trump was in response to North Korea's repeated testing of long-range missiles in its pursuit to establish itself as a nuclear power. North Korea responded by vowing to launch a ""nuclear pre-emptive strike"" if it felt at risk. President Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed. In January, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down and talk with Mr Kim and a couple of months later the two sides said they had agreed to a meeting. ""Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Mr Trump tweeted in March. Although the mooted summit was briefly cancelled by Mr Trump, it did eventually happen in Singapore in June, with the US president describing it as a ""tremendous success"". The pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang.In a sign of possible trouble ahead though, North Korea accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks in July.But this was followed by a letter sent to Mr Trump by Mr Kim, which the US president tweeted. Part of it read: ""I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach of myself and Your Excellency Mr President aimed at opening up a new future between the DPRK and the US will surely come to fruition."" Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned into a meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US. Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"". He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power and banned the Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off. President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"". The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June. But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods. ""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" he tweeted in March. China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!"" It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017. Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall."" More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall."" Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president. The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall. Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr López Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump. How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan. Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions. The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he took a tumble into a bunker on the course. Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea. Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis. Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now. In June, he tweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" While Donald Trump hasn't spoken to Iran's leader since coming to power, he has spent a lot of his time talking about the country. One of his administration's first moves was to impose new sanctions against the country in response to a ballistic missile test, which Tehran said had not violated a UN resolution on its nuclear activities.The US confirmed that Tehran was continuing to comply with the UN agreement but Mr Trump labelled it a ""terrible deal"" and ordered a review into it nonetheless. During a trip to Israel in 2017, Mr Trump said Iran ""must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon - never, ever - and must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias.""He later claimed in a tweet that Iran was working with North Korea to develop nuclear weapons.Then in May this year, President Trump finally decided to pull out of the UN agreement with Iran, saying: ""It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of this deal.""Going against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015. Continuing his hardline stance, in June the US threatened to enforce sanctions on countries that have not stopped importing Iranian oil by November 2018. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump's fierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada. Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec. When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade before tweeting that the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president. With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president . Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in a tweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckled handshake with Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"". But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"". President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel. But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. Syria is another country that Donald Trump has changed his views on quite substantially since becoming the US president. When his predecessor was considering military action in Syria back in 2013, Mr Trump was a vocal critic against intervention.""Again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack Syria - if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the US gets nothing,"" Mr Trump tweeted in September 2013. But just over two months into his presidency, President Trump said he was so moved by images of children in the aftermath of a chemical attack by Syrian forces that he was taking military action. ""Using a deadly nerve agent, [Syrian President] Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children,"" Mr Trump said. ""No child of God should ever suffer such horror.""Two US Navy ships fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian air base from their positions in the Mediterranean. It was the first direct US military action against the Syrian president's forces.Mr Trump deployed his military again in April this year, with 100 missiles targeting suspected government chemical weapons facilities in response to a suspected deadly chemical attack on the town of Douma.After the strikes, Mr Trump tweeted: ""A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!"" President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table. After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well. Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US. In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel. South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year. Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world. Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017. President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, he took to Twitter to describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year. The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"". The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit with one eye-catching moment of awkwardness - but some reports suggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.  On immigration, Mr Trump tweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, he tweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"". While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix, according to BBC Reality Check. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.  At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders also discussed their continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. In August, Mr Trump tweeted that ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June. Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder. Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America. Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion. Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017. The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments. Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say. But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift the sanctions would be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko and encouraged the European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July. His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication of an interview the US president gave to The Sun newspaper. In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead. ""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"". Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit. He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled. Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump. Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when he took part in a ceremonial sword dance during the trip. Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.
                            
Mr Trump tweeted his thanks for ""a wonderful visit"".
                            
Mr Trump was keen to highlight a $12bn (£9bn) purchase of Boeing aircraft in a joint statement after the visit. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House. Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia. A Washington Post report said Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer, footage leaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before — maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives. However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq. The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trump over the phone on 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters. Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trump told reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well. Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help. ""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on. Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012. Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point). But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, when clashes broke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel. US Congress has called for criminal charges against those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC. Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State. Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.  While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan reaffirmed their rejection of the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. Donald Trump is a big fan of Poland and its people. During a visit there in July last year, he described Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, warning against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"".Mr Trump spoke of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war"" during his speech in Warsaw.He also thanked the country for buying Patriot missile defence systems from the US in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the Nato alliance. ""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people,"" he declared. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied. Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013. Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group. Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on a glowing orb at the meeting also set social media abuzz. The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers. The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough. But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June. After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Human rights have not been at the top of President Trump's agenda so far, but he has called for the release of a political prisoner in Venezuela. ""Venezuela should allow Leopoldo Lopez, a political prisoner & husband of @liliantintori out of prison immediately,"" he tweeted in mid-February. Venezuela is in the middle of an economic and political crisis, with the country deeply divided between those who support the government of the socialist President Nicolas Maduro and those who blame him. Mr Trump has discussed the situation in Venezuela on the phone with leaders of neighbouring countries, including Brazil and Colombia, but he has not spoken directly to President Maduro. In an October tweet, Mr Trump called ""for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela."" The tweet reflected statements made by Mr Trump at a dinner with Latin American leaders in which he thanked them for supporting the Venezuelan people and condemning the Maduro ""dictatorship"".Mr Maduro, however, has sent a word of warning to President Trump, saying in a televised speech: ""Don't repeat the errors of Obama and Bush when it comes to Venezuela and Latin America.""In April 2017 it emerged that Citgo Petroleum, the state oil company, gave half a million dollars to Trump's inaugural committee and a General Motors plant in the country was seized by the state.Mr Trump celebrated the release of an American man in Venezuela in May this year, tweeting: ""Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela."" The man, a Mormon missionary from Utah, had been held without trial on weapons charges since 2016. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year. At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence. Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"". Pedro Sánchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country. Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated. Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and President Trump praised his armed forces for ""another successful job"". Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzai said the country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"". Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. Mr Trump said he was ""cancelling"" President Barack Obama's deal to thaw relations with Cuba, saying he was re-imposing certain travel and trade restrictions eased by his predecessor. But the president's approach has not scrapped all of the Obama-era policy regarding the island nation. Both countries will keep their embassies open in each other's capitals, commercial flights will continue and US tourists can still return home with Cuban goods. During a speech in Miami's Little Havana neighbourhood, where Mr Trump signed a directive outlining his policy, he lambasted the deal with the ""brutal"" Castro government as ""terrible"" and ""misguided"".He said the US would not lift sanctions on Cuba until ""all political prisoners are freed"" and vowed to ""help the Cuban people themselves form businesses and pursue much better lives"". President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November. At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"". She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authorities reported to have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Tensions between the US and its historical ally have been strained for years, but they reached a new low in January 2018, when Mr Trump threatened to withdraw US assistance. Previously he had put Pakistan on notice as he unveiled his new Afghan strategy in August 2017.""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order and peace.""But he had warmer words when Islamabad helped secure the release of an American-Canadian couple held hostage in the country for five years. Mr Trump met the president before his face-to-face meeting in Helsinki with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on 16 July. President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February. ""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes. It later emerged that Mr Trump had been referring to a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013. But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context and data didn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape. Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he did phone the Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017. He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During a visit to Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace. In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"". The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. Events passed off without incident on Mr Trump's first visit to Belgium as president in May 2017, when he met King Philippe and Queen Mathilde before taking part in a Nato summit. Mr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions the fight against the Islamic State group and noting the ""critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria"". He also took the chance to remind him of ""the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,"" and to meet Nato spending commitments - a topic Mr Trump raised again at the 2018 Nato summit in Brussels.No one seems to have mentioned his campaign trail claims that Brussels was a ""hellhole"" or the geographically dubious ""Belgium is a beautiful city"". The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initial credit for applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism, tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar – look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. The visit of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October could have been awkward, after he openly criticized Mr Trump during the campaign and even called him ""evil"".But the two held a cordial joint press conference and Trump joked about the Greek leader's past remarks: ""I wish I knew before my speech"". He added: ""The American people stand with the Greek people as they recover from the economic crisis that recently afflicted their nation."" The Greek leader said the two had a productive exchange and he shared common values with the US. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year, saying there were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear. Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends — fast friends — over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In June of this year, the Trump administration announced that it was ending the temporary protection status that had granted nearly 60,000 Hondurans the right to live in the US, meaning they could be forced to leave the the country by 5 January 2020.Hondurans were granted this status after Hurricane Mitch hit the Central American country in 1998, but the Department of Homeland Security said conditions in the country had ""notably improved"" since the disaster. The move came a couple of months after Mr Trump has complained that a ""caravan"" of migrants from Honduras were making their way towards the US, tweeting: ""Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the US is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL."" While President Trump has not spoken to Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, he has tried to ban Somalis from entering the US. The proposed ban has been partly reinstated by the Supreme Court after it was twice by rejected judges in the US, allowing Mr Trump to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. He has described the affected nations as ""terror-prone countries"".In May last year, a member of the US military was killed in Somalia, the first confirmed combat death there since the 1993 disastrous Black Hawk Down incident. There was another fatality in June this year. The deaths came after the US announced in April 2017 that it was sending dozens of troops to Somalia to train forces fighting Islamist group al-Shabab. President Trump has yet to formally meet with or call the Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, though he did pose for a photo and tweeted a welcome message when the leader visited Washington and met with Vice-President Mike Pence. During his White House visit, the Trump Administration thanked Mr Kvirikashvili for Georgia's sacrifices fighting with NATO forces in Afghanistan and also vowed to explore better trade relations between the two countries. President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914. ""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"". During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake. The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017. Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.  Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world."" Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila. His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far. After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. He tweeted that he had ""never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said 'take them out.'""  Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump reportedly asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language.According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security announced that Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation, granted to Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, would end in July 2019.Haiti's US Ambassador Paul Altidor told the BBC the idea that ""we're simply immigrants who come here to take advantage of the US"" is wrong. Mr Trump spoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate the New York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year. During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade. Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according to Politico. When Prime Minister Solberg met Mr Trump in Washington he may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jet only available in Call of Duty, a computer game.  A day later Norway was reportedly mentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal.    Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics.  According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told the lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, or Asian nations. Mr Trump cited Libya as an example of the failure of Western military intervention regularly on his way to winning the US election, but the record shows he backed it at the time.The country has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Fighters aligned to the so-called Islamic State group (IS) have threatened to cause further chaos in recent years.President Trump held a meeting with Libya's prime minister, Fayez Al-Sarraj, at the White House in December last year during which they discussed political reconciliation in the country and the threat from IS. But the US leader is keen to take a less engaged approach to the country, telling reporters he did not ""see a role"" there for the US. Amid the NFL national anthem controversy, President Trump singled out Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt as an example for other sportspeople to follow.He tweeted: ""Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time, showed RESPECT for our National Anthem!""Mr Trump had criticised NFL players who kneel during the national anthem as a protest, to highlight the treatment of black Americans. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trump tweeted that he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.Mr Trump's administration announced in January 2018 that it would cancel permits that allow nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to live and work in the US.They were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) after earthquakes rocked the Central American country in 2001.Salvadoreans now have until 9 September 2019 to leave or face deportation, unless they find a legal way to stay. Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was one of the first world leaders to meet Donald Trump at the White House. Their talks at the end of March 2017 focused on the future of the Nato alliance and President Trump ""urged"" the Danish leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence. The meeting appeared to go well, with Mr Rasmussen saying afterwards that he was ""more positive"" about Denmark's relationship with the US than when he ""evaluated the situation right after the [US] election."" Sudan is another of the predominantly Muslim countries that Donald Trump has included on his travel ban list. The Supreme Court partly reinstated the ban after it was twice rejected by judges in the US. It means people without ""close"" family or business relationships in the US could be denied visas and barred entry. More recently, Mr Trump postponed a deadline on whether to permanently lift US sanctions against Sudan so he could have more time to ""establish that the government of Sudan has demonstrated sufficient positive action"" on counter-terrorism efforts, providing humanitarian relief and securing a ceasefire in conflict areas.The US has issued sanctions against Sudan since the 1990s, when it was accused of state-sponsored terrorism.Mr Trump has yet to appoint a special envoy for Sudan. President Trump's main focus in Yemen has been his ban on its citizens from travelling to America.In December 2017, the US Supreme Court ruled President Donald Trump's travel ban on six mainly Muslim countries could go into full effect, pending legal challenges.Mr Trump has also called on Saudi Arabia to ""allow food, fuel, water, and medicine to reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it,"" in response to the humanitarian crisis linked to the ongoing Saudi campaign and blockade against Houthi rebels.Yemen was the site of the first military operation authorised by Mr Trump, in which a special forces team raided the compound of a suspected terrorist leader. The mission didn't go to plan. The US Navy Seals came under fire from fighters belonging to the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula group (AQAP) and one member of the elite team was killed. It later emerged that a number of civilians were also killed in the operation, which had been drawn up in November 2016 but approved by Mr Trump. In an interview with Fox News, Mr Trump appeared to lay blame for the death of Navy Seal William ""Ryan"" Owens on military leaders.  ""This was a mission that was started before I got here,"" Mr Trump said. ""They came to see me and they explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected... And they lost Ryan."" A New York Times article claimed the Navy Seals found out their mission had been compromised after intercepting AQAP communications but they ""pressed on toward their target"" nonetheless.  Mr Trump responded to criticism by tweeting that it had been ""a winning mission... not a failure"". A White House statement said it was a ""successful raid"" that yielded ""important intelligence"". Carryn Owens, the widow of the Navy Seal, was invited to Mr Trump's joint address to Congress. She got a standing ovation and as the room applauded, the president said her husband's legacy was ""etched into eternity"".

Debt Market Sentiment,Gen Z's new pro-union push,2024-09-14,2023-09-04,Kate Morgan,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230831-the-gen-zers-leading-a-new-pro-union-push,"US union membership has plummeted. But young workers are organising, pushing companies to rise to the occasion and meet their demands for better conditions on the job. Labour unions in the United States have seen a major decline since the 1980s. According to Bureau of Labour Statistics data, more than 20% of workers belonged to a union in 1983 (the first year such data was available). In 2022, that number had fallen by half. The decline, which many experts attribute to employer-friendly policy change, an increase in right-to-work laws that weaken employees' organising and collective bargaining power and a trend towards outsourcing, has left the United States with one of the lowest union densities among major economies. But even with membership on the decline, worker support for unions has risen. In August 2022, Gallup recorded the highest levels of union support since the 1960s; 71% of Americans approve of labour unions, and about one in 10 non-union workers said they were ""extremely interested"" in joining one. High-profile labour efforts have dominated headlines: in recent years, workers at Amazon, Starbucks and several universities have organised. The Writer's Guild of America and actors' union SAG-AFTRA remain on strike over demands for wage and benefit increases, along with protection from evolving AI. And among those on the frontlines are the nation's youngest workers leading the renewed push for labour unions. Gen Z is, according to the Center for American Progress, ""the most pro-union generation alive today"". ""I think there's a growing understanding that if you have a job, you need a union,"" says Jaz Brisack (pictured above). The now-26-year-old was one of the earliest leaders of union efforts at Starbucks in Buffalo, New York, in 2021. Gen Z's involvement and support for organised labour makes sense considering the context of their experiences, says Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labour education research and a senior lecturer at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labour Relations, US. ""First of all, they grew up being told they were going to be better off than their parents,"" she says. ""The fact is, they struggled to find jobs, and the jobs they found were not as good as their parents'. They and the generations that follow them are saddled with college debt. They're looking at a world where they wonder if they should even have children because of climate change. They're concerned about broader social issues like reproductive rights and gun control, and planning to hold governments and employers accountable on those issues."" Some company practices during the pandemic, adds Bronfenbrenner, increased Gen Z workers' enthusiasm for unions: low-income employees, service workers and workers without a higher educational degree had difficulty accessing personal protective equipment (PPE), health care and paid sick time on the job. Reports from the Economic Policy Institute show that, in 2020, just upwards of 10% workers deemed ""essential"", including those in the retail sector, were covered by a union contract. Workers who were represented by a union, meanwhile, were more likely to access internal and external mechanisms to advocate for safety and health concerns. ""Many of these workers were on the front lines,"" she says. ""When they asked for something as simple as some PPE, or time off to take care of their family members, or to not come to work when they were sick, employers said no. Workers are willing to put up with a lot but risking your life and your family's lives – that's too much, and I think that was the final straw."" Brisack, who uses they/them pronouns, says their employment at Starbucks amid a pandemic-related job shortage moved them to feel ""nothing is coming to save us"". It inspired them to try to generate their own solutions, and was key to their organising efforts, which involved many Gen Zers and supporters. Brisack now believes in the power of unions to create equality among what they see as an inequitable power structure, saying, ""I think people are looking back and seeing that what actually created improved standards of living in the past was union density, and they're more open to ideas about organising."" Gen Z vs the world Baby boomers had plenty to draw them together, says Bronfenbrenner, as the generation ""got very involved politically with civil rights, the women's movement and the anti-war movement"". But in the late 1970s, ""it shifted very dramatically, and there was much more focus on taking care of yourself and making money"". Researchers widely consider Generation X to be significantly more independent and self-reliant; and millennials, according to empirical research, are the most individualistic generation of all. Gen Z, on the other hand, appears to be the collective generation. A multi-year Stanford University research project, the findings of which are detailed in the book Gen Z, Explained: The Art of Living in a Digital Age, determined the group born between the mid-1990s and 2010 is highly collaborative. Brisack believes since Gen Z feels they've been collectively let down by society, many feel it's necessary to act as a group to improve things. Gen Z-driven unionisation efforts also tend to be marked by the generation's passion for social causes, and their demands reflect it, says Bronfenbrenner. ""There's this term, 'organising for the common good',"" she says. She points to several moments; for instance, in the spring, striking teachers in California demanded sustainability initiatives and better care for homeless students. ""The Starbucks workers demanded their employer take a stand on LGBTQ rights,"" she adds. But Gen Z organisers don't only have new demands; they're also organising new industries, including hourly wage positions that haven't traditionally been covered by union protections. ""When we first started taking on Starbucks, there were a lot of people in the union world who were like, 'this is not a good target. This is not reasonable',"" says Brisack. ""Because it's tiny workplaces and a company that's going to fight it, and really high turnover so you're reinventing the wheel every few months.""  Large corporations may also have the power to launch widescale anti-union campaigns and messaging that can be difficult for small-scale organisers to overcome. But while many Gen Z organisers like Brisack have realistic expectations about what unionising in service industry jobs can – or can't – accomplish, they still find it worthwhile. ""Obviously, we're not going to get pensions and a lot of things that unions were able to get in the past in some industries – at least not without really, really solid union density,"" they say. ""But I think we can change the standard of living from, 'these are poverty jobs' to being able to have a career and be long-term workers in these roles without sacrificing a standard of living."" Efficient organisers Beyond being enthusiastic about organising, Gen Z is also just plain good at it. Their tactics have evolved faster than companies' union-busting efforts, and Gen Z-led protests have drummed up major public attention and support. Organisers at the media outlet Business Insider, for instance, utilised a robust social media campaign; some experts say this technique catalysed executives to recognise the union after a 13-day strike.  This social innovation can offer a kind of insulation against employers' efforts to prevent unionisation, says Bronfenbrenner. ""Creativity puts the employer off guard because the workers are having fun. They're not supposed to be having fun when there's an anti-union campaign; they're supposed to be scared and intimidated. When unions do creative things like use memes, it turns that whole climate of fear and conflict on its head."" And Gen Z's mastery of social media and multi-platform communication helps create widespread public support, she adds. Data from the Pew Research Center research has shown public sentiment towards corporations is increasingly negative. And the public is more likely to support workers moving against them, she says even when it creates inconveniences like TV shows' new seasons being postponed, or UPS packages being delayed. ""There's a public who is willing to make sacrifices for workers' rights,"" says Bronfenbrenner. Finally, what makes Gen Z workers in service industries and low-wage jobs the ultimate organisers, she adds, is that they're far less affected by traditional union-busting techniques because they don't care all that much about getting fired. ""These companies already don't offer them pensions or long-term promotional tracks. They already move around from job to job, so getting fired is not the same threat,"" believes Bronfenbrenner. Change or trend? Even amid a declining rate of unionisation, most Americans believe unions are good for workers. And despite years of pro-employer legislation at the federal level, in late August, the treasury department issued a report that showed unions were good for the economy. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen wrote that unionising ""could contribute to reversing the stark increase in inequality we’ve seen in recent decades, promoting economywide growth"". Whether recent organising efforts will translate into change at a systemic level, or a return to the kind of union density America saw in the last century remains to be seen. Brisack believes the unionisation of high-churn service industries creates momentum. ""People might be moving from one job to another, partly because of the industry being a high-burnout, high-exploitation industry, but people are going to take the union principles with them,"" they say. ""Once you've been through one union campaign, it's a lot harder to just accept exploitation or unfair conditions, or having no voice in future workplaces.""  Bronfenbrenner says larger developments may be brewing. There's been a changing of the guard at the National Labour Relations Board (NLRB), the independent federal agency that provides protections for private-sector employees, she points out, and those running the agency ""are responding to their job very differently, and decisions keep coming down that are making organising easier"". But those positions are appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate, adds Bronfenbrenner. ""All of this can change with a new administration and Congress. The question is, can this moment outlast that? Will these young people get motivated to make sure change is happening beyond just their workplace? Will they get discouraged when the change doesn't happen fast enough?"""
Debt Market Sentiment,"London still works for share listings, says boss",2024-09-14,2023-06-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65777308,"""London still works"" as a place to float a business on the stock exchange, according to the boss of the world's largest producer of natural soda ash. We Soda has announced plans to list its shares in the UK, in a move that could value it at up to $7.5bn (£6bn). The move is being seen as a boost for London's stock market, after concern it is losing out to overseas rivals. It would be the country's biggest flotation so far this year and could see We Soda enter the FTSE 100 index. According to consultancy EY, the amount raised through share flotations in London fell by 90% last year. Earlier this year, building materials giant CRH said it would be moving its main share listing from the UK to the US. British microchip designer Arm is to float in the US despite reports that the UK government had lobbied it to choose London. But We Soda chief executive Alasdair Warren told the BBC's Today programme it had chosen the UK as it felt the London market was one that would ""well understand our business"". The soda ash produced by We Soda can be found in washing powder detergents, and is also used by companies in the production of goods such as glass. solar panels and batteries for electric vehicles. As well as soda ash, Mr Warren said the company was also a chemicals producer, ""with lots of characteristics which are similar to a lot of the speciality chemicals companies that are listed in London"". Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges. But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here. Accountants, lawyers, financial PR firms and others feed off the fees that UK listings generate. The exodus has not gone unnoticed by the government. It has been scrambling to try to make the UK a more attractive place for companies to set out their stall. We Soda already has its headquarters in London and Europe is its biggest market.  Mr Warren added that since the company had launched its flotation plans, ""we've had almost 300 investors express interest, around half of those are from the UK, but a half of them are from also other countries around the world, including a lot from the US and Europe"". ""So I think that that's an endorsement of the fact that London still works and we're very confident we'll get a good deal done,"" he said, We Soda is owned by Ciner Group, a Turkish industrial conglomerate controlled by billionaire Turgey Ciner. The flotation is aiming to raise about $800m for the Ciner Group, with part of the proceeds being used to pay down debt. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the flotation was a ""ray of light"" for the London market. However, she added it was ""unlikely to lead to a flood of immediate listings due to the still volatile nature of market sentiment""."
Debt Market Sentiment,Why people in China stopped paying their mortgages,2024-09-14,2022-08-09,By Suranjana Tewari,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-62402961,"""Construction stops, mortgage stops. Deliver homes and get repaid!"" That was one of the chants disgruntled apartment buyers in China used at a protest in June. But their ire over unfinished homes didn't stop at signs and chants. Hundreds of them stopped paying their mortgages - a radical step for China, where dissent is not tolerated.  A young couple who moved to Zhengzhou in central China told the BBC that after receiving the down payment last year, the developer withdrew from the project and construction stalled. ""I have imagined countless times the joy of living in a new home, but now it all feels ridiculous,"" the woman, who did not wish to be named, said. A woman in her late 20s who also bought a home in Zhengzhou told the BBC that she too is ready to stop paying her mortgage: ""After the project is fully resumed, I'll continue paying."" Many of them can pay but are choosing not to, unlike the US subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 when money was lent to high-risk borrowers who then defaulted. They have purchased homes in roughly 320 projects around the country, according to a crowd-sourced estimate on Github where homeowners have been posting about their decision. But it's unclear how many actually stopped paying.  The boycotted loans could total $145bn (£120bn), S&P Global ratings estimates. Other analysts say it could be even higher. The revolt has rattled authorities, focusing attention on a market already under pressure from a slowing economy and a serious cash crunch. More alarmingly, it has signalled a lack of confidence in one of the main pillars of the world's second largest economy.  ""Mortgage boycotts, driven by deteriorating sentiment toward property, are... a very serious threat to the financial position of the sector,"" think tank Oxford Economics said in a recent note. China's property sector makes up a third of its economic output. That includes houses, rental and brokering services; industries producing white goods that go into apartments; and construction materials. But China's economy has been slowing - in the last quarter it grew by just 0.4% compared to the previous year. Some economists don't expect any growth this year. That's largely because of Beijing's zero-Covid strategy - repeated lockdowns and continued restrictions have affected incomes and, in turn, savings and investments. The size of China's economy means that disruption in a crucial market - like property - can affect the global financial system. Experts believe contagion is the concern now - banks won't lend if they believe the sector is tanking.  ""It will all depend on policy,"" says Ding Shuang, head of Greater China economic research at Standard Chartered. ""Unlike in other parts of the world where property bubbles break because of the markets, this is government-inflicted.""  Thirty real estate companies have already missed foreign debt payments. Evergrande, which defaulted last year on its $300bn debt, is the most high-profile casualty. S&P has warned that if sales do not pick up, more companies could follow suit. Demand for homes is also not rising as China undergoes a demographic change with urbanisation and population growth slowing.  ""The fundamental issue is that we have reached a turning point in the housing market in China,"" says Julian Evans-Pritchard, a senior China economist at Capital Economics.  Real estate accounts for about 70% of personal wealth in China - and home buyers often pay upfront for unfinished projects. These ""pre-sales"" make up 70%-80% of new home sales in China, Mr Evans-Pritchard said, adding that developers need that money because they use it to fund several projects at once.  But many young and middle class Chinese are no longer investing in property, likely because of a weak economy, job losses and pay cuts - and now the fear that developers might not complete projects. ""That's part of the problem - developers were counting on new money coming in, and those new sales are not happening anymore,"" Mr Evans-Pritchard said. More than $220bn worth of loans could be tied to unfinished projects, according to banking group ANZ. And credit - a  major source of cash in the boom years - has also dried up.  In 2020, China's government introduced the ""three red lines"" - accounting measures to limit how much developers could borrow. That cut off funding, and the subsequent lack of confidence in the market has also affected banks' willingness to lend to property companies.  For one, Beijing is putting the onus on local governments - they're offering reduced deposits, tax rebates and cash subsidies to home buyers, and relief funds to developers. But this comes at a cost because local coffers will take a hit as property developers buy less land. ""I think this is the moment for the central government and regulators to step in,"" Mr Ding said. ""At some point it will step in to ring-fence the problem of some companies. The sector is too important for the economy."" The Financial Times recently reported that China issued $148bn in loans to help property developers, and Bloomberg reported that mortgage holders may be given a payment holiday without it affecting their credit score. But in a recent note, Oxford Economics said any government intervention in real estate and infrastructure may provide a short-term boost but that ""it is not ideal for China's longer-term growth as the government and the financial sector are being forced to help sustain an unproductive (and failing) real estate industry"". This is also not just a financial crisis. The boycott of mortgages risks becoming a serious social issue, Mr Ding said. And that could become a problem for President Xi Jinping ahead of a crucial party congress later this year where he is expected to seek a historic third term.  Analysts say the reported bailout - $148bn - may not be enough. Capital Economics estimates companies need $444bn just to complete halted projects. It's also not clear whether banks - especially smaller rural ones - can absorb the cost of the mortgage strike.  Even if construction restarts, many developers may not survive because house sales are unlikely to shore up sentiment. Sales in China's 100 top developers dropped by 39.7% in July compared to the same period last year, according to China Real Estate Information Corp (CRIC). This crisis is the clearest indication yet that China's economy is at a crossroads. ""The government is trying its best to find new sources of growth but that's going to be challenging because the economy has been very reliant on property, infrastructure investment and exports over the last three decades,"" Mr Evans-Pritchard said. ""The era of very rapid growth in China is probably now over... and that's most obvious in the property sector at the moment."" Additional reporting by BBC Beijing"
Debt Market Sentiment,Global markets in sell-off mode,2024-09-14,2018-10-26,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45995725,"Global markets remained in sell-off mode on Friday, as investor worries sent shares in Asia, Europe and the US tumbling. The benchmark S&P 500 index in the US slid more than 1.7%, closing down almost 10% from its September high. The Dow Jones fell 1.2%, while the Nasdaq slumped more than 2%. The falls extended losses earlier in the month, fuelling concerns that sentiment is shifting as investors face a widening mix of risks. As of this week, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indexes have given up the gains they posted earlier in the year, while the Nasdaq is up only about 2%. On Friday, a US Commerce Department report showing stronger-than-expected annualised growth of 3.5% in the third quarter failed to bolster confidence, as analysts focused on weakness in exports, housing and business investment. Disappointing quarterly results from tech giants Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet also fuelled Friday's declines. On the S&P 500, Amazon - previously one of the market's star performers - was one of the biggest losers. Shares in the retail giant fell more than 7%, after the firm forecast weaker sales growth than expected for the upcoming Christmas season. October is typically a bumpy month for the markets, but the declines have made for one of the worst months in several years. Analysts expect global growth to slow next year, particularly in China. In the US, companies are facing rising costs due to labour shortages and trade tariffs. In Europe, uncertainty over Brexit and Italian debt has also fuelled worries.  On Friday, France's CAC 40 index fell 1.3%, while the Dax slipped about 1%.  In London, the FTSE 100 retreated, closing down 0.9% at 6,939.56. Earlier, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 1.1%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.4%."
Debt Market Sentiment,Moving home can be stressful for Fido too,2024-09-14,2017-12-22,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42402920,"Move into your dream home and the dog immediately chews the new sofa.  The result: more stress which, according to an expert, was probably the cause of the furniture destruction in the first place. ""Dogs will pick up on your stress when moving house,"" says Gwen Bailey, founder of Puppy School, a network of canine training classes. ""It is best to leave them with relatives for a couple of weeks so they can move into a more settled house."" One in four UK households own a dog. More than a million homes are expected to be bought next year. That is a lot of hounds on the move. So, given that 2018 is the Chinese Year of the Dog (beginning in February), perhaps the UK's favourite pet should get a little more consideration during the upheaval of moving home. At least property-buying dog lovers will have something to help them in 2018 - time to prepare. The ongoing income squeeze means experts do not expect a surge in demand among potential buyers next year. Prices will only creep up. So, nobody need buy and move in a rush.  Ms Bailey, whose book The Perfect Puppy has been in print for 21 years, says that dogs can become more territorial, aggressive, keen to chew anything, or docile - depending on their personality - during the stress of moving home. She suggests that making up the dog's bed, making sure they have their water bowl, and establishing a routine, should be priorities, however untidy the new home. The new home offers everyone the chance of a fresh start, even the dog, she says, while her seven-month-old Vizsla, Otto, plays around her. ""This is a perfect opportunity to start again, to introduce some new rules and new routines. So if, say, you do not want your dog to go upstairs, then a new home is a good time to make that change,"" she says. She also suggests that dog owners consider their new neighbours when moving home, particularly if there are cats or children next door. But what are the chances of many people getting new neighbours in 2018? Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), says the housing market in many areas will be muted owing to a constraint on affordability. The RICS prediction, drawn from surveyors across the UK, has one of the best track records for accuracy. In 2018, the expectation is for house prices to be unchanged, and for the cost of renting to rise by 1%. However, this masks a big regional difference. Prices might well fall in London and the South East of England, RICS predicts, while rising fastest in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and the North West of England. House prices compared to earnings are still lower than before the financial crisis in these areas where property values are expected to increase. It is not only geography that housing market analysts believe will be important in 2018, but also the type of property. Property portal Rightmove, which tracks asking prices, expects homes with two bedrooms or fewer to rise in price by 3%, compared with a 2% rise in three- and four-bedroom homes.  But the jump in price remains the greatest when moving from a three- to a four-bedroom home, rather than moving between smaller homes.  Housing commentator Henry Pryor, whose previous prediction of a 4% fall in house prices in 2017 is looking well wide of the mark, says house price predictions are a folly. The effect of interest rates, government schemes to assist first-time buyers, and the sentiment of lenders, can have a big effect on prices and are difficult to foresee. In 2018, the B word (Brexit) might make buyers delay any potential purchase, he says, but the D words (debt, divorce, and death) will continue to drive some activity in the housing market. Again, he expects house prices to fall in 2018. Ed Stansfield, chief property economist at Capital Economics, who is predicting a 2% rise, agrees that buyers and lenders will be cautious in 2018. This, he says, will be the effect of interest rates. The Bank of England recently raised its benchmark rate for the first time for 10 years. It now stands at 0.5%. For Ray Boulger of John Charcol mortgage brokers the impact of any further rises in interest rates would not create too much of a struggle for those who have taken out a home loan recently. These homeowners would already have been tested to ensure they could cope with larger interest rate rises, and most are on fixed-rate deals. Where it could have an effect, he suggests, is by reducing the maximum mortgage available to new applicants. First-time buyers need to find an average deposit of about £33,000, according to Russell Galley, of mortgage lender Halifax. At least this group will be cheered by predictions of small rises, or even falls in house prices. This leads to what, for many people, is the deciding factor on whether to buy their first home,  move to a bigger one, or stay put. It is not potential interest rate rises, not the accessibility of mortgages, and certainly not the welfare of the family pet. It is how well off people feel. So, experts agree, a predicted ongoing squeeze on incomes will probably mean a somewhat static UK housing market in 2018. That might be good news for Fido at least."
Debt Market Sentiment,Pawnbroker shuts shops as it seeks lifeline,2024-09-14,2019-09-13,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49690753,"Customers of a High Street pawnbroker are being left in the dark after branches were closed and calls unanswered. A&B Pawnbrokers (Albemarle & Bond) and Herbert Brown stores have closed their doors, while its website says ""this store"" has ceased trading. Owner Speedloan Finance told the BBC all its 116 stores had been closed because of ""significant losses"". The firm said it was ""exploring options available to it"". These included finding a buyer for some or all of the stores, it said. ""Speedloan is due to enter into a period of consultation with employees concerning its proposal and has in the meantime offered its employees voluntary redundancy,"" it added. The pawnbrokers' trade body hit out at the firm's unanswered helpline. ""Their decision to downscale UK operations is a strategic matter for the company but [we have] expressed concern that the communication of their actions to their customers falls below the standards expected of its members,"" the National Pawnbrokers Association (NPA) said.  ""In particular, we are most unhappy with the fact that customers cannot get through to the helpline. We have demanded that the management of the company resolve this as a matter of urgency.""   Katie Prescott, business reporter Industry insiders are shocked at the way Albemarle & Bond has handled its abrupt closure.  Many say that moving the pledges (the goods secured against the loan) to a central location is unfair, as most of their customers like to deal with things in their local branch.  One said that many of these clients don't have easy access to standard forms of credit, explaining that one option offered by A&B, to pay their loan online using a debit card, was often not appropriate, although they can also use cash in a NatWest branch.  The main concern now is what happens to those customers.   The BBC understands from a source close to one of the UK's biggest pawnbroker chains, Harvey & Thompson, that they are talking to A&B about the situation and are making every effort to offer their support and help for customers and staff. However, what that support looks like is yet unclear.  It's a sentiment echoed by the National Pawnbrokers Association.  Albemarle & Bond has a chequered history. Business boomed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, but it fell victim to a plunging gold price.  In 2013, it announced it was melting down gold in order to pay its debts. A few months later, it fell into administration.  It changed hands twice, to be bought in 2015 by the Japanese pawnbroking company Daikokuya Holdings. In 2016, it was given a £10m cash injection from the investment firm Gordon Brothers. Four years on and it is once again on the market. Its latest set of accounts show that it lost £3.3m last year - as against £1.6m the year before.  Pawnbrokers allow customers to offer something valuable as security for a loan, or buy items such as jewellery and antiques. They lend money quickly, but usually at a worse rate than banks. Stores also often offer other financial services such as currency exchange and buying gold. The company said that any items pawned in A&B stores will be transferred to a central store, and can be redeemed or sold through this operation. ""If your items are expired or due to expire, please note we will not take any action with your items until we speak to you,"" the website said. ""Unfortunately, we were unable to contact all customers prior to the closure date. We apologise for any inconvenience this has caused."" Letters have been sent by Albemarle & Bond, which was established in 1840, to customers as stores closed. The regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said it was aware that companies operated by Speedloan had closed stores. ""We are engaging with the firm and asking them to ensure this process is carried out in an orderly manner and to minimise disruption to Speedloan's customers,"" the FCA said. Speedloan said it was keeping the FCA informed. The Financial Ombudsman Service said it had received calls from frustrated customers unable to get through to the company and were worried about their items. Customers can contact the company on 01865 798114, which is a dedicated hotline, or by email at info@albemarlebond.com.  If customers are not happy with the response from the company, they can contact the Financial Ombudsman Service to complain on 0800 023 4567, or the FCA customer helpline on 0800 111 6768. More information is available from the National Pawnbrokers Association. Consumer advice on pawnbroking is available from Citizens Advice and the Money and Pensions Service"
Debt Market Sentiment,IMF sounds alarm on US trade tariffs,2024-09-14,2018-06-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44488251,"The Trump administration's trade policies are likely to hurt the US economy and undermine the world's trade system, the IMF has warned. IMF director Christine Lagarde said a trade war would lead to ""losers on both sides"" and have a ""serious"" impact. The caution comes as the US prepares to levy new tariffs on $50bn worth of Chinese imports. New duties on foreign steel and aluminium, announced in March, have already gone into effect. Those tariffs have already prompted Europe, Mexico, Canada and China to introduce or announce plans for counter-measures in retaliation.  The move threw the G7 meeting last weekend into disarray, with US President Donald Trump retracting his endorsement of the joint statement and lashing out at host Canada.  While the IMF expects the trade dispute to have relatively minor economic impact - slowing GDP by a fraction of a percentage point - Ms Lagarde said she was concerned about how the fight would affect sentiment. ""What is more critical and more difficult to factor in at the moment ... is the actual impact on confidence,"" she said at a press conference in Washington. The IMF said the White House, which has also threatened to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), is responding to rising concerns about the side-effects of free trade. ""These measures, though, are likely to move the globe further away from an open, fair and rules-based trade system, with adverse effects for both the US economy and for trading partners,"" the IMF said. The IMF outlined the risks in its annual review of the US economy, which offered a bright near-term outlook. The organisation forecasts US growth of 2.9% this year, as the Trump administration's $1.5tn tax cut package and $300bn increase in federal spending temporarily boost activity. However, it expects GDP to slow to 2.7% in 2019 and 1.9% in 2020, trending lower as the decade continues and the effects of the tax cuts fade. In a statement, the US Treasury Department contested those predictions, saying White House policies, including tax reform and de-regulation, would result in ""more sustainable economic growth"". ""While we appreciate the IMF's work on their report and share similar short term forecasts on US economic growth, we differ significantly on the medium and long term projections,"" the US said. Ms Lagarde said she hopes that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin proves correct, but she is concerned about rising public debt and the risk of a sudden bout of inflation. ""Despite good near-term prospects, a number of vulnerabilities are being built-up,"" the IMF said. On Friday, the US is expected to levy tariffs on about $50bn worth of imports from China, in response to alleged theft of intellectual property. The US wants China to stop practices that allegedly encourage transfer of intellectual property - design and product ideas - to Chinese companies, such as requirements that foreign firms share ownership with local partners to access the Chinese market. In April, the US published a list of about 1,300 Chinese products that would potentially be subject to tariffs. The list covered products of industries such as aerospace, information and communication technology, robotics and machinery.    After the US raised duties on foreign steel and aluminium imports in March, China imposed tariffs on US imports, including pork and wine. It had previously said it did not want a trade war but would not sit by if its economy was hurt.  "
Debt Market Sentiment,'Blue Wall' voters rate the Tories one year on,2024-09-14,2020-10-29,By Alex Forsyth and Alice Thompson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-54721183,"Last October, MPs in a packed parliamentary chamber voted for a general election, agreeing to let the country decide its own fate after months of failed wrangling on Brexit.  A year later, we returned to two constituencies in north-east England to see how voters feel about the choice they made.  At 5am, in the final wintery days of the election campaign, Boris Johnson paid a visit to Grimsby Fish Market.  Dressed in white overalls, he shook hands with the fish merchants on the floor, making bold pledges about the benefits for their industry of leaving the EU. Four days later, the constituency of Great Grimsby turned from red to blue, as the Conservatives ousted Labour for the first time in 74 years.   It was one of a swathe of seats across the Midlands and northern England that seemed persuaded by promises of a bright post-Brexit future, and generous investment in communities that often felt overlooked. But Boris Johnson and his government could never have predicted what was coming down the line.  A global pandemic knocked their plans off course, forcing them to confront a public health crisis with serious economic consequences.  Patrick Salmon, who owns fish smoking company Alfred Enderby in Grimsby docks, met the prime minister on the fish market floor last year. Looking back, he said Mr Johnson had ""had the toughest year possible"" trying to tackle coronavirus, and that therefore he was ""going to get it wrong"". ""But I defy anybody to get what we've just been through right,"" he added.  For Patrick, Brexit - and the type of deal the UK makes with the EU on fishing - is still critical, but he acknowledged the issue had taken a ""backseat"" over the last year due to the Covid crisis.  He urged people to be optimistic about the prospects of a good deal, saying ""we all need to be very, very positive. We've got no choice… So let's get behind it and let's talk it up."" Up the road from Patrick's smokers, overlooking the waters of Alexandra Dock, we met up with Mike Woods. Mike, who's chairman of the Grimsby Fish Merchants Association, also met the prime minister at the fish market last December.  He says he was impressed by what he described as Mr Johnson's ""passion"" for the industry, and he still backs him now. ""I seriously still have belief in Boris Johnson,"" he said. ""I do believe that Boris is the right man for the job. And I can't look at the present moment in time and think: who's going to replace him?"" But Mike is nervous about the effect of the crisis on the country's economy. He wants to see the government do more to balance the competing demands of both public health and public finances.   ""I think we need to protect the elderly, and protect the vulnerable, but we also have to balance. We're getting into so much debt as a nation. Who's going to pay for it?"" Not far away, Freeman Street Market has sat in the centre of Grimsby for more than 140 years. A busy community hub, made up of independent craft fairs, food stalls, and sweet shops, we joined some of the traders as they made their last sales of the afternoon.   Nicola Maasdam, who runs a gift shop, is broadly reassured by the government's efforts. ""I think [Johnson] has done the best with what is a completely unprecedented situation. We've never been in a situation like that in living history.  ""And what could they do? I think they've taken the advice that they could take, and have done a pretty good job. There's always things that they could do better."" And if Labour were in charge instead, she doesn't think they would have handled the situation any differently. ""They've still got the same advice that they've been given. They wouldn't have been given any different advice. And I don't think they could have done a better job personally."" But that's by no means a universal view. From his pie shop ""Pie-o-neers"", Stuart Hudson said he thinks of the prime minister as a ""bit of a clown"". ""I don't agree with some of his views and what he goes for. I think the whole way everything's been dealt with has just been backwards altogether."" Josie Moon, who runs a community arts project, is worried and angry. ""This is a storm. We are all in it together. But some of us are on yachts, and some of us are on inflatable dinghies, and I think it's about time that the people in this country wake up and say, you know what, this is terrible.  ""This doesn't have to be like that. In terms of the arts, I worry. I've got so many friends who are artists, so many friends who are musicians, and I weep for what is happening to them, and how they're being treated with utter disdain and contempt and like their lives don't matter."" But has anybody here actually changed their view on the Conservative Party over the last year? Despite concerns from some about how the government has enforced restrictions and handed out economic help, it seems that those who decided to back Mr Johnson last year are still content to do so.  And those who didn't? They're still not impressed by a man they didn't vote for in the first place.  A few hours' drive along the North East coast, the shadow of the steelworks stretches over Redcar's wide sands. The steel industry once powered the town, but now the site is mostly empty, awaiting longed-for regeneration. When we last visited Redcar in February, we met people who'd voted Conservative for the first time and were cautiously hopeful that what some saw as a gamble might pay off. Walking on the beach with his wife Irene, Michael Shepherd isn't so sure now. ""I voted Tory last time"", he said. ""I've been a Labour man all my life.  I think we all got carried away on a wave of enthusiasm for him [Johnson] really.  ""We never seem to see him now. He's taken a retreat stance. It's all the time other people coming out to talk for him. So a lot of confidence has gone really."" Redcar's town centre is dotted with empty shops - a sign of the struggle so many high streets face. There we met Stephen Gent, who was passing through on a trip from County Durham. For him, the past year has marked a shift in the political tone of the country. ""If we think back to the caterwauling in the Houses of Parliament just before Christmas last year, we are certainly in a better situation,"" he said. ""From that point of view, I think Covid has brought the country together more, and there is less division between people than there was."" Despite the pandemic exacerbating talk of a North-South divide, he hasn't lost hope that the region will eventually see some of the investment it's been promised. ""We're not really seeing any major changes or impacts yet,"" he said. ""So it's a matter of waiting and seeing for me. I'm always hopeful."" As evening fell, we watched Redcar Town ladies football club train beneath the floodlights of a well-kept pitch. In a region that feels hard-hit by this pandemic, sport has been essential for many, including Middlesbrough fan Michelle Coleman. She has some sympathy about the challenge the pandemic has presented, despite misgivings about aspects of the government's approach.  ""What I would say is whoever was running the country during this pandemic had an impossible task on their hands. No one could keep the whole country happy,"" she said. ""A lot of the affected areas are in the north, not just the North East, but there's Manchester and Liverpool that have obviously been hit hard. ""I think we just continuously feel that up in the north, we just don't matter. I don't feel like we get as much investment as obviously down south. But I think one thing we do have is the community spirit."" It's a sentiment echoed by head groundsman Graham Rose. ""You can see Redcar town centre, you know, you can see the shops shutting down left, right and centre. And it's so difficult for them to make ends meet at the moment and Covid is the big thing. ""It's made a mess of everything really. But as positive human beings, we will battle through and we'll get on with it."" There is understanding that the pandemic has knocked the government's priorities off course; paradoxically, it may have bought Boris Johnson some time before he's expected to deliver on his election promises. But this unexpected, uncertain year has undoubtedly dented confidence in some quarters.  The true political consequences may depend on how the government handles whatever comes next."

Debt Market Sentiment,Government reassures over Interserve,2024-09-14,2018-01-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42715453,"The government has said it does not believe any of its major suppliers are in a similar position to Carillion. It commented after shares in the construction and services firm Interserve fell amid reports that its financial health was under special Cabinet Office scrutiny.  The Cabinet Office said it monitored all its ""strategic suppliers"", and was in regular talks about their finances. Interserve said it was keeping officials informed.  Interserve shares dive on new warning Carillion: Not alone in hitting problems The company, which employs 80,000 people worldwide, issued a profits warning in September saying its profits were likely to halve, in part because of big losses in its energy-from-waste business.  This was followed by a second profits warning in October.   It said it expected net debt for 2017 to be about £513m, in part because of the problems in the energy-from-waste business, but also a ""normalisation of trading terms with our supply chain and exceptional costs"".  However, it forecast that debt would peak in the first half of 2018. Interserve is involved in a three-year restructuring programme launched by new management in October aimed at improving efficiency, its procurement process and simplifying the business. On Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the Cabinet Office was monitoring Interserve.  In response, Interserve said: ""Last week we announced that we expect our 2017 performance to be in-line with expectations outlined in October and that our transformation plan is expected to deliver £40m-£50m benefit by 2020."" It said it expected its 2018 operating profit to be ""ahead of current market expectations and we continue to have constructive discussions with lenders over longer-term funding"". ""We are keeping the Cabinet Office closely appraised of our progress as would be expected,"" it added. Like Carillion, Interserve's business involves construction, as well as cleaning, healthcare probation and healthcare services.   The Cabinet Office said: ""We monitor the financial health of all of our strategic suppliers, including Interserve.   ""We are in regular discussions with all these companies regarding their financial position. We do not believe that any of our strategic suppliers are in a comparable position to Carillion."" Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said Interserve had had its problems ,""but it's no Carillion"".  He said last week's trading update ""showed improvement"", but added that Wednesday's reports would do ""no good for sentiment, given there may be some twitchiness among investors in the sector following Carillion's collapse"". ""Comparisons with Carillion are all too easy to make, of course - a diverse business operating on thin margins. It has faced pressure from employment and contract mobilisation costs and margin deterioration from a cost base which has not been flexible enough,"" added Mr Wilson. However, he added: ""The arithmetic doesn't look anything like as bad as Carillion."" He pointed out that Interserve had been winning contracts in recent months, including a £140m contract with the BBC to continue providing facilities services and a £227m contract from the Department for Work and Pensions.  Shares in Interserve fell sharply at the start of trading in London, but have subsequently rebounded to stand about 1.5% lower."
Debt Market Sentiment,'Dangerous undercurrents' in global economy,2024-09-14,2018-10-10,By Kamal Ahmed,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45803283,"One of the most comprehensive studies of the state of banking and markets since the financial crisis warns that ""dangerous undercurrents"" are a rising threat to the world economy. The International Monetary Fund's Financial Stability Report says that although banks are far safer than they were in 2008 there are new risks. Trade tensions are growing, the IMF says, and inequality has risen. Further moves towards a trade war could ""significantly harm global growth"". Other threats to trade, such as a disorderly Brexit, could also ""adversely affect market sentiment"", the IMF argues. The US-based organisation says that a ""no-deal"" departure from the European Union could lead to fragmentation in European money markets, meaning that finance cannot flow around the system so efficiently. The body urges the Bank of England to be ready to provide more quantitative easing - money printing - if it is required. In a separate report, the IMF said the UK had historically weak public finances with high levels of debt and low levels of assets. Britain sold off many of its assets in the privatisations of the 1980s and 1990s and also did not create a sovereign wealth fund from its oil revenues, which Norway did.  Of leading industrialised countries, only Portugal's ""net worth"" was in a poorer position, the IMF said.  That could mean that Britain will have to raise more taxes in the future because government-owned asset growth will not provide as much support to the economy. The Financial Stability Report is the second time in 24 hours the IMF has published sober warnings about the state of global finance. On Monday, it downgraded world growth forecasts for next year, blaming new trade barriers. Tuesday's report says governments should resist attempts to roll back banking regulations put in place in 2008 to stop a similar financial crisis happening again. President Donald Trump has already pushed through laws repealing banking rules in America for smaller institutions, saying they were holding back bank lending to businesses.  The IMF also warns market investors, who have seen the largest upward bull run in stocks in history. The report says they are in danger of becoming complacent about the chances of an economic shock to the system. One could be the ending of ""easy money"". Central banks are starting to withdraw the stimulus that was put in place at the time of the financial crisis. Interest rates are rising and quantitative easing - money printing - being dialled back. The IMF fears this could lead to sharp falls in markets. The risks of a government funding crisis in Italy, where the country's banks are under pressure, is also highlighted. ""Looking ahead, clouds appear on the horizon,"" the report, published at the body's annual meeting in Bali, Indonesia, says. ""Support for multilateralism has been waning, a dangerous undercurrent that may undermine confidence in policymakers' ability to respond to future crises. ""Nonetheless, despite trade tensions and continued monetary policy normalisation in a few advanced economies, global financial markets have remained buoyant and appear complacent about the risk of a sudden, sharp tightening in financial conditions."" The IMF's warnings will increase fears that the present buoyancy in global growth may not last. The American economy has been performing strongly, encouraging international investors to move capital there and invest in the dollar. To cool inflationary pressure, the American central bank, the Federal Reserve, is raising interest rates, which acts as a further attraction to global capital because returns are higher. That puts pressure on emerging market economies such as Turkey and Argentina, which have large amounts of debt which concerns investors. The IMF says there is a ""risk of contagion"" as investors become increasingly nervous about the strength of emerging markets, with the risk of capital flows towards the US accelerating. The report says that outflows could hit $100bn (£76.4bn) over a year, about 0.6% of emerging market economies' gross national income. That would be ""of a magnitude"" similar to the financial crisis."
Debt Market Sentiment,Adopting the recovery position,2024-09-14,2021-08-01,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-58047221,"The cost of having staff on furlough is up with the start of August, to 20% of wages. As it ends next month, that remains the biggest threat of a jobs crunch. By the end of June, 141,000 Scots were furloughed, down from 175,000 in late May, and with vacancies high, numbers were on the way down. Across the UK, furloughed workers were down by half a million in the same period, to 1.9m, and a survey out this week from the Office for National Statistics points to that being down to between 1.1m and 1.6m during July. The threat of that crunch point as furlough ends is weakening, but still significant, while uncertainty hangs over companies facing deferred VAT bills and servicing much higher debt as a result of Covid, while many have depleted cash reserves and stunted earning opportunities where social-distancing restrictions still apply. Some sectors remain in dire straits - notably international travel and the events and late-night economy where being crowded is the point. There are big medical threats as well: of rising infection and hospitalisation rates, of more variants, of mass self-isolation feeding through to supply chain problems, of the known unknowns of long Covid, weighing on both the health service and on employers. But there are also clear signs that the economic recovery is beating expectations.  The quarterly monitor of 500 companies in Scotland by the Fraser of Allander Institute, sponsored by Addleshaw Goddard, showed a marked improvement in the number of firms that expect to continue trading through the next six months - from 83% at the end of last year, to 92% in the second quarter of this year. Even in accommodation and food services, which have been hard hit, but which are emerging into a lively staycation season, expectations were the most positive since 2014. The outlook for growth was not so good. The official May figure, of 0.9% growth, looks good. Output remained 2.7% below the pre-pandemic peak. Both figures were marginally better than the UK as a whole. But prospects for both are more sluggish into the second half of this year. What is really striking is the positive momentum from corporate results. This is only part of the economy - the part which is publicly accountable to shareholders. But across reports, the words that keep cropping up are ""ahead of expectations"". That is partly because expectations were so poor, due to so much uncertainty. It is also because the fog is lifting to show consumer sentiment is strong, with unusually-high savings of the past 18 months being unleashed by consumers. Just some of the companies with a headquarters or a big presence in Scotland, over recent days, and ahead of the August shut-down for many: NatWest, formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland and still notionally HQ'd in Edinburgh, reported sizeable profits, but also a healthy reflection on its huge business client base. Gloomy prospects for bad debt this time last year have been downgraded by £700m. Some £190m of those profits is going into dividend payments to its majority shareholder, the UK government. And in case you missed it, that remaining 55% public stake, resulting from the 2008-09 bailout, is to be cut by up to 15 percentage points over the next 12 months, if the price is right. The share price, of course, is nowhere close to break-even for the taxpayer. It's well up on the start of this year, at above 200 pence, but less than half the price at which the bailout took an 82% stake. The share price should be helped upwards by ploughing excess capital into buying back shares. Lloyds Banking Group soared past analyst expectations to a £3.9bn first-half profit.  This time last year, its £3bn set-aside for bad debts took the Bank of Scotland owner deep into a half-year loss. Of that, £656m is being unwound from dud loan provision. Barclays reported on a ""resurgence in activity"". A further, modest unwinding of the money set aside for loans turning sour was in the half-year results for Virgin Money, formerly known as Clydesdale Bank and based in Glasgow. It is taking £19m out of that fund, and leaving £678m in place. Across the main lenders, there's growing competition for mortgage business reflecting and fuelling strong house price increases. That should mean better deals for customers and less profitability for banks. Diageo, the biggest distiller of Scotch whisky, successfully pivoted to the off-trade with the pandemic, and it's successfully pivoting back to bars. Particularly in the US, bars are filling up again, and so are spirit glasses. Disruption to the way people drink continues to hit Guinness, which is also a Diageo product, and is down 23% in Ireland. But a long-term shift from beer and wine towards spirits may have been accelerated. Menzies Aviation. No longer delivering newspapers, the Edinburgh-based global ground-handling firm reported a ""very strong"" start to 2021. It is evident, again, that market disruption, in this case in aviation, has led to opportunities to grab market share.  Cargo has been strong, to replace the loss of passenger airliner bellies in which to pack traded goods. The firm has a joint venture in China, a big expansion in Miami, Europe's air travel sector is the only continent that continues to struggle. In Aberdeen, First Group's financial results for the year to March turned to profit, reflecting a huge injection of public subsidy to keep its buses running, while it cut costs. Passenger numbers have returned to around 60% of pre-pandemic levels. It has been retreating from North America, with the £3.3bn sale of its yellow school bus and transit divisions bringing the ire of big shareholders for valuing them too cheaply. The chief executive, Matthew Gregory, is quitting under the pressure. The global reach of the recovery was evident from earnings announcements in energy and mining companies, also pouring capital into share buybacks - a form of returning value to shareholders by increasing the prices and, not coincidentally, a way for chief executives to maximise their bonuses. After last year seeing oil prices plunge, this year saw Shell boost its dividends. Nestle had its strongest first half in a decade. The most astonishing figures come from the tech giants, riding the wave of lockdown and home-working while also benefiting from the reopening of the economy, boosted savings and America's huge fiscal stimulus. Microsoft's cloud computing division saw growth of more than 50%. Google's online advertising was up by nearly 70%.  Apple sold more than 50% more iPhones, helping lift total sales to $81.4bn in only three months, up by 36% on last year, and strong growth in all its divisions, notably the US, China and in non-hardware services. Facebook then weighed in with bumper profits. The social media mega-corp reported second quarter revenues were up 56% to $29bn. Because it sells advertising on the basis of demand rather than an old-fashioned rate-card, the boom in that online ad market saw prices rise 47%. The company also issued a warning: that this rate of growth can't continue indefinitely. The tech sector has seen far too much froth before, followed by some painful adjustments. Closer to home, the economy is a long way from being out the pandemic woods. Insolvency specialists at Begbies Traynor reported this week on growth in the signals of financial distress for Scottish companies, and notably those that fly beneath the stock exchange radar. During the second quarter of the year, more than 33,000 companies were reckoned to be showing signs of distress, including arrears on loans. That's 24% up on last year, which ought to be no surprise. UK figures are in line with that. That Fraser of Allander business monitor points to 8% of firms being unsure if they'll survive the next six months, and only 51% say they're trading at least normally. Clearly, that's not yet normal."
Debt Market Sentiment,US markets pick up amid global sell-off,2024-09-14,2018-10-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45957674,"US stock markets have begun to recover from a global sell-off, regaining most of their losses in the final hour of trading. The three major indexes closed between 0.4% and 0.6% lower, having earlier been down over 2% with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both at six-month lows. The recovery comes after sharp falls in European and Asian markets, with London's FTSE 100 on track for its worst monthly performance in a decade. Asian stocks also fell overnight. Analysts said it was hard to pinpoint the global falls on one particular factor. In Europe, they said the sell-off had been exacerbated by fears over the situation in Italy, which has the second-highest national debt in the eurozone. The European Commission has told the country to revise its budget, the first time it has ever made such a request.  Meanwhile, there are also fears over the impact on trade of the current situation in Saudi Arabia, where the Kingdom is facing pressure over the death of prominent Saudi critic journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The country is one of the world's largest oil exporters and investors are concerned about the threat of possible sanctions. ING strategist Benjamin Schroeder blamed ""a concoction of concerns"" for the falls, saying investors' overall sentiment was suffering from trade tensions, fears over Italy and Brexit.  While Charles Schwab analysts said these general fears were ""exacerbating already skittish global sentiment"". Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said the general tone was ""not good"". He said it was ""hard to say"" what was driving the falls, but ""the old adage that the market hates uncertainty holds true"". ""But it's not all geopolitical noise and fears about rates - some notable earnings announcements have also rocked confidence,"" he said, noting that disappointing performances from 3M and Caterpillar had hit the Dow's performance.

Debt Market Sentiment,"London still works for share listings, says boss",2024-09-14,2023-06-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65777308,"""London still works"" as a place to float a business on the stock exchange, according to the boss of the world's largest producer of natural soda ash. We Soda has announced plans to list its shares in the UK, in a move that could value it at up to $7.5bn (£6bn). The move is being seen as a boost for London's stock market, after concern it is losing out to overseas rivals. It would be the country's biggest flotation so far this year and could see We Soda enter the FTSE 100 index. According to consultancy EY, the amount raised through share flotations in London fell by 90% last year. Earlier this year, building materials giant CRH said it would be moving its main share listing from the UK to the US. British microchip designer Arm is to float in the US despite reports that the UK government had lobbied it to choose London. But We Soda chief executive Alasdair Warren told the BBC's Today programme it had chosen the UK as it felt the London market was one that would ""well understand our business"". The soda ash produced by We Soda can be found in washing powder detergents, and is also used by companies in the production of goods such as glass. solar panels and batteries for electric vehicles. As well as soda ash, Mr Warren said the company was also a chemicals producer, ""with lots of characteristics which are similar to a lot of the speciality chemicals companies that are listed in London"". Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges. But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here. Accountants, lawyers, financial PR firms and others feed off the fees that UK listings generate. The exodus has not gone unnoticed by the government. It has been scrambling to try to make the UK a more attractive place for companies to set out their stall. We Soda already has its headquarters in London and Europe is its biggest market.  Mr Warren added that since the company had launched its flotation plans, ""we've had almost 300 investors express interest, around half of those are from the UK, but a half of them are from also other countries around the world, including a lot from the US and Europe"". ""So I think that that's an endorsement of the fact that London still works and we're very confident we'll get a good deal done,"" he said, We Soda is owned by Ciner Group, a Turkish industrial conglomerate controlled by billionaire Turgey Ciner. The flotation is aiming to raise about $800m for the Ciner Group, with part of the proceeds being used to pay down debt. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the flotation was a ""ray of light"" for the London market. However, she added it was ""unlikely to lead to a flood of immediate listings due to the still volatile nature of market sentiment""."
Debt Market Sentiment,Why citizenship is now a commodity,2024-09-14,2017-05-30,Katie Beck,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20170530-why-citizenship-is-now-a-commodity,"As more people are willing to move countries for opportunity and stability, anti-immigration policies and tightened borders are prompting a rise in ‘citizenship for sale’. On a recent flight, I was idly flipping through the inflight magazine, when I came across an unusual advert promising “a unique strategy to safeguard your future prosperity and security.” The advert was plugging what it called “citizenship by investment.” I’d heard of citizenship-for-sale initiatives in the past, and – prompted by the ad – I briefly wondered whether a second citizenship beyond my American one was something I might need. Is this something that people other than the uber rich are considering, and for reasons other than tax optimisation? And if so, why? “The global rise of populist movements, together with an ever-increasing sentiment towards the creation of insular societies have all contributed to the unpredictability of our rapidly changing world,” explained the advert. As more countries tighten their borders and paths to immigration, a new industry is working to bypass those restrictions – for a hefty fee. A desire to stay global Investment citizenship programmes are not new. They’ve been around for decades, primarily as a way for countries to boost their incomes. Canada and the Caribbean island of St Kitts and Nevis started theirs in the 1980s and the US and UK began similar ones in the 1990s. The specifics of different investment citizenship programmes vary by country. They allow foreigners to invest in real-estate projects and businesses, buy property, or to donate money directly to a country’s government in exchange for a visa or passport. St. Kitts and Nevis launched its initiative in 1984, one year after the fledgling country claimed independence from the UK. The aim was to get more money flowing in from entrepreneurs who saw value in tropical beaches and low taxes. It only attracted a few hundred participants in the beginning. But, by 2009, backed by a marketing campaign, passport holders of the island nation were given visa-free access to the 26 Schengen area countries and demand increased rapidly. The industry has seen huge growth in recent years. 2014 marked the first year that the US ran out of immigrant-investor visas before the end of the fiscal year. London-based CS Global Partners, the consultancy firm that made the inflight-magazine advert I read, shepherds investors through the legal process of procuring a passport through investment. The firm says interest in their services has grown fourfold in the past year. “We are definitely seeing big shifts,” says CEO Micha Emmett. “The traditional market still exists – very much so – but we’ve seen [people from] countries that were never interested in second citizenship by investment options before now coming online making inquiries. For example, we saw a 400% increase in enquiries from Turkey in March.” Events including the decision by Britain to leave the European Union and the 2016 US Presidential election are driving new interest. UK citizens are now seriously weighing their options, Emmett says. “In terms of what happened in the UK with Brexit, on the day that the vote was announced, our phones rang off the hook, I was approached in the street by people, there was a very apparent panic,” she adds. A changing clientele  Wealthy, private investors from emerging market economies are driving the trend, according to The International Monetary Fund. Data from the controversial EB-5 visa programme in the US, which allows foreigners to invest in real-estate projects in exchange for a fast-tracked green card application, shows the demographics are shifting, according to Peter Joseph, executive director of Invest In USA, an industry trade organisation for the programme. “We are seeing a few countries adding to a diversifying trend. China is the predominate source [of applicants], making up about 80%, but places like Vietnam, India and Brazil have been sources of growth in the past few years,” he says. Paul Williams of La Vida Golden Visas, which specialises in second residency and citizenship within Europe, works with clients from over 50 countries. Since Britain voted for Brexit, he says, he has seen an interest from UK citizens for the first time. Citizenship: a hot commodity The most well-known programmes are in the Caribbean, where white sand beaches, low investment minimums, non-restrictive residency requirements and quick processing times combine to attract investors. For example, to become a citizen of the Caribbean island of Dominica, which sits between Guadeloupe and Martinique, you’ll need an investment of $100,000, with no requirement to spend any time on the island and no wait-time. And, such programmes are important economic drivers. In St. Kitts and Nevis, passports are the country’s largest export and the money generated from the programme is seen as responsible for lifting the nation out of debt and fuelling a construction boom. The IMF says Citizenship by investment programmes amounted to 14% of St Kitt’s GDP in 2014, and other estimates say the programme may have accounted for as much as 30% of the government’s revenue in 2015. But increasingly, richer countries are offering 'citizenship for a price'. Comparable programmes in New Zealand cost NZ$1.5m ($1.06m) – a popular move among Silicon Valley’s tech elite recently – or £2m ($2.58m) for the UK and $500,000 for the US. Joseph says the EB-5 programme is hugely valuable for the country, delivering over $1 billion dollars to the US economy each quarter. “We’ve seen exponential growth since the financial crisis in 2008 to the tune of an increase of over 1,200% from 2008 until today,” he says. Increased interest in the US programme is due in part to the relatively stable economy and safe investment environment, but also thanks to the low investment minimum. The EB-5 programme requires the $500,000 to be invested areas lacking jobs and cash, but critics argue the low minimum is a loophole being exploited by developers. Although the US caps the total number of visas granted each year through the programme to 10,000, the number of applicants has no limit. Interest, it seems, doesn’t either. “There are currently over 23,000 investor petitions for a visa number.” Joseph says, “That’s just how many that are pending right now.” At last count, 23 countries from Cyprus to Singapore offered some kind of investment residency or citizenship scheme and more are being created with similar programmes proliferating across Europe. Almost half of all EU member states now offer some form of investment residency or citizenship programmes. Mobility is key For as little as $50,000 (in Latvia) or as much as $10 million (in France), foreigners can buy legal status to live, work and bank in a number of countries. Perhaps more importantly, by extension, they buy access to visa-free travel to countries around the world. And, there’s an informal rating system for the most sought after passports. “Some people in the industry determine [the value] by the number of visa-free countries a person can travel to. So I think at the moment the data out there is that on the German passport you can travel to more countries than with any other citizenship in the world.” Emmett says. In a globalised world where political isolationism is paradoxically on the rise, this freedom of movement is an attractive element of such schemes. Andrew Henderson, an American entrepreneur and founder of the Nomad Capitalist, a blog, podcast and consulting company, has four passports and is working on his fifth. Multiple citizenships provide him with a multitude of entrepreneurial options, he says. He says investing in programmes in the African archipelago of Comoros and the Caribbean Island of St. Lucia give him more opportunities and lower taxes. “For me it’s about how I could have better options, better tax treatment, better treatment as a person and get the same visa free travel.” he says, adding that he expects investment citizenship to rise. “I think the world is going more nomadic.  People don’t want to be in once place. They want to have one or two or three bases for lifestyle reasons and pay reasonable taxes, and that’s what becoming more accessible. While not everyone with multiple citizenships will reside in multiple nations, Williams says the industry can be viewed as a barometer of turmoil in the world.  He says many of the investors he works with see these programmes as a safety net. “Most of our clients do not go and live in the country they invest in,” he says. “They see it as more of an insurance policy. They know that they’ve got that second residency, so if they ever have to jump on a plane they’ve got that option.” Your country for sale Such programmes aren’t without controversy. Afterall, should citizenship be for sale? Detractors say no. Earlier this year in the US, two senators, Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Grassley, introduced a bill to get rid of the EB-5 programme, arguing that it is too flawed to continue. “It is wrong to have a special pathway to citizenship for the wealthy while millions wait in line for visas,"" Feinstein said. Detractors also argue these programmes unfairly favour the rich and are unattainable for everyone else. They also cite concerns about money laundering, criminal activity and backdoor access to countries that circumvent normal immigration systems. Indeed, the intersection of large sums of money and international real estate deals is ripe for fraud. Just this month an FBI Investigation uncovered a $50 million visa fraud operation involving Chinese investors in the EB-5 programme. And in April, the Securities and Exchange Commission brought charges against a man in Idaho who they say spent Chinese investor’s money on new homes, cars and a zip line for himself rather than the real estate projects it was meant for. The St. Kitts and Nevis programme ran into trouble with the US Treasury Department when suspected Iranian operatives were caught using their St. Kitts passports to launder money for banks in Tehran in violation of US Sanctions. Controversy surrounding the US EB-5 programme reached the upper echelons of the White House as the Kushner family’s real estate company was accused of conflicts of interest for using Presidential son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner’s name in a pitch to lure Chinese investments in a New Jersey property development. And the programme’s reputation for shady deals is not going away. But in a world where borders are closing, demand for these services will most likely continue to grow, experts say. Paul William’s advice for UK Citizenswho are anxious about Brexit? Hold tight. ‘Things are uncertain, but they can’t do anything about it now since they are still European residents,” he says. “In two years time, if the UK does end up with the same access to the EU as America, say, then a lot of people will be wanting to do something.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
Debt Market Sentiment,Gen Z's new pro-union push,2024-09-14,2023-09-04,Kate Morgan,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230831-the-gen-zers-leading-a-new-pro-union-push,"US union membership has plummeted. But young workers are organising, pushing companies to rise to the occasion and meet their demands for better conditions on the job. Labour unions in the United States have seen a major decline since the 1980s. According to Bureau of Labour Statistics data, more than 20% of workers belonged to a union in 1983 (the first year such data was available). In 2022, that number had fallen by half. The decline, which many experts attribute to employer-friendly policy change, an increase in right-to-work laws that weaken employees' organising and collective bargaining power and a trend towards outsourcing, has left the United States with one of the lowest union densities among major economies. But even with membership on the decline, worker support for unions has risen. In August 2022, Gallup recorded the highest levels of union support since the 1960s; 71% of Americans approve of labour unions, and about one in 10 non-union workers said they were ""extremely interested"" in joining one. High-profile labour efforts have dominated headlines: in recent years, workers at Amazon, Starbucks and several universities have organised. The Writer's Guild of America and actors' union SAG-AFTRA remain on strike over demands for wage and benefit increases, along with protection from evolving AI. And among those on the frontlines are the nation's youngest workers leading the renewed push for labour unions. Gen Z is, according to the Center for American Progress, ""the most pro-union generation alive today"". ""I think there's a growing understanding that if you have a job, you need a union,"" says Jaz Brisack (pictured above). The now-26-year-old was one of the earliest leaders of union efforts at Starbucks in Buffalo, New York, in 2021. Gen Z's involvement and support for organised labour makes sense considering the context of their experiences, says Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labour education research and a senior lecturer at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labour Relations, US. ""First of all, they grew up being told they were going to be better off than their parents,"" she says. ""The fact is, they struggled to find jobs, and the jobs they found were not as good as their parents'. They and the generations that follow them are saddled with college debt. They're looking at a world where they wonder if they should even have children because of climate change. They're concerned about broader social issues like reproductive rights and gun control, and planning to hold governments and employers accountable on those issues."" Some company practices during the pandemic, adds Bronfenbrenner, increased Gen Z workers' enthusiasm for unions: low-income employees, service workers and workers without a higher educational degree had difficulty accessing personal protective equipment (PPE), health care and paid sick time on the job. Reports from the Economic Policy Institute show that, in 2020, just upwards of 10% workers deemed ""essential"", including those in the retail sector, were covered by a union contract. Workers who were represented by a union, meanwhile, were more likely to access internal and external mechanisms to advocate for safety and health concerns. ""Many of these workers were on the front lines,"" she says. ""When they asked for something as simple as some PPE, or time off to take care of their family members, or to not come to work when they were sick, employers said no. Workers are willing to put up with a lot but risking your life and your family's lives – that's too much, and I think that was the final straw."" Brisack, who uses they/them pronouns, says their employment at Starbucks amid a pandemic-related job shortage moved them to feel ""nothing is coming to save us"". It inspired them to try to generate their own solutions, and was key to their organising efforts, which involved many Gen Zers and supporters. Brisack now believes in the power of unions to create equality among what they see as an inequitable power structure, saying, ""I think people are looking back and seeing that what actually created improved standards of living in the past was union density, and they're more open to ideas about organising."" Gen Z vs the world Baby boomers had plenty to draw them together, says Bronfenbrenner, as the generation ""got very involved politically with civil rights, the women's movement and the anti-war movement"". But in the late 1970s, ""it shifted very dramatically, and there was much more focus on taking care of yourself and making money"". Researchers widely consider Generation X to be significantly more independent and self-reliant; and millennials, according to empirical research, are the most individualistic generation of all. Gen Z, on the other hand, appears to be the collective generation. A multi-year Stanford University research project, the findings of which are detailed in the book Gen Z, Explained: The Art of Living in a Digital Age, determined the group born between the mid-1990s and 2010 is highly collaborative. Brisack believes since Gen Z feels they've been collectively let down by society, many feel it's necessary to act as a group to improve things. Gen Z-driven unionisation efforts also tend to be marked by the generation's passion for social causes, and their demands reflect it, says Bronfenbrenner. ""There's this term, 'organising for the common good',"" she says. She points to several moments; for instance, in the spring, striking teachers in California demanded sustainability initiatives and better care for homeless students. ""The Starbucks workers demanded their employer take a stand on LGBTQ rights,"" she adds. But Gen Z organisers don't only have new demands; they're also organising new industries, including hourly wage positions that haven't traditionally been covered by union protections. ""When we first started taking on Starbucks, there were a lot of people in the union world who were like, 'this is not a good target. This is not reasonable',"" says Brisack. ""Because it's tiny workplaces and a company that's going to fight it, and really high turnover so you're reinventing the wheel every few months.""  Large corporations may also have the power to launch widescale anti-union campaigns and messaging that can be difficult for small-scale organisers to overcome. But while many Gen Z organisers like Brisack have realistic expectations about what unionising in service industry jobs can – or can't – accomplish, they still find it worthwhile. ""Obviously, we're not going to get pensions and a lot of things that unions were able to get in the past in some industries – at least not without really, really solid union density,"" they say. ""But I think we can change the standard of living from, 'these are poverty jobs' to being able to have a career and be long-term workers in these roles without sacrificing a standard of living."" Efficient organisers Beyond being enthusiastic about organising, Gen Z is also just plain good at it. Their tactics have evolved faster than companies' union-busting efforts, and Gen Z-led protests have drummed up major public attention and support. Organisers at the media outlet Business Insider, for instance, utilised a robust social media campaign; some experts say this technique catalysed executives to recognise the union after a 13-day strike.  This social innovation can offer a kind of insulation against employers' efforts to prevent unionisation, says Bronfenbrenner. ""Creativity puts the employer off guard because the workers are having fun. They're not supposed to be having fun when there's an anti-union campaign; they're supposed to be scared and intimidated. When unions do creative things like use memes, it turns that whole climate of fear and conflict on its head."" And Gen Z's mastery of social media and multi-platform communication helps create widespread public support, she adds. Data from the Pew Research Center research has shown public sentiment towards corporations is increasingly negative. And the public is more likely to support workers moving against them, she says even when it creates inconveniences like TV shows' new seasons being postponed, or UPS packages being delayed. ""There's a public who is willing to make sacrifices for workers' rights,"" says Bronfenbrenner. Finally, what makes Gen Z workers in service industries and low-wage jobs the ultimate organisers, she adds, is that they're far less affected by traditional union-busting techniques because they don't care all that much about getting fired. ""These companies already don't offer them pensions or long-term promotional tracks. They already move around from job to job, so getting fired is not the same threat,"" believes Bronfenbrenner. Change or trend? Even amid a declining rate of unionisation, most Americans believe unions are good for workers. And despite years of pro-employer legislation at the federal level, in late August, the treasury department issued a report that showed unions were good for the economy. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen wrote that unionising ""could contribute to reversing the stark increase in inequality we’ve seen in recent decades, promoting economywide growth"". Whether recent organising efforts will translate into change at a systemic level, or a return to the kind of union density America saw in the last century remains to be seen. Brisack believes the unionisation of high-churn service industries creates momentum. ""People might be moving from one job to another, partly because of the industry being a high-burnout, high-exploitation industry, but people are going to take the union principles with them,"" they say. ""Once you've been through one union campaign, it's a lot harder to just accept exploitation or unfair conditions, or having no voice in future workplaces.""  Bronfenbrenner says larger developments may be brewing. There's been a changing of the guard at the National Labour Relations Board (NLRB), the independent federal agency that provides protections for private-sector employees, she points out, and those running the agency ""are responding to their job very differently, and decisions keep coming down that are making organising easier"". But those positions are appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate, adds Bronfenbrenner. ""All of this can change with a new administration and Congress. The question is, can this moment outlast that? Will these young people get motivated to make sure change is happening beyond just their workplace? Will they get discouraged when the change doesn't happen fast enough?"""
Debt Market Sentiment,Evergrande shares jump as debt deadline looms,2024-09-14,2021-09-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58660578,"Shares in Evergrande have jumped in Hong Kong after the troubled property giant struck an agreement with Chinese bond holders on Wednesday. The announcement helped to calm some investor concerns over debts of more than $300bn (£220bn). But the world's most indebted developer is also due to make a $83.5m interest payment on an overseas bond on Thursday. The Hong Kong market was closed on Wednesday when the deal was announced. After a volatile day of trading, Evergrande shares closed more than 17% higher. The firm's shares have lost more than 80% of their value on the Hong Kong stock market so far this year as it struggles to raise money to meet its obligations. The company had moved to placate investors, saying in a statement on Wednesday that it would pay interest payments for its domestic bonds.  The amount due for the domestic bond is estimated to be $35.9m (£26.3m). However, the statement did not reveal how much interest would be paid or when any payment would be made, saying only that the bond ""has already been resolved through private negotiations"". The filing also did not mention the separate foreign bond. Under agreements with investors, the company has a 30-day grace period before a missed payment on the offshore bond would become a default. Some analysts have cautioned that the failure of such a large and heavily-indebted property developer could have a major impact on the Chinese economy, which could potentially spread to the global financial system. And while Wednesday's deal was seen by some investors as a positive development, others remain wary. ""It's too soon to say whether this is just a brief respite or it signifies that a rescue plan is in the works,"" Donald Low, Director of the Institute for Emerging Market Studies at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology said. Investment experts are looking for clarity over what the Chinese government may do to resolve the firm's debt crisis. ""Until there is certainty regarding how the government will deal with Evergrande, investors are likely to remain jittery,"" Catherine Yeung, Investment Director, Fidelity International told the BBC. Ms Yeung also pointed that Beijing' business crackdown - which has seen it increasingly tightening its grip on big businesses, including tech giant Alibaba and ride-sharing app Didi Chuxing- may add to uncertainty.  ""Investors can usually deal with different standalone issues but the regulatory changes we have seen so far this year, coupled with the fast evolving Evergrande situation, has seen investor sentiment weaken,"" she said.

Debt Market Sentiment,Evergrande chairman put under police surveillance,2024-09-14,2023-09-28,By Mariko Oi,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66932548,"Evergrande's chairman Hui Ka Yan has been put under police surveillance as the problems for the Chinese property giant mount. Evergrande said its shares would remain suspended until further notice. It marks another low for the heavily indebted property giant which defaulted in 2021, triggering China's current real estate market crisis. In August, it filed for bankruptcy in the US in a bid to protect its American assets as it worked on a deal. In a statement on Thursday, Evergrande said Mr Hui ""has been subject to mandatory measures in accordance with the law due to suspicion of illegal crimes"", without giving any further detail. The latest share suspension comes just a month after the firm's previous 17-month suspension was lifted. Evergrande - once the world's most valuable property developer - is at the centre of a real estate crisis threatening the world's second largest economy. With more than $300bn (£247bn) of debt, the firm has been scrambling to raise cash by selling assets and shares to repay suppliers and creditors. Most of Evergrande's debt is owed to people within China, many of whom are ordinary citizens whose homes have not been finished. When the firm defaulted on its huge debts in 2021, it sent shockwaves through global financial markets as the property sector contributes to roughly a quarter of China's economy. Several other of the country's major developers have defaulted over the past year and many are struggling to find the money to complete developments. Hui Ka Yan, also known as Xu Jiayin, was born into a poor family in China's central Henan province in 1958, during Mao Zedong's economic and social campaign, the Great Leap Forward. Despite his upbringing, after setting up Evergrande in 1996, he became a poster child for China's super-rich. He earned the nickname ""Belt Brother"" in 2012 by wearing a gold-buckled belt from the French luxury label Hermès to China's annual legislative conference. In 2017, he became China's richest person with his fortune rising to $42.5bn (£34bn). But his wealth has plummeted since then, largely as Evergrande's problems have grown, and he has kept a low profile in recent years. There are several reasons why Evergrande's problems are serious. Firstly, many people bought property from Evergrande even before building work began. They have paid deposits and could potentially lose that money if it goes bust. There are also the companies that do business with Evergrande. Firms including construction and design firms and materials suppliers are at risk of incurring major losses, which could force them into bankruptcy. The third is the potential impact on China's financial system: If Evergrande defaults, banks and other lenders may be forced to lend less. This could lead to what is known as a credit crunch, when companies struggle to borrow money at affordable rates. A credit crunch would be very bad news for the world's second largest economy, because companies that can't borrow find it difficult to grow, and in some cases are unable to continue operating. This may also unnerve foreign investors, who could see China as a less attractive place to put their money. In July, Evergrande revealed it had lost a combined 581.9bn yuan ($79.6bn; £65.6bn) over the past two years. It has been working on a new repayment plan and the company seemed to have been moving closer to resolving the problem after it filed for US bankruptcy protection. Its latest plan was to reissue its overseas debt as new bonds that it had to pay back in about 10 years' time, as well as offering their creditors stakes in the company as shares. But earlier this week, Evergrande revealed its mainland unit Hengda Real Estate had defaulted on 4bn yuan of debt. Chinese business wire Caixin also reported that several current and former executives has been detained. Trading in its two other units - property services and electric vehicles - was also suspended on Thursday. ""China's property-sector stress will continue to pose cross-sector credit risks in the near term,"" wrote Lan Wang and Duncan Innes-Ker of Fitch Ratings.

Debt Market Sentiment,Truss's tax cuts clearly wrong approach - Shapps,2024-09-14,2023-02-05,By Samuel Horti and Laura Kuenssberg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-64530150,"Liz Truss's radical tax-cutting plan was ""clearly"" not the right approach, according to Grant Shapps, who briefly served in her short-lived government. In a return to the political fray, Ms Truss wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that her economic agenda was never given a ""realistic chance"". Business Secretary Mr Shapps said he agreed with Ms Truss on wanting lower taxes - but inflation must fall first. ""You can't just go straight to those tax cuts,"" he said. In her 4,000-word essay, Ms Truss stood by her plans to boost economic growth, arguing they were brought down by ""the left-wing economic establishment"". But she acknowledged she was not ""blameless"" for the unravelling of the mini-budget. They are the first public comments the former PM has made on her resignation in October of last year. Ms Truss resigned after she and her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng introduced a £45bn package of tax cuts - including a cut to the top rate of income tax - which panicked the markets and alienated Tory MPs. Mr Shapps was asked on BBC One's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show whether Ms Truss's approach had been the right one. ""Clearly it wasn't,"" he said. He admitted that the UK's tax burden was currently ""very high"", and said he agreed with Ms Truss that Conservatives must be ""making the good arguments"" that a lower-tax economy can be successful in the long term. But before the government cuts tax, it must first halve inflation, get ""growth into the economy"" and get debt ""under control"", he said. He tried to avoid addressing Truss's criticism that the Conservative Party had failed, for years, to make the case for free-market economics with low taxes and low regulation. Mr Shapps said he took the role of home secretary in the final days of Ms Truss's government out of a sense of ""national duty"", and that by that point ""we'd seen the impact on the markets"". He replaced Suella Braverman, who resigned over two data breaches. Six weeks earlier, as Ms Truss entered Downing Street, she had fired Mr Shapps as transport secretary, a role he held under the former Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Ms Truss's brief time in power - 49 days - made her the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history.  In her essay, Ms Truss said that while her experience last autumn was ""bruising for me personally"", she believed that over the medium term her policies would have increased growth and therefore brought down debt. She argued that the government was made a ""scapegoat"" for developments that had been brewing for some time. ""Frankly, we were also pushing water uphill. Large parts of the media and the wider public sphere had become unfamiliar with key arguments about tax and economic policy and over time sentiment had shifted leftward,"" she wrote. She also said she had not appreciated the strength of the resistance she would face to her plans - including plans to abolish the 45p top rate of income tax. ""I assumed upon entering Downing Street that my mandate would be respected and accepted. How wrong I was."" Mr Kwarteng dropped the 45p income tax proposals 10 days after they were announced, telling the BBC it was ""a massive distraction on what was a strong package"". Less than a fortnight later, Ms Truss sacked Mr Kwarteng, something she said she was ""deeply disturbed by"". She described Mr Kwarteng in her essay as ""an original thinker and a great advocate for Conservative ideas"" - but that it was clear the tax proposals could not survive.  With the benefit of hindsight, she would have acted differently during her premiership, she wrote - but she still backs her plans for growth.  Sir Jake Berry, who was Conservative party chairman under Ms Truss, said he agreed with her assessment of the problems facing the UK economy, but ""not necessarily the cure"". Speaking on the Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show, he added that Ms Truss had been wrong to say the Conservatives had failed to make the argument for lower taxes. Meanwhile, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Ms Truss's policies ""made working people pay the price"". ""The Conservatives crashed the economy, sank the pound, put pensions in peril and made working people pay the price through higher mortgages for years to come. ""After 13 years of low growth, squeezed wages and higher taxes under the Tories, only Labour offers the leadership and ideas to fix our economy and to get it growing."" While Ms Truss resigned as prime minister, she is still serving in parliament as the MP for South West Norfolk."
Debt Market Sentiment,Bank cuts China growth forecast over power outages,2024-09-14,2021-09-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58704200,"Goldman Sachs has become the latest banking giant to cut its growth forecast for China, as the country struggles with energy shortages. It now expects the world's second largest economy to expand by 7.8% this year, down from its previous prediction of 8.2%. The firm says major industrial output cuts caused by power outages add ""significant downside pressures"". It estimates as much as 44% of China's industrial activity has been affected. The power supply crunch, caused by environmental controls, supply constraints and soaring prices, has left some factories and homes without electricity. The energy shortage at first affected manufacturers across the country, many of whom have had to curb or stop production in recent weeks. A document seen by the BBC shows that the largest port in northern China at Tianjin has been affected by a shortage of electricity. Power rationing for cranes that lift cargo between ships and the shore is expected to continue until the end of the week. The shortage has now spread to some homes, with residents in north-east China experiencing unannounced power cuts in the past few days. People living in Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces have complained on social media about the lack of heating, and lifts and traffic lights not working. Provincial authorities have been scrambling to guarantee electricity and heating for residents. China remains highly dependent on coal for electricity generation. Japanese finance giant Nomura, Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley and China International Capital Corporation have also either downgraded their economic growth forecasts for China or warned of lower growth because of the power disruptions. The Chinese economy is already grappling with the impact of tough new regulations of some of the country's biggest industries such as property developers and technology companies. Concerns over the fate of the heavily-indebted real estate giant Evergrande are also weighing on investor sentiment. ""Considerable uncertainty remains with respect to the fourth quarter, with both upside and downside risks relating principally to the government's approach to managing the Evergrande stresses, the strictness of environmental target enforcement and the degree of policy easing,"" Goldman said. On Monday, without mentioning Evergrande by name, China's central bank promised to protect consumers exposed to the housing market. The announcement by the People's Bank of China has been seen as a signal that authorities are ready to act to stop any fallout from the Evergrande crisis spreading to other parts of the economy. Global markets have been rocked in recent days as investors fret about the company's ability to make interest repayments on its more than $300bn (£219bn) of debt."
Debt Market Sentiment,Five ways to revive Zimbabwe’s economy,2024-09-14,2017-11-22,By Matthew Davies,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42079584,"Current events in Zimbabwe show that while a week may be a long time in politics, it is really a very short blink of an eye in economics. Zimbabweans on the streets of Harare and Bulawayo may be hopeful for political change, but they are much more sanguine and realistic when it comes to improving the country's economy.  Presidents can be impeached in days or weeks. It takes years to wreck economies and usually even longer to repair them. So, will Emmerson Mnangagwa be able to take Zimbabwe's economy off life support and at least start to put it on the road to recovery? Analysts are very sceptical that a quick solution is even feasible. The euphoria that has gripped the nation has certainly raised hopes that the future will be brighter, but if that improved sentiment is to deliver economic dividends, the government needs to make some drastic reforms. The first tool President Mnangagwa would need to even get a recovery kick-started is hard currency. Zimbabwe hasn't had a currency of its own since 2009, after hyperinflation killed off the old Zimbabwean dollar.  Since then, the US dollar has been the main currency for transactions, as well as the South African rand. And in recent years a cash shortage has been slowly strangling the economy, which is half the size it was at the turn of the millennium. Ten numbers that will help you understand what's actually going on But who would stump up the cash? Western donors will remain wary of a Zanu-PF government which simply sees Robert Mugabe replaced by Mr Mnangagwa.  The International Monetary Fund, which describes Zimbabwe's economy as one of the most fragile in the world, may be more willing - but only with many strings attached to any deal.  China is possibly the most likely cash benefactor in the initial stages of a Mnangagwa administration. In some circles, Mr Mnangagwa is seen as Zimbabwe's Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader who instigated a degree of market liberalisation.  Assuming the cash is forthcoming, what then? Mr Mnangagwa would have to dump economic policies that are unpalatable to foreign investors.  In 2009, Mr Mugabe signed the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act (IEEA) into law, which aimed to place 51% of companies into the hands of Black Zimbabweans.  Even some Chinese companies have been forced to close their operations in Zimbabwe in recent years, because the IEEA made it unprofitable to do business in the country.  Once considered the breadbasket of Africa, Zimbabwe saw its agricultural production start to plunge at the turn of the century after the government-sanctioned programme of farm seizures.  Some sources claim that Mr Mnangagwa is keen to revitalise Zimbabwe's commercial farms, and may seek the help of white farmers to do it.  Corruption has been a major restraint on economic growth in Zimbabwe for years. Much of the farmland that was seized from white farmers ended up in the hands of army generals and the political elite, who knew next to nothing about agriculture.  The farms simply fell into disarray. Likewise, businesses that ended up with people with more political connections than entrepreneurial flair more often than not went to the wall.  Not that corruption is confined to Zimbabwe in the African context, but it is one of those places that it seems to trickle down from the top. Just ask any South African who has driven their car across the border and been stopped at a police roadblock.  But Mr Mnangagwa has not escaped the corruption criticism. It is alleged that he was at the top of corruption tree when the army effectively took over the Marange diamond fields in the east of the country in 2008. At the time, he was the defence minister.  That whole affair raised the eyebrows even of Mr Mugabe, who said last year that he felt at least $13bn of revenue had gone missing from the diamond bonanza. For nearly 20 years, Zimbabwe has been in default on $9bn worth of international debt. That debt needs restructuring, probably with the assistance of the IMF and the World Bank.  Perhaps a government that did not only include Zanu-PF could even get the debt (or some of it) wiped out. Mr Mnangagwa is thought to be open to a new deal with the IMF, but getting new financing and renegotiating old deals would probably be easier for a unity government which included opposition politicians, especially former Finance Minister Tendai Biti.  Formal jobs in Zimbabwe are rare. Unemployment runs at more than 90%. Creating the conditions for investment and seeing that money flows in should have a dramatic short-term effect on unemployment.  Other conditions already exist: the country has an abundance of natural resources in both agriculture and mining, and a potential labour force that's one of the most skilled in Africa.  All it needs is the political will and the right economic conditions for Zimbabwe's unemployment statistics to become rather less stratospheric.    Meanwhile, three million Zimbabweans are estimated to live outside the country, having fled the dire economic conditions that emerged over the past two decades. They too have skills which would be useful in the rebuilding of the economy.  But they will have to feel they would be landing on solid and stable ground - both financially and politically. Otherwise, why go back?  In addition, it could be argued that a Zanu-PF dominated government would not want them back this side of an election. The vast majority of the returning diaspora would be unlikely to vote for Mr Mnangagwa and his party. In the longer term, Zimbabwe needs to have its own currency.  Using the US dollar was necessary after the old Zim dollar became worth less than the paper it was printed on and met its demise.  But there is so much more to creating a viable currency than switching on a printing press. Confidence is key.  Last year, the Reserve Bank introduced ""bond notes"" which were meant to alleviate the chronic shortage of US dollars in the system.  However, many thought this was an attempt to re-introduce the Zim dollar via the back door.  In fact, the notes have done nothing to address the cash shortage and some analysts say they might have actually made the situation worse, by pushing up the demand for US dollars even further.  Few people like using the bond notes, even though the amount in circulation is relatively low and the denominations are small.  Putting money into a bank was no longer considered the soundest of options, because the cash could only be withdrawn in small amounts and there was always the fear that the Reserve Bank would come for your hard-earned dollars.  So, the stock market soared, ironically becoming one of the best performing bourses in the world. Indeed, the rise in the stock market has only been curtailed by the army intervention and the resignation of Mr Mugabe."
Debt Market Sentiment,Rebooting the case for Scottish independence,2024-09-14,2018-05-25,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-44252435,"Four years on from That Referendum on Scotland, and what's changed? Well, quite a lot, thanks to Brexit, three national elections, a new first minister, a new prime minister, the rise of Richard Leonard and Rees-Moggery, plus an oil and gas slump. But the polling figures on independence have barely shifted. ""Why?"" I was asked this week by a semi-detached Nationalist.  ""Because the arguments haven't moved,"" he answered himself. Neither side has reflected, in public at least, on where their arguments needed sharpening up, least of all on the economic questions. Until today - 25 May 2018. Remember the date. It just might turn out to be significant. The Sustainable Growth Commission will take some digesting. It's a weighty, meaty document. From what I've been told about its recommendations, it retains much of the sunny optimism that buoyed the Yes campaign in 2014, but to that has been added a big dollop of candour. As an economic prospectus for independence, it recognises that people were not sufficiently reassured in 2014, least of all about their pensions, savings and mortgages. They heard glib assurances back then that negotiations with Westminster would go swimmingly, because that would be in Westminster's interest. Downing Street would give Scotland what was asked for, including joint control of sterling. Transition costs were so low as to lack any serious costing. And a higher economic growth rate would flow from an enlightened administration taking all the right policy and fiscal decisions, without facing economic or political headwinds or any internal contradictions on lowered tax and higher spending. I recall one Yes supporter wryly comparing the sentiment of the movement back then to the Summer of Love in 1967. Everything good was possible, and all at once. Nothing bad need happen. It was groovy, man. Andrew Wilson is no hippie, though he draws deeply on the pipe of positivity and optimism. The commission he has led has applied candour to each of the weaker points in the 2014 economic prospectus, and conceded some ground to the critics of independence, in the interests of credibility. Take the currency for instance. The new plan does not seek shared control of the Bank of England.  It takes the word of the former governor, Lord (Mervyn) King, that Scotland could certainly be independent, and it could use sterling, but at one big cost: Holyrood would have to accept whatever monetary decisions are made in the City of London, and made in the interests of a London-dominated nation that no longer included Scotland. If Scotland's economy were out of sync with the cycle in the UK, that could be painful. That's how it was in the 1990s, and Alex Salmond railed against it. But in recent years, London has been the outlier, and Scotland has been at or near the UK average. So interest rate and financial policies set for the British middle ground, even without Scotland in Britain, might have suited Holyrood just fine. A central bank would be set up, without control over interest rates, and there would be a regulator, but with a light workload, as the banks would have shifted at least their brass plates south of the Border, to be regulated from London.  Any smaller financial institutions, still based in Scotland, would have low expectations of a bail-out - though since the crash, that's now the message to all lenders. Or take fiscal policy. The Wilson Commission gulps in full the harsh message from GERS - Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland.  A deficit, including oil and gas revenue, at nearly 10% of national output, or Gross Domestic Product, is not sustainable, it is conceded. So what to do? A lot of work has gone into the answer. It is not simply to grow the economy faster, as the name of the commission suggested it should. The days of the tiger economies, at least in Europe, have gone.  The best hope for boosting growth in the short term - productivity being a longer-term project - is seen as a boost to immigration, with a ""Come to Scotland"" campaign, and financial incentives thrown in.  That's easy for an economist to say: less so for a politician (I intend to return to the question of growth once I've had a chance to digest the recommendations). A key element of the Wilson answer to the fiscal question is discipline on spending. This looks like, politically, the most difficult factor to manage, in an excited environment where expectations can run away from reality. The constraint would not be a real terms cut, but instead a very small increase, at 1% below the cash terms increase in economic growth. For example, suppose 2% inflation and 1.5% real growth, which is not an unreasonable target, meaning 3.5% cash growth. Pare that back to a disciplined 2.5% increase in public spending, and you could guess that would make for uncomfortable discussions round the Cabinet table.  The aim, remember, is to be doing this over the years when immense pressure is expected to build on health and social care budgets. The Wilson report adds to that a cut in defence, including the nuclear deterrent budget, to 1.6% of national economic output (To be clear: Trident money would not be spent on other priorities. It would be put into deficit reduction). Then review tax collection and get it to the same level of efficiency as the best of smallish nations. There's a call for a rigorous review of all spending, to ensure that the government doesn't keep spending on the priorities of 10 or 20 years ago, just because it's aye been, and because those programmes are too difficult to cut. And oil and gas? No, that is taken out the equation, to be treated as a windfall, and put into a future generations fund for long-term projects. All this assumes a taxing and spending regime which doesn't depart much from what we have at the moment. In the early years, it does not encourage people to think that Scotland would shift either to a high-tax, high welfare Scandinavian model or low tax and low regulation. Nor does it battle through the thicket of possibilities around Brexit, and where Scotland might find itself over the next few years.  For five to 10 years of such a fiscal plan, it is reckoned that an independent Scotland would be running a deficit and building up debt. Modelling with what they say are conservative assumptions, the deficit would fall to 3% in the ninth year.  That's the level widely seen, as in euro currency rules, to be a safe and stable level of deficit. Only then could the government start to look at the five other tests being set for creating a Scottish currency - a small package of tick boxes designed to reassure voters and the markets with a canny nod to caution. So while leaving monetary policy to the Bank of England, and requiring tight discipline on spending, the rhetoric of independence or even ""taking back control"" begins to lose its shine. Critics of independence might well question if it would be worth all the effort, and £450m in estimated transition costs, only to find that a change in constitutional status hasn't moved the dials much.  But that's one of the many lessons we're in the early stages of learning from the Brexit process. ""Taking Back Control"" in an open, modern economy is something of a mirage. Even a sovereign parliament is constrained by international agreements and market orthodoxies.  And even at Whitehall's scale and depth, the capacity of government to negotiate and and to manage upheaval is itself a major constraint.  In turn, that places tight limitations on what else it can be expected to achieve in managing or reforming public services. Unpicking economic unions, whether 45 years in the making in Europe or 311 years in Britain, is much more complicated than it might look at first. Bigger and established players in negotiations tend to have most leverage.  When it's done, independence has to be combined with some dependence and a lot of inter-dependence, requiring compromise. And as the Swiss sometimes observe about their relations with Brussels, the negotiations never stop. In that sense, though in few others, the Brexit negotiations may be doing the Scottish constitutional debate a favour. Looking at London and Brussels, Scots can see and smell the rubber hitting the road.   Voters may be more likely, therefore, to seek and reward candour, rather than jumping on the bandwagon painted in the brightest red and sporting the most populist slogan. That's among the big challenges thrown down by the Wilson Commission. The report gives the independence movement something big and meaty to chew on, and to debate internally, perhaps then to move the dials in its direction on the Yes and No polling.  It throws down the gauntlet to opponents of Scottish independence to reflect at least as seriously on the campaign they ran in 2014. They got the majority. But at least some must surely be wary of complacency. Would the same campaign and arguments work again, in the wake of Brexit, and against the Andrew Wilson prospectus? And the report is also a challenge to all of us who take some part in the debate about Scotland's future.  From what we know about it so far, the report of the Sustainable Growth Commission sounds like a serious document for serious times.  It is a more mature approach than we've seen for a long time, and surely demands a mature response."
Debt Market Sentiment,UK economy 'vulnerable' to borrowing shock,2024-09-14,2020-03-11,By Szu Ping Chan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51836555,"A surge in public spending risks exposing the UK economy to a shock rise in borrowing costs, according to the government's spending watchdog. Abandoning long-term goals to balance the books could have consequences, the Office for Budget Responsibility said. Higher annual borrowing and overall debt would leave Britain ""vulnerable"" to changing investor sentiment. The warning came as the chancellor unveiled the biggest Budget giveaway since 1992. Rishi Sunak's first budget included an extra £7bn to support workers and businesses affected by the coronavirus and at least £5bn to help the NHS cope with the outbreak. In total he outlined £30bn of extra spending this year. But higher spending over the long-term would be likely to lead to higher borrowing, which could prompt a rise in the cost of that borrowing. A year ago, the OBR predicted the UK economy would grow by 1.4% this year. Now it says it expects it to grow at just 1.1% this year, the slowest pace since the financial crisis. That does not take into account any hit from the virus, which will slow growth further and could add an additional £6bn to the deficit over the next two years, George Buckley, chief UK economist at Nomura estimates.   The extra £12bn to battle the coronavirus was not costed in this year's Budget, he points out. Public borrowing is already forecast to climb to a six-year high by 2022 without taking into account these additional spending measures. There has been no immediate impact on the cost of government borrowing. Yields on ten year government bonds rose only marginally after the Budget as investors took the near-term planned rise in borrowing in their stride Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, said: ""Markets are not only willing to accept [higher] fiscal spending but are now actively cheering it."" However, the OBR said the government's decision to move away from trying to reduce Britain's debt in relation to the size of the economy, could store up problems for the future. The last government said it aimed to bring down public sector net debt, but it now is projected to remain steady at around 75% of GDP over the next five years. Robert Chote, the chairman of the OBR, said that while he did not see the government spending splurge as a ""gamble"", a sudden increase in inflation and interest rates would make ""the arithmetic a lot more uncomfortable."" Sir Charlie Bean, a member of the OBR's budget responsibility committee, added: ""Clearly the more debt you build up, the more exposed you are if things go wrong.  ""And there's a good general principle that you want to have the debt-to-GDP ratio declining in good times, to build up the space for responding precisely to the events like the coronavirus. ""If you only have the ambition to keep debt constant as a proportion of GDP, every time you get a bad shock, you just ratchet that up again."" Boris Johnson's government has moved away from an previous Tory ambition to eliminate borrowing this decade. In the Budget the chancellor launched a review of the government's current self-imposed spending rule, which requires it to balance the books, excluding investment spending, within three years. Public borrowing is forecast to be lower this financial year at £47.4bn than predicted last March, but after that the deficit is projected to rise sharply. The government is now set to borrow £54.8bn in the coming financial year to plug the gap between the money it spends on public services and the tax revenues it collects. This is much higher than the £40.2bn that was forecast. This will rise to £66.7bn in 2021-22. The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing. The government expects to borrow almost £100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts. And that figure does not include £12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn. Mr Sunak said a weaker global backdrop would drag down UK growth. But the OBR said it expected the economy to rebound in 2021 with the help of the big spending boost. It said growth is forecast to rise to 1.8%, before moderating to 1.5% in 2022 and 1.3% the following year. Higher growth would make it easier to reduce debt as a proportion of the overall size of the economy and make the UK less vulnerable to a shock rise in borrowing costs. However, the growth forecasts were made before the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in the UK became clear. So they do not take into account the impact of the virus, the emergency government stimulus measures, or the cut in UK interest rates announced earlier on Wednesday. Mr Sunak said the coronavirus outbreak would have a ""significant impact"" on the economy, warning that a fifth of Britain's workforce could be off work at the same time during the peak of the outbreak. But he said the extra spending and investment would provide ""security today"" and ""prosperity tomorrow"". Mr Sunak unveiled a three-point plan to tackle the coronavirus, including: Mr Sunak said the government would do ""everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure""."
Debt Market Sentiment,Five reasons why China's economy is in trouble,2024-09-14,2022-10-04,By Suranjana Tewari,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-62830775,"China's economy is slowing down as it adapts to a punishing zero-Covid strategy and weakening global demand. Official growth figures for the July to September quarter are expected soon - if the world's second-largest economy contracts, that increases chances of a global recession. Beijing's goal - an annual growth rate of 5.5% - is now out of reach although officials have downplayed the need to meet the target. China narrowly avoided contraction in the April to June quarter. This year, some economists do not expect any growth. The country might not be battling steep inflation like the US and the UK, but it has other problems - the factory of the world has suddenly found fewer customers for its products both domestically and internationally. Trade tensions between China and major economies such as the US are also hampering growth.   And the yuan is on course for its worst year in decades as it plummets against the US dollar. A weak currency spooks investors, fuelling uncertainty in financial markets. It also makes it difficult for the central bank to pump money into the economy.  All of this is happening at a time when the stakes are especially high for President Xi Jinping - he is expected to secure an unprecedented third term at the Communist Party Congress which begins on 16 October.  So what exactly has gone wrong? Covid outbreaks in several cities, including manufacturing hubs like Shenzhen and Tianjin, have been hurting economic activity across industries. People are also not spending money on things like food and beverages, retail or tourism, putting major services under pressure. On the manufacturing side, factory activity appears to have climbed back up in September, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.  The rebound could be because the government is spending more on infrastructure.  But it came after two months in which manufacturing did not expand. And it has raised questions, especially since a private survey showed that factory activity actually fell in September, with demand hitting output, new orders and employment. Demand in countries like the US has declined too because of higher interest rates, inflation and the war in Ukraine. Experts agree that Beijing could do more to stimulate the economy, but there is little reason in doing so until zero Covid ends.  ""There is not a lot of point in pumping money into our economy if businesses cannot expand or people cannot spend the money,"" said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at S&P Global Ratings.  Beijing has stepped in - in August it announced a 1 trillion yuan ($203bn; £180bn) plan to boost small businesses, infrastructure and real estate. But officials can do a lot more to trigger spending to meet growth targets and create jobs. This includes investing more in infrastructure, easing borrowing conditions for home buyers, property developers and local government, and tax breaks for households. ""The response of the government to the weakness in the economy has been quite modest compared to what we have seen during previous economic bouts of weakness,"" Mr Kuijs said.  Weak real estate activity and negative sentiment in the housing sector has undoubtedly slowed growth. This has hit the economy hard because property and other industries that contribute to it account for up to a third of China's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  ""When confidence is weak in the housing market, it makes people feel unsure about the overall economic situation,"" Mr Kuijs said. Home buyers have been refusing to make mortgage payments on unfinished buildings and some doubt their houses will ever be completed. Demand is down for new homes and that has reduced the need for imports of commodities used in construction. Despite Beijing's efforts to prop up the real estate market, home prices in dozens of cities have declined by more than 20% this year. With property developers under pressure, analysts say authorities might have to do far more to restore confidence in the real estate market.  Extreme weather is starting to have a lasting impact on China's industries. A severe heatwave, followed by a drought, hit the south-western province of Sichuan and the city of Chongqing in the central belt in August.  As the demand for air conditioning spiked, it overwhelmed the electricity grid in a region that almost entirely relies on hydropower.  Factories, including major manufacturers like iPhone maker Foxconn and Tesla, were forced to cut hours or shut altogether.  China's Statistics bureau said in August that profits in the iron and steel industry alone were down by more than 80% in the first seven months of 2022, compared to the same period last year. Beijing eventually came to the rescue with tens of billions of dollars to support energy companies and farmers.  A regulatory crackdown on China's tech titans - which has already lasted two years - is not helping.  Tencent and Alibaba reported their first drop in revenue in the most recent quarter - Tencent's profits fell by 50%, while Alibaba's net income fell by half. Tens of thousands of young workers have lost work - adding to a jobs crisis where one in five people aged 16 to 24 are unemployed. This could hurt China's productivity and growth in the long run.  Investors are also sensing a shift in Beijing - some of China's most successful private companies have come under greater scrutiny as Mr Xi's grip on power grows.   As state-owned companies appear to be gaining favour, foreign investors are taking money off the table.   Japan's Softbank pulled out a huge amount of cash from Alibaba, while Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway is selling its stake in electric vehicle maker BYD.  Tencent has had more than $7bn worth of investments withdrawn in the second half of this year alone.  And the US is cracking down on Chinese companies listed on the American stock market. ""Some investment decisions are being postponed, and some foreign companies are seeking to expand production in other countries,"" S&P Global Ratings said in a recent note. The world is becoming accustomed to the fact that Beijing may not be as open for business as it used to be - but Mr Xi is risking the economic success that has powered China in recent decades."
Debt Market Sentiment,Can India's Adani Group recover from $100bn loss?,2024-09-14,2023-02-07,By Archana Shukla,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64495573,"India's Adani Group has seen its market value plunge after a US investment firm made fraud allegations against it. Can its ambitious growth plans survive?  Until two weeks ago, the ports-to-energy conglomerate which operates seven publicly traded companies had a combined valuation of $220bn.  But since 24 January, when short seller Hindenburg Research accused the group of ""brazen"" stock manipulation and accounting fraud, its valuations have nearly halved. The group's founder Gautam Adani has seen billions wiped off his personal wealth and has dropped out of the list of the world's top 20 richest people. The Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them ""malicious"" and ""baseless"" and says it plans have not changed. But investors are clearly still nervous.  On Monday, the group said in a statement that it would prepay loans worth $1.1bn, taken using shares as collateral, ahead of their maturity date next year. This, it said, was partly due to ""continued market volatility"" and to assure investors that the group's promoters would ""prepay all shares-backed financing"". The announcement led to a rally in the flagship company's stock - on Tuesday, shares of Adani Enterprises closed 15% higher on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Last week, the group also called off its secondary share sale. The 2.5bn (£2bn) it had raised was meant to pay off debt and fund projects, including airport renovation, expressway construction and an ambitious green hydrogen ecosystem. They indicate investors are losing confidence in a company. Analysts are now watching to see how the stock price slide affects the company's operations, cash flow and expansion plans. ""Most of their ambitious projects will have to be heavily scaled back in ambition and timetable, because they will have next to no capacity to raise funds right now,"" says Tim Buckley, director at Climate Energy Finance, a think-tank that works on financial issues related to transition from fossil fuel to clean energy. It could borrow money to fund projects and acquisitions - a common strategy for infrastructure companies, which helped fuel the Adani Group's rapid growth. But the group's debt has grown at a faster pace than revenues and profitability, which some fear could raise risks of a default - a concern flagged by both the Hindenburg report as well as some analysts. The group already has total debt of nearly two trillion rupees ($24bn; £20bn) - it almost doubled over the past three years as Mr Adani's ambitions extended to areas such as 5G and green hydrogen. Nearly two-thirds of Adani's debt is from overseas sources such as bonds or foreign banks, according to a report by global brokerage Jefferies. Until now, the group has mostly raised funds by using its infrastructure assets or shares as collateral. But with stock prices plunging, the value of this collateral has also dipped. The private wealth units of two big banks, Credit Suisse and Citigroup, have stopped accepting Adani bonds as collateral, Bloomberg has reported.  Many Indian banks have also loaned billions of dollars to companies linked to the group and state-owned insurance firm Life Insurance Corporation of India has invested in it. Market observers say that the Hindenburg report and the reaction to it will make lenders cautious - which means loans could become costlier. ""There is pressure on the company's credibility. It will make it extremely difficult to raise fresh loans, especially in the overseas market,"" an Indian corporate banker said on condition of anonymity as he didn't want to be seen commenting on the Adani Group. Another observer, a former banker with an international wealth fund, said that the group may be forced to delay some projects until the issue settles down. He also did not want to be named. The BBC sent a list of questions to the Adani Group. A spokesperson replied: ""All our ongoing projects continue according to the plan. Adani Group's core fundamentals remain unchanged.""  Scrutiny on the group has now increased. Investors and credit rating agencies are closely assessing its ability to raise money and repay loans. S&P Global Ratings has downgraded its outlook on two Adani companies to negative. ""New investigations and negative market sentiment may lead to increased cost of capital and reduce funding access for rated entities,"" it said.   In a video statement after the group's share sale was called off, Mr Adani had said that its balance sheet was ""healthy and assets robust"". He added that the group has an ""impeccable track record of fulfilling our debt obligations"". But credit rating agency ICRA said in a statement last week that the group's large, debt-funded capital spending programme remains a key challenge. Most of the group's capital-guzzling new businesses such as green energy, airports and roads are housed under flagship company Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) and depend on it for funds. AEL has enough cash but could come under pressure if it has to pay interest for even its subsidiaries. Some of the group's firms will be shielded from the current volatility because they own and operate strong physical assets such as ports, airports and factories. ""Adani Ports and Adani Power are the strongest and most well-capitalised [firms], which means their assets are backed by long-term government contracts. Most of the loans taken by these companies are against these revenue and profit-accruing assets,"" says the corporate banker quoted above. However, this isn't the case for some of the group's newer businesses. Companies such as Adani Gas and renewable energy arm Adani Green already have immense debt on their books and are still building up their cash flows. This could make them more vulnerable to market shocks and reduce their creditworthiness. The banker points out that while the prices of bonds issued by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd have fallen only marginally, those issued by Adani Green had lost more than a quarter of their value in three days. Deferring new projects and selling some assets to raise money could be a way out. ICRA has said that some of the planned capital spending is discretionary in nature and can be deferred, depending on how much liquidity it has. ""The company has built assets that are valuable to a developing country like India, and there will be many strategic investors interested,"" said a corporate adviser who didn't want to be named. Some analysts remain optimistic. ""I have seen varied operating [Adani] projects from ports, airports, cements to renewables which are solid, stable and generating a healthy cash flow. They are completely safe from the ups and downs of what happens in the stock market,"" says Vinayak Chatterjee, an infrastructure expert who is founder and managing trustee of the Infravision Foundation.  Analysts are also watching to see if there will be a regulatory enquiry into the group's corporate governance. The issue has also set off a political row over Mr Adani's perceived closeness to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which both deny.  On Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi from the main opposition Congress party brought up the allegations in parliament, accusing Mr Modi of helping the Adani Group - his comments caused uproar, with a federal minister accusing Mr Gandhi of levelling ""wild allegations"" without proof.    A day earlier, the party had held protests across the country, demanding an investigation into the allegations. Mr Buckley says that as pressure mounts, the Adani Group's ability to win government contracts easily to ramp up revenues will be challenged. It will also find it difficult to restore its credit credibility.  Since the group has to repay a significant amount, it will have to do a strategic asset sale, he says. "
Debt Market Sentiment,Klarna to cut 10% of staff as it warns of recession,2024-09-14,2022-05-24,By Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61562651,"Buy now pay later firm Klarna has announced plans to cut around 700 staff as it warned of a ""likely recession"". The Swedish firm blamed a combination of rising prices, a change in consumer sentiment and the war in Ukraine for the move. ""What we are seeing now in the world is not temporary or short-lived, and hence we need to act,"" said chief executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski. The cuts equate to around 10% of Klarna's 7,000-strong workforce.  ""When we set our business plans for 2022 in the autumn of last year, it was a very different world than the one we are in today,"" said Mr Siemiatkowski. ""Since then, we have seen a tragic and unnecessary war in Ukraine unfold, a shift in consumer sentiment, a steep increase in inflation, a highly volatile stock market and a likely recession."" In a blog, Mr Siemiatkowski advised staff - who the company refers to ""Klarnauts"" - to ""take care of yourselves and each other"". Klarna is one of many tech companies warning that the months ahead will be difficult and taking steps to cut jobs or freeze hiring, as consumer spending weakens and ad sales slow. Social media firm Snap shares tumbled roughly 40% on Tuesday after it cut sales and profit targets set a month ago. The owner of the Snapchat messaging app said it would slow its rate of hiring after it said ""macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further and faster than anticipated"". The update prompted a wider sell-off, with shares in Facebook-owner Meta down roughly 10%, Google-owner Alphabet falling 8% and smaller firms such as Pinterest down 26%. In the UK, the central bank has warned the economy could fall into recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive quarters - after official figures revealed the economy shrank in March. Higher prices are beginning to bite into household budgets and people have started spending less and cutting down on car journeys due to high fuel costs. Soaring energy bills and food prices are also having an impact and inflation - the rate at which prices rise - jumped to 9% in April and is expected to reach more than 10% by the end of the year. Commenting on the cuts, Klarna said its affected employees in Europe will be offered ""to leave Klarna with an associated compensation"", but added outside of the continent, ""the process for impacted employees will look different depending on where you work"". Klarna staff were asked to work from home this week ""in consideration of the privacy of the people affected by these changes"". Mr Siemiatkowski said it had been ""a very tumultuous year"" so far. It contrasts with 2021 when, thanks to the shift in consumer spending to online during Covid restrictions, Klarna saw the value of the company soar to $46bn when it raised millions of dollars from investors. Since then, however, The Wall Street Journal has reported it is seeking a new round of investment and its valuation could sink by as much as $16bn to $30bn. Klarna dismissed the report as ""pure speculation"". Buy-now-pay-later providers should have a pretty good insight of consumer sentiment. After all, it is a product that has been used by 17 million people in the UK, including 30% of those aged in their 20s. No doubt Klarna has decided that those customers are likely to tighten their belts, spending less on fashion and the like as food and fuel take a bigger and bigger chunk out of their disposable incomes. But there are likely to be wider factors at play here too. Firstly, this kind of credit is facing greater scrutiny from regulators. Will shoppers think twice about clicking the Klarna box if they know that, in doing so, other potential lenders will be aware of how they are funding their purchases or they have to undergo affordability checks? Secondly, Klarna has expanded fast, but so have its losses, and those in charge need to chart a sustainable course for the business. Over its last financial year, Klarna's operating losses swelled to 6.58bn Swedish krona (£540m) from 1.62bn Swedish krona.  In its annual report, the company said losses were growing but that was ""entirely explained by Klarna's growth, expansion to new markets and massive inflow of new customers"". Danni Hewson, financial analyst for AJ Bell, said Klarna's job cuts ""might be the sensible option even if it takes a great big chunk out of the company's valuation"". ""Markets are adjusting, those sky-high market caps that some growth businesses have attained over the last couple of years are coming under considerable scrutiny and many investors are deciding they don't hold up,"" said Ms Hewson. ""Klarna's caught between a rock and hard place as it needs to keep up its expansion momentum if it's to grow revenue and start generating profits. ""It could delay fundraising, wait for a more favourable moment, but there's no telling how long that wait would be particularly when recession is looming over the global economy."" Buy-now-pay-later is now a popular payment method across many stores, especially for people in their 20s. However, one in 10 people using them already had debt arrears elsewhere, a review by the Financial Conduct Authority last year found. It has led to criticism the schemes encourage shoppers to buy more than they can afford. Earlier this month, Klarna announced it would start telling credit agencies who pays on time and who falls behind. From June, banks and credit card firms will be able to see people's Klarna habits when making credit checks."
Debt Market Sentiment,Truss: I never had realistic chance to cut taxes,2024-09-14,2023-02-05,By Jasmine Andersson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-64527252,"Liz Truss has said she was never given a ""realistic chance"" to implement her radical tax-cutting agenda by her party. In a 4,000-word essay in the Sunday Telegraph, Ms Truss stood by her plans to boost economic growth, arguing they were brought down by ""the left-wing economic establishment"". They are the first public comments the ex-PM has made on her resignation. But she said she was not ""blameless"" for the unravelling of the mini-budget. Business Secretary Grant Shapps, who was appointed by Ms Truss as her home secretary during her final week in office, said she ""clearly"" had not had the right approach to taxation. Speaking on BBC One's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show, he said her desire for lower taxes in the long term was correct, but inflation should have have been lowered first. Ms Truss was forced to quit after she and her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's £45bn package of tax cuts panicked the markets and tanked the pound to a record low. Her brief time in power - 49 days - made her the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history.  Ms Truss said that while her experience last autumn was ""bruising for me personally"", she believed that over the medium term her policies would have increased growth and therefore brought down debt. She argued that the government was made a ""scapegoat"" for developments that had been brewing for some time. ""Frankly, we were also pushing water uphill. Large parts of the media and the wider public sphere had become unfamiliar with key arguments about tax and economic policy and over time sentiment had shifted leftward,"" she wrote. ""Regrettably, the government became a useful scapegoat for problems that had been brewing over a number of months."" She also said she had not appreciated the strength of the resistance she would face to her plans - including plans to abolish the 45p top rate of income tax. ""I assumed upon entering Downing Street that my mandate would be respected and accepted. How wrong I was. While I anticipated resistance to my programme from the system, I underestimated the extent of it,"" she writes. Mr Kwarteng dropped the 45p income tax proposals 10 days after they were announced, telling the BBC it was ""a massive distraction on what was a strong package"". Less than a fortnight later, Ms Truss sacked Mr Kwarteng, something she said she was ""deeply disturbed by"". ""Kwasi Kwarteng had put together a brave package that was genuinely transformative - he is an original thinker and a great advocate for Conservative ideas. But at this point, it was clear that the policy agenda could not survive and my priority had to be avoiding a serious meltdown for the UK,"" she wrote.  With the benefit of hindsight, she writes that she would have acted differently during her premiership - but she still backs her plans for growth. ""I have lost track of how many people have written to me or approached me since leaving Downing Street to say that they believe my diagnosis of the problems causing our country's economic lethargy was correct and that they shared my enthusiasm for the solutions I was proposing,"" she said. After 100 days of ""soul searching"" we have a version of events from the shortest serving UK Prime Minister in history.  This is Liz Truss's catastrophic time in office, described and defended in her own words.  At some length, she attempts to argue her case and answer for her actions. There is reflection and regret but not the apology which many might expect.  What burns through this 4000 word essay is a sense from Liz Truss that almost everything was against her as she makes a case for what might have been.  The system, officials, Conservative MPs all played a part, she argues, in stopping her from achieving her aim of economic growth through tax cuts and de-regulation.  There are breathtaking reminders of how high the stakes were as her policies sent shockwaves through the economy - Kwasi Kwarteng had to go to avoid ""a serious meltdown for the UK"" and ""the starkest of warnings"" came from officials that the country may have to default on its debt.  Despite her downfall, Liz Truss argues many still share her enthusiasm for what she was trying to achieve.  Sir Jake Berry, who was Conservative party chairman under Ms Truss, said he agreed with her ""diagnosis"" of the problems facing the UK economy, but ""not necessarily the cure"". Speaking to Laura Kuenssberg, he added that Ms Truss had been ""wrong"" to say the Conservatives had failed to make the argument for lower taxes.  Meanwhile, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Ms Truss's policies ""made working people pay the price"". ""The Conservatives crashed the economy, sank the pound, put pensions in peril and made working people pay the price through higher mortgages for years to come. ""After 13 years of low growth, squeezed wages and higher taxes under the Tories, only Labour offers the leadership and ideas to fix our economy and to get it growing."" While Liz Truss resigned as prime minister, she is still serving in parliament as the MP for South West Norfolk."
Debt Market Sentiment,Investors seize on positive news but rally fades,2024-09-14,2020-04-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52200851,"A global rally on financial markets faded as US shares shed gains despite hopes that the spread of coronavirus in some hotspots may be easing. The Dow Jones and the S&P 500 dipped 0.1%, while the Nasdaq fell 0.3%, dropping back from earlier increases and a 7% surge on Monday. In London, Paris and Frankfurt stocks had closed more than 2% higher, while earlier Asian markets also gained. A drop in oil prices contributed to the afternoon slide. However, Tuesday's declines were modest compared to the dramatic swings in recent weeks, reflecting signs of renewed investor optimism for many companies - including travel companies and retailers, which had seen shares plunge as governments impose lockdown measures. In the US, department store Kohl's jumped 20%, while Royal Caribbean Cruises climbed more than 13%. In the UK, Easyjet rose more than 15%, while British Airways' owner IAG increased 7%.  The FTSE 250, considered to be more representative of the UK economy, finished more than 5% higher. Investor sentiment was buoyed by news that the death toll in Spain, which has been badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic, had fallen for a fourth consecutive day, in a sign that the country may have passed its peak.  There was also a slowdown of new infections in Italy, which has also been ravaged by the virus. News that some countries, including Austria and Denmark, have made small steps to relax their lockdowns, also helped sentiment. But New York, which had earlier seen signs its outbreak might be easing, reported a large jump in Covid-19 deaths. ""Investors are reacting to indications that lockdown measures in the UK, US and Europe are beginning to 'flatten the curve' of coronavirus infections and fatalities,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. However, he added: ""The market's relief is only likely to last so long, and attention will soon turn to how countries intend to exit the current containment measures which have in effect hit the pause button on the global economy."" Despite gains on Monday and Tuesday, the FTSE 100 is still down by 25% compared to its highest level in January, before the pandemic led to lockdowns across Europe and the US. Adding to the positive financial news were further measures to support economies, including a trillion-dollar package in Japan and central bank moves in China. And with the ink barely dry on a $2 trillion rescue plan passed by Congress last month, Donald Trump said he favoured another massive spending programme, this time targeting infrastructure projects. There are also reports that European Union leaders are close to a rescue package for countries worst hit by the pandemic."
Debt Market Sentiment,Fears over repair contractor's future,2024-09-14,2018-12-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-46551845,"Opposition councillors in Powys want assurances about the viability of a company responsible for council house repairs amid concern about its debts. Kier is the county council's partner in Heart of Wales Property Services, and is also handling the refurbishment of Brecknock Museum in Brecon. Last month Kier announced an emergency plan to raise £264m to cut its £600m debt and strengthen the company. The Kier Group said it was still aiming to ""win new business"". A Powys officer said responses would be given to the full council in January.  Heart of Wales Property Services (HOWPS) looks after 5,400 homes and 630 other properties in the county. The joint venture was launched in July 2017 when 109 council employees were transferred to Kier.  Plaid Cymru group leader Elwyn Vaughan said he wanted assurances that Kier was still a ""viable entity"". ""In recent months we have seen a major outsourcing company, Carillion, going to the wall and another company, Interserve, in severe difficulty,"" he told the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Labour group leader Matthew Dorrance said he was unhappy that the ruling independent/Conservative coalition had rejected a plan to allow greater scrutiny of the work of HOWPS. He said his party wanted to ensure the joint venture ""serves the people of Powys, not profit margins"". Kier Group chief executive Hadyn Mursell said the attempt to raise cash from existing shareholders had been prompted by a ""change of sentiment"" in the financial markets over lending to the UK construction sector. He wanted to ""better position Kier to continue to win new business and further strengthen our market-leading positions"". Nigel Brinn, director of environment at Powys and a member of the HOWPS board, said: ""We can confirm that the council has received formal questions regarding Kier and that responses will be provided at a meeting of the full council in January."""
Debt Market Sentiment,Turkey: Could the US damage its economy?,2024-09-14,2019-01-16,By Reality Check,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-46866661,"President Trump has said the US will ""devastate Turkey economically"" if Ankara decides to attack Kurdish groups in Syria. Mr Trump was referring to his plan to pull US forces out of Syria, where they have been fighting alongside a Kurdish militia against the group calling itself Islamic State (IS). Turkey regards the Kurdish group as terrorists. The US president's comments drew a sharp response from Turkey, which said Mr Trump would not get anywhere by threatening the country economically. After Mr Trump's tweet, the Turkish lira dropped in value against the US dollar. It then recovered its value, suggesting that his remarks had limited impact. So how could the US damage Turkey economically - if it wanted to? The relationship between Washington and Ankara has historically been close - politically, economically and militarily. Turkey - a Nato member - is a vital partner for the US but there have been significant strains in the partnership. These came out into the open last August, when the US slapped sanctions on Turkey over the continued detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson. It marked a new low in relations and was a further blow to an already fragile economy. The US also doubled tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium that month, leading to further falls in the value of the Turkish lira - some 40% since the beginning of 2018. Turkey responded in kind, raising tariffs on cars from the US to 120%, on alcoholic drinks to 140% and on leaf tobacco to 60%. In fact, only 5% of Turkish exports head to the US and Turkey imports only slightly more from there. Turkey's trading relationships with China, Russia and Germany are more important.  But even though overall trade with US is not as large, there are key vulnerable sectors: air transport, iron and steel and machinery - and this is where the US has chosen to target previous sanctions. Turkey has historically had a deficit in international trade, in that it imports more from the rest of the world than it exports. However, the trade gap did narrow considerably in 2018 on the back of the weakness of the lira, which made Turkey's exports more competitive and imports more expensive. Turkey may be vulnerable over its high levels of debt. As of the end of September 2018, its external debt amounted to over 50% of its gross domestic product (GDP) - the value of all the goods and services it produces in a year - according to official figures. ""This is Turkey's Achilles heel,"" says York University economist Gulcin Ozkan.  ""It puts the country at the mercy of international investors and makes it vulnerable to exchange rate movements."" There are two features of Turkey's foreign debt increase that are concerning. It has a relatively high level of short-term debt, which is due for repayment in the near future. That means having a greater reliance on external finance. In addition, most of its overall debt is in foreign currencies such as the US dollar and the euro. So, the debt becomes more expensive as the Turkish currency loses value and other currencies - such as the US dollar - strengthen. In fact, the lira had been struggling for most of last year, recording its worst decline since 2001. This currency weakness also aggravates Turkey's persistent inflation problem, which at one point in 2018 peaked at over 25%.   It's important to point out that the Turkish economy has been growing strongly for most of the period since 2001. But confidence in Turkey was beginning to wane last year over concerns that the economy was overheating due to huge spending and borrowing. In addition, the Turkish government has taken away some power from the central bank, leading investors to worry about the direction of fiscal policy. So any fallout with the US could further sour the financial markets' view of the health of the Turkish economy. ""This could lead to a decline in capital inflows and impact the value of the Turkish currency,"" says economist Gulcin Ozkan. But given the importance of the political and strategic relationship with Turkey, which shares borders with Syria, Iraq and Iran, the US may want to tread carefully. Turkey is the biggest recipient of US defence equipment after Israel and the UAE and the vast majority of its air force is US supplied. It also hosts US and Nato forces at its Incirlik airbase, in the south of the country. So Turkey may be economically vulnerable but politically and strategically it remains very important.

Debt Market Sentiment,How Germans will look back on Angela Merkel,2024-09-14,2021-09-23,By Joshua Nevett,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58570507,"Germans vote on Sunday in elections that will ultimately bring down the curtain on Angela Merkel's final term as chancellor of Germany. When Mrs Merkel steps down after 16 years in power, how will history remember her?  We asked four experts to assess her style of leadership and track record. She has turned German politics into a discussion about policy rather than politics, says Matt Qvortrup, professor of political science at Coventry University, and author of Angela Merkel: Europe's Most Influential Leader. German politics used to be a testosterone-fuelled Männerclub - a club of men. Under Mrs Merkel, things have become much more policy-oriented. The problem with that, I suppose, is that it ends up being quite mechanical and scientific. Mrs Merkel trained as a physicist, and has a PhD in quantum chemistry. So, for someone like her, she has an approach that is very factually based. That's not the sort of thing that is barnstorming. But in her own sort of way, she has staged a bit of a revolution in German politics and world politics generally. At a time when politics has become more polarised, she's tried to depolarise them by depoliticising issues. Charlotte Galpin: Senior lecturer in German and European politics at the University of Birmingham Mrs Merkel has been proclaimed by Forbes as the most powerful woman in the world for 10 years running. There is a whole generation in Germany that has never known anything other than a woman leader.  Her position has been symbolically important for women's representation, and she is known for bringing women into key positions. For example, she supported Ursula von der Leyen, the first female German defence minister and European Commission president. Yet, such symbolic representation doesn't automatically mean wider change, especially for women of colour and the LGBTQ+ community. The targeting of Muslim women and rallying against so-called gender madness is widespread in Germany, driven in part but not only by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. This election cycle, the issue of gender-appropriate language has become a politicised issue, over which Mrs Merkel has stayed largely silent. Dr Rüdiger Schmitt-Beck: Professor of political science and political sociology at the University of Mannheim Her policy legacy is a somewhat bizarre mix of modernisation and backwardness.  Many of the modernising features - such as same-sex marriage, phasing out nuclear energy, and welcoming immigration policies - would not be expected from a Christian Democratic chancellor. However, the country is almost grotesquely lagging behind on big, pressing issues like digitalisation, climate policy, and demographic change. As Angela Merkel leaves office, the political landscape is much more volatile. This concerns, in part, the increasingly complex party system and the AfD, which thrives on anti-immigration sentiment. There is, of course, the simple fact that she was the country's first female chancellor. I'm sure her pragmatic, quasi-presidential style of governing will serve as a role model for her successor, whoever it may be. Dr Katrin Schreiter: Lecturer in German and European studies at King's College London Her legacy is a determined and silent one. Her leadership is based on sober evaluation and projecting reliability. She's always been criticised for not being a visionary. But voters knew what they were getting with her. She is brilliant at reading the room and taking the temperature of the electorate. For that, she has earned a lot of trust from international partners. The other legacy that she leaves is that she liberalised the agenda of her party, the conservative Christian Democrats. She has moved the conservatives closer to the centre, and also closer to the left-wing Greens in certain aspects. Matt Qvortrup: Her main legacy is rescuing the euro, and dealing with the financial crisis of 2008.  I remember talking to her in Brussels at the time. In response to the crisis, she said she wanted as much market economics as possible, but as much state intervention as necessary. The German Social Democrats used that line as a slogan in the 1960s. When I put that to her, she said, ""I'm not a historian, I'm a pragmatist"". The second moment was her response to the Trump years. She kept the powder dry for liberal internationalism. Former US President Barack Obama actually convinced her to run for a fourth term. Immediately after Trump won the election, Mr Obama flew to Berlin to meet with Mrs Merkel. After the meeting, Mr Obama recounted that he saw a tear in her eye. She was all alone.  She kept the ship afloat and, in a way, she's now done her duty. She can go. Charlotte Galpin: Mrs Merkel's tenure is usually described as one characterised by crises.  A key moment was the refugee crisis. Facing a humanitarian crisis in the Balkans, Mrs Merkel opened Germany's borders and accepted almost a million refugees during 2015 proclaiming ""wir schaffen das"" - we can manage this. Germany stood out as one of the few European countries that gave refuge to Syrians fleeing the civil war. Yet, 2015 saw the AfD move from an economically liberal, anti-Euro party to a far-right, Islamophobic one. The AfD's success in the last Bundestag election saw the country's first far-right MPs since the 1960s. Dr Rüdiger Schmitt-Beck: Three [moments] in particular come to mind. First, when Mrs Merkel and her finance minister addressed citizens in 2008 to assure them that the government would guarantee their savings, to prevent a much-dreaded bank run.  Second, the high-stakes EU negotiations about debt relief for Greece during the Euro crisis. And finally, Mrs Merkel's decision not to close the border to refugees stranded in Hungary in 2015. One should not overlook that Mrs Merkel did not open the border, as this decision is often framed, but decided not to close it. Dr Katrin Schreiter: One of them was in 2017, when she paved the way for same-sex marriage to go through parliament. Shortly before the election, she gave an interview to a women's magazine. In it, she said voting on these issues was a matter of individual conscience. She basically broke the party line and that opened up the opportunity to pass that law after years of delay. That was a major achievement. One of my favourite quotes is an early one. Once, when asked about what she felt when thinking of Germany, she said: ""I think of well-sealed windows. No other country can make such well-sealed and nice windows."" That shows her humility and pragmatism. She broke it down to something very practical. That encapsulates it for me. The responses to these questions have been edited for brevity and clarity."
Debt Market Sentiment,A model for urban renewal or a warning sign?,2024-09-14,2021-02-22,By Stephen Starr,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56048812,"This Cincinnati neighbourhood has a storied history. Today, it's the scene of a major urban renewal effort that's prompted no small controversy. On a typical, pre-pandemic weekend, thousands of people would descend on Cincinnati's revitalised Over-The-Rhine district just north of downtown.  Revellers would come to lounge on the grass in Washington Park, shop at any of the dozens of elegant new boutiques or meet for a beer at Rhinegeist Brewery's vast beer hall. Over-The-Rhine, or OTR as it's better known, didn't always have a reputation as a place to kick back and relax. Twenty years ago this April, police shot and killed Timothy Thomas, a 19-year-old unarmed black man wanted for outstanding traffic and other non-violent misdemeanours.  The anger fuelled by his death resulted in some of the worst rioting the country experienced since the Los Angeles unrest of 1992, and led to millions of dollars in property damage. It marked an era of decline and neglect for the area, and by 2009 Over-The-Rhine ranked among America's most dangerous districts. Since then, however, much of the district has undergone a massive and expensive regeneration process, and in many ways now finds itself almost unrecognisable from the past - for better or worse. Named for the German immigrants who moved here from the mid-1800s to work in local breweries and slaughterhouses, by the early 1900s Over-The-Rhine had grown into a thriving community of tens of thousands.  A combination of anti-German sentiment sparked by the First World War, and Prohibition in the 1920s, saw many lose their jobs and leave the area.  From the 1940s, increasing numbers of migrant workers from Appalachian regions moved in, though as many saw their socio-economic circumstances improve they moved on, fleeing cramped living conditions in poorly maintained tenements.  By the 1960s, Over-The-Rhine became home for many displaced African-American residents forced from a neighbouring district by the construction of a new interstate highway. Fast forward 60 years and the area has undergone great changes. New microbreweries, throwbacks to their bustling beer-infused heritage, and quaint boutiques, restaurants and music venues have turned it into a popular going-out spot. Its stunning collection of 19th Century German Revival and Italianate architecture ranks among the largest in the country, attracting millions of visitors every year. In 2017, the American Planning Association named Over-The-Rhine one of the nation's five ""great neighbourhoods"", in part as it ""serves as a national model of neighbourhood revitalisation"". A streetcar ferrying revellers between Over-The-Rhine and downtown Cincinnati began operating five years ago. This spring, FC Cincinnati's sparkling new $250m (£182m), 26,000 capacity stadium is set to open outside its western fringes, providing around 1,000 new jobs. Much of the forward progress has been the work of 3CDC, a non-profit developer established by the City of Cincinnati and local corporations such as Procter and Gamble, Fifth Third Bank and the supermarket giant, Kroger, investing around $800m in the area. When 3CDC started out in 2004, there were almost 3,000 vacant buildings, lots and housing units in Over-The-Rhine. Joe Rudemiller, with 3CDC, says investment specific to Over-The-Rhine has seen 173 buildings restored, another 44 new buildings constructed, and acres of ""civic space"" and two civic buildings refurbished. It has also built close to a thousand condominiums and 468 apartments - 283 as affordable housing units - as well as facilities for the homeless and hundreds of thousands of square feet of commercial space. Having spent two years selling Colombian and Venezuelan food from a pop-up tent outside Over-The-Rhine's historic Findlay Market, Isis Arrieta-Dennis jumped at the chance of opening her own eatery when the opportunity arose. ""We were looking for a place that was somehow diverse and saw that the Findlay Market was a place that would bring the diversity we needed for our business,"" says the Colombian native, who opened The Arepa Place nearby in 2018.  ""As a woman, as a minority business owner, for me the doors have opened. The work has been hard (but) the community has given me a lot of opportunities."" Over-The-Rhine's growth has fuelled hundreds of similar businesses and a budding entrepreneurial scene that firmly positions it as one of the most dynamic urban districts in the Midwest. But that revitalisation has also come at a cost.  It's sparked a furious debate, centred on access to affordable housing and displacement, over whether the recent changes have been positive for the existing community, or simply a prime illustration of successful gentrification. For Maurice Wagoner, president of the Over-The-Rhine community council, a proposed $77m mixed development project at the intersection of Liberty and Elm streets (3CDC is not involved) is just the latest example of local black families being left behind and excluded. Rents at the development are set to range from $1,400 to $2,800 - out of reach for most locals, Wagoner says - while the developers are seeking a $20m, thirty-year tax abatement.  ""They're (the developers) using our tax dollars to build this development, and we can't afford to live (here). The average person can't afford to live in there,"" he says, pointing to the site.  A 2016 report produced for the Community Council found a 73% drop in affordable housing in Over-The-Rhine between 2002 and 2015. ""We don't have no qualms against development,"" says Wagoner, who has lived in the area since 2012 but has been involved in community issues for 13 years. ""But we want equitable development. The people here, they want to improve their quality of life, they want to be part of the revitalisation. But they can't be a part of what they see going on in the neighbourhood.""  Supporters have argued the project would be an overall positive for the district, including through job creation and greater urban density.  On 3 February, Cincinnati City Council voted to green light the development. Many members of the local black community for whom Over-The-Rhine has been home for generations still suffer from chronic housing and jobs shortages.  Housing blight and all-too-frequent building collapses remain worrying factors for many.  Two years ago, a centrally located supermarket closed to be replaced by a new, bigger store - the first to open since 1969. But for residents in the northern areas, it means an additional mile round trip to collect groceries. Violent crime and shootings, though fewer than in the past, continue to plague the area. The marginalisation black residents felt and experienced at the hands of law enforcement most infamously two decades ago still persists. Cincinnati Black Lives Matters protests were prominent in Over-The-Rhine last summer. Job losses caused by the pandemic have further squeezed low-income residents and small businesses alike. Arrieta-Dennis says her business has suffered a 25% fall while many local stores have been forced to close altogether. To help, 3CDC has restructured its debt in order to assist with rent reductions and relief programs for the 80 restaurants and tenants in Over-The-Rhine and in the downtown area it supports. Still, the broader building boom and soon-to-be-opened football stadium mean community leaders fear their biggest concerns will outlast the pandemic, with short-term rentals set to further fracture the community and change Over-The-Rhine's social fabric. ""They (developers and landlords) are making profits off Airbnbs rather than giving people a place to live in our community,"" says Wagoner.  ""The neighbour next door to me rents it out for Airbnb. I don't know who my neighbours are anymore. It's terrible."""
Debt Market Sentiment,UK economy 'vulnerable' to borrowing shock,2024-09-14,2020-03-11,By Szu Ping Chan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51836555,"A surge in public spending risks exposing the UK economy to a shock rise in borrowing costs, according to the government's spending watchdog. Abandoning long-term goals to balance the books could have consequences, the Office for Budget Responsibility said. Higher annual borrowing and overall debt would leave Britain ""vulnerable"" to changing investor sentiment. The warning came as the chancellor unveiled the biggest Budget giveaway since 1992. Rishi Sunak's first budget included an extra £7bn to support workers and businesses affected by the coronavirus and at least £5bn to help the NHS cope with the outbreak. In total he outlined £30bn of extra spending this year. But higher spending over the long-term would be likely to lead to higher borrowing, which could prompt a rise in the cost of that borrowing. A year ago, the OBR predicted the UK economy would grow by 1.4% this year. Now it says it expects it to grow at just 1.1% this year, the slowest pace since the financial crisis. That does not take into account any hit from the virus, which will slow growth further and could add an additional £6bn to the deficit over the next two years, George Buckley, chief UK economist at Nomura estimates.   The extra £12bn to battle the coronavirus was not costed in this year's Budget, he points out. Public borrowing is already forecast to climb to a six-year high by 2022 without taking into account these additional spending measures. There has been no immediate impact on the cost of government borrowing. Yields on ten year government bonds rose only marginally after the Budget as investors took the near-term planned rise in borrowing in their stride Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, said: ""Markets are not only willing to accept [higher] fiscal spending but are now actively cheering it."" However, the OBR said the government's decision to move away from trying to reduce Britain's debt in relation to the size of the economy, could store up problems for the future. The last government said it aimed to bring down public sector net debt, but it now is projected to remain steady at around 75% of GDP over the next five years. Robert Chote, the chairman of the OBR, said that while he did not see the government spending splurge as a ""gamble"", a sudden increase in inflation and interest rates would make ""the arithmetic a lot more uncomfortable."" Sir Charlie Bean, a member of the OBR's budget responsibility committee, added: ""Clearly the more debt you build up, the more exposed you are if things go wrong.  ""And there's a good general principle that you want to have the debt-to-GDP ratio declining in good times, to build up the space for responding precisely to the events like the coronavirus. ""If you only have the ambition to keep debt constant as a proportion of GDP, every time you get a bad shock, you just ratchet that up again."" Boris Johnson's government has moved away from an previous Tory ambition to eliminate borrowing this decade. In the Budget the chancellor launched a review of the government's current self-imposed spending rule, which requires it to balance the books, excluding investment spending, within three years. Public borrowing is forecast to be lower this financial year at £47.4bn than predicted last March, but after that the deficit is projected to rise sharply. The government is now set to borrow £54.8bn in the coming financial year to plug the gap between the money it spends on public services and the tax revenues it collects. This is much higher than the £40.2bn that was forecast. This will rise to £66.7bn in 2021-22. The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing. The government expects to borrow almost £100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts. And that figure does not include £12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn. Mr Sunak said a weaker global backdrop would drag down UK growth. But the OBR said it expected the economy to rebound in 2021 with the help of the big spending boost. It said growth is forecast to rise to 1.8%, before moderating to 1.5% in 2022 and 1.3% the following year. Higher growth would make it easier to reduce debt as a proportion of the overall size of the economy and make the UK less vulnerable to a shock rise in borrowing costs. However, the growth forecasts were made before the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in the UK became clear. So they do not take into account the impact of the virus, the emergency government stimulus measures, or the cut in UK interest rates announced earlier on Wednesday. Mr Sunak said the coronavirus outbreak would have a ""significant impact"" on the economy, warning that a fifth of Britain's workforce could be off work at the same time during the peak of the outbreak. But he said the extra spending and investment would provide ""security today"" and ""prosperity tomorrow"". Mr Sunak unveiled a three-point plan to tackle the coronavirus, including: Mr Sunak said the government would do ""everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure""."
Debt Market Sentiment,Five ways to revive Zimbabwe’s economy,2024-09-14,2017-11-22,By Matthew Davies,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42079584,"Current events in Zimbabwe show that while a week may be a long time in politics, it is really a very short blink of an eye in economics. Zimbabweans on the streets of Harare and Bulawayo may be hopeful for political change, but they are much more sanguine and realistic when it comes to improving the country's economy.  Presidents can be impeached in days or weeks. It takes years to wreck economies and usually even longer to repair them. So, will Emmerson Mnangagwa be able to take Zimbabwe's economy off life support and at least start to put it on the road to recovery? Analysts are very sceptical that a quick solution is even feasible. The euphoria that has gripped the nation has certainly raised hopes that the future will be brighter, but if that improved sentiment is to deliver economic dividends, the government needs to make some drastic reforms. The first tool President Mnangagwa would need to even get a recovery kick-started is hard currency. Zimbabwe hasn't had a currency of its own since 2009, after hyperinflation killed off the old Zimbabwean dollar.  Since then, the US dollar has been the main currency for transactions, as well as the South African rand. And in recent years a cash shortage has been slowly strangling the economy, which is half the size it was at the turn of the millennium. Ten numbers that will help you understand what's actually going on But who would stump up the cash? Western donors will remain wary of a Zanu-PF government which simply sees Robert Mugabe replaced by Mr Mnangagwa.  The International Monetary Fund, which describes Zimbabwe's economy as one of the most fragile in the world, may be more willing - but only with many strings attached to any deal.  China is possibly the most likely cash benefactor in the initial stages of a Mnangagwa administration. In some circles, Mr Mnangagwa is seen as Zimbabwe's Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader who instigated a degree of market liberalisation.  Assuming the cash is forthcoming, what then? Mr Mnangagwa would have to dump economic policies that are unpalatable to foreign investors.  In 2009, Mr Mugabe signed the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act (IEEA) into law, which aimed to place 51% of companies into the hands of Black Zimbabweans.  Even some Chinese companies have been forced to close their operations in Zimbabwe in recent years, because the IEEA made it unprofitable to do business in the country.  Once considered the breadbasket of Africa, Zimbabwe saw its agricultural production start to plunge at the turn of the century after the government-sanctioned programme of farm seizures.  Some sources claim that Mr Mnangagwa is keen to revitalise Zimbabwe's commercial farms, and may seek the help of white farmers to do it.  Corruption has been a major restraint on economic growth in Zimbabwe for years. Much of the farmland that was seized from white farmers ended up in the hands of army generals and the political elite, who knew next to nothing about agriculture.  The farms simply fell into disarray. Likewise, businesses that ended up with people with more political connections than entrepreneurial flair more often than not went to the wall.  Not that corruption is confined to Zimbabwe in the African context, but it is one of those places that it seems to trickle down from the top. Just ask any South African who has driven their car across the border and been stopped at a police roadblock.  But Mr Mnangagwa has not escaped the corruption criticism. It is alleged that he was at the top of corruption tree when the army effectively took over the Marange diamond fields in the east of the country in 2008. At the time, he was the defence minister.  That whole affair raised the eyebrows even of Mr Mugabe, who said last year that he felt at least $13bn of revenue had gone missing from the diamond bonanza. For nearly 20 years, Zimbabwe has been in default on $9bn worth of international debt. That debt needs restructuring, probably with the assistance of the IMF and the World Bank.  Perhaps a government that did not only include Zanu-PF could even get the debt (or some of it) wiped out. Mr Mnangagwa is thought to be open to a new deal with the IMF, but getting new financing and renegotiating old deals would probably be easier for a unity government which included opposition politicians, especially former Finance Minister Tendai Biti.  Formal jobs in Zimbabwe are rare. Unemployment runs at more than 90%. Creating the conditions for investment and seeing that money flows in should have a dramatic short-term effect on unemployment.  Other conditions already exist: the country has an abundance of natural resources in both agriculture and mining, and a potential labour force that's one of the most skilled in Africa.  All it needs is the political will and the right economic conditions for Zimbabwe's unemployment statistics to become rather less stratospheric.    Meanwhile, three million Zimbabweans are estimated to live outside the country, having fled the dire economic conditions that emerged over the past two decades. They too have skills which would be useful in the rebuilding of the economy.  But they will have to feel they would be landing on solid and stable ground - both financially and politically. Otherwise, why go back?  In addition, it could be argued that a Zanu-PF dominated government would not want them back this side of an election. The vast majority of the returning diaspora would be unlikely to vote for Mr Mnangagwa and his party. In the longer term, Zimbabwe needs to have its own currency.  Using the US dollar was necessary after the old Zim dollar became worth less than the paper it was printed on and met its demise.  But there is so much more to creating a viable currency than switching on a printing press. Confidence is key.  Last year, the Reserve Bank introduced ""bond notes"" which were meant to alleviate the chronic shortage of US dollars in the system.  However, many thought this was an attempt to re-introduce the Zim dollar via the back door.  In fact, the notes have done nothing to address the cash shortage and some analysts say they might have actually made the situation worse, by pushing up the demand for US dollars even further.  Few people like using the bond notes, even though the amount in circulation is relatively low and the denominations are small.  Putting money into a bank was no longer considered the soundest of options, because the cash could only be withdrawn in small amounts and there was always the fear that the Reserve Bank would come for your hard-earned dollars.  So, the stock market soared, ironically becoming one of the best performing bourses in the world. Indeed, the rise in the stock market has only been curtailed by the army intervention and the resignation of Mr Mugabe."
Debt Market Sentiment,What's knocked markets off course?,2024-09-14,2018-12-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46515773,"Just a few months ago, US financial markets seemed headed for a third year in a row of hefty increases. But shares have tumbled since October, retreating to lower levels than at the start of the year.  That decline continued on Friday, as weak economic data in Europe and China sparked a late afternoon sell-off, sending all three major US share indexes lower. The Nasdaq dropped almost 2.3%, the Dow fell 2% and the S&P 500 sank 1.9%. For those invested in US stocks, the double-digit gains in seven of the last 10 years may still feel pretty good. But as Wall Street debate turns to just when a recession might begin, many investors are bracing for a rough patch.  What's behind the shift in sentiment? At their peaks this year, the Dow and S&P 500 were up about 8% since the start of 2018. The Nasdaq had increased 15%. But the stock market surge was always a bit suspect. It outpaced other economic measures by a large margin and was driven by the tech sector, which accounted for roughly half of the gains on the S&P 500 up until mid-August of this year. Now some of the biggest winners - such as Apple and Facebook - have stumbled, dragging down the markets and making the weakness elsewhere more visible. All three indexes are off 10% from their earlier peaks - a decline often considered a correction. Until tech recovers, a broader market bounce is unlikely, said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. ""Looking to 2019, volatility is likely to represent the norm rather than the exception,"" he says. ""By many measures, the degree of investment difficulty is on the rise.""  US central bankers have been raising interest rates since 2015, moving away from the unusually low rates put in place during the financial crisis as economic growth rebounds. Analysts are worried about how much more expensive borrowing might get - and whether companies and households will be able to handle the increased costs. Fears have been tempered recently by signals from the US Fed suggesting it may enact fewer rates rises in 2019 than previously expected. But some still worry about the risks from corporate debt levels, which have hit historic highs - with an increasing percentage of the loans made to companies with already large debt loads. US growth is expected to slow to 2.5% in 2019, down from about 3% this year, according to the IMF and Federal Reserve. Some closely watched industries and financial indicators are already flashing warning signs of a more serious contraction. In October, sales of existing homes had fallen more than 5% compared to 2017. Construction spending has started to slip and growth in consumer spending been less robust than expected. Meanwhile, business optimism is in retreat. Indeed, nearly half of US financial officers believe the nation's economy will enter a recession by the end of 2019, a recent Duke University survey found. Investors loved US President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts. But his trade policy has them tied up in knots. In March, Mr Trump ordered tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium, as well as on billions of dollars worth in annual trade from China. He's threatened more, including on foreign cars. The tariffs have already raised costs for US companies - and economists warn they threaten to slow growth, adding to recession worries. Markets aren't sure about White House strategy, and an ongoing investigation of Mr Trump's election campaign ties to Russia has only added to uncertainty emanating from Washington. ""If these investigations produce some sort of smoking gun that throws us into a constitutional crisis, that might prove destabilising,"" says Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities. The IMF expects the global economy to expand 3.7% in 2019, but the growth has become more uneven. The US Federal Reserve recently flagged issues in Europe, China and emerging markets as some of the biggest threats to the American economy, with Brexit high on the list. Indeed, as much as US indexes are down, financial markets elsewhere have dropped even farther.  The Global Dow is down around nearly 9% so far this year, and the MSCI world index is down about 8%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index has fallen about 6%; Hong Kong's Hang Seng index is about 13% lower in 2018. The Shanghai Composite has dropped more than 20%. The Stoxx Europe 600 is off almost 11%. France's CAC 40 has dropped almost 9%, London's FTSE 100 has declined nearly 11%. and Germany's DAX is down more than 15%. So stormy seas likely lie ahead."
Debt Market Sentiment,Fears over repair contractor's future,2024-09-14,2018-12-13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-46551845,"Opposition councillors in Powys want assurances about the viability of a company responsible for council house repairs amid concern about its debts. Kier is the county council's partner in Heart of Wales Property Services, and is also handling the refurbishment of Brecknock Museum in Brecon. Last month Kier announced an emergency plan to raise £264m to cut its £600m debt and strengthen the company. The Kier Group said it was still aiming to ""win new business"". A Powys officer said responses would be given to the full council in January.  Heart of Wales Property Services (HOWPS) looks after 5,400 homes and 630 other properties in the county. The joint venture was launched in July 2017 when 109 council employees were transferred to Kier.  Plaid Cymru group leader Elwyn Vaughan said he wanted assurances that Kier was still a ""viable entity"". ""In recent months we have seen a major outsourcing company, Carillion, going to the wall and another company, Interserve, in severe difficulty,"" he told the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Labour group leader Matthew Dorrance said he was unhappy that the ruling independent/Conservative coalition had rejected a plan to allow greater scrutiny of the work of HOWPS. He said his party wanted to ensure the joint venture ""serves the people of Powys, not profit margins"". Kier Group chief executive Hadyn Mursell said the attempt to raise cash from existing shareholders had been prompted by a ""change of sentiment"" in the financial markets over lending to the UK construction sector. He wanted to ""better position Kier to continue to win new business and further strengthen our market-leading positions"". Nigel Brinn, director of environment at Powys and a member of the HOWPS board, said: ""We can confirm that the council has received formal questions regarding Kier and that responses will be provided at a meeting of the full council in January."""
Debt Market Sentiment,Islamic banking post-Paris,2024-09-14,2015-12-03,Eric Barton,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20151202-how-the-terrorist-attacks-in-paris-could-affect-islamic-banking,"Will the atrocities in France change the future for Sharia-compliant banking? Islamic Financing A look at the basics rules... Islamic banking is guided by rules called Sharia law, which are based on the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. The rules forbid profiting from money lending, meaning Sharia-compliant banks often buy properties for clients and then sell them back at an increased price through monthly payments. The rules also forbid banking transactions from investing in anything harmful, generally defined as gambling, prostitution, weapons, or alcohol. Developments built with Sharia-compliant financing, for instance, cannot include bars or restaurants that serve liquor. When Daud Vicary Abdullah stood in front of a packed ballroom at the Global Insurance Symposium in the US city of Des Moines, Iowa, in May, he could feel tension filling the room. Abdullah was there to talk about a sector of money lending governed by Islamic law, in a place where Muslims are far from common. Abdullah, president and chief executive officer of the International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance (INCEIF) in Malaysia, told the crowd that the goal of Islamic financing is simple: to guarantee ethical business practices. Islamic financing, based on Sharia law, forbids Muslims from investing in projects where liquor or pork will be sold, for instance. But more importantly for banks, it also prohibits making a profit lending money, meaning most deals are asset-backed rather than interest-backed. After Abdullah spoke, hands shot up among the 400 attendees. The questions continued for so long that they ran out of time. Afterward, Abdullah had 40 or 50 people wanting to know more about Sharia law and how they could enter the industry. “People said, ‘Gosh, we thought you were going to get up there and yell “Allahu Akbar”,’ but it was really fascinating,’” Abdullah recalled. “I was, without question, nervous about getting up there, but they accepted me and the subject.” Since then, there has been terrorism in Paris — the worst attacks on the city since World War II that left 130 dead — and anti-Islam sentiment growing, casting a shadow on all things Islam. Despite this, Abdullah believes people will see beyond the current situation, and recognise that Sharia-compliant banking focuses on a higher ethical standard, something most would likely see as a good change.  “Islamic Finance is not a religious issue. It is a business decision,” said Abdullah. “There will, however, need to be a redoubling of effort to change the potential negative perceptions arising, whether they are real or not. This is an ongoing challenge, but one that the industry is used to and becoming better equipped to deal with.” In recent years, banking and related Sharia-compliant services have been among the fastest-growing segments of finance in the West. Analysts say the recent news shouldn’t change that, but they say there’s little doubt that some decision-makers in banks may now think twice about expanding into an Islam-related field. The growth factor Rarely found outside the Middle East just a decade ago, Islamic financing has found acceptance in recent years from government regulators and bankers, with big Islamic banking hubs now in London and Malaysia. In July, Germany’s first Sharia-compliant bank opened in Frankfurt. “The UK has been very good to open its arms to Islamic finance, as far as non-Muslim countries are concerned,” said Faizal Karbani, founder and CEO of London-based Simply Ethical Ltd, which helps companies adapt to Islamic law. “A decade ago, there was very little on the market that was Sharia certified, and now there are regular seminars and training and many Western banks getting into the industry.” While Muslims in many Western countries had no choice but to use traditional financing just a decade ago, the growth in Sharia-compliant banking means it’s available more widely than ever before. And in many countries, Islamic banking has grown enough that there are competing banks looking for Muslim customers. The reason is simple: bankers see opportunity in a sector once served only by Arab companies. Islamic finance has grown by 17% globally in recent years, according to analysis from Ernst & Young. By 2019, Islamic financing will have 1.8tn in assets and see profits triple, the consultancy firm estimated. That growth is in part because of the expansion into new markets but also because there’s so much liquidity in the Middle East, thanks to oil money, said Iman Abdel Khalek, director of Middle East Debt Capital Markets at Citigroup in Dubai. “There’s a growing interest in the Western world for Sharia financing as it becomes more mainstream,” Khalek said. “It’s not a market that major banks can ignore.” In the past year, banks in Hong Kong, Luxembourg, South Africa, and the UK have issued their debut Islamic bonds, said Najib Al Aswad, senior manager at Islamic Finance Advisory & Assurance Services (IFAAS), an international Islamic finance consultancy headquartered in Birmingham, UK. In Hong Kong, RHB Asset Management Sdn will soon add two more Islamic investment funds to the one it created last year. To make this happen, many countries must rewrite finance laws to allow Islamic financing or, like Malaysia, come up with a dual system to oversee banks. The Islamic banking sector in Malaysia began with just a single bank in 1969, followed by a 1983 law that allowed the expansion of the industry, and the addition of an Islamic money market in 1994. “It all starts with a political will to change financial regulations,” Al Aswad said. Whether there will be that political will now, after the attacks in France, is unclear. Among the barriers to more widespread acceptance in the West has been a lack of training offered for those who wanted to learn the rules of Islamic financing and no way for consumers to know if banks were truly compliant, Karbani said. Now, several international organisations, including Ethica Institute of Islamic Finance in Dubai and the UK-based Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, offer certification programs for banks, accounting firms, and other companies that might be looking to diversify into this sector. Uncharted territory But even as major Western banks begin to embrace it, Islamic financing remains illegal in some countries and hard to find in others. In Japan, for instance, finance laws don’t allow banks to buy a property and then sell it back to customers, as is done by many Sharia-compliant banks. In February, however, Japan’s Financial Services Agency hinted that it may begin to relax the rules to allow Sharia-compliant banking. “There is still healthy skepticism towards Sharia financing because people look at it and think that it’s a product based on faith,” Karbani said. But that may change as banks realise they’re closing off a growing segment of banking. “A lot of the growth is not guided by good sentiment but good financial thinking.” In China, HNA Group, a conglomerate with investments from aviation to tourism, is now issuing what’s believed to be the country’s first Islamic financing, offering Sharia-compliant bonds and a $150m deal to buy ships. Meanwhile, in the US, the first Islamic bank opened in 1980, but the industry there has grown little since, according to a report from the US Federal Reserve. While large banks like Citigroup offer Islamic financing, only one US bank, Michigan-based University Islamic Financial, offers Sharia-compliant services exclusively. “One of the main issues with Sharia financing is simply that it’s misunderstood,” Abdullah said. David Yerushalmi, a New York lawyer who has led a campaign in the US against Sharia-compliant financing, said the problem isn’t an understanding of the industry. He said the problem is that Sharia compliance requires a committee of experts to oversee the bank’s activities in that field, and these committees often end up with “hardcore Islamic radicals,” according to Yerushalmi. “When you look at Sharia-compliant financing, the investing public doesn’t know what it’s getting,” Yerushalmi said. “People think banks are supplying Sharia-compliant programs, but what they’re really getting is financing overseen by radicals.” After the attacks in Paris, Yerushalmi believes the Sharia-compliant financing industry will slow for a short time but will continue to grow after the initial anti-Islam sentiment passes. Standardising the rules Falling oil prices might also slow the growth of Islamic financing, Khalek warned, but a bigger issue is the debate about how to define Sharia rules. Her division is overseen by a board of three scholars that sign off on deals and provide regular audits, she said. Other banks offer far fewer guarantees. “There is certainly a lack of standardisation in considering what is, and what isn’t, Sharia compliant,” Khalek said. “But there is continued innovation in this industry.” Abdullah’s university in Kuala Lumpur, INCEIF, with 30 full-time faculty, is one such organisation looking to provide a standard set of rules for the industry. His school offers three masters and a doctorate in the practical application of Sharia rules in finance. His campus is also home to the International Shari'ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA), which hopes to align different schools and governing bodies on what defines Islamic financing. More than anything, Abdullah wants the West to embrace the idea that Islamic financing isn’t just about what’s permissible but what’s ethical. Islamic law dictates that financing ought to support only the public good, he said, meaning Sharia-compliant banks can’t use money to buy bulldozers used to destroy rainforests. “There has been a lot of trust lost in the financial system in the last few years. Sharia financing offers an alternative to this,” Abdullah said. He said he believes, “Sharia equals ethical and responsible financing.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
Debt Market Sentiment,China stocks see biggest spike since 2016,2024-09-14,2018-10-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45936809,"One of China's leading stock indexes has seen its highest daily spike in more than two years following signs that the government will step in to support battered equity markets.  The Shanghai Composite closed up 4.1%, its biggest one-day rise since March 2016.  The moves extend a rally that began on Friday and after investor confidence surged on assurances from Beijing. Stocks had been falling as China's economic growth continued to stutter. On Friday, top Chinese financial officials - including economic adviser Liu He and the heads of the securities and insurance commissions - issued a statement to buoy investor sentiment in bruised markets.  ""The barrage of headlines from key Chinese officials on Friday was deafening and extremely co-ordinated, which has been to great effect,"" Pepperstone analyst Chris Weston said in a research note.  Over the weekend, the government published a draft of new rules for personal tax deductions, according to Reuters.  The moves come as  the world's second largest economy faces challenges such as high debt levels and an intensifying trade war with the US. Data out Friday showed that in the third quarter of the year, the Chinese economy grew at the slowest rate rate since the global financial crisis, expanding by 6.5% from a year earlier. The rate was a drop from the 6.7% pace in the prior quarter, but remains in line with the government's full-year target of about 6.5%. For years China has pushed to wean its economy off exports and rely more on domestic consumption for growth. At the same time, the government has been fighting to contain ballooning debt driven by a wave of infrastructure development and a housing bubble without hurting growth. In recent months Beijing has taken steps to support its economy, including cutting capital requirements to boost liquidity and ease the slowdown."
Debt Market Sentiment,Why US 'YOLO' spending baffles economists,2024-09-14,2023-12-01,Megan Carnegie and Leah Carroll,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231130-why-americans-yolo-spending-attitude-baffles-economists,"Despite past trends, US consumers are spending at record levels. Economists are mystified – and struggling to forecast an end point. Throughout a period of sky-high interest rates, depleted savings and grinding inflation, Americans have spent with abandon. On Black Friday, sales at brick-and-mortar stores were up 1.1% from last year; online alone, US shoppers spent a record $9.8bn (£7.72bn) online alone. Consumers spent another $12.4bn (£9.77bn) on Cyber Monday – an eye-popping 9.6% increase over last year. This holiday splurge follows a pattern of US consumer spending, which has buoyed the American economy in the past year, making up nearly 70% of the real GDP's 4.9% Q3 growth.  While some of this spending reflects the rising cost of necessities, Americans are also still buying big-ticket items and laying out tons of cash for experiences. This ""YOLO"" attitude towards money bucks the spending trends of past economic downturns – and some economists have been left scratching their heads, especially as consumer sentiment on the economy remains overwhelmingly pessimistic. ""If 18 months ago, you'd have said the Federal Reserve Bank could raise interest rates by 500 basis points, and the consumer would chug on, relatively unfazed, I would have been extremely surprised,"" says Ellie Henderson, an economist at UK-based, global bank Investec. ""I'd have said, 'that's just not how economics works'."" Typically, after a major crisis or job-market downshift, the economy generally experiences a small bump in both consumer savings and spending. However, the San Francisco Reserve Bank (SFRB) reported in May that the post-pandemic rise in fiscal spending this year has soared beyond the growth of any other post-1970s recessions.  Much of that growth, wrote SFRB experts, is due to an ""unprecedented"" increase of accumulated savings in US households, driven by the US Federal Government's swift fiscal response to the pandemic. Stimulus packages that directly introduced $5tn (£3.9tn) into the US economy, combined with other indirect policies, including eviction moratoriums and the suspension of student loan payments, saved Americans about $2.3tn (£1.8tn)  in 2020 and 2021. Although this year, people have drawn down their savings, many consumers still have money in their reserves – some for the first time ever – and they're willing to spend it now, even as they don't have faith in a full economic rebound. This sustained period of ""you-only-live-once""-esque spending amid rising debt and dwindling savings has confounded many economists. Leading the charge on this YOLO spending, reports Boston Consulting Group, are the younger, upper-middle class segments of the US population. While these individuals are not necessarily affluent, they are earning enough money to meet their needs, and are still able to spend on pleasure trips and luxury goods. Many of them are also leaning into using buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) platforms, which are experiencing major growth in the US, including during November's Black Friday shopping spree.  ""The strength of consumer spending, even after the dark days of the pandemic, has taken me by surprise,"" says Wendy Edelberg, senior fellow in economic studies at The Brookings Institution, and director of The Hamilton Project.  Even if the pattern doesn't follow economic precedent, however, some experts argue it makes sense intuitively. ""When you don't really know what the future holds – or even if there's a long enough future for you – people are focusing on the present and the short-term horizon,"" says Chiraag Mittal, an assistant professor of marketing at the McIntire School of Commerce, University of Virginia. And, he says, amid shifting attitudes around work and life, ""people are choosing to prioritise their happiness and fun"". Malcolm Harris, author of Palo Alto: A History of California, Capitalism, and the World, argues intangible factors like these often get lost in the qualitative analyses that seek to explain macroeconomic trends. ""Working life can change in qualitative ways that the metrics are bad at picking up,” he says. Even though many people are still employed and earning pay cheques, he argues, they're not necessarily happy – wages still are not keeping up with the pace of inflation, for instance, and people are still reeling from the physical and psychological trauma of the Covid-19 pandemic. ""Although job satisfaction numbers seem strong, life happiness metrics are in the dumps,"" says Harris. ""Given how much of our life is related to work, how can analysts square that circle?"" However inexplicable the phenomenon feels, several economists agree these YOLO spending patterns can't continue forever, and that the economic landscape is on the brink of change.  Henderson says there are major headwinds coming that could affect this, such as the October expiration of childcare grants, and the return of student loan payments. ""How could that not hit consumption going forward?"" she says. Additionally, US credit card debt has surpassed $1tn (£788bn) for the first time, and economists predict it's unlikely the cost of basic goods will drop soon, even as inflation slows. (Plus, those BNPL bills will come due, too.) Henderson predicts it's only a matter of time before some Americans are forced to tighten their belts and restrain their splurging. After such an exceptional fiscal year, however, Edelberg is less certain. ""I really don't know when it will go down – it depends on which part of my brain you ask,"" she says. If she were to hedge, she says the behaviour change would come by the end of the year. Yet, she says, ""honestly, I would not be surprised if I were surprised""."
Debt Market Sentiment,"Recession avoided, but growth is anaemic",2024-09-14,2023-11-29,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-67568765,"Innis & Gunn has weathered some chilly economic weather in the two decades since it started brewing premium lager in Edinburgh. The bank crash was a signal to keep away from too much debt, so higher interest rates in the past two years have not hit it as hard as some others. But rising costs for households have meant subdued demand for nights out in its taprooms.  ""Consumers are nervous. They're cutting back on things they used to do, like going out twice a week,"" says Dougal Gunn Sharp, noting there has been a consequent rise in off-trade demand for having one of his beers at home. That uncertainty has added to his caution about opening more pubs. They are capital intensive, he says, and the prospect of borrowing to expand does not look that attractive. The business, with its brewing now in Perthshire, is instead focussing on its core business, and looking to events to drive growth.  It already has a division seeking out such opportunities, having signed up as beer sponsor and provider of bars at the Royal Highland Show, the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo and concerts on Edinburgh Castle esplanade. That focus on sticking to the core business, while avoiding the cost and risk of investment to expand, is a repeating feature of business in Scotland. It is reflected in business surveys, in data published by the Scottish government and analysis by its chief economist. Wednesday brought statistics that show Scotland has avoided recession this year, but growth remains weak. Stronger wind speeds and fewer strikes helped shape a mixed set of output figures. The third quarter of the year saw growth of 0.4% in Scotland. The Scottish government data also shows the most recent month, September, saw slowing growth, to only 0.1%. For economists, a recession would have required two consecutive quarters of contraction. April, May and June provided one such fall in output, by 0.3%. The third quarter helped reverse that. But looking back further shows that 0.4% was the only growth we saw in 12 months.  Looking ahead, with prices still rising and borrowing costs remaining higher for longer, the forecasts continue to appear positive but poor for the Scottish and the wider UK economies. Growth in September was at only 0.1%, following 0.3% for July and 0.2% for August. The services sector slowed as autumn began, while wind speeds picked up, raising output of wind turbines by 17%.   That has a growing influence on total output from the economy, also known as Gross Domestic Product. The UK economic numbers this year have been affected by strikes, mainly in England. The third quarter saw the health service cut back on activity due to stoppages by staff, helping to explain why the UK as a whole saw zero growth and Scotland saw 0.4%. Manufacturing was growing in Scotland, though it has not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Construction has risen 2.5% in a year, but barely in the most recent quarter. The services sector - more than three quarters of the economy - included relatively strong performance by the business services and finance sector, which represents 30% of Scotland's economy. The quarterly figures once again showed hotels and catering having a tougher time than others. Those are the figures that reflect on the past year. The pattern worth noting from a longer perspective is that the rebound from pandemic and lockdown has stalled. Output has barely changed from the peak reached in 2019, ahead of Covid's arrival. With his review of the economy this week, the Scottish government's chief economist, Gary Gillespie, gave a tease that the resilience evident in the economy, despite all the pressures on it, might yet give us a pleasant surprise. But most of his analysis was more downbeat, covering weak business investment, a negative consumer sentiment index, sustained price inflation fuelled partly by wage inflation, and higher borrowing costs. Dr Gillespie also noted how varied the recovery from the pandemic has been for different sectors: construction up nearly 13% - after a 50% lockdown dip - services up 2.6%, and production, including manufacturing, down by nearly 6%. And he notes that forecasts for growth are not good. Having been much too gloomy about prospects for this year, the Bank of England reckons on UK growth falling from 0.4% this year to zero next year.  In Scotland, the Fraser of Allander Institute (FAI) sees growth picking up to 0.7% next year. The EY ITEM Club of economists, using the Treasury model of the economy, is looking to growth of 0.2% for the whole of this year rising to 0.3% next year. FAI director Prof Mairi Spowage responded to the latest GDP figures, with growth over three months, saying: ""Given that we've seen growth starting to slow down, we've still got a pretty difficult period ahead with higher prices, higher interest rates than people are used to, and wider uncertainty in the economy. ""All the forecasts for Scotland are pretty anaemic."" Scotland's chief economist concluded that the best prospects from growth may be from exports, and may be sluggish. Dr Gillespie added: ""While the return to positive real earnings growth is good news for household incomes, the ongoing weakness in consumer sentiment and lower demand for labour mean that consumption is unlikely to drive growth in the near term.  ""With inflation expected to remain above target for longer, economic growth is likely to be driven by external demand in Scotland, and will be a gradual process."" One day after publishing that, Dr Gillespie's team confirmed the latest Scottish export statistics which point to the challenges there. International exports from Scotland to the European Union failed to recover in the year after the pandemic struck, and in the second year outside the European single market.  The figures show 4% growth in the value of sales to the rest of the UK in 2021, to reach 61% of all sales outside Scotland. These were dominated by financial services, retail and electricity. That dominance of the UK market is a notable challenge to plans for Scotland being independent and re-joining the European single market A boundary within the UK's internal market could slow trade in similar ways to the disruption of goods and services trade resulting from a Brexit boundary in the Dover Straits. The figures show a modest recovery of non-European international exports during the second year of the pandemic, led by whisky and food. But the data point to a drop of 11.7% in sales into the EU since the UK left the single market, with no recovery in year two. We're nearly two years on from that. These figures were delayed by the pandemic. But with war in Ukraine and in Gaza, structural weakness in the Chinese economy, persistent price inflation in many developed nations and higher interest rates for many, global demand does not look like being a quick solution to the lack of investment and consumer spending in Scotland."
Debt Market Sentiment,Is Sunak's approach convincing or confusing voters?,2024-09-14,2023-11-18,By Alex Forsyth & Imogen Wallace,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67451542,"From warm coats for pet pooches to sprout-shaped cuddly toys and even dog cologne, there's an array of treats for animal lovers on offer in West Bromwich's indoor market. Dave Griffiths' pet stall has been there for over 30 years, and the market trader witnessed the town's political shift from a long-held Labour seat to a Conservative constituency in 2019 - though he's uncertain about where it will turn next. ""There are so many extremes - left and right,"" he says. ""I'd say the majority of people in this country don't agree with that. ""They are somewhere in the middle - just a little more to the left, a little more to the right. There is nobody really representing them."" He says voters don't want to turn to the extremes of politics but get frustrated when things don't get done.  Events in Westminster this week have reopened fissures within the Conservative Party. Rishi Sunak's cabinet reshuffle which saw the sacking of former Home Secretary Suella Braverman and the shock return of David Cameron to front-line politics, followed by the government's legal defeat over its plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, have reignited division and discussion about the party's direction. In West Bromwich's busy high street with the regular market in full swing, this hasn't escaped the notice of shoppers. John has voted for the Conservatives in the past but thinks the prime minister is ""silly"" if he thinks his plans for Rwanda will work.  ""The judges have already said it is illegal. Is he going to purposely break the law?""  He says he likes David Cameron but doesn't have faith in Rishi Sunak. And Keir Starmer? ""All he seems to do is complain,"" he says.  Margaret and Lynda aren't happy to see David Cameron come back. ""He walked away when it got too much for him,"" they say, recalling the former prime minister's resignation after the Brexit vote. On immigration, they have sympathy for those trying to come to the UK but don't think the country can take in more people.  They also have concerns about the Rwanda plan, saying it ""looks like a terrible place - where they are going to send them... I wouldn't like to think we're sending them over there"". The prime minister is simultaneously trying to reassure his fractious party and find a way to somehow shift its persistently dismal position in the polls. His reshuffle - hailed by some Tory MPs as a return to ""solid centre-right government which the country needs""  - prompted concern from others on the backbenches that it might fracture the electoral coalition the party built in 2019, when they took seats from Labour in places like West Bromwich. The ""New Conservatives"" group, which consists of MPs elected since the Brexit referendum in 2016, has demanded a focus on the concerns of ""ordinary people"" like law and order - and migration. In the face of such internal party pressure, Rishi Sunak opted for tough talk following the significant setback to the plan he claims will stop small boats crossing the Channel, saying flights to Rwanda would take off in the spring despite the plethora of parliamentary and legal challenges the policy could still face. In Wednesbury, a town that sits in the West Bromwich West constituency which also flipped from Labour to Conservative in 2019, Sushil Kumar isn't convinced it's the right focus. Serving pakoras to queuing punters from behind the counter of his Indian food truck, he described how his wife had been waiting for four years for NHS treatment. ""We've been paying tax for so long... they say they've got no space."" He is not a fan of the Rwanda scheme describing it as ""not very nice"".  Cutting NHS waiting lists is one of Rishi Sunak's oft-repeated five priorities, along with halving inflation - a target met this week - growing the economy, reducing debt and stopping the boats. According to the Migration Observatory, public opinion is divided on migration - around 23% believe immigration is bad or a very bad thing, while 52% think the numbers should be reduced either by a little or a lot. On the specific issue of stopping boats, the public appear to be sceptical - one YouGov poll in August found that 80% of the public lacked confidence in the government's ability to achieve its goal.  Another poll for Ipsos in September said over half believed the government's Rwanda policy would reduce people trying to get to the UK without permission.  At the Orchard Coffee Lounge, a family-run business in Wednesbury, Liz Wallis and friends Karen Barfoot and Brian Wilkins agree with the sentiment of the policy but are sceptical about the approach. ""We don't have the infrastructure in this country to cope with more people,"" says Karen. ""I don't know what we can do, but we really do need to start reducing the intake in this country."" Liz says she doesn't mind the prime minister. ""I don't mind anyone who is trying. And he's trying, and for me he's trying for all the right things."" Karen wishes there was less fighting in politics. ""We don't need that, we need them to pull together."" Rishi Sunak visited the very same coffee shop back in the summer, the kind of outing party leaders make with their local MPs to highlight life beyond Westminster. The prime minister is attempting to find a message that resonates with voters in the face of polls that clearly suggest they're lacking faith, and at the same time navigate the internal divisions in his own party over his chosen direction. It is his style to try and tread that line carefully; the question is whether the approach he opts for ends up convincing, or confusing. "
Debt Market Sentiment,A phenomenon that drives bad decisions,2024-09-14,2018-09-17,Madeline Grant,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180914-the-trick-to-learning-when-to-cut-your-losses,"Why would a gambler keep playing, even after losing a lot of money? Economists call it the sunk cost fallacy, a phenomenon which drives us to make bad decisions. We’re bidding farewell to 2018 with some of BBC Capital’s greatest hits from over the last year. With these compelling stories, indispensable tips and expert insight, you’ll be ready to make 2019 the best it can be. Madeline Grant is Editorial Manager at the Institute of Economic Affairs  You’ve popped down the shops to pick up some milk. Halfway there you remember that this particular shop is actually closed on Sunday afternoons. And as far as you know, there are no others open nearby. Still, you’ve already spent 10 minutes walking in that direction, so you might as well at least finish your journey, right? Unless you were already desperate to stretch your legs, this is a transparently stupid way of thinking. Yet, bizarrely, this illogical cognitive pattern is widespread in decision-making; often, involving choices with far higher stakes. A gambler might call it chasing your losses. The British saying – ‘don’t throw good money after bad’ – captures a similar sentiment. Economists call it the sunk cost fallacy, and it’s ubiquitous. We all do it. Ever gone to the cinema and stayed to the end of a film you actually loathed 10 minutes in – or watched yet another season of what was once your favourite TV show? This is the logic that says “I’ve sunk a lot of money into my old car. I can’t just scrap it now. I really should replace that faulty gearbox”. (See also: those who stay in bad relationships for several additional years because they don’t want their time together to have been ‘all for nothing’). What links these examples is the phenomenon of continuing to throw good resources (time or money) after bad, hoping for things to improve when there’s no good reason to believe they will. In other words, people are loath to cut their losses. We are much more likely to continue to senselessly plough time or money into a project that isn’t working out, in the hope that it will get better, than take a hit and walk away. What drives this is optimism (that, against the odds, the situation will improve) and an aversion to failure. Even animals can show a sunk-cost bias. One recent University of Minnesota study found mice and rats were just as likely as humans to fall foul of lab experiments involving delays and rewards. In each case, the more time invested waiting for their ‘prizes’ (for the rodents, flavoured pellets, for the humans, funny videos) the less likely they were to quit the pursuit before the delay ended. According to some researchers, this pattern may suggest some evolutionary reason for this economically irrational flaw. ‘A winning hand’ At work, the consequences of desperately hanging on to irrecoverable costs can be catastrophic. For smaller firms, this could mean, for instance, putting off firing a worker you have spent months training, even though it was clear from the outset they were never going to cut it. But this same spirit pushes people towards totally illogical huge investments. Thinking only in terms of future possible gains means they fail to factor in unrecoverable funds already spent. It’s easy to see why. After you’ve invested £10 million ($13m) in a project, which hasn’t delivered, the case for throwing in a further £5 million is far easier to justify if you only consider returns on £5 million – rather than £15 million. But in reality, of course, you also don’t want to look stupid by abandoning it. In his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman hypotheses that ‘sunk cost’ thinking often explains why firms turn to new management, or hire consultants, at this stage of a project’s decline. Not, he believes, because they are necessarily more competent than the original managers – but because the new arrivals carry none of the political baggage (and the associated reluctance to cut losses and move on). Like a gambler ‘chasing losses’ at a poker table, people stuck in the sunk cost trap will pretend that they have a winning hand. Nick Leeson, the infamous ‘Rogue Trader’ who caused the collapse of Barings Bank in 1995, followed similar reasoning in trying to recover his position from a series of disastrous early trades. Political overspend Making continuous foolish decisions driven by sunk-cost analyses will eventually lead firms to haemorrhage money or market share and consequently grind to a halt. By contrast, there are fewer checks and balances around political decision-making. It certainly doesn’t help that around the world, political U-turns are viewed as inherently weak – further incentivising politicians to persist with costly decisions. Many examples bear out this trend on a global level. Public infrastructure projects are notorious for running over budget – Britain’s proposed ‘High Speed Rail 2’ project – on course to overspend by £50 billion ($65bn) and counting, for instance. Japan, too, has a costly addiction to infrastructure spending. This is part of the reason the country has been saddled with the highest level of national debt in the world. Many of these projects have offered very little fiscal stimulus, and there are numerous ‘bridges to nowhere’, both literal and metaphorical. In the US, the “war on drugs” policy increased the number of people behind bars, creating the most extensive prison infrastructure in the world. Yet despite the wealth of evidence that focusing on supply has done little to curtail drug abuse (and caused a host of terrible side effects) lawmakers would now struggle to dismantle this pervasive system. The sunk cost trap drives bad decisions in the billions and trillions, but it also impacts personal finances – individuals waste money needlessly pouring their savings, for instance, into repairing a property that gains no value. Fighting the fallacy The sunk cost fallacy, then, has huge significance on a micro and macroeconomic level – for personal and political decision-making around the world. Yet a greater awareness of this illogical thought process may help us avoid falling into these traps – and to hold business leaders and politicians to account when they do. So, how can we avoid the pitfalls? “We are all susceptible to these biases”, says Dr Jim Everett, a social psychologist and researcher at Leiden University. “But often, we can partially offset them by taking a step back and thinking through the alternatives.” When weighing up whether to persist with a course of action, he says, always ask yourself: ‘What would I gain or lose if I stuck with this option, and what would I gain or lose if I switched?' If in doubt, Everett recommends reflecting on the entire chain of decisions that has led to where you are now, and considering the counterfactuals – in other words, what’s true and not true, a reality check. “If presented with the same choice again, would I make the same decision? If not – why not?” So, it’s a simple idea, with global ramifications. And ultimately, it all goes back to the first lesson of gambling.

Debt Market Sentiment,China new home prices see biggest fall since 2015,2024-09-14,2021-11-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59286413,"China's property slump has deepened official data showed, with new home prices seeing their biggest month-on-month decline since 2015. New construction starts in January to October also fell 7.7%, compared to a year earlier. The country's property market has been shaken in recent months as real estate giant Evergrande struggles to keep up interest payments on its huge debts. China has also been hit by a new wave of Covid cases and major power cuts. The 0.2% drop in new home prices in October was the biggest fall seen in China since February 2015. It also marks the first decline in new home prices +since March 2015. Sentiment in China's property market, which accounts for about a quarter of the country's economic activity by some measures, has been rocked as major property developers grapple with huge debts. The industry has come under intense scrutiny as fears continue over the future of companies including real estate giant Evergrande. Last week, Evergrande, which is saddled with around $300bn (£223bn) of debt, avoided defaulting on overdue interest payments of $148m. Just days before a 30-day grace period on the payments was set to expire it sold a 5.7% stake in media firm HengTen Networks Group for around $145m. The previous week Evergrande's car making business sold its UK-based electric motor business Protean for an undisclosed sum. Other Chinese home builders have also struggled to find the money to make debt repayments. Shares of developer Fantasia plunged by 50% last week after it said there was no guarantee it would be able to meet its other financial obligations following a missed payment of $205.7m in October. And earlier this month, trading in shares of Kaisa Group and three of its units was halted in Hong Kong after one of its businesses missed a payment on a wealth management product. The debt crisis faced by Chinese property giants had triggered concerns amongst some international investors that it could have a major impact on global financial markets. However, in recent weeks a number of high-profile figures have moved to help calm those fears. On Monday, the governor of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda said that he believed that China's property woes were unlikely to trigger a global shock as the amount of money owed to creditors outside the country was relatively low. ""We don't expect China's property woes to have a big impact on Japan's economy or financial institutions. We also don't see a huge risk of the woes triggering a big, global shock,"" Mr Kuroda told business leaders in the city of Nagoya, central Japan."

Debt Market Sentiment,Is Conchita Europe’s salvation?,2024-09-14,2015-05-22,Jason Farago,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150522-is-conchita-europes-salvation,"The annual musical contest offers much more than cheesy pop songs. It suggests a model for European unity worth following, writes Jason Farago. There’s an unhappy phrase – possibly apocryphal, but enduring – attributed to the French diplomat Jean Monnet, the spiritual father of the European Union. “If I were to do it again from scratch,” Monnet supposedly said about the project of continental unity, “I would start with culture.” Whether or not he ever uttered those words, they have come back with a vengeance over the last five years, as the Euro has cratered, half a dozen national economies have been pushed to the brink of default, and far-right parties have gained power in countries including France and Finland. In good times, Europe’s politicians talked a big game about unity and brotherhood. When the going got rough, they have been more than happy to let Greece crumble rather than stand together. And yet this week 180 million Europeans are set to bask in the glory of Europe. The Eurovision Song Contest, taking place in Vienna this year, has grown from a plucky seven-nation sing-off into the world’s largest non-sporting event this side of CCTV’s Chinese new year gala. In this 60th anniversary year the celebrations have extended all the way to Australia, a Eurovision-obsessed country that has been given a wild card to compete this year. It is enormous, Eurovision, and if all you hear is schlocky pop, you are not listening closely enough. I’m not European, and usually my musical tastes run more to Alban Berg than ABBA. But I have been watching Eurovision for more than a decade now, starting when I watched a grainy livestream of the event from Estonia in 2002. Over the years I have come to believe that the Eurovision Song Contest, more than any other institution, offers the best possible model for the construction of a new Europe. More than football, more than Erasmus, more than Skype and Easyjet, Eurovision proposes how Europe can work: as somewhere modern, joyous, accepting of the East, tolerant of Muslims and immigrants, proud of difference and yet proudly united. With the EU locked in existential crisis, an already beloved model for Europe will be on display in Vienna this week, confetti and all. This is not bloviating, and this is not clickbait – this is a serious proposal. If Europe really wants to build a common future, bearded divas are a good place to start. Come together Like almost everything with the prefix euro-, the Eurovision Song Contest has its roots in the aftermath of World War Two. In 1955 the young European Broadcasting Union, a consortium of national broadcasters, conceived of a single programme across multiple networks, transmitted simultaneously across borders. They found a model in the newly founded San Remo Festival, and created a musical celebration that pitted seven countries against one another in a friendly competition in which national pride would go hand in hand with European solidarity. (The BBC was a founding member of the European Broadcasting Union, but the UK did not participate in the first Eurovision – they missed the deadline.) For all its technical derring-do – a transnational broadcast was no small feat in the years before satellite television – Eurovision was a political project as much as an entertainment. Decades before the Maastricht treaty, Eurovision offered a template for a multilingual, diverse, yet united Europe, and when the song contest has become intertwined with real-world politics, it’s almost always been for unity’s sake. The Portuguese entry of 1974 served as the signal for rebel army officers to launch the Carnation Revolution. More recently Ruslana, the Ukrainian singer who won the 2004 contest in a Xena the Warrior Princess getup, helped lead that year’s Orange Revolution and later became one of the most prominent leaders of the pro-European Euromaidan movement. That political resonance continues today, not least in the expansion of Eurovision to the former communist bloc. One of the saddest aspects of the failure of the euro is its obscuring of the much more successful project of the European Union, which is enlargement. It was hardly preordained that less than thirty years after the end of the Cold War, Europeans would take it for granted that they could hit the beach in Croatia or have a stag do in Vilnius. (We might remind ourselves that Vienna is further east than Prague; discount airline passengers headed to Conchita Wurst’s hometown usually land in Slovakia.) Five former states of the USSR have now hosted Eurovision: Estonia, Latvia, Ukraine, Russia, and the rather notorious Azerbaijan, who spent millions masterminding their Eurovision victory, complete with fireworks. Serbia won it, too, with a lesbian power ballad in Serbo-Croatian. Brits who can’t abide their perpetual failure at Eurovision like to grouse about newer entrants’ tendency towards voting for one another, but I still get choked up at the spectacle of nation after nation casting its vote for a pan-European festival more open to the east than even football. Skopje calling! From pop to politics When Conchita Wurst, the Viennese drag queen with impeccable posture, swanned to victory in Copenhagen last year, she tearily proclaimed that “this night is dedicated to everyone who believes in a future of peace and freedom.” (She is not the first gender-queer winner of Eurovision; Israel’s Dana International, who unlike Wurst is transgender, won with Diva in 1998.) Eurovision has done wonders for gay visibility across Europe, but not only that. While the European political sphere admits Islamophobic sentiment of often shocking intensity, no fewer than four Muslims have won it all on the Eurovision stage since 2003 – among them the incomparable Loreen Talhaoui, a raven-haired Swede of Moroccan descent. Euphoria, the greatest Eurovision song in twenty years, netted the most douze points in the history of the competition, and set off a pan-European love story in which a Muslim embodied the joy and the concord of a single population from Dublin to Bucharest. (For crying out loud, the name of the song begins with E-U!) Loreen, who went out of her way to meet Azeri opposition activists at that year’s contest in Baku, is the very model for a contemporary European – English-speaking but proudly Swedish; invested in a local tradition but gazing across borders, to the east and to the south; and, more than anything, willing to dream big and to believe in change at a moment when so much of Europe prefers retrenchment. In 1990, the winner of the Eurovision Song Contest was Insieme: 1992, by the Italian crooner Toto Cutugno – a schlocky ballad in the form of an ode to Maastricht. “Unite, unite, Europe,” went the chorus, a singalong English refrain. And so Europe should. But how? The most terrifying future for the old continent is one in which the economic suicide cult now ensconced in Brussels and Berlin exerts a monopoly on the idea of unity, and ‘Europe’ becomes a synonym for economic devastation and political impuissance. Europe can be so much more: a place where union means something much more than a common market, and where solidarity and diversity are not at odds. I am hardly saying that Conchita Wurst should be president of the European Council, but the mandarins of the EU would do well to take a lesson from a diva immeasurably more popular than them, and who has brought Europeans together in a way they cannot dream of. In debt-wracked Athens as much as prosperous Frankfurt, Europeans are losing their faith in unity via diversity – and given the performance of their political leaders since the crash, who can blame them? But the real hope of Europe is on stage in Vienna this weekend, somewhere amid the waving flags and the disco balls.
