liquidity conditions,Schalke's fall to the edge of existence,2024-09-15,2024-04-29,Harry de Cosemo,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckr5yy29k82o,"Schalke's fall to the edge of existence It’s 5:45pm on matchday in Gelsenkirchen and tram 302 is bouncing. The 20-minute, five-and-a-half-mile journey to the Veltins Arena is the first sign of the raucous noise that awaits. Kick-off for Schalke 04’s match against Nuremburg is still just under three hours away. But homages to Schalke, in the form of stickers, graffiti and murals, are on almost every surface, surrounded by reminders of the region’s industrial heritage. The stadium stands on a hill on the city outskirts and every entrance is packed with eager fans. An aroma of beer, bratwurst and cigarette smoke hangs in the air. An hour before the action starts, the Nordkurve housing the Schalke ultras is full and loud. By kick-off, there are 62,000 packed in and it is hard to hear a single thought. This is the Schalke ritual, one that has played out in Europe many times. Over the past 20 seasons, they have played in the Champions League eight times. In 2011 they reached the semi-finals, losing to Manchester United.  In 2019, their most recent campaign among the elite, they reached the last 16, losing to Manchester City. But this is a different stage, with different stakes. This is Bundesliga 2 - the German second tier. Schalke are fallen giants, hanging dangerously close to a second relegation in succession and, possibly, oblivion. Despite recent assurances that their finances are holding up, the viability of the debt-saddled club as a genuine power is in doubt. How did this colossus - the third biggest club in Germany in terms of members, with the third most league titles of all time - end up on the edge? And is there any way back?  Schalke's players react after their relegation to the second tier was confirmed by a 4-2 final-day defeat by RB Leipzig in May “Their fans are talking in apocalyptic terms,” says journalist Felix Tamsut, who writes about football fan culture for Der Speigel and others. “You have crisis clubs in Germany, clubs going bankrupt, but I don’t think I’ve seen a club as big as Schalke talk in a way like their fans do. It’s shocking to see from a German football perspective. “It is a huge club - about 160,000 members. That’s more than Real Madrid, more than a lot of big clubs in Europe. Schalke is the most extreme case of a club trying to live beyond its means. “Having lots of fans doesn’t mean you have the money, but they spent like they did, thinking things would work out.” In 2016 Schalke signed teenage Swiss striker Breel Embolo for a reported 25m euros (£21.4m). The deal was revealed to Schalke’s fans via a video message that suggested the club had seen off competition from Barcelona, Manchester United and Arsenal. But three years later, after 10 goals in in 48 Bundesliga games, Embolo was sold to Borussia Monchengladbach for half the amount Schalke had paid. Nabil Bentaleb, signed from Tottenham in 2017 for 19m euros (£16m), departed for free at the end of his contract. Embolo and Bentaleb are just two examples of poor recruitment in recent years. And not only have Schalke bought badly, but they have also sold poorly. Key players such as Leon Goretzka, and academy prospects Sead Kolasinac, Max Meyer and Joel Matip, who should have represented good avenues for profit, left on free transfers. A stretched balance sheet came under further strain as the Covid-19 pandemic choked off the income from gate receipts and dented the value of the Bundesliga’s television deal., external Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 brought an abrupt end to the relationship with Gazprom – the energy giant majority owned by the Russian state and the club’s main sponsor. “Decisions have been made in the past that were totally wrong and have cost a lot of money,” Anja Wortmann, Schalke Supporters Club board member, tells BBC Sport. “The team they put together didn’t fit and didn’t play well. There was a ‘hire and fire’ culture for new coaches.” Current manager Karel Geraerts, hired in October, is the 11th permanent Schalke boss in 10 years. The swift series of pay-offs, hefty transfer fees, punishing interest rates on borrowed money and world events have taken their toll. Schalke’s debts rose to 217m euros in 2021 and, while they have since reduced that figure, they are sorely missing the income associated with the top flight. Breel Embolo (left) was one of a clutch of big-money buys who failed to work out They are also without long-time chairman Clemens Tonnies. The 67-year-old billionaire, who made his money in meat processing and frequently plugged holes in the club’s finances with loans, was ousted in 2020 after 19 years at the helm. His departure followed an apology for controversial comments about population growth in Africa as well as a Covid outbreak at his plant that sent local infections soaring. The club he left behind are now five points and four places clear of the Bundesliga 2's relegation play-off spot. Below that lies the automatic drop. Schalke's debts are such that the German Football Association (DFB) has granted them only a conditional licence, external for next season's third tier, noting a “liquidity gap” that must be bridged by the end of June if their finances are going to be ready for the reduced revenues outside the top two divisions. If they are relegated and fail to meet the financial conditions imposed by the DFB, the punishment is automatic demotion to the amateur regional leagues. The club have been granted an unconditional licence to operate in Bundesliga 2 in 2024-25 if they stay up.  Crucial games against the division's bottom two sides - Osnabruck and Hansa Rostock - followed by a final-day trip to mid-table Greuther Furth will decide their fate. Amid the change and challenges, the stress and the spreadsheets, the fans have been the one constant. “Being a Schalke fan is about more than just the game,” says Wortmann. “It is meeting friends before the game; it is driving together to away games. “The clubhouse is like a pub - we drink, talk and sing. It is a special atmosphere. In England you have a saying, 'You only sing when you’re winning’. Most of the German clubs are the same; Schalke is different. “Forty thousand Schalke fans wanted to go to each of the last three away games. The three stadiums combined didn’t have the capacity.” Schalke fans' commitment comes at considerable cost for many. Gelsenkirchen has an unemployment rate of 12.6%, almost 10 percentage points above the rate in Germany. The closure of the region’s coal mines means jobs have ebbed away. But the pride remains. Before every game the Veltins Arena is serenaded by ‘Das Steigerlied’ - The Climbing Song - celebrating the city’s mining heritage. The players' tunnel at the Veltins Arena is designed to look like a mine shaft in honour of the area's historic roots in the coal industry Tim Hoogland is a former Schalke midfielder who came through the academy, and is now the Under-19s assistant coach. “You have to know the history of the club. The area is the Ruhr Valley, a region where the coal mines were,” he says. “You have so many different cultures; it is a melting pot. Different people came from Italy, Turkey, and Yugoslavia to work. It is a very hard-working area of Germany. Because the mines closed, the area is very poor. “Some of the people of Gelsenkirchen and the surrounding areas only have this club. It is a religion for them. “If Schalke were in the fifth or sixth division, the bond with the fans would only get stronger. It is where everyone comes together, passed down the generations. Everyone lives and breathes it.” Tamsut agrees: “There is a saying, ‘Schalke will never disappear’. Even if the whole club has to be set up again, the fans will do it. The entity called Schalke is way beyond any person; it lives in the hearts of so many.” One of them is the captain of a rival team. Timo Becker, who leads Bundesliga 2 promotion-chasers Holstein Kiel, is a former Schalke player and a current fan. He has been known to play for Holstein Kiel on an afternoon and then stand on the Nordkurve alongside the Schalke ultras in the evening. “Schalke is what people have in common,” says Wortmann. “You can be a doctor or be unemployed and it doesn’t matter. We call it kleinster gemeinsamer nenner (the lowest common denominator). “People don’t know Gelsenkirchen, but if you say Schalke they recognise it.“ The famous nights in Europe that helped forge that reputation feel a long way away now. The run to Old Trafford and the last four of the Champions League was 13 years ago this week. One of Hoogland’s personal favourite memories from that era – his goal against a Real Madrid side featuring Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and a host of galacticos – was a decade ago. Hoogland (far left) celebrates his goal at the Bernabeu in 2014, but Schalke lost 9-2 to Real on aggregate in the Champions League last 16 “We created lifelong memories as a team,” he smiles. “I was injured for a lot of those Champions League games but, coming through the youth academy, I saw it from a fan perspective, watching historical players like Raul and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. Schalke was always in my heart. “The Champions League atmospheres were amazing. The semi-finals against Manchester United, the game in Madrid when I scored, were great.” Hoogland is adamant that the roots for Schalke’s recovery are in their tradition of homegrown players. “There is nothing as important as the academy for Schalke, in the past and the future,” he says. “The amount of academy players who came through - Manuel Neuer, Benedikt Howedes, Mesut Ozil, Julian Draxler - all were in Germany’s World Cup-winning team in 2014 and started at Schalke. “There have been lots of others. Joel Matip has been at Liverpool for nearly a decade, [Bayern Munich forward] Leroy Sane, [former Arsenal defender] Sead Kolasinac, [West Ham defender] Thilo Kehrer - so many great players. “It is brutally important to bring in academy players.” Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was born in Gelsenkirchen and joined Schalke aged five before progressing to the first team and leading them to the Champions League semi-finals in his final season before a move to Bayern Munich Off the field, the route forward is less clear. In Germany the 50+1 rule, which guarantees that members own the majority share in clubs, is a point of pride. Protests aimed at protecting it have been common and widespread among clubs. Some Schalke fans, though, feel that the club’s situation is so dire it is necessary to dilute fan control in favour of more investment. The return of shamed former chairman Tonnies has also been raised as an option. “We have discussions among the fans in the last few years,” says Wortmann. “People say they want Tonnies because he has the money and he can help. The ultras say he is responsible for the current situation. He was the king. He pulled the strings. Everyone did what he said. “Among the fans, we aren’t as united as it seems in the stadium. During the game everyone is supporting the team. ""Some fans don’t want 50+1 rule; they want the club sold to investors. You can see how much it means to the people. They fight, but it is with passion.” Wortmann believes that loosening the rules to allow a cash injection into Schalke is short-term thinking. For her, the existing rules keep the playing field more level and the gradient back to the top more manageable. “Union Berlin are the best example,” she says. “They reached the Champions League this season with not much money. Bayer Leverkusen won the championship. Everyone who is not a Bayern fan is happy about that. “In Germany it is possible with a team that is quite cheap to challenge. We should stick to the 50+1 rule.” A 2-0 victory over Nuremberg means the early-hours post-match tram back into Gelsenkirchen is just as lively. The immediate future is beginning to look a little more secure. For now, anyway. Whatever is next, in its darkest hour Gelsenkirchen is clinging on to its soul. As the saying goes, Schalke will never disappear.

liquidity conditions,House of Fraser rejects collapse reports,2024-09-15,2018-06-04,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44353529,"House of Fraser has denied reports it is on the brink of collapse as the department store chain insists its rescue plans are on track. The retailer said it is ""inaccurate and unhelpful"" to suggest it is struggling to secure the support of its banks. The talks were continuing and ""constructive"", House of Fraser added. The retailer said last month it would launch a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which allows firms to close loss-making shops and reduce rents. House of Fraser has 59 stores in the UK and Ireland, more than 6,000 employees and 11,500 concession staff. It has not said how many stores are earmarked for closure under its CVA or which stores are likely to be closed. ""If we are to deliver a sustainable, long-term business supported by new liquidity then we need to make difficult decisions about our underperforming legacy stores,"" said chief executive Alex Williamson. He said the current ""inaccurate speculation"" was feeding ""ongoing uncertainty for my colleagues"". The owner of toy shop Hamleys, China's C.banner, recently agreed to buy a majority stake in House of Fraser. The Chinese firm has pledged a cash injection for House of Fraser on the condition the CVA goes ahead. A CVA is designed to help a struggling company to pay back a proportion of its debts over time. It involves a strict repayment scheme overseen by an insolvency practitioner and must be approved by at least three quarters of the firm's creditors. UK high streets have seen a host of big names struggling in recent months, as they grapple with online competition, a decline in consumer confidence and rising overheads.

liquidity conditions,Palestinians reject Trump's Middle East peace plan,2024-09-15,2020-01-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51292865,"Palestinians have dismissed US President Donald Trump's new Middle East peace plan as a ""conspiracy"". It envisages a Palestinian state and recognition of Israeli sovereignty over settlements in the occupied West Bank. Mr Trump said Jerusalem would remain Israel's ""undivided"" capital, but the Palestinian capital would ""include areas of East Jerusalem"".  Reacting to Tuesday's announcement, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Jerusalem was ""not for sale"".  ""All our rights are not for sale and are not for bargain,"" he added. Palestinians took to the streets on Wednesday as part of a ""day of rage"" called by political factions.  The Palestinian health ministry said three people were injured by live fire in clashes between protesters and Israeli security forces near Ramallah in the northern West Bank. They are in a stable condition. Several people were also injured by rubber-coated bullets during a protest in the village of Abu Dis, in the eastern suburbs of Jerusalem, and one person was hit by a rubber bullet near Arroub camp in the southern West Bank, according to the Palestinian Wafa news agency. Meanwhile, Israeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin said a cabinet vote on whether to apply Israeli sovereignty to most Jewish settlements in the West Bank, the strategic Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea had been delayed for several days for technical and procedural reasons.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said the vote would take place on Sunday. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel - and the US under the Trump administration - dispute this. The Jordan Valley is a fertile strip of land running along the border with Jordan that makes up almost 30% of the West Bank. Palestinians say the valley would form an integral part of the land that they want for a future state. Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Trump administration had simply ""copied and pasted"" the steps that Mr Netanyahu wanted to see implemented. ""It's about annexation, it's about apartheid,"" he said. ""Moving to the de jure annexation of settlements is something that was given the green light yesterday.""  Mr Trump's blueprint for solving one of the world's longest-running conflicts was drafted under the stewardship of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Speaking on Tuesday, he said it was ""impossible for any Palestinian, Arab, Muslim or Christian child to accept"" a Palestinian state without Jerusalem as its capital. ""We say a thousand times, no, no, no,"" he said. ""We rejected this deal from the start and our stance was correct."" The militant Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, also rejected the deal which it said aimed ""to liquidate the Palestinian national project"". The Israeli prime minister described Mr Trump's plan as the ""deal of the century"". Israel ""will not miss this opportunity"", Mr Netanyahu said. ""May God bless us all with security, prosperity and peace!"" he added.  In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu said that over time the Palestinians would ""see they'll never get a better deal"".  A spokesman for United Nations Secretary General António Guterres said its positions had been defined by relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. ""The United Nations remains committed to supporting Palestinians and Israelis to resolve the conflict on the basis of United Nations resolutions, international law and bilateral agreements and realising the vision of two states - Israel and Palestine - living side by side in peace and security within recognized borders, on the basis of the pre-1967 lines,"" he added. Saudi Arabia and Egypt welcomed President Trump's efforts and called on Israel and the Palestinians to resume negotiations.  Jordan said the only path to peace was to establish an independent Palestinian state, based on pre-1967 boundaries, while Turkey's foreign ministry dismissed Mr Trump's proposals as an ""annexation plan"" aimed, it said, at killing a two-state solution and stealing Palestinian land for money. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged the Palestinians to give the plans ""genuine and fair consideration and explore whether they might prove a first step on the road back to negotiations"". Mr Trump also indicated that the West Bank would not be cut in half under the plan. ""We will also work to create a contiguous territory within the future Palestinian state, for when the conditions for statehood are met, including the firm rejection of terrorism,"" he said. By BBC Monitoring Palestinian media unequivocally condemned the plan. ""No Palestinian will either accept it or agree to engage with it,"" said Palestinian Authority newspaper Al-Hayat al-Jadidah. The Hamas-run Filastin online said: ""There is no full half of the deal of century because the entire bottle is empty."" Israeli opinion diverged along political lines with right-leaning media applauding the ""historic move"". The pro-Netanyahu paper Yisrael Hayom said: ""It would be a sin if we didn't support it and immediately apply Israeli sovereignty to Israeli settlements."" Other outlets had greater sympathy for the Palestinian cause and noted that however well Mr Netanyahu's annexation plans played to his supporters in Israel's upcoming general election, he would soon stand trial on charges of corruption. ""Netanyahu's drama is inconceivable: on the day he gets a green light to realise his wet dream, to annex as he wishes... a harsh indictment is filed,"" said one commentator in the liberal newspaper Haaretz. ""He will not escape his fate."" The Palestinians broke off contacts with the Trump administration in December 2017, after Mr Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the US embassy to the city from Tel Aviv.  Since then, the US has ended both bilateral aid for Palestinians and contributions for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). In November, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US had abandoned its four-decades-old position that Jewish settlements in the West Bank were inconsistent with international law. Of all the conflicts in the Middle East, that between Israel and the Palestinians has been the most intractable. Although the two sides signed a peace accord in 1993, more than a quarter of a century on they are arguably as far apart as ever. Jerusalem: Both Israel and the Palestinians hold competing claims to the city. Israel, which occupied the formerly Jordanian-held eastern part in 1967, regards the whole of Jerusalem as its capital. The Palestinians insist on East Jerusalem - home to about 350,000 of their community - as their future capital Palestinian statehood: The Palestinians want an independent state of their own, comprising the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. Israeli prime ministers have publicly accepted the notion of a Palestinian state alongside Israel - but not what form it should take. Benjamin Netanyahu has said any Palestinian state should be demilitarised with the powers to govern itself but not to threaten Israel. Recognition: Israel insists that any peace deal must include Palestinian recognition of it as the ""nation-state of the Jewish people"", arguing that without this Palestinians will continue to press their own national claims to the land, causing the conflict to endure. The Palestinians say what Israel calls itself is its own business, but to recognise it as the Jewish state will discriminate against Israel's Arab population of Palestinian origin, who are Muslims, Christians and Druze. Borders: Both sides have fundamentally different ideas as to where the boundaries of a potential Palestinian state should be. The Palestinians insist on borders based on ceasefire lines which separated Israel and East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza between 1949 and 1967. Israel says those lines are militarily indefensible and were never intended to be permanent. It has not said where borders should be, other than making clear its own eastern border should be along the Jordan River. Settlements: Since 1967, Israel has built about 140 settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as 121 outposts - settlements built without the government's authorisation. Settlements are considered illegal by most of the international community, though Israel disputes this. Palestinians say all settlements must be removed for a Palestinian state to be viable. Mr Netanyahu has vowed not only to never to uproot any settlements but to bring them under Israeli sovereignty. Refugees: The UN says its agencies support about 5.5 million Palestinian refugees in the Middle East (the Palestinian Authority says there are up to 6 million), including the descendants of people who fled or were expelled by Jewish forces from what became Israel in the 1948-49 war. Palestinians insist on their right to return to their former homes, but Israel says they are not entitled to, noting that such a move would overwhelm it demographically and lead to its end as a Jewish state."
liquidity conditions,Singapore's crypto ambitions shaken by FTX collapse,2024-09-15,2022-12-18,By Suranjana Tewari,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63898729,"There was a time when it seemed as though Singapore would become a global centre for cryptocurrency. Authorities had signalled an early interest in harnessing blockchain technology. That, coupled with the city state's favourable business environment, attracted digital asset companies and a burgeoning community of investors. In 2021, investment in the industry in Singapore increased tenfold compared to the previous year to $1.48bn (£1.2bn), according to KPMG, making up nearly half the Asia Pacific total for the year. 2022 could not have been more different. Crypto assets and companies - many with links to Singapore - have imploded, causing reverberations and sparking losses around the world.  First a popular token called Terra Luna collapsed, causing its sister token TerraUSD, which was largely stable, to plummet.  A few months later, Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows filed for bankruptcy, taking down crypto exchange Voyager Digital with it. In August, crypto lender Hodlnaut became the next in a growing string of casualties. It is thought that the closures of key market players this year has wiped out $1.5 trillion in crypto market capitalisation. Then in November, billions were lost within a matter of days, when US crypto exchange FTX spectacularly collapsed because of a crippling liquidity crunch. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has since been charged by US authorities with ""one of the biggest financial frauds in US history"". For Singapore, the FTX collapse was particularly shocking. Its state investment fund Temasek had invested in the exchange, pumping in $275m over several months.  Temasek says it will write down the money, and is conducting an internal review into the investment. The fund is worth more than $295bn and so the FTX investment makes up a small percentage of its public wealth portfolio. But Singapore's deputy prime minister, who is also finance minister, told parliament the loss had caused reputational damage. ""The fact that other leading global institutional investors like BlackRock and Sequoia Capital also invested in FTX does not mitigate this,"" Lawrence Wong said. Tail investors were hurt too, and many believe the Singaporean authorities should have done more. Nicole Yap, 26, says she didn't flinch about investing in the exchange because so many big companies were backing it. She has lost roughly $150,000 (£122,000), but feels the onus should not be on the user entirely. ""You need the regulation - the government or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) - to say, 'these companies are good, we've seen their books,'"" Ms Yap says. ""Just because there is a lot of scam in crypto, doesn't mean crypto is a scam. But users don't have a platform to find out about these things. We only have social media and crypto influencers."" Carol Lim started investing in cryptocurrency during the pandemic. The 52-year-old was hoping to make enough money to retire in the next few years.  ""I invested with Hodlnaut because the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) endorsed it. In today's value, I lost about $55,000. I can only hope to get some of it back."" Hodlnaut was one of a handful of firms that was granted in-principle approval to provide digital payment services by Singapore's central bank. The licence approval was rescinded when the lender was forced to stop withdrawals because of market conditions. ""The core of the problem is that there is some misunderstanding amongst regulators. They want to attract businesses to their jurisdiction, but you need to regulate in such a way that consumers are safe,"" says Michael Gronager, CEO and co-founder of blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. Mr Gronager says that because consumers are so global these days, regulators need to decide whether to implement laws on the company - for example, giving them a licence to operate in the country - or to restrict trading access to retail investors. FTX did not have a licence to operate in Singapore. However, MAS has said it is not possible to prevent local users from accessing overseas service providers. ""We will see fraud, fast money in the industry - that's no surprise. We see it in the internet, we see it in all sorts of traditional industries,"" Mr Gronager says. Singapore had started introducing new measures even before the FTX saga, warning that the technology can be volatile and speculative. It banned crypto advertising earlier this year and is investigating a number of outlets present in the island nation. Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, left Singapore last year after it was put on an investor alert list for soliciting customers without the requisite licence, and offering Singapore dollar trades.  The crackdown has attracted criticism from industry players as a result, for instance from Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of US-based crypto exchange platform Coinbase. ""Singapore wants to be a hub for Web3 (a vision of the next iteration of the internet that uses blockchains and cryptocurrencies), and then simultaneously says: 'Oh, we're not really going to allow retail trading or self-hosted wallets to be available,"" he said at the Singapore FinTech Festival in November.  ""Those two things are incompatible in my mind,"" he added. Singapore's government says it remains enthusiastic about crypto and still wants to become a virtual-asset hub, with a focus on the business and administrative side of blockchain technology. It has vowed to contain risks, by proposing knowledge tests for retail investors before being allowed to trade, and has acknowledged this could mean retail-focused companies may move to other jurisdictions. ""Cryptocurrency platforms can collapse due to fraud, unsustainable business models, or excessive risk taking. FTX is not the first cryptocurrency platform to collapse, nor will it be the last,"" Mr Wong said. ""Those who trade in cryptocurrencies must be prepared to lose all their value. No amount of regulation can remove this risk."""
liquidity conditions,"Business confidence is falling, says Natwest boss",2024-09-15,2022-05-26,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61599029,"The cost of living crisis presents challenges because so many firms and customers have no experience of high inflation and rising lending rates, NatWest boss Alison Rose has said. Firms on the bank's books have falling confidence, she told BBC Scotland. Ms Rose blamed this on problems with supply chains, energy bills and skills shortages. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also ""exacerbated"" people's worries, she added.  Three years after she took over the top role from Ross McEwan, and renamed Royal Bank of Scotland, or RBS, with the Natwest brand, Ms Rose said that the impact of inflation, higher interest rates and the invasion of Ukraine has caused a ""concern"" for business about ""confidence to grow"".  ""We are still seeing positive tailwinds from recovery from the pandemic as companies scale back up again, but definitely business confidence is being affected,"" she said.  She added business customers of Natwest are not pulling back on investment, though there is cautiousness about long-term projects.  ""We're seeing people increasing investment in working capital as they re-engineer their supply chains,"" Ms Rose said. ""One of the challenges we all need to recognise is that, for a lot of business owners and lot of families, an environment of inflation and rising interest rates is not something they've had to deal with for a long period of time."" Interest rates were cut sharply during the financial crisis in 2008-09, when RBS had the biggest balance sheet of any bank in the world, ran into severe difficulties with its exposure to bad lending, and had to be bailed out with a £45bn capital injection by the UK government.  It is only this month that the Bank of England base interest rate has returned to 1%, and the current Consumer Price Index, at 9%, is at its highest level for 40 years and continuing to rise.  So it is a falling minority of people in Britain who remember the problems of living with high inflation, and few in business could remember both rising at the same time. Ms Rose, who joined Natwest 30 years ago, said the bank has relationship managers who can offer experience of getting through turmoil in business conditions. ""People are really anxious and worried about all those trends, so we encourage them to come and talk to us, because there are things we can do and we can help with,"" she explained. The chief executive said the bank is not seeing signs of mortgage arrears rising or bad debt more widely. ""As we came out of the pandemic, a lot of businesses built a lot of liquidity on their balance sheet. One of the things we've focussed on is helping people save and put money away for a rainy day.  ""We're not seeing any of those early warning indicators around bad debts or insolvencies or even calls coming into our financial health and support teams. ""But we're very acutely aware that people are worried about those challenges. We encourage customers to get in touch if they are worried."" The finance sector has seen pay rise ahead of inflation, unlike almost every other sector. RBS bonuses this year were up 44%.  While others face falling real incomes, the Natwest boss defended bank pay as fair and competitive with other banks, while the bonus pool is declining. ""We recognise that we get well paid in the finance sector, but the majority of our staff don't get bonuses. The majority are on fixed pay,"" she said. ""We've always said we would pay fairly and competitively. Our staff are paid above minimum wage. Also it's important to bring the right talent into our organisation so that we can support our customers."" On very low savings rates for customers of Natwest and Royal Bank of Scotland and its Ulster Bank brand - only 0.15% on the premium saver account and 0.45% on ISA cash - the chief executive responded: ""We've got to balance all those elements. We've always said we will pass on rates, to keep that in balance to make sure we're doing that responsibly and fairly."" Also in the interview, looking back at her time in the investment bank, while its operations were close to bringing Royal Bank of Scotland crashing down in 2008, Ms Rose recalled it as a ""really difficult time"". ""I've had my whole career here, and I remember the financial crisis clearly, and the impact we can have on people's lives when things go wrong. That's driven a huge part of my commitment to rebuilding part of the bank's reputation,"" she said. ""I remember walking the floors, talking to more junior people, trying to provide reassurance. What I saw was a lot of my colleagues - good people, doing good work, traumatised by what happened, (feeling) it wasn't the bank they recognised. That wasn't what they did."" She reflects that the last two chief executives - Mr McEwan and Stephen Hester - were in a fight for survival, whereas her job is about focussing on the future and growth, about building relationships more than being a bank purely for transactions. And on the move away from its Scottish branding, she said Natwest remains proud of its Scottish heritage, banking one in three Scottish businesses, one in five households and one in seven Scottish mortgages, while being a major employer north of the border."
liquidity conditions,Rooney welcomes Kirchner's Derby interest,2024-09-15,2021-10-26,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59048184,"Wayne Rooney is trying to stave off the threat of relegation following Derby's points deduction - but they have appealed against the decision Derby County manager Wayne Rooney has welcomed US businessman Chris Kirchner's declaration of interest in taking over the club. Kirchner, 34, is the co-founder of global logistics company Slync.io and confirmed his intention to buy the Rams in an open letter to supporters. The Championship club have been in administration since 22 September. ""He was at the game last week. I spent a bit of time with him. He's got some really good ideas,"" said Rooney. The former England forward said Kirchner's letter was a ""real show of intent"" and told BBC Radio Derby: ""He is a very good businessman and I am sure he wouldn't be putting his name to a public statement if he didn't mean what he is trying to do at the club."" Administrators Quantuma have said they want to identify three preferred bidders by the end of the year. Chris Kirchner is chief executive of Dallas-based shipping and logistics company Slync.io Former Derby owner Andy Appleby is believed to have registered an interest, but last month Quantuma said they had not been approached by Mike Ashley, who recently sold Newcastle United. Kirchner is the first person to go public over plans to buy the Rams. A graduate of the University of Kentucky, now based in Texas, he posted in a Twitter thread:, external ""I'm not a billionaire... not sure this matters. However I've done well enough to acquire and fund a club.  ""The administrators are very diligent and required a minimum of £100m in proof of liquidity to even get to the point I am at in the process. ""As things go with this process, I will continue to share as I am legally able to while being respectful of the EFL and the administrators. They are both doing a wonderful job, care about the future of the club and will not let anything like some of the past public debacles happen again."" Quantuma confirmed they have received a ""fully funded"" and ""credible"" offer from Kirchner, but one which has ""a number of related conditions"" which must be considered. ""As we have said previously, it is the responsibility of the joint administrators to ensure any preferred bidder is able to submit an offer for the club which both maximises the positions of the creditors to the club and secures the long-term future of this historic club,"" joint administrator Andrew Hosking said in a statement. ""We also have to ensure the EFL is satisfied the prospective purchaser will pass their own tests and also the terms of the offer are justifiable to the various stakeholders impacted by the administration.""  Graeme Shinnie's goal enabled Derby to draw 1-1 at Coventry City on Saturday Kirchner has said he is ""impressed with the attitude of manager Wayne Rooney"", the rest of the coaching staff and players, and he plans to be there when they face Blackburn Rovers at Pride Park on Saturday. In his letter, he said: ""While the club is currently going through a really tough time, it is the supporters, and everyone associated with the club that have stayed loyal which provide the foundation to rebuild again. ""This challenge is one I don't take lightly but is something I am looking forward to - and I know we can prove successful at - if we work together. ""I want to be a part of that rebuild and support that effort. As an entrepreneur I am committed to building companies and I want to apply that experience towards rebuilding this proud and storied club."" He continued: ""At this point in time, the administration process is complex, but I have informed the administrators that I'm willing to work through these complexities. ""I understand and acknowledge that there are a number of interested parties in the club, but I wanted to go on the record at the start of the process and be up front."" Derby, who have not played in the Premier League since 2008, were deducted 12 points for going into administration but claim it was caused by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and have appealed against the sanction.  Owner Mel Morris agreed sales to Abu Dhabi-based group Bin Zayed International (BZI) and Spanish businessman Erik Alonso earlier this year but both deals collapsed. Kirchner's letter concluded: ""The best stories in life often start after a setback and the best years of Derby County FC are without a doubt in front of us.  ""Hopefully, we will have the chance to be better than ever before and together write our own chapters in the illustrious history of DCFC! Up the Rams!"" Administrators Quantuma are hopeful that a buyer will be found for Derby County Former Rams defender Charlie Palmer told BBC Radio Derby's Sportscene that Kirchner's intentions ""seem correct"". But he said a lot of discussions would have to take place before any would-be buyer could conclude a deal. ""They need to get to the nitty-gritty, find out what all the issues are to make sure they can address and resolve those problems. Hopefully they can put in the money required, pay off the debts and start taking this club further up the league,"" Palmer added. ""Wayne is doing a great job with his hands tied. It's going to be interesting when money does become available, with his contacts and the way he wants the game to be played, (whether) he will be able to bring in the players which could take this club to the next level.  ""I'm hoping when the right person comes in, they can give him the support and the financial clout to take this club forward because he deserves that opportunity.""  BBC Radio Derby's Chris Coles Just to see communication from Chris Kirchner already puts him ahead of the likes of BZI and Sheikh Khaled. That saga went on for a long, long time and there was lots of excitement about what they could bring to the table. He's said all the right things. If you make sure you're very complimentary about the club you're buying and you throw in something like 'Up The Rams' at the end then you get lots of people onside. Quantuma have already shown they are only willing to enter into dialogue with those who are deadly serious and hence they have demanded, not just from Chris Kirchner, but from other interested parties, proof of funds and evidence of the cash required to take Derby out of this position. Despite it feeling different, it is still very early stages so fans will be optimistic, but wary, after what's happened before.

liquidity conditions,"Coronavirus: Wickes owner to cut 2,500 jobs",2024-09-15,2020-06-15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53053055,"The UK's biggest builders' merchant, Travis Perkins, plans to cut about 2,500 jobs, or 9% of its workforce. The group said it expected a UK recession to hit demand for building materials this year and in 2021. It said it had started a consultation process with staff at about 165 branches,  about 8% of its network. The group includes Wickes, Toolstation and Tile Giant. It said closures would mainly be of smaller branches of its Travis Perkins General Merchant brand. Figures out last week showed that the UK economy shrank more than 20% in April while the country was in lockdown. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said at the time that there ""signs of the economy now beginning to come back into life"", but it was unclear how much long-term damage the pandemic would cause. The government has put in place various measures to try to limit the long-term damage, including a furlough scheme for workers. Travis Perkins has been using that furlough scheme, but nevertheless said that the coronavirus crisis had ""created significant challenges across our group"". Chief executive Nick Roberts said: ""While we have experienced improving trends more recently, we do not expect a return to pre-Covid trading conditions for some time and consequently we have had to take the very difficult decision to begin consultations on the closure of selected branches."" The group's sales volumes plunged 40% in May year-on-year, but have since recovered to about 85 % to 90% of last year's levels as more branches have reopened, with social distancing measures. It said there had been particularly strong demand for do-it-yourself (DIY) ranges at its Wickes stores and at Toolstation, with both businesses showing improving like-for-like sales growth against 2019. Travis Perkins said that although it had overall liquidity of £763m, it had agreed a relaxation of banking covenants. Treasury figures last week showed that more than a quarter of UK workers are furloughed, with the government paying 80% of staff salaries . From August to October, workers on furlough will continue to receive 80% of their salary. However, the amount paid by the state will be reduced each month, and employers will be expected to make up the rest."
liquidity conditions,IMF warns of Cambodia credit risk,2024-09-15,2013-01-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-20954841,"The IMF has called upon Cambodia's central bank to tighten the credit market The International Monetary Fund has warned that a credit boom in Cambodia poses a threat to economic growth. Banks have been cutting interest rates to win customers and private sector credit has increased by almost a third in the past 12 months, the fund said. This means that borrowing levels are now equal to 37% of the country's total economic output, well above the median for most other low-income nations.  A similar surge in 2008 saw a real-estate boom and bust, the fund warned. If the current rate of growth in the private credit market continues then it may signal overheating, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The National Bank of Cambodia, the country's central bank, has taken some steps to tighten and slow lending.  It most recently raised the amount of money that banks need to hold in reserve, making it harder for them to access the cash needed to lend. However, the IMF said that, external raising the reserve requirement ""does not automatically mean tighter credit conditions"" and further steps were needed. ""Cambodian banks still have excess liquidity, a number of them are lowering interest rate spreads to compete for market share, and some increasingly rely on cheaper external funding from foreign banks,"" it explained. The IMF advised the central bank to implement measures which are not just effective in reducing credit growth, but also cause the least amount of distortion in the market.

liquidity conditions,Jobs saved as troubled shopfitter is sold,2024-09-15,2018-07-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-44696856,"More than 300 jobs have been secured at Fife-based Havelock Europa after the business was bought out of administration.  The firm was sold through a pre-pack administration process to Havelock International, a new firm established by turnaround specialist Rcapital. The sale came immediately after the appointment of PwC as administrators. A total of 320 jobs were threatened after Kirkcaldy-based Havelock suffered a drop in orders. The firm, which makes furniture and fittings for shops and public buildings, blamed continuing pressures on the high street. Last week Havelock had trading in its shares suspended over concerns about its financial position. It is understood that all employees have now been transferred to the new company. Havelock Europa's customers have included Primark, Holland and Barrett, and House of Fraser. Havelock Europa can trace its origins back nearly 150 years in Kirkcaldy, and in the specialist joinery business of shopfitting.  In recent years, it's been struggling. Banks and shop chains have been shrinking rather than expanding.  And with a recent public warning that it was in financial difficulties, its supplier credit terms became much more demanding. So it was put in administration on Tuesday, knowing that it would immediately be bought over by Rcapital, a private equity fund that invests in turning around distressed companies. The management team stays in place. They now have the time and capital to win new customers in different and growing sectors such as furnishing new hotels and student accommodation. And they drop out of the stock market, which will save money on reporting compliance and avoid a lot of unwelcome publicity if or when things go wrong. No redundancies are planned, but there's no guarantee they won't happen. It will take time to turn the company around, with new orders and new sectors. The big question for the workforce is how long Rcapital is willing to commit. Turnaround specialists always have an exit in view, and they exist to make a profit. They are rarely patient.  Working them is rarely a pleasure.  But Havelock's management sound confident about the future because they believe the core business remains strong. Mark Addley, restructuring partner for PwC in Scotland, said: ""We are delighted to have secured a future for the business and employees of Havelock.  ""2017 was a very difficult trading year for the business and a combination of the associated losses and tightening credit in recent weeks rapidly led to a liquidity crunch.   ""It has proved very difficult to secure a sale against such a backdrop so to have managed to complete a transaction and preserve the employment of over 300 staff in an area where there are very few substantial employers is particularly pleasing."" Havelock chief executive Shaun Ormrod said: ""It has been a very difficult period for employees, customers and our supply chain.   ""However, the PwC team have worked tirelessly to secure this sale, which provides an opportunity for Rcapital to support the management team to implement its turnaround plan.  ""With the ongoing support of our workforce, customers and suppliers I am looking forward to Havelock becoming a profitable, secure business with long-term growth prospects.""      Rcapital said Havelock's management team would work in partnership with Rcapital to ""restructure and invest in the business"", adding that a key focus would include ensuring that ""all customer projects are completed in full"". Rcapital director Josie Richardson added: ""The underlying Havelock business is strong and provides refits for some of the UK's best-known high street brands.   ""We fully support the management and operational teams and will work with them to ensure the best possible customer service and sustainable growth.""  Unions gave a cautious welcome to the news. GMB Scotland organiser Alan Ritchie said: ""Relief for our members is the overriding feeling because the immediate future of the business was dependent on new investment - but we are well aware that there will be challenges ahead.  ""We will sit down with the new owners as soon as possible to establish their plans for the future of the plant and the staff.  ""Our priority will obviously be the defence of our members' interests, which means sustaining jobs, pay and conditions as best we can.  He added: ""The last few days have been incredibly tense for our members and their families but today's announcement brings some respite for them and for the Fife economy, which has not had its troubles to seek.""  In a separate boost for Fife, agricultural specialist Cefetra Ltd has announced that it has signed a long-term agreement with Forth Ports to develop a new agri-hub at the Port of Rosyth. The development will create a new purpose-built facility at the port that will be able to handle a range of agricultural products for the Scottish and northern English markets."
liquidity conditions,Investors sue over Credit Suisse collapse,2024-09-15,2023-05-04,By Nick Marsh,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65467019,"Asian investors have joined a series of landmark international lawsuits being filed against the Swiss government over its handling of the takeover of troubled bank Credit Suisse. In March, Swiss authorities forced Credit Suisse to merge with larger rival UBS amid fears it could collapse. The move rendered worthless $17bn (£13.5bn) of bonds held by investors. ""Everything unravelled so quickly,"" said one bondholder in Singapore who spoke to the BBC anonymously. Already a Credit Suisse client for several years, he bought around $500,000 worth of bonds in January despite the bank having been hit by a series of scandals and compliance problems over the past few years. ""Whenever I spoke to them, the bank gave me constant reassurances that this was just a blip, so I decided to go for it. It didn't feel like I was gambling."" Companies sell bonds to investors to raise the funds they need, paying the money back over time with a premium. The type of bonds he bought from Credit Suisse are known as AT1 bonds, or contingent convertibles. They normally carry high yields for investors but are considered among the riskiest bonds that banks issue. Investors know that in dire circumstances this type of debt can be written down to zero, which is exactly what happened when UBS was told to take over Credit Suisse. The Swiss financial regulator, Finma, has not commented directly on the lawsuit but in March said ""the contractual conditions"" for a write down were met.  AT1 bonds, they said, can be wiped out in a so-called ""Viability Event"" - in this case the extraordinary liquidity support granted by the Swiss government to Credit Suisse on 19 March. Nevertheless, dozens of individual bondholders in Singapore have joined what is believed to be thousands of aggrieved retail investors globally, who are challenging the Swiss authorities in court. Lawyers say they have been inundated with enquiries. The bondholders' main grievance is the manner in which the merger was conducted. Central to their claim is who was given priority when the bank failed. The terms of the bonds, seen by the BBC, show that bondholders are, if possible, supposed to be compensated first, after which come shareholders. But in practice, shareholders were allowed to exchange their Credit Suisse shares for UBS shares, albeit at a vastly reduced value. It means, in effect, that those who had bought shares got something, while those who had bought bonds got nothing. The legal firm representing bondholders has called the Swiss regulator's decision ""an unlawful action"" that has had ""devastating consequences on thousands of retail and small investors globally."" ""In simple terms, bondholders were deprived entirely of the value of their bonds through a series of irregular administrative acts,"" said Epaminontas Triantafilou from law firm Quinn Emanuel. Another Asia-based bondholder who spoke to the BBC said he and his wife, who were due to retire this year, had their life savings wiped out by the decision. ""We're losing sleep over this. It should have been a rock solid investment, but now I think the reputation of Switzerland and Swiss banks has gone down the tube,"" he said. ""Who in the world is going to trust Switzerland anymore?"" Investors are also unhappy with reassurances they received from Credit Suisse, despite the fact that the bank was going through enormous difficulties. Vinit Chandra, another bondholder in Singapore, says presentations given by the bank encouraged the buying of bonds as late as 14 March - the day before Saudi investors said they would not be providing any more financial assistance to Credit Suisse and the bank suffered a 25% drop in its share price. ""I know people, sophisticated investors, who went and bought the bond,"" he said. ""They were saying to me, 'look, this is solid, this is all kosher'. ""[Credit Suisse] were very clear. They said the kinds of circuit breakers that the Swiss authorities would have to trigger in order to write off a bond were very far away."" Credit Suisse says it is not commenting on the lawsuits. Legal experts have privately expressed doubts over whether the investors will be successful. But given that Swiss law only allows for a limited period in which claims can be submitted, bondholders say it is now or never. ""People are hurting together and maybe the power of the collective can have an effect,"" said Mr Chandra.  ""Who knows? If there's some kind of settlement high up between the big boys, then the retail investors like us can get the drip feed of whatever trickles down."""
liquidity conditions,Leading UK commercial property fund suspended,2024-09-15,2019-12-04,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50658437,"Investors in one of the UK's biggest commercial property funds - worth £2.5bn - have been temporarily prevented from taking out their money.  Investment firm M&G said withdrawals from its property portfolio fund had been suspended after investors consistently withdrew their savings. The firm blamed ""Brexit-related political uncertainty"" and difficulties in the retail sector for the situation. The fund has shrunk by £1.1bn so far this year.  ""Given these circumstances, we have now reached a point where M&G believes it will best protect the interests of the funds' customers by applying a temporary suspension in dealing,"" M&G said in a statement. It has waived 30% of its annual charge to investors, as they were unable to access their money, although some have called for action from the regulator on such charges. The M&G Property Portfolio has invested in 91 UK commercial properties across shopping centres, other retail, industrial and office sectors on behalf of UK investors. The same fund was suspended in July 2016 for four months following the UK's EU referendum when money flooded out of such funds. Investors range from armchair, retail investors to institutional investors, dealing with millions of pounds. M&G has been unable to sell properties fast enough, particularly given its concentration on the retail sector, to meet the demands of investors who wanted to cash out. The decision to suspend the fund, and its feeder fund, was taken by its official monitor - its authorised corporate director - and the City watchdog has been informed. ""The FCA is working closely with the firms involved to ensure that timely actions are undertaken in the best interests of all the fund's investors,"" a spokesman for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said. M&G said the suspension would be monitored daily, formally reviewed every 28 days, and would only continue ""as long as it is in the best interests of our customers"". This will allow assets to be sold over time, rather than as a fire sale, in order to meet investors' withdrawal demands. The firm has written to investors to explain the current situation. Investors in general have been shaken in recent months by the demise of previously lauded fund manager Neil Woodford. Woodford Investment Management is shutting after Mr Woodford was sacked from its flagship fund in October. The case raised questions regarding the oversight of funds which invest in assets that take a long time to sell, but from which investors can withdraw their money from at any time. The M&G case will make the case stronger for regulators to take a tougher stance on these types of investments. By Rob Young, business reporter The suspension of a UK commercial property fund has been anticipated for some time.  The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, has been on high alert, subjecting a number of funds to enhanced monitoring.  One of the main issues affecting M&G has been the state of retail. The High Street has been having a torrid time.  As more and more stores have closed, that has put pressure on property funds. Returns from these have been less than great recently and so many investors have been pulling out their cash.  M&G admits it has been struggling to sell buildings with sufficient speed to be able to match the demand from investors wanting their cash back. Hence this suspension.  Some analysts warn several other property funds could follow suit.  When the M&G property portfolio last took this action, others did too. That was just after the EU referendum in 2016. As the UK approaches yet another Brexit deadline, it could become even more difficult for funds to sell commercial property at a value they think is fair. Investors have been pulling their money out of other large so-called open-ended property funds, and the FCA has recently introduced daily monitoring of property funds. Yet financial planners have mixed views on whether the M&G suspension could be matched by other funds in the sector. ""Property is a long-term investment and we urge investors not to panic,"" said Patrick Connolly of financial advisers Chase de Vere.  ""While the M&G fund is suspended, most other providers have far greater liquidity, and less exposure to retail properties, and so are better placed to meet redemptions, as long as there isn't a mad rush to the exit door. ""Property still remains an asset class which can play an important role in investment portfolios and, when we have some real clarity on Brexit, the prospects for this asset class will hopefully improve."" However, Ryan Hughes, from AJ Bell, said investors would review their interest in other funds which could lead to ""a rush for the exits"". ""We could see a wave of suspensions now - several that offer daily redemptions are at risk,"" he said.  A spokesman for Aviva, one of the other fund managers that suspended a fund in 2016, said it had ""pro-actively built cash levels in the Aviva Investors Property Fund"". These were now at around 30% after it made several sales over the summer. ""We are in a period of heightened market uncertainty and believe this is an appropriate level given market conditions. Robust liquidity management remains a key priority for the fund managers,"" he said."
liquidity conditions,University given £1m bailout from watchdog,2024-09-15,2018-11-16,By Sean Coughlan,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-46223219,"A UK university had to be given an emergency loan of almost £1m by the higher education watchdog to stay afloat this autumn. It's been discovered that the Office for Students provided the bailout when the university faced the prospect of running out of cash and being unable to pay its bills. The money has been repaid - and the regulator says the university, a small, modern institution, is now financially stable. But it highlights the fragility of university finances, which are now in a ""marketplace"" and vulnerable to fluctuations in recruitment and tuition fee income. The discovery of this payment is also embarrassing for the Office for Students (OFS), which recently sent out a tough message that there would be no bailouts for universities in financial difficulty. Sir Michael Barber, who chairs the regulator, told a conference a couple of weeks ago that it was wrong for university leaders to think the OFS would would help them if they were in ""financial trouble"" because of a lack of student numbers or overspending on buildings. ""This is wrong. The OFS will not bail out providers in financial difficulty,"" Sir Michael said. The watchdog says the bailout it did provide, made to the university in September and understood to be about £900,000, was under the rules of its predecessor organisation, the Higher Education Funding Council for England, under transition arrangements. It followed a cash problem faced by the university over the summer. But a spokesman for the OFS said that under its own new rules, now in place, such financial support would no longer be permissible. The debate about bailouts followed reports from Richard Vaughan in the I newspaper that three universities were on the ""brink of bankruptcy"". It raised the question of whether universities, in what has been designed as a competitive marketplace, should be allowed to go bust and close down. That the watchdog was ready to act behind the scenes shows how difficult it would be to really allow a university to go under. It would mean huge disruption for students and would mean the loss of what are often among the biggest local employers and drivers of local economies. It could also put the watchdog and universities minister into a very compromised position if they let a university collapse. They would be asked how they allowed people to apply to a university they knew to be at financial risk. If students are getting into £50,000 of debt from a degree course, the Office for Students, acting in the consumer interest, would be expected to warn students not to step aboard a university that was not financially watertight. But if they, or university ministers, did warn that a university was in financial trouble, it would be likely to destroy the student numbers on which universities rely for their income - making it even harder for a university to dig itself out of danger. The OFS says that its new provisions will make the university sector more financially robust. As a condition of registering with the OFS, the regulator will have to be confident that universities are financially secure for at least the next three years. A spokesman for the OFS said the institution to which it lent money could now pass this financial test and show it was ""not at material risk of insolvency for the next three years"". ""Over the summer, we provided a short-term liquidity loan to the university, which was quickly repaid in full and repaid before registration,"" the OFS spokesman said.  He said it was paid under ""inherited legal responsibilities which will cease to apply at the end of this transition year in July 2019"". ""We have been very clear that we would not bail out any university. But we have also said that where a university is in trouble, we would first ensure that they have a strong student protection plan and secondly we would act according to the circumstances. ""This could for example involve requiring them to carry out a strategic options review to identify future options including restructuring their business model, sale of property or mergers."" It will also raise questions for the current review of university funding in England. There have been suggestions that the headline figure for tuition fees could be reduced to £6,500 from £9,250. Although this would mean less cash going directly to universities, it would mean that more of university budgets could be distributed centrally, making them less vulnerable to annual changes in student numbers."
liquidity conditions,Fed fights move to end some Covid support measures,2024-09-15,2020-11-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55020693,"The US central bank has hit back after the Trump administration said it was ending some emergency lending programmes established to provide economic support during the pandemic. The decision affects schemes aimed at helping corporations, mid-sized businesses and local governments, among others. The Federal Reserve said it thought the programmes were still needed. But they have been controversial in Washington.  US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin authorised the programmes in spring this year, using money from a major stimulus package approved by Congress. They marked a large expansion of the Fed's powers, allowing the bank to buy corporate debt and lend to mid-sized businesses, among other authorities. But the schemes have been lightly used, drawing criticism from some who have questioned their necessity, and from others who were worried their design was too limited to reach those in need. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has defended the programmes, saying they were helping to stabilise financial markets by giving the private sector confidence to continue lending. In a statement, the central bank said it disagreed with the White House decision to allow them to expire on 31 December. ""The Federal Reserve would prefer that the full suite of emergency facilities established during the coronavirus pandemic continue to serve their important role as a backstop for our still-strained and vulnerable economy"", it said. In his letter to the bank, Mr Mnuchin said the schemes had ""clearly achieved their objective"". He asked the Fed to return unused funds to the Treasury Department, allowing Congress to put some $455bn to other uses.   ""While portions of the economy are still severely impacted and in need of additional fiscal support, financial conditions have responded and the use of these facilities has been limited,"" he wrote in a letter to the bank. It was ""Congressional intent... to have the authority to originate new loans or purchase new assets... expire"" on 31 December, he added. The stand-off comes as Washington remains embroiled in debate over the need for further stimulus. Economists have said the recovery remains fragile and cautioned against withdrawing support prematurely.  Democrats have backed more than $3tn in new aid programmes, but Republicans maintain a smaller package would be sufficient. The US economy has recouped about half of the jobs lost in March and April. But many of the funds for unemployed workers and struggling businesses have been exhausted, while rising virus cases have led to renewed restrictions in many places.  Without action by Congress, some 12 million Americans could lose access to unemployment benefits in coming weeks. The US Chamber of Commerce, a business lobby, criticised the decision to end the programmes just as president-elect Joe Biden is about to enter the White House.  ""A surprise termination... prematurely and unnecessarily ties the hands of the incoming administration, and closes the door on important liquidity options for businesses at a time when they need them most,"" said the group's chief policy officer, Neil Bradley."
liquidity conditions,How the Bay of Pigs invasion began - and failed,2024-09-15,2021-04-23,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56808455,"Sixty years after the Bay of Pigs invasion - the failed attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba - the island continues to celebrate its victory while the invaders who survived live on in the US with the satisfaction of having done their duty. BBC Mundo examines the military plan and the reality of what unfolded.  Johnny López de la Cruz feels deprived of air. Locked up in a lorry with more than 100 other prisoners, he can barely breathe. Inside the vehicle, the detainees are getting desperate. They sweat. Several faint. Some remove the buckles from their military belt to perforate the car's ceiling and allow some air in. They are buying time. But most expect to be executed as soon as they arrive in Havana. The vehicle arrives at its destination seven hours later. Military personnel open the doors. Several bodies fall into the asphalt. Nine detainees have died during the trip. When it is Johnny's turn to exit, he barely manages to jump out. There are more prisoners besides those arriving in the ""lorry of death"". In total, spread out across several vehicles, there are nearly 1,100 detainees. They are the survivors of the 2506 Brigade, an army of 1,400 youths who hours before had failed in their attempt to invade Cuba, crushed at Giron beach by Fidel Castro's forces. Most are Cuban exiles who, following Castro's victory, were recruited and trained by the CIA to overthrow the island's revolutionary government. Fidel Castro had reached power slightly more than two years before, on 1 January 1959, when his forces brought down the government of Fulgencio Batista, whom they accused of being authoritarian and corrupt. Despite substantial popular support for Castro, many Cubans did not agree with his revolution and left for exile. The Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961 was doomed to fail even before the first shot was fired. The Brigade still blames Washington.  From the White House, US President John F Kennedy cancelled at the last minute the US air strikes that would have neutralised Castro's aviation. He did so because he felt the United States could not appear to be behind the invasion. Being seen as such would not only damage its international reputation, but would also give an excuse to the Soviet Union, which at that time was consolidating its position as a key ally of Castro, to respond and provoke an unprecedented nuclear conflict. Under these circumstances, the attack by the determined but inexperienced youths who dreamed of ""liberating Cuba from Castro"" lasted less than 72 hours. They landed at dawn on 17 April 1961. By the afternoon of 19 April they had already been defeated. The survivors of the 2506 Brigade were released more than a year later, in late 1962, following intense negotiations. The surviving members of the invading force are still waiting in exile for the fall of the Cuban socialist government. Cuba, in turn, commemorates every 19 April the defeat, by a small nation, of an army of ""mercenaries"" funded by the world's most powerful country. It has been 60 years. This is the story of how the invasion plan was hatched, why it failed, and how it has marked the life of its protagonists. Johnny López de la Cruz, now 80 years old, is the current president of the Association of Veterans of the 2506 Brigade. He was part of a paratrooper battalion that participated in the invasion of the Bay of Pigs. This is his story: My eyes were opened the day Sergeant Benitez was killed. He was from Batista's police, a good friend of the family who never left Cuba because he believed he had done nothing wrong. In the beginning I supported Castro. He never said he was a Communist. If he had done so, nobody in Cuba would have supported that. But soon afterwards, people started to be executed. Properties and lands were seized and nationalised. One day, two of Castro's men arrived and took Benitez away to put him on trial. I was there, to support him. It lasted less than half an hour. He was not even allowed to speak. He and four other men were declared guilty and were taken to an abandoned cemetery outside of town. They were executed and thrown into a common grave. I woke up. I did not understand how you could order the execution of people without allowing them to defend themselves. That was an abuse of authority.  Then I started to participate in counter-revolutionary activities.  We would distribute pamphlets and write ""Down with Fidel"" on walls. But then, two members of my group were arrested. People close to me told me that I was next. So I went with three friends to Havana and flew out to Miami with fake papers. When I arrived in the US in 1960 I already knew that other exiles were being trained by the CIA in Guatemala to invade Cuba. I made my way over there a few days later.  Between 1959 and 1960, thousands of anti-Castro youth such as Lopez de la Cruz concluded that their only options were exile or taking up arms against the government.  Most ended up in the US, a country willing to fund Castro's overthrow. The nationalisation of American industries and businesses as well as Castro's increasing ties with the Soviet Union soon led to a souring of relations between Cuba and the US. He had become a real threat to the regional influence of the world's most powerful country. The CIA, the Pentagon and the White House, under the administration of US President Dwight Eisenhower, decided to liquidate the revolutionary leader. And they found in a group of Cuban exiles the perfect army to execute the plan. In total, some 1,400 men were recruited. In the meantime, Cuba adopted preparations as it suspected an imminent invasion.   Jorge Ortega Delgado fought on Fidel Castro's side during the invasion. When he remembers those days, his eyes sparkle. Sitting down in the porch of his house in Havana, Ortega, who is now 77-years-old, told the BBC how he joined the militias. I come from a very humble working-class family. When the Revolution triumphed, I was 15 years old and I immediately joined revolutionary activities. The US started to intervene and to try to attack Cuba. In October 1959 the Revolutionary Militias were founded.  I joined and trained during 1959 and 1960. Towards the end of October 1960, Fidel Castro, the Commander in Chief, arrived at a training session. He asked to talk to all the militias. We were almost 1,500. He asked those under 20 years of age to join the anti-aircraft artillery forces. That afternoon I asked my parents for permission to go with them. They agreed.  I was sent to Battery Number 30. That was where we started getting trained in anti-aircraft artillery.  The original plan designed by the CIA and the Eisenhower administration was to have the exiles leave from Puerto Cabezas, in Nicaragua, and land near the city of Trinidad, in southern Cuba. The main objective was to occupy the zone and resist for enough time to establish a rival government by exiled leaders that would later be supported by the United States. Trinidad is near the Escambray mountain, where there were already members of an anti-Castro group, that would join the invading troops, and, if necessary, would organise a guerrilla warfare campaign similar to the one successfully conducted by Fidel Castro in the Sierra Maestra mountains a few years before. To facilitate the landing, 16 aircraft would previously bomb Castro's main airports, destroying his air force and gaining advantage over the Cuban skies. But plans changed radically when Kennedy became President in January 1961. He agreed to continue with the plan, but not under those conditions. He thought that invading Trinidad in broad daylight was too brash. ""Kennedy wanted to deny any participation in the invasion. It had to be done covertly. Landing in Trinidad in broad daylight demonstrated too much power, [it would show] that the US was behind"", Peter Kornbluh, director of the Cuba Documentation Project at the US National Security Archive. ""The operation had to be as secret as possible and Kennedy gave the CIA three days to re-elaborate a plan that had been under preparation for a whole year"", the expert adds. Kornbluh managed to obtain the declassification of a report on the failed military action that remained secret for 37 years. Kennedy reduced the aircraft from 16 to 8 and urged the CIA to modify the zone and time for the landing. They chose what would later prove to be one of the worst possible sites: the Bay of Pigs, a hard to reach inlet in the south of the island. In this zone, coastlines are hostile. It is a swampy region with impenetrable mangroves and razor-sharp ""dog's teeth"", as reefs are known in Cuba. A difficult scenario to carry out a landing with stealth and speed. Near the Bay of Pigs there was an airport, key for the refuelling of the invaders' aircraft. Jorge Ortega Delgado completes his first anti-aircraft cannon exercise and anxiously waits to have his day off on 15 April. He has spent several months in military training. But at daybreak, on that same day, the combat alarm rings. Invading aircraft have bombed two airports in Havana and another one in Santiago. ""We went out immediately. They ordered us to take out the cannon and were deployed to a beach. When we arrived they told us that on daybreak, 15 April, mercenary aircraft had attacked our airfields and killed seven of us"", Ortega remembers. ""All of the youth there, we felt very strongly against this. We could not believe it. We were willing to do anything necessary to defend the fatherland"", the former combatant says, his voice still ringing with emotion.  The 15 April 1961 bombardment was the first one that Kennedy had authorised to destroy Castro's aircraft before the landing, scheduled for 17 April. The eight aircraft left on the morning of 15 April from the base at Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, and dropped their bombs over the airfields of Santiago de Cuba, in the country's east, and over Ciudad Libertad and San Antonio de los Banos, both in Havana. Despite causing seven deaths, they only damaged a few Cuban airplanes, some of them which were already out of service. Castro's Air Force was left almost untouched and, besides, they managed to shoot down one of the invading aircraft. After the bombardment, a plane with Cuban insignia landed in Key West, Florida. Its pilot said he was a deserter from Castro's armed forces. In reality, he was part of the CIA plan to avoid involving the US in the attack. This way, it would look as if a domestic anti-Castro uprising had started in Cuba, rather than an action promoted by the US. ""But the story about the deserter lasted only a few hours. Although the US denied it, all the world learned that the aircraft were American and that they wanted to pretend that the attack had been executed by Cuban deserters"", Kornbluh explains. With suspicions aroused over US participation, Kennedy cancelled the rest of the air strikes, landing a devastating blow against the objectives of the 2506 Brigade, which was left with insufficient air support. ""I always say that the war was lost before it had begun"", Lopez de la Cruz laments. But at that moment, none of the invaders knew it.   17 April 1961. It is 1:00 in the morning. The invading boats approach Larga beach, at the end of the narrow Bay of Pigs.  They do not want to make noise. Surprise is the key to the plan. But for months Castro has been suspecting an aggression is coming. He knows that a war against the US is a like a David-Goliath confrontation, and he is well prepared. ""They had militias patrolling practically every beach of the island"", Kornbluh explains. One of these patrols hears noises. They turn on their flashlights and open fire. The invaders respond. They manage to capture a few of the militias, who have had time to sound the alarm. The surprise factor is gone. Castro's troops are mobilising to repel the invasion and there are still many invaders waiting to land. Humberto López Saldaña is 83 years old. In 1960 he left Cuba for exile in Miami. Soon after he joined the Brigade. He was in one of the invading boats. We had a lot of difficulties. We started to fight too soon. This delayed the landing. Besides, our boats were all too small. Every time they hit one of the reefs they ended up practically destroyed. Many sunk. The landing continued until early in the morning. We were waiting for the tide to go out to see better and avoid the reefs. From the coast, they threw us a rope to reach land.  At around 6:00 in the morning Castro's aviation appeared. Bombs fell right next to us. Our boats shook like they were made of paper. Soon after a bomb hit my boat, the Houston. Panic ensued. Several comrades died. The captain threw the Houston against the reefs to help everyone else reach dry land.  Besides disabling the Houston, Castro's aircraft also sunk the Rio Escondido. We had a lot of munition and tonnes of aircraft fuel on those boats. Everything was lost. Jorge Ortega and his anti-aircraft battery arrived at the province of Matanzas, where the Bay of Pigs is located, at around 5 pm on 17 April. There, he found out he would fight against 1,200 men who had managed to disembark in Cuba, besides the paratrooper battalion that had been airdropped in a nearby zone.   Another group of brigade members stayed at the rear guard, without moving. Ortega remembers hearing the militia men, the sound of tanks and mortar fire. ""On 16 April we had closely listened to Fidel's speech honouring our seven compatriots fallen during the bombardments. On our way to Havana, the people would come out to the street with flags, asking that we defeat the enemy"", Ortega remembers. It was in that speech that Castro declared for the first time the socialist nature of the revolution and he called on the people to repel the mercenaries. On the morning of 18 April Ortega detected enemy planes. It was the first time he fired a cannon. ""You feel restrained. We all feel afraid. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying. But you look at the person next to you and you see the rest of the men are firm and resolute. When you start to shoot, you feel enraged and you lose fear"", Ortega recalls. That same day, his battery went in with more troops near Larga beach, laying siege to a substantial part of the exile army. ""On the morning of 19 April we saw how one of the aircraft, shot down by our battery, fell into the sea. Another airplane fell into a sugar cane field. The co-pilot burned to death but the pilot jumped in his parachute and tried to escape. He died in combat with our troops"", the ex-combatant tells. With the cancellation of the air strikes previous to the landing, the B-26 aircraft that accompanied the invasion were easy prey for Castro's practically intact air fleet. The boats carrying aircraft fuel had been lost and the invading planes could not use the airport near Giron beach, as they had planned. They now needed to fly four hours round trip to the base in Nicaragua to refuel. Each time they returned to Cuba, they had less than an hour to carry out the bombings. The crews removed one of the machine guns from the airplanes, to make them lighter. But that left them more vulnerable. Twenty-four hours after the 17 April landing, the invaders had already lost two of their six ships and half of their air fleet. The rest of the vessels retreated to the open sea, to avoid more damage from Castro's forces. On 19 April, four American flight instructors based in Nicaragua flew in to support the Brigade members who had been left to themselves. Fidel's forces shot them down. ""They did not have to die, but they felt they had to support us. It was a great gesture"", Lopez de La Cruz laments.  Castro knows the enemy is facing difficulties. He orders a full advance to bottle them up against the coastline and prevent them from escaping. His troops arrive in waves: lorries with more men, armoured carriers, mortars, airplanes. By the third day, the invaders don't have munitions, aircraft, or escape routes. They surrender at 530 in the afternoon of 19 April. It is complicated to estimate an exact number of deaths from the invading side. ""There were naval personnel in the boats that sunk and we lost count there"", De La Cruz explains. The president of the Veterans Association calculates that there were 103 deaths and another 100 wounded. He thinks the casualties were very low, taking into account that the fighting went on for three days. On Cuba's side, one of the commanders who led the resistance, Jose Ramon Fernandez, said in a book about the invasion he co-authored with Fidel Castro that they had incurred in 176 deaths.   ""The invasion of the Bay of Pigs was a tremendously arrogant miscalculation by the CIA"", Kornbluh says. The intelligence agency's leaders were convinced that Castro's revolution was unpopular and that all that was needed was a military invasion by opponents to spark a popular uprising against him. ""But the truth was that Castro was very popular in that area. He had given them electricity and agricultural aid. The CIA started from false and poor premises to carry out the invasion. Also, it was not that difficult to imagine that tens of thousands of Cuban soldiers would quickly defeat 1,400 invaders"", Kornbluh argues. Some 1,100 men of the 2506 Brigade were captured and sent to prisons in Havana. Humberto López Saldaña tells BBC Mundo what he experienced after being captured: Before they sent us to prison, Che Guevara arrived. He asked us what we used to do for a living before leaving Cuba. He seemed very calm, but I always thought that at any moment he could shoot me. They moved us in several lorries. One of them was too crowded. It was sealed hermetically. Nine of my colleagues died inside that vehicle. My lorry had its windows open. While we were being moved, people shouted at us in the street: ""Mercenaries! Sell-outs! We will execute you!"" Later, in Havana, we were locked up in the Castillo del Principe prison. We were not treated well.  Some prison cells were over-crowded and you had to sleep on the floor Getting cigarettes was very difficult. Some prisoners resorted to smoking orange peelings. When we were taken out to walk on the courtyard, a guard would poke us with a bayonet if we did not keep up the pace. We were around 150 detainees in every prison corridor, but we only had one toilet for all of us. We were given a cup of coffee that in reality was dirty water. Many times they would spit on it before handing the cup to us. The bread we were given was hard as a rock. They would throw it to the ground. You had to dip it in water to be able to chew it. Food was very scarce.  López de la Cruz spent three months in solitary confinement because he tried to escape and was designated a dangerous prisoner. Because of that, he was sent in the very last plane that took prisoners back to Miami. It was Christmas 1962. Kennedy had sent a famous lawyer to negotiate with Castro. His name was James B Donovan, who in February 1962 had already facilitated a prisoner exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union. He went to Havana for the first time on 30 August 1962. On the next day he met with the Cuban leader for four hours. During the following months, Donovan held several talks with Castro. Negotiations were approached as a process of ""indemnification"", rather than as a humanitarian exchange, ""something which Castro demanded from the beginning, because he wanted Cuba to be compensated for the expenses of the invasion"", Kornbluh explains. Months before their release, the prisoners had faced a public trial for treason. Many believed they would end up facing a firing squad, but they were sentenced to 30 years in prison. The court also established that a sum that totalled $62 million US dollars would need to be paid to secure their release. By the end of December 1962, Donovan agreed with Castro the release of the prisoners in exchange for $53 million US dollars in medicines and food to be distributed among the Cuban people.   As the provisions began arriving in Cuba on 23 December, the first flights from Pan American airlines started to take the prisoners to Miami, where they were met by a welcoming crowd of 10,000 people at the Dinner Key auditorium. In the meantime, Cuba celebrated the ""second victory at Giron beach"", as they described having won ""the battle for indemnification"". Lopez de la Cruz remembers being on the last Pan American flight, looking out of the airplane window and thinking that it would be very difficult to return to his country.  ""People say that they exchanged us for cans of baby food, but we did not feel humiliated. Because of our release, Cuba received a lot of clothing, food and medications that the government distributed there"", Lopez Saldaña said. Neither of the two exiles has ever been back to Cuba.   Jorge Ortega, former Cuban combatant, tells BBC Mundo: Would I be able one day to sit with one of them and have a drink together? I think it would be very difficult, because of all my comrades who fell or ended up mutilated.  To talk, yes. Cuba is always open to dialogue. But there must be equality of conditions. While there is still a [US trade] embargo, this cannot be. The people of the Brigade are mercenaries because they sold themselves to a country that hired them. They will always be enemies of ours. They have never stopped being so. To this day, from Miami, they influence and try to decide, supporting this [US] blockade against our Fatherland.  It is true that [former US President Barack] Obama was in Cuba some time ago and he called for dialogue. But he also called to forget history. History is never forgotten. We always have it present.     The invasion of the Bay of Pigs is seen in Cuba as an aggression by traitors who sold out to the US. Every 19 April there is a celebration with military parades, commemorating what the Cuban government calls the ""first defeat of imperialism in Latin America"". Ninety miles away, however, the feeling is very different. Nostalgia about what could have been runs through the streets of Miami. Monuments, museums and parks commemorate the heroes of 2506 Brigade. Today, 60 years later, the survivors don't like to talk about how many Cubans from the other side they killed during the invasion. ""The truth is that I would rather not say. We knew we were going to war, but nobody will ever tell you that we enjoyed killing people. Deep down, we were all brothers"", Lopez de la Cruz says. ""You go to kill or be killed. Today it seems different. It is true that we were all Cubans. But at that moment we only thought of liberating Cuba from all the horror that was happening"", Lopez Saldaña insists. The veterans of the Brigade still dream about seeing the fall of the Cuban government in their lifetime. There are two US presidents whom they find difficult to forgive: Kennedy and Obama. ""Kennedy was not up to it. It was an act of stupidity. Although he wanted to protect the US, it was easy to see that they were involved. Years later, I understand his decision, but the truth is that many people feel betrayed and disappointed for what he did"", Lopez de la Cruz tells BBC Mundo. The veterans are even more critical of Obama. ""He wanted to ingratiate himself with the Castro regime and negotiate, but he was naïve. Cuba opened the doors without changing anything. It was a disastrous policy"", Lopez Saldaña insists. A substantial part of the Cuban exile community in Florida still supports a hard-line policy against the island. They venerate the former brigade members as heroes in exile. ""We have a tremendous satisfaction. We fulfilled our duty even though we did not reach our objective. Here in Miami people respect us a lot. Donald Trump himself met with us several times. In fact, in September 2020 he invited us to the White House. We are very proud"", López Saldaña remarks.

liquidity conditions,What's behind the rise of Asia's stock markets,2024-09-15,2017-10-26,By Virginia Harrison,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41651086,"Memory chips and China's economic muscle are among the factors that have put a rocket under Asian stocks this year, pushing markets to record or multi-year highs.  ""Everyone hated Asia markets for a long time,"" says Josh Crabb, head of Asian equities at Old Mutual Global Investors. ""Now we've moved on from there"".  Moved on indeed: South Korea's Kospi sits at a record; Japan's Nikkei 225 index is above a two-decade high; Hong Kong's Hang Seng is around a 10-year peak, while markets in India, Taiwan and Indonesia are among the others scaling fresh heights.  It's an unusual moment for equities in the region as strong corporate profits, economic stimulus and growth are overshadowing nearby political risks. ""Markets seem impervious to events,"" says CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy. ""Sabre-rattling from North Korea barely makes a dent"".  And some analysts argue that as long as US markets keep their cool, there's plenty of good times for investors in Asia still to come. Since the 2009 crash, global markets have been moving steadily higher - with a few stumbles en route.  Massive liquidity coupled with ultra-low interest rates has created a fertile environment for stocks to thrive. Asia has enjoyed a tailwind from record gains on Wall Street. At the same time, China's economy - aiming for 6.5% growth this year - has been  underpinning the broader region for some time.  The world's second largest economy has a big impact on the fortunes of other countries, even as its growth rate moderates. Take South Korea: It's seen double-digit export growth for the last 11 months, thanks largely to China, which buys about one-quarter of its products sold offshore.  ""China's improving economic conditions can really be seen as a trigger for the equity run in Asia,"" says IG Markets analyst Jingyi Pan.  Japan's economy is also gathering steam.  Exports are climbing and strong domestic spending on devices like cameras and computers from China is driving growth.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's re-election, and the likely continuation of his Abenomics policies, was met with cheers from investors.  Ed Rogers, chief executive of Rogers Investment Advisors in Japan believes the benchmark Nikkei index can track even higher.  ""Japan has a long way to go. There's $18tn in cash on the sidelines,"" he says, adding that most of that money is currently invested in low-yielding Japanese government bonds.  ""There's a similar boat load of money that wants to get out of China,"" Mr Rogers says. That money could find plenty of homes in Asia where equities are cheap relative to other parts of the world. Companies in the region are strengthening, and well-received results this earnings season have given markets a boost. For South Korean firms, the outlook is even brighter. CLSA analyst Paul Choi says at the beginning of 2017, people were expecting 10% corporate earnings growth, now that forecast is around 50%.  It's got a lot to do with memory chips. Higher prices for chips used in electronic devices have spurred index heavyweights like Samsung and SK Hynix, as well as the broader market.  In fact, Mr Choi says that fluctuations in the value of memory chips is more threatening to South Korea's market than provocations from its northern neighbour.  Which brings us back to North Korea.  Investors appear largely unshaken by displays of military aggression - missile tests and provocations against Japan - and analysts say markets have factored in the risk. Rogers Investment Advisors Mr Rogers describes the North Korea threat as ""kind of overblown"". That attitude will shift dramatically if threats turn to action. Until then, other risks to the Asian rally loom larger.  Turning off the stimulus tap and the ratcheting up of interest rates will dampen enthusiasm, while analysts point to China's ballooning debt as another threat to the region.  Mr Rogers says political risk and ""unpredictability"" hang over Asian markets and unexpected moves could stunt recent rallies. The threat of the ""unknown"" is a familiar refrain from market-watchers in the region.  ""The most damaging risks are the ones we don't forecast,"" says CMC Markets' Mr McCarthy.  A final recurring note of caution is the rush on Wall Street. Recent gains have been inspired by strong earnings, along with hopes of tax reform and business friendly policies under President Trump. But the chorus of concern about the market's sharp rise is growing on Wall Street. History shows a gradual climb-down from the record highs on US markets is unlikely, and a collapse could shock the world.  ""If the US blows up, most things will come off. [Asia] won't be immune,"" says Josh Crabb of Old Mutual Global Investors.   ""Markets tend to get euphoric and then they get fearful. Theoretically you shouldn't have boom and bust, but human behaviour drives stock markets more than logic."""
liquidity conditions,"Steel sector needs help in days not weeks, MP says",2024-09-15,2020-06-21,By Ione Wells,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-53119158,"There can be no post-pandemic economic recovery without a strong and healthy steel industry, according to Labour MP Stephen Kinnock. Opposition MPs are calling on the UK government to provide loans to steel firms experiencing a sudden drop in demand due to coronavirus. It said it was ""committed to supporting the sector's economic recovery"". Aberavon MP Mr Kinnock told BBC Politics Wales support was needed in ""days not weeks"" to help the industry. In May, 10 Welsh MPs wrote to the chancellor asking for extra support for the sector during the pandemic. As shops start reopening, and pressure builds on the government to outline its plans for the UK's economic recovery, big questions still remain about the part steel will play in the country's economic bounce back. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Newport East Labour MP Jessica Morden told Boris Johnson: ""Plants like Tata's Llanwern and the Orb steel works - the only electrical steel plant in the UK - can play a key part in that recovery, but three months into this crisis and steel companies are still waiting for government liquidity support which is critical.  ""Will the prime minister commit to address this now?"" Mr Johnson said ministers would do ""everything they can"" to maintain UK steel production, but no bailout has been promised yet. Mr Kinnock said steel was the ""backbone of our manufacturing sector"". ""Nothing, really, can work in this country in terms of the manufacturing sector without steel,"" he said. ""Steel is in the offices we work in, the cars that we drive, the trains that we ride, even the cutlery that we eat our food with."" Demand for steel has dropped massively during the coronavirus crisis, especially with industries like car manufacturing grinding to a halt.  Before the pandemic, Tata Steel had suffered £371m in pre-tax losses last year and there was continuing uncertainty for the wider industry because of Brexit.  There have been reports the UK government may consider so-called ""last resort"" loans for viable companies, if their failure would disproportionately harm the economy.  But ministers will want some certainty any loans will be paid back to ""protect"" the taxpayer. Mr Kinnock said he believed loans to steel firms would be returned and he has urged the government to consider the costs to the taxpayer of not stepping in to support them. ""We are urging the government to support the industry now and also think about the cost of doing nothing,"" he said.  ""There are 4,000 relatively well paid men and women working in the Port Talbot steel works, thousands more relatively well paid jobs in the steel industry across the country. ""Imagine the cost of losing those jobs.  ""Imagine the cost of decommissioning a steelworks with blast furnaces and the vast cost that would cause the government. ""So we are saying to the government - give the temporary loan. ""It is a loan that will be paid back in order to avoid the massive cost of doing nothing."" Steel industry analyst Dr Kathryn Ringwald-Wildman said the pandemic has hit firms at an already tough time. ""We've got uncertainty building on uncertainty,"" she said. ""The position of the steel industries is quite desperate at the moment and they will need government support to survive.  ""They would've needed government support without the pandemic. ""If they are to weather this particular storm they will need support. ""The question is: this is taxpayer's money. Is this a bridge over the pandemic crisis or is it a bridge over the pandemic crisis only to find the economic situation post-pandemic is much more serious globally than we might imagine?"" Beyond questions around the cost of recovery, with Tata Steel reportedly needing at least £500m through the pandemic, government decisions to support steel or not are inherently political - with the effect on areas like Port Talbot hanging in the mix. ""You take the steel industry out of Port Talbot you have got nothing. You haven't got anything to take its place,"" said Dr Ringwald-Wildman. ""The decision that's made now will resonate for many years.  ""It may be that the politicians will decide to defer the decision to end steel manufacturing in the UK - let the companies sink or swim.  ""They might choose to defer that because of the consequences down the line. ""It would take a very brave government to say we don't need a steel industry in the UK.  ""The emphasis has been, in conversations around the edge of the Brexit decision, we will make our own steel, use our own steel, buy our own steel. ""We will, of course, be trading on the international market.  ""But the notion that our domestic steel industry would be one of our major suppliers to our manufacturing industry was fundamental."" A spokesperson for Tata Steel, which has furloughed about 2,400 staff across UK sites, said: ""The ultimate impact of coronavirus has been the sudden drop in demand for steel.  ""But it is a storm that we are weathering, and we're looking to come out of the other side. ""We are in negotiations with both UK and Welsh governments to seek all available support that we can."" A UK government spokesperson said it has ""engaged with businesses across the economy, and has already increased the scope and scale of many of our support schemes, including loans to steel companies with a turnover of over £45m"". ""We recognise that economic conditions continue to be challenging and we are committed to supporting the sector's economic recovery."""
liquidity conditions,Why do people experience phantom rectum?,2024-09-15,2018-12-06,By Emma Tracey & Beth Rose,https://www.bbc.com/news/disability-46426300,"There's nothing about sex and relationships that author and YouTuber Hannah Witton will shy away from talking about - including little-discussed topics such as disability and sex. She's frank, informed, funny and focused on breaking down taboos.  Then there's the Little Mix video. Recently, the 26-year-old - who earlier this year underwent emergency surgery to have her colon removed and a stoma created - featured in the band's music video for the song Strip.  The stoma - an opening in the tummy - means Hannah lives with an ileostomy bag she calls Mona. She has blogged about her journey to ""love her new body"", including publishing a mini-documentary about an underwear photo-shoot in which her stoma and her scars are on display.  Here, and for the Ouch podcast, she ""shoots the breeze about pooing into a bag"" with two more experienced stoma users - BBC presenter Sam Cleasby, who runs the So Bad Ass website, and Blake Beckford who is ""most well known for having a stoma and a sixpack"".  Thousands of people in the UK are living with a stoma bag, having undergone surgery for a number of conditions, including bowel cancer, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.  Here's everything you didn't know you wanted to know about living with an ileostomy bag - warning, topics include phantom rectums, Barbie butts and sex.  What on earth's an ileostomy bag?  An ileostomy is an operation involving the small intestine being diverted through an opening - or stoma - in the abdomen. A bag is then placed over the stoma to collect liquid and waste, which is emptied into the toilet. According to Hannah, the stoma looks ""red, squishy and moist. It has no nerve endings, you can't really feel it if you touch it, and poo comes out of it."" All three had theirs fitted due to ulcerative colitis  - where the colon and rectum become inflamed and ulcers develop on the colon's lining. ""I often forget that I have one until I go to the toilet,"" says Hannah. ""The only time I feel it, is if there is any kind of gas. Then the bags get a little bit crunchy, or if my output is kind of liquidy, then it gets a bit sloshy.""  Is it high maintenance? ""At first it's all consuming,"" says Sam. ""You have to learn this whole process of how you look after it, how you change it, how you empty it. Now it is totally just part of my daily routine - I have a shower, change my bag.""  All three say they also have to get up in the middle of the night to empty their bags to prevent leakage. Can you eat normally? ""My family is Indian,"" says Sam. ""When I was in hospital a nurse told me: 'You'll never be able to eat curry again.' I was ready to rip out the drips in my arms. She was wrong. You have to just try different foods and now there's pretty much nothing that I wouldn't eat.""  She says, though, that the first time she ate beetroot, after the surgery, she was horrified: ""I thought I was haemorrhaging from the inside out."" Having a stoma means food isn't digested as well as someone with a fully-functioning system.  Hannah finds it ""fascinating and disgusting"" to watch food emerge and likes to ""pull out long bits of mushroom"". Sam, meanwhile, looks out for whole peas in her bag, and pops them while they're in the pouch.  Is it smelly? Hannah says the output - or poo - smells once it's out of the bag, for example while it's being emptied. In the bag, however, she says you won't smell a thing.   ""If you smell a fart, it is 100% not me because there are filters. So whoever's got a functioning butthole, it was them."" One thing that does smell a bit fishy when it comes out of the bag is, well, fish. But Sam has a top tip - add a drop of minty mouthwash to the pouch which neutralises the fish so you won't smell a thing. Hannah likes to talk about sex, so, does that mean you can still do it if you've had your plumbing re-routed? ""Hell yeah,"" says Sam. ""You can't take your bag off during sex - you'd let all your output out,"" adds Hannah. ""For me it was more the mental barriers like body confidence, feeling insecure and overcoming those. From a physical sense it doesn't really affect anything other than a bag flapping around."" But it's not so straightforward for everyone. ""I've got a gay male friend who has a stoma and has the Barbie butt - when you have your rectum and anus removed and they sew everything up, down below. That changed his sex life,"" says Sam. Hannah still has a rectum, but says she doesn't think there's enough information out there. ""I've no idea how long it is, how fragile it is. Because anal play is not just a gay thing, it's for everyone, so I don't know what I can do with my butt."" While we're there, what's a phantom rectum? ""People who have lost a limb, still feel pain or itching or they feel like their limb's still there,"" says Sam. ""So that's the same but in your rectum. It's like your brain doesn't know that it's not attached anymore."" Hannah adds: ""At the beginning I got it all the time. I was talking to my nurse about these urges that I need to poo. She said: 'Next time just go sit on the toilet and feel it out.'"" Sounds peculiar, what's the cringiest moment you've had? For Sam, it was earlier this year in San Francisco. She felt the skin around her stoma start to burn - a sure sign that it's leaking. She found a supermarket with toilets and dashed inside. ""There was a massive queue and by the time I got there it was everywhere - from my boobs to my knees,"" she says. ""I ended up having to throw away my leggings and T-shirt and had to come out of the toilet in just a bra and dungaree dress crying and walk slowly past this queue of people.  ""There are times where it just feels quite devastating to have an accident in public, but I can laugh about it now."" Hannah says she has a Can't Wait Card from Crohn's and Colitis UK which she can flash in cafes or shops so she can use their facilities without having to give a long explanation.  Are stomas always so troublesome?  ""It's given me my life back,"" says Blake, ""because living with ulcerative colitis was just dreadful. You feel a lot of pain and sickness. I'd get to a point where I wouldn't leave the house for the sake of having an accident.""  For Hannah, it wasn't so liberating.  She was diagnosed at the age of seven and had a lot of difficulty with inflammation. But between the ages of 15 and 25 she went into remission. This changed last year.  ""This flare up just came out of the blue and completely wiped me out. I was in hospital for a month and had to have emergency surgery.  ""I don't feel like getting a stoma gave me my life back. I want to go back to my life before all of this. But having said that, I'm not ashamed of it."" Crohn's and Colitis Awareness  Week runs until 7 December.

liquidity conditions,Rooney welcomes Kirchner's Derby interest,2024-09-15,2021-10-26,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59048184,"Wayne Rooney is trying to stave off the threat of relegation following Derby's points deduction - but they have appealed against the decision Derby County manager Wayne Rooney has welcomed US businessman Chris Kirchner's declaration of interest in taking over the club. Kirchner, 34, is the co-founder of global logistics company Slync.io and confirmed his intention to buy the Rams in an open letter to supporters. The Championship club have been in administration since 22 September. ""He was at the game last week. I spent a bit of time with him. He's got some really good ideas,"" said Rooney. The former England forward said Kirchner's letter was a ""real show of intent"" and told BBC Radio Derby: ""He is a very good businessman and I am sure he wouldn't be putting his name to a public statement if he didn't mean what he is trying to do at the club."" Administrators Quantuma have said they want to identify three preferred bidders by the end of the year. Chris Kirchner is chief executive of Dallas-based shipping and logistics company Slync.io Former Derby owner Andy Appleby is believed to have registered an interest, but last month Quantuma said they had not been approached by Mike Ashley, who recently sold Newcastle United. Kirchner is the first person to go public over plans to buy the Rams. A graduate of the University of Kentucky, now based in Texas, he posted in a Twitter thread:, external ""I'm not a billionaire... not sure this matters. However I've done well enough to acquire and fund a club.  ""The administrators are very diligent and required a minimum of £100m in proof of liquidity to even get to the point I am at in the process. ""As things go with this process, I will continue to share as I am legally able to while being respectful of the EFL and the administrators. They are both doing a wonderful job, care about the future of the club and will not let anything like some of the past public debacles happen again."" Quantuma confirmed they have received a ""fully funded"" and ""credible"" offer from Kirchner, but one which has ""a number of related conditions"" which must be considered. ""As we have said previously, it is the responsibility of the joint administrators to ensure any preferred bidder is able to submit an offer for the club which both maximises the positions of the creditors to the club and secures the long-term future of this historic club,"" joint administrator Andrew Hosking said in a statement. ""We also have to ensure the EFL is satisfied the prospective purchaser will pass their own tests and also the terms of the offer are justifiable to the various stakeholders impacted by the administration.""  Graeme Shinnie's goal enabled Derby to draw 1-1 at Coventry City on Saturday Kirchner has said he is ""impressed with the attitude of manager Wayne Rooney"", the rest of the coaching staff and players, and he plans to be there when they face Blackburn Rovers at Pride Park on Saturday. In his letter, he said: ""While the club is currently going through a really tough time, it is the supporters, and everyone associated with the club that have stayed loyal which provide the foundation to rebuild again. ""This challenge is one I don't take lightly but is something I am looking forward to - and I know we can prove successful at - if we work together. ""I want to be a part of that rebuild and support that effort. As an entrepreneur I am committed to building companies and I want to apply that experience towards rebuilding this proud and storied club."" He continued: ""At this point in time, the administration process is complex, but I have informed the administrators that I'm willing to work through these complexities. ""I understand and acknowledge that there are a number of interested parties in the club, but I wanted to go on the record at the start of the process and be up front."" Derby, who have not played in the Premier League since 2008, were deducted 12 points for going into administration but claim it was caused by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and have appealed against the sanction.  Owner Mel Morris agreed sales to Abu Dhabi-based group Bin Zayed International (BZI) and Spanish businessman Erik Alonso earlier this year but both deals collapsed. Kirchner's letter concluded: ""The best stories in life often start after a setback and the best years of Derby County FC are without a doubt in front of us.  ""Hopefully, we will have the chance to be better than ever before and together write our own chapters in the illustrious history of DCFC! Up the Rams!"" Administrators Quantuma are hopeful that a buyer will be found for Derby County Former Rams defender Charlie Palmer told BBC Radio Derby's Sportscene that Kirchner's intentions ""seem correct"". But he said a lot of discussions would have to take place before any would-be buyer could conclude a deal. ""They need to get to the nitty-gritty, find out what all the issues are to make sure they can address and resolve those problems. Hopefully they can put in the money required, pay off the debts and start taking this club further up the league,"" Palmer added. ""Wayne is doing a great job with his hands tied. It's going to be interesting when money does become available, with his contacts and the way he wants the game to be played, (whether) he will be able to bring in the players which could take this club to the next level.  ""I'm hoping when the right person comes in, they can give him the support and the financial clout to take this club forward because he deserves that opportunity.""  BBC Radio Derby's Chris Coles Just to see communication from Chris Kirchner already puts him ahead of the likes of BZI and Sheikh Khaled. That saga went on for a long, long time and there was lots of excitement about what they could bring to the table. He's said all the right things. If you make sure you're very complimentary about the club you're buying and you throw in something like 'Up The Rams' at the end then you get lots of people onside. Quantuma have already shown they are only willing to enter into dialogue with those who are deadly serious and hence they have demanded, not just from Chris Kirchner, but from other interested parties, proof of funds and evidence of the cash required to take Derby out of this position. Despite it feeling different, it is still very early stages so fans will be optimistic, but wary, after what's happened before.

liquidity conditions,University given £1m bailout from watchdog,2024-09-15,2018-11-16,By Sean Coughlan,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-46223219,"A UK university had to be given an emergency loan of almost £1m by the higher education watchdog to stay afloat this autumn. It's been discovered that the Office for Students provided the bailout when the university faced the prospect of running out of cash and being unable to pay its bills. The money has been repaid - and the regulator says the university, a small, modern institution, is now financially stable. But it highlights the fragility of university finances, which are now in a ""marketplace"" and vulnerable to fluctuations in recruitment and tuition fee income. The discovery of this payment is also embarrassing for the Office for Students (OFS), which recently sent out a tough message that there would be no bailouts for universities in financial difficulty. Sir Michael Barber, who chairs the regulator, told a conference a couple of weeks ago that it was wrong for university leaders to think the OFS would would help them if they were in ""financial trouble"" because of a lack of student numbers or overspending on buildings. ""This is wrong. The OFS will not bail out providers in financial difficulty,"" Sir Michael said. The watchdog says the bailout it did provide, made to the university in September and understood to be about £900,000, was under the rules of its predecessor organisation, the Higher Education Funding Council for England, under transition arrangements. It followed a cash problem faced by the university over the summer. But a spokesman for the OFS said that under its own new rules, now in place, such financial support would no longer be permissible. The debate about bailouts followed reports from Richard Vaughan in the I newspaper that three universities were on the ""brink of bankruptcy"". It raised the question of whether universities, in what has been designed as a competitive marketplace, should be allowed to go bust and close down. That the watchdog was ready to act behind the scenes shows how difficult it would be to really allow a university to go under. It would mean huge disruption for students and would mean the loss of what are often among the biggest local employers and drivers of local economies. It could also put the watchdog and universities minister into a very compromised position if they let a university collapse. They would be asked how they allowed people to apply to a university they knew to be at financial risk. If students are getting into £50,000 of debt from a degree course, the Office for Students, acting in the consumer interest, would be expected to warn students not to step aboard a university that was not financially watertight. But if they, or university ministers, did warn that a university was in financial trouble, it would be likely to destroy the student numbers on which universities rely for their income - making it even harder for a university to dig itself out of danger. The OFS says that its new provisions will make the university sector more financially robust. As a condition of registering with the OFS, the regulator will have to be confident that universities are financially secure for at least the next three years. A spokesman for the OFS said the institution to which it lent money could now pass this financial test and show it was ""not at material risk of insolvency for the next three years"". ""Over the summer, we provided a short-term liquidity loan to the university, which was quickly repaid in full and repaid before registration,"" the OFS spokesman said.  He said it was paid under ""inherited legal responsibilities which will cease to apply at the end of this transition year in July 2019"". ""We have been very clear that we would not bail out any university. But we have also said that where a university is in trouble, we would first ensure that they have a strong student protection plan and secondly we would act according to the circumstances. ""This could for example involve requiring them to carry out a strategic options review to identify future options including restructuring their business model, sale of property or mergers."" It will also raise questions for the current review of university funding in England. There have been suggestions that the headline figure for tuition fees could be reduced to £6,500 from £9,250. Although this would mean less cash going directly to universities, it would mean that more of university budgets could be distributed centrally, making them less vulnerable to annual changes in student numbers."

liquidity conditions,Trump releases long-awaited Middle-East peace plan,2024-09-15,2020-01-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51288218,"US President Donald Trump has presented his long-awaited Middle East peace plan, promising to keep Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital. He proposed an independent Palestinian state and the recognition of Israeli sovereignty over West Bank settlements. Standing alongside Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, Mr Trump said his proposals ""could be the last opportunity"" for Palestinians. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas dismissed the plans as a ""conspiracy"". ""I say to Trump and Netanyahu: Jerusalem is not for sale, all our rights are not for sale and are not for bargain. And your deal, the conspiracy, will not pass,"" he said in a televised address from Ramallah in the West Bank. The blueprint, which aims to solve one of the world's longest-running conflicts, was drafted under the stewardship of President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Thousands of Palestinians protested in the Gaza Strip earlier on Tuesday, while the Israeli military deployed reinforcements in the occupied West Bank. The joint announcement came as both Mr Trump and Mr Netanyahu faced political challenges at home. Mr Trump is the subject of an impeachment trial in the US Senate while the Israeli PM on Tuesday dropped his bid for immunity on corruption charges. Both men deny any wrongdoing. David Friedman, the US ambassador to Israel, said that the timing of the announcement was not tied to any political development, adding it had been ""fully baked"" for some time.  Meanwhile, reports said Mr Netanyahu was planning to press ahead with annexing 30% of the occupied West Bank, with a cabinet vote due on Sunday. More than 400,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements. Those settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Mr Friedman said Israel did ""not have to wait at all"" to move ahead with annexation.  ""Today, Israel takes a big step towards peace,"" Mr Trump told officials and reporters at the White House. ""My vision presents a win-win opportunity for both sides, a realistic two-state solution that resolves the risk of Palestinian statehood to Israel's security."" His proposals are: ""Palestinians are in poverty and violence, exploited by those seeking to use them as pawns to advance terrorism and extremism. They deserve a far better life,"" Mr Trump said. He also indicated that the West Bank would not be cut in half under the plan. ""We will also work to create a contiguous territory within the future Palestinian state, for when the conditions for statehood are met, including the firm rejection of terrorism,"" he said. Israeli officials said Mr Netanyahu would fly to Moscow on Wednesday to discuss the proposals with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Until now all of the most difficult aspects of an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal - the so-called final status issues - like borders; the future of Israeli settlements in the West Bank; the long-term status of Jerusalem; and the fate of Palestinian refugees, were to be left for face-to-face talks between the Israelis and Palestinians themselves.  Not any longer. The deal proposed by President Trump and enthusiastically endorsed by Prime Minister Netanyahu essentially frames all of these issues in Israel's favour.  The Palestinians were not just absent from this meeting - they have boycotted the Trump administration ever since it unilaterally moved its embassy to Jerusalem. But they have essentially been presented with an ultimatum - accept the Trump parameters or else, and they have been given some four years to come around.  While President Trump is offering the Palestinians a state it would be a much truncated one. No Jewish settlers will be uprooted and Israeli sovereignty will apparently be extended to the settlement blocs and the Jordan Valley. The Palestinians might have a capital in the East Jerusalem suburbs.  This ""take it or leave it offer"" will appal many long-standing students of the region. The question now is not so much what benefit this deal might bring but how much damage it may do by over-turning Palestinian aspirations. In his address, President Abbas said it was ""impossible for any Palestinian, Arab, Muslim or Christian child to accept"" a Palestinian state without Jerusalem as its capital. ""We say a thousand times, no, no, no,"" he said. ""We rejected this deal from the start and our stance was correct."" The militant Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, also rejected the deal which it said aimed ""to liquidate the Palestinian national project"". The UN said it remained committed to a two-state solution based on the borders in place before the 1967 war, when Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza. A spokesman for Secretary General António Guterres said the UN wanted a peace deal on the basis of UN resolutions, international law and bilateral agreements. Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said the proposals envisaged a form of apartheid. It said Palestinians would be relegated ""to small, enclosed, isolated enclaves, with no control over their lives"". Israel's Peace Now organisation said the plan was ""as detached from reality as it is eye-catching"".  ""The plan's green light for Israel to annex the settlements in exchange for a perforated Palestinian state is unviable and would not bring stability,"" it said. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged the Palestinians to give the plans ""genuine and fair consideration and explore whether they might prove a first step on the road back to negotiations"". The Palestinians broke off contacts with the Trump administration in December 2017, after Mr Trump decided to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the US embassy to the city from Tel Aviv.  Since then, the US has ended both bilateral aid for Palestinians and contributions for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). And in November, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US had abandoned its four-decades-old position that Jewish settlements in the West Bank were inconsistent with international law. The Arab League will convene an urgent meeting on Saturday. Of all the conflicts in the Middle East, that between Israel and the Palestinians has been the most intractable. Although the two sides signed a breakthrough peace accord in 1993, more than a quarter of a century on the two sides are arguably as far apart as ever. Jerusalem: Both Israel and the Palestinians hold competing claims to the city. Israel, which occupied the formerly Jordanian-held eastern part in 1967, regards the whole of Jerusalem as its capital. The Palestinians insist on East Jerusalem - home to about 350,000 of their community - as the capital of a hoped-for independent state. Palestinian statehood: The Palestinians want an independent state of their own, comprising the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. Israeli prime ministers have publicly accepted the notion of a Palestinian state alongside Israel but not what form it should take. Benjamin Netanyahu has said any Palestinian state should be demilitarised with the powers to govern itself but not to threaten Israel. Recognition: Israel insists that any peace deal must include Palestinian recognition of it as the ""nation-state of the Jewish people"", arguing that without this Palestinians will continue to press their own national claims to the land, causing the conflict to endure. The Palestinians says what Israel calls itself is its own business, but to recognise it as the Jewish state will discriminate against Israel's Arab population of Palestinian origin, who are Muslims, Christians and Druze. Borders: Both sides have fundamentally different ideas as to where the boundaries of a potential Palestinian state should be. The Palestinians insist on borders based on ceasefire lines which separated Israel and East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza between 1949 and 1967. Israel says those lines are militarily indefensible and were never intended to be permanent. It has not said where borders should be, other than making clear its own eastern border should be along the Jordan River. Settlements: Since 1967, Israel has built about 140 settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as 121 outposts - settlements built without the government's authorisation. They have become home to some 600,000 Israeli Jews. Settlements are considered illegal by most of the international community, though Israel disputes this. Palestinians say all settlements must be removed for a Palestinian state to be viable. Mr Netanyahu has vowed not only to never to uproot any settlements but to bring them under Israeli sovereignty. Refugees: The UN says its agencies support about 5.5 million Palestinian refugees in the Middle East (the Palestinian Authority says there are up to 6 million), including the descendants of people who fled or were expelled by Jewish forces from what became Israel in the 1948-49 war. Palestinians insist on their right to return to their former homes, but Israel says they are not entitled to, noting that such a move would overwhelm it demographically and lead to its end as a Jewish state. * entries are selective and abridged"
liquidity conditions,British Steel in talks to avert collapse,2024-09-15,2019-05-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48303436,"Talks to avert the collapse of British Steel will resume later on Friday after the firm secured funds to stay afloat until the end of May. Sources close to owners Greybull Capital say its future will be discussed at ""ministerial level"".  British Steel has admitted it needs further financial support from the government to help it address ""Brexit-related issues"". One possibility is a £75m government lifeline to the company.  Otherwise, ministers can decide to nationalise the firm or see it fall into administration.  On Thursday, British Steel said it had the backing of shareholders and lenders and that operations continued as usual while it sought a ""permanent solution"" to its financial troubles.  A spokeswoman said: ""As the business navigates the significant uncertainties caused by Brexit, and explores options to strengthen the business for the long term, we are pleased to confirm that we have the required liquidity while we work towards a permanent solution.""  British Steel is the UK's second largest steel firm, employing 4,500 people and about 20,000‎ indirectly via its supply chain. In April, the firm was forced to borrow £100m from the government to pay an EU carbon bill, so it could avoid a steep fine. However, concerns about its future were raised this week after Sky News reported that insolvency experts had been lined up in case the firm could not secure further government funding. It is understood that along with administration, nationalisation or a management buyout are being discussed as fall-back options for the company. British Steel's troubles have been linked to a slump in orders from European customers ‎due to uncertainty over the Brexit process. The firm has also been struggling with the weakness of the pound since the EU referendum in June 2016 and the escalating trade US-China trade war. Greybull Capital, a private equity firm, rescued Tata Steel's long products business during the depths of the steel crisis in 2016, saving more than 4,000 jobs. It has since rebranded the company as British Steel and recently returned it to profit. The concerns come days after Tata signalled its planned merger with German rival Thyssenkrupp was off, raising fresh doubts about its Port Talbot site. Tata, which admitted it is facing tough operating conditions in the UK, promised to keep its UK plants running, but only if they could be profitable. "
liquidity conditions,Why do people experience phantom rectum?,2024-09-15,2018-12-06,By Emma Tracey & Beth Rose,https://www.bbc.com/news/disability-46426300,"There's nothing about sex and relationships that author and YouTuber Hannah Witton will shy away from talking about - including little-discussed topics such as disability and sex. She's frank, informed, funny and focused on breaking down taboos.  Then there's the Little Mix video. Recently, the 26-year-old - who earlier this year underwent emergency surgery to have her colon removed and a stoma created - featured in the band's music video for the song Strip.  The stoma - an opening in the tummy - means Hannah lives with an ileostomy bag she calls Mona. She has blogged about her journey to ""love her new body"", including publishing a mini-documentary about an underwear photo-shoot in which her stoma and her scars are on display.  Here, and for the Ouch podcast, she ""shoots the breeze about pooing into a bag"" with two more experienced stoma users - BBC presenter Sam Cleasby, who runs the So Bad Ass website, and Blake Beckford who is ""most well known for having a stoma and a sixpack"".  Thousands of people in the UK are living with a stoma bag, having undergone surgery for a number of conditions, including bowel cancer, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.  Here's everything you didn't know you wanted to know about living with an ileostomy bag - warning, topics include phantom rectums, Barbie butts and sex.  What on earth's an ileostomy bag?  An ileostomy is an operation involving the small intestine being diverted through an opening - or stoma - in the abdomen. A bag is then placed over the stoma to collect liquid and waste, which is emptied into the toilet. According to Hannah, the stoma looks ""red, squishy and moist. It has no nerve endings, you can't really feel it if you touch it, and poo comes out of it."" All three had theirs fitted due to ulcerative colitis  - where the colon and rectum become inflamed and ulcers develop on the colon's lining. ""I often forget that I have one until I go to the toilet,"" says Hannah. ""The only time I feel it, is if there is any kind of gas. Then the bags get a little bit crunchy, or if my output is kind of liquidy, then it gets a bit sloshy.""  Is it high maintenance? ""At first it's all consuming,"" says Sam. ""You have to learn this whole process of how you look after it, how you change it, how you empty it. Now it is totally just part of my daily routine - I have a shower, change my bag.""  All three say they also have to get up in the middle of the night to empty their bags to prevent leakage. Can you eat normally? ""My family is Indian,"" says Sam. ""When I was in hospital a nurse told me: 'You'll never be able to eat curry again.' I was ready to rip out the drips in my arms. She was wrong. You have to just try different foods and now there's pretty much nothing that I wouldn't eat.""  She says, though, that the first time she ate beetroot, after the surgery, she was horrified: ""I thought I was haemorrhaging from the inside out."" Having a stoma means food isn't digested as well as someone with a fully-functioning system.  Hannah finds it ""fascinating and disgusting"" to watch food emerge and likes to ""pull out long bits of mushroom"". Sam, meanwhile, looks out for whole peas in her bag, and pops them while they're in the pouch.  Is it smelly? Hannah says the output - or poo - smells once it's out of the bag, for example while it's being emptied. In the bag, however, she says you won't smell a thing.   ""If you smell a fart, it is 100% not me because there are filters. So whoever's got a functioning butthole, it was them."" One thing that does smell a bit fishy when it comes out of the bag is, well, fish. But Sam has a top tip - add a drop of minty mouthwash to the pouch which neutralises the fish so you won't smell a thing. Hannah likes to talk about sex, so, does that mean you can still do it if you've had your plumbing re-routed? ""Hell yeah,"" says Sam. ""You can't take your bag off during sex - you'd let all your output out,"" adds Hannah. ""For me it was more the mental barriers like body confidence, feeling insecure and overcoming those. From a physical sense it doesn't really affect anything other than a bag flapping around."" But it's not so straightforward for everyone. ""I've got a gay male friend who has a stoma and has the Barbie butt - when you have your rectum and anus removed and they sew everything up, down below. That changed his sex life,"" says Sam. Hannah still has a rectum, but says she doesn't think there's enough information out there. ""I've no idea how long it is, how fragile it is. Because anal play is not just a gay thing, it's for everyone, so I don't know what I can do with my butt."" While we're there, what's a phantom rectum? ""People who have lost a limb, still feel pain or itching or they feel like their limb's still there,"" says Sam. ""So that's the same but in your rectum. It's like your brain doesn't know that it's not attached anymore."" Hannah adds: ""At the beginning I got it all the time. I was talking to my nurse about these urges that I need to poo. She said: 'Next time just go sit on the toilet and feel it out.'"" Sounds peculiar, what's the cringiest moment you've had? For Sam, it was earlier this year in San Francisco. She felt the skin around her stoma start to burn - a sure sign that it's leaking. She found a supermarket with toilets and dashed inside. ""There was a massive queue and by the time I got there it was everywhere - from my boobs to my knees,"" she says. ""I ended up having to throw away my leggings and T-shirt and had to come out of the toilet in just a bra and dungaree dress crying and walk slowly past this queue of people.  ""There are times where it just feels quite devastating to have an accident in public, but I can laugh about it now.""

liquidity conditions,London transport 'to shut without second bailout',2024-09-15,2020-10-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-54383989,"London's transport network will shut down in a ""doomsday scenario"" without a second bailout, Transport for London (TfL) has warned. The government agreed to a £1.6bn bailout in May, to keep services running after TfL's income fell by 90% during the coronavirus pandemic. The deal is due to expire in two weeks.  TfL bosses say £2bn is needed to run services until December, but a row has broken out between the prime minister and London's mayor over funding. Speaking to BBC London, Boris Johnson said any future deal would be reliant on Sadiq Khan ""taking some steps to show more prudence in how he handles his money"". He said his successor as mayor ""must cut his coat to suit his cloth"". ""I'm sad to say the current mayor of London blew the finances of TfL with an irresponsible fare package,"" he said. ""This government will do what we can to support Londoners and keep the city moving."" In response, a spokeswoman for the Mayor of London described this comment as ""extraordinarily disingenuous"".  ""The sole cause of TfL's current financial difficulties is this virus - which has led to huge financial losses for public transport authorities around the world as passenger numbers have collapsed,"" she said. The spokeswoman added before the pandemic, Mr Khan had reduced TfL's operating deficit by 71% and that cash reserves had increased by 13%, meaning TfL had more than £2bn in reserves when the pandemic hit.  The government has promised a letter setting out terms for a fresh bailout. TfL Commissioner Andy Byford said finances were ""right on the wire"".  The transport authority wants almost £3bn to stay afloat through 2021, according to the Local Democracy Report Service. Without government cash, the network would be forced to issue a Section 114 order - the equivalent of bankruptcy for a public company.  This ""doomsday scenario"" would mean ""absolute shut down"" with TfL only allowed to run services it had to provide by statute dating back to the 1800s. Due to a 200-year-old law, the Woolwich Ferry - which links Woolwich and North Woolwich - is the only commuter service TfL is legally obliged to run. Buses for children who live more than two miles from school would also continue to run.  TfL would also carry out limited road repairs and license taxis and private hire vehicles.  But the Tube, Overground, rail services, trams and most buses would stop running. As the deadline for a new deal approaches, Mr Byford said he was ""almost begging"" ministers to send their offer so negotiations could start. Mr Byford said: ""London will grind to a halt - it's as simple as that."" London's Deputy Mayor for Transport, Heidi Alexander, said she wanted a ""grown-up discussion"" with ministers.  ""We do run the risk of this becoming less of a negotiation and more of an exchange of information that then just results in an imposition from government of a whole series of conditions,"" she warned. London Mayor Sadiq Khan and his team complained of punitive conditions attached to the first grant at the last minute - including extra borrowing, slashing free travel for older people and under 18s and raising fares next year. TfL's Liquidity Policy means it has to maintain a minimum level of cash reserves of at least 60 days' worth of forecast costs - about £1.2bn - to ensure it has enough cash to meet payment obligations as they become due and provide sufficient headroom to allow it to deal with emergencies.  But Conservative group leader Susan Hall said it was right for ministers to put rules in place when TfL was asking for billions of pounds at taxpayers' expense.  Ms Hall said the network should consider dipping into its £1.2bn reserve.  ""It's a hefty sum of money and I've been told it's used for rainy days,"" she said. ""I would suggest it's pouring at the moment."""
liquidity conditions,TSB suffers £105m loss after computer chaos,2024-09-15,2019-02-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47085474,"TSB's computer meltdown pushed the bank into a £105.4m loss last year, from a £162.7m profit in 2017. The disastrous IT upgrade resulted in £330.2m in costs, to be partly offset by £153m that TSB said it expected to recover from computer provider Sabis. About 80,000 customers switched their bank account away from TSB in 2018 - 30,000 more than 2017 - after some people went weeks without services.  There was also the cost of customer compensation and fraud.  TSB said it had resolved about 90% (181,000) of the 204,000 customer complaints received since the IT chaos. Of the £330m in extra costs, about £125m was for customer compensation and sorting out their problems, £49m was due to fraud and operational losses, £122m for extra help and advice to sort out the IT problems, and £33m in lost income from waived fees and charges. In recognition of the extra work for its employees, the bank said it had awarded staff - excluding executives - £1,500 each in December. No bonuses are being paid to executives for 2018.  Richard Meddings, TSB executive chairman, said in a statement: ""Last year was TSB's most challenging year. But we enter 2019 with renewed ambition to re-emerge as the leading challenger bank in the UK - firmly on the side of the customer."" Analysis: Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter The management of TSB are talking up 2019 and attempting to move on from the IT failure that ruined last year for the bank. It also disrupted weddings and house moves, as well giving fraudsters opportunities to exploit TSB customers. This moment only marks a comma, rather than a full stop, in the saga as three inquiries into the meltdown are still open.  MPs on the Treasury Committee still have an open inquiry. TSB itself commissioned an independent review from lawyers Slaughter and May to detail what went wrong and what lessons need to be learned. The results are expected in the next few weeks. But the most significant of all is an inquiry by the Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, which has powers to issue fines of many millions of pounds. Last summer it was critical of TSB's response to the crisis, but its in-depth investigation - undertaken jointly with the Bank's of England's Prudential Regulation Authority - could take months to complete. TSB, owned by Spanish banking giant Sabadell, was stung by the IT crisis last April that left up to 1.9 million users of its digital and mobile banking locked out of their accounts. The tech troubles were triggered by the movement of customer data from former owner Lloyds' IT system to a new one managed by Sabadell. Chief executive Paul Pester stepped down in the wake of the fiasco. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said at the time that Mr Pester ""set the tone for TSB's complacent and misleading public communications"".  The bank announced his replacement, former CYBG chief operating officer Ms Debbie Crosbie in November. She will join the business in the spring. TSB also said that customer deposits fell by 4.7% to £29.1bn last year, which the bank said was due to planned changes in savings products. Customer lending also decreased by 2.7% to £30bn. Despite customers switching away at the height of the crisis, a total of 140,000 customers opened a new account with TSB. The bank said that economic and market conditions remained uncertain for a number of reasons, including Britain's impending departure from the European Union. But it maintained that it was ""one of the most strongly capitalised banks in the UK and, with a healthy liquidity reserve, is well positioned to weather economic uncertainty or shocks"".  TSB's Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio - a key measure of financial strength - stands at 19.5% and is among the strongest of UK banks."
liquidity conditions,"Steel sector needs help in days not weeks, MP says",2024-09-15,2020-06-21,By Ione Wells,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-53119158,"There can be no post-pandemic economic recovery without a strong and healthy steel industry, according to Labour MP Stephen Kinnock. Opposition MPs are calling on the UK government to provide loans to steel firms experiencing a sudden drop in demand due to coronavirus. It said it was ""committed to supporting the sector's economic recovery"". Aberavon MP Mr Kinnock told BBC Politics Wales support was needed in ""days not weeks"" to help the industry. In May, 10 Welsh MPs wrote to the chancellor asking for extra support for the sector during the pandemic. As shops start reopening, and pressure builds on the government to outline its plans for the UK's economic recovery, big questions still remain about the part steel will play in the country's economic bounce back. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Newport East Labour MP Jessica Morden told Boris Johnson: ""Plants like Tata's Llanwern and the Orb steel works - the only electrical steel plant in the UK - can play a key part in that recovery, but three months into this crisis and steel companies are still waiting for government liquidity support which is critical.  ""Will the prime minister commit to address this now?"" Mr Johnson said ministers would do ""everything they can"" to maintain UK steel production, but no bailout has been promised yet. Mr Kinnock said steel was the ""backbone of our manufacturing sector"". ""Nothing, really, can work in this country in terms of the manufacturing sector without steel,"" he said. ""Steel is in the offices we work in, the cars that we drive, the trains that we ride, even the cutlery that we eat our food with."" Demand for steel has dropped massively during the coronavirus crisis, especially with industries like car manufacturing grinding to a halt.  Before the pandemic, Tata Steel had suffered £371m in pre-tax losses last year and there was continuing uncertainty for the wider industry because of Brexit.  There have been reports the UK government may consider so-called ""last resort"" loans for viable companies, if their failure would disproportionately harm the economy.  But ministers will want some certainty any loans will be paid back to ""protect"" the taxpayer. Mr Kinnock said he believed loans to steel firms would be returned and he has urged the government to consider the costs to the taxpayer of not stepping in to support them. ""We are urging the government to support the industry now and also think about the cost of doing nothing,"" he said.  ""There are 4,000 relatively well paid men and women working in the Port Talbot steel works, thousands more relatively well paid jobs in the steel industry across the country. ""Imagine the cost of losing those jobs.  ""Imagine the cost of decommissioning a steelworks with blast furnaces and the vast cost that would cause the government. ""So we are saying to the government - give the temporary loan. ""It is a loan that will be paid back in order to avoid the massive cost of doing nothing."" Steel industry analyst Dr Kathryn Ringwald-Wildman said the pandemic has hit firms at an already tough time. ""We've got uncertainty building on uncertainty,"" she said. ""The position of the steel industries is quite desperate at the moment and they will need government support to survive.  ""They would've needed government support without the pandemic. ""If they are to weather this particular storm they will need support. ""The question is: this is taxpayer's money. Is this a bridge over the pandemic crisis or is it a bridge over the pandemic crisis only to find the economic situation post-pandemic is much more serious globally than we might imagine?"" Beyond questions around the cost of recovery, with Tata Steel reportedly needing at least £500m through the pandemic, government decisions to support steel or not are inherently political - with the effect on areas like Port Talbot hanging in the mix. ""You take the steel industry out of Port Talbot you have got nothing. You haven't got anything to take its place,"" said Dr Ringwald-Wildman. ""The decision that's made now will resonate for many years.  ""It may be that the politicians will decide to defer the decision to end steel manufacturing in the UK - let the companies sink or swim.  ""They might choose to defer that because of the consequences down the line. ""It would take a very brave government to say we don't need a steel industry in the UK.  ""The emphasis has been, in conversations around the edge of the Brexit decision, we will make our own steel, use our own steel, buy our own steel. ""We will, of course, be trading on the international market.  ""But the notion that our domestic steel industry would be one of our major suppliers to our manufacturing industry was fundamental."" A spokesperson for Tata Steel, which has furloughed about 2,400 staff across UK sites, said: ""The ultimate impact of coronavirus has been the sudden drop in demand for steel.  ""But it is a storm that we are weathering, and we're looking to come out of the other side. ""We are in negotiations with both UK and Welsh governments to seek all available support that we can."" A UK government spokesperson said it has ""engaged with businesses across the economy, and has already increased the scope and scale of many of our support schemes, including loans to steel companies with a turnover of over £45m"". ""We recognise that economic conditions continue to be challenging and we are committed to supporting the sector's economic recovery."""
liquidity conditions,China can now monitor state-funded projects 24/7,2024-09-15,2024-02-04,By Annabelle Liang,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68027592,"Some Chinese developers must now install monitoring equipment at their projects, under official measures which took affect this month. The rules apply to firms that have received at least 30 million yuan ($4.2m; £3.3m) of government funding. It comes as authorities move to support China's crisis-hit property industry. In January, the country's housing ministry said it would offer more bailout loans to developers struggling with debt and a slowdown in demand. Announcing the new surveillance rules in January, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in a statement that it was moving to ""regulate the implementation of projects and the use of funding"". ""These measures are important to strengthen investment supervision... and improve the effectiveness of government investment,"" it added. The rules are part of the Chinese government's efforts to ensure that ""funds being used to prop up struggling property developers are being used for their intended purposes,"" Ben Harburg from investment firm MSA Capital told the BBC. ""Chinese developers have breached the trust of the Chinese government in the past by taking funds earmarked for completion of a project to pay off a coupon or even for personal use,"" he said. Under the measures, security devices - including surveillance cameras, drones or even satellite equipment - must be used to monitor projects, if conditions allow. The people of China are some of the most surveilled citizens in the world. It has been estimated that half of the world's surveillance cameras are in China, amounting to hundreds of millions of the devices. All this is part of China's aim to build what it calls ""the world's biggest camera surveillance network"". Many of the cameras use artificial intelligence, including facial recognition technology. However, David Goodman, a professor of Chinese politics at The University of Sydney, said that he does not see the new rules as ""creepy, though there is an element of desperation,"" from the authorities to oversee state-sponsored projects. ""It is likely to have some results, and some of those may even be positive towards ensuring performance and social achievement,"" he added. Mareike Ohlberg, a senior fellow at the think-tank German Marshall Fund of the United States, said she ""does not expect a move which is - at least in theory - geared towards monitoring how public funds are spent to generate a lot of backlash"" given ""widespread surveillance across the country"". Project developers should also use other technologies like big data to detect problems quickly, according to the NDRC. The BBC contacted several major Chinese developers - including Evergrande, Country Garden, Sunac and Longfor - for comment. None have yet responded. The severe problems engulfing China's property market were highlighted this week as a court in Hong Kong ordered the liquidation of debt-laden developer Evergrande. Evergrande, like many of its rivals, borrowed billions of dollars as it expanded aggressively. However, rules were introduced in 2020 to control the amount large real estate firms could borrow. That helped trigger a crisis, which the industry is still struggling to overcome. This presents a major issue for the Chinese government as the property sector accounts for roughly a quarter of the world's second largest economy. ""The property sector is the bellwether for the Chinese economy. Provincial governments depended on the sector to drive employment and meet growth targets. It is critical that the Chinese government shore up this sector to diffuse some global fears,"" Mr Harburg said.  Earlier this year, China's housing ministry announced plans to offer more bailout loans to developers ""in view of the current financing difficulties of some real estate projects"". At the same time local governments have been asked to provide a list of projects that need support, the official newspaper of China's housing ministry reported. Chinese lawmakers have also urged banks, which provided nearly 10 trillion yuan in loans to the property sector last year, to continue lending to struggling developers. In January, to help free up funds to support the economy, China's central bank made the largest cut to mandatory reserves for banks in more than two years. A day after the move, a senior official said the financial industry had an ""unshirkable responsibility"" to property developers. ""For projects that are in difficulty but whose funds can be balanced, we should not blindly withdraw loans, suppress loans, or cut off loans,"" Xiao Yuanqi from the National Financial Regulatory Administration told a news conference in Beijing. ""We should provide greater support through extending existing loans, adjusting repayment arrangements, and adding new loans."" Troubles in the property sector have also prevented developers from completing projects, leaving millions of vacant units scattered across the country. The crisis has already left many home buyers waiting for their new properties, in a country in which real estate accounts for around 70% of personal wealth. ""That could affect economic growth and potentially the stability of the financial system,"" said Ms Ohlberg. Beijing has previously sought to temper public concerns as people have taken to Chinese social media sites such as Weibo to share their frustrations about developers. ""Housing affects social stability. If a lot of people buy properties that aren't built, that's a lot of people who will be very upset,"" she added."
liquidity conditions,Why hasn't mortgage pain led to a housing crash?,2024-09-15,2023-07-08,Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66133116,"The black clouds are rising above the mortgage market. House prices are beginning to show notable annual falls. Fixed mortgage rates now mostly start with a 6%. The City is starting to predict a prolonged peak in UK base interest rates of 6.5%, with some seeing a case for 7% rates. In financial markets, the UK is starting to diverge from other western economies: longer term borrowing rates for government are now at 15-year highs, above where they got to after the ill-fated Liz Truss mini budget. While this is not a panic, it is a notable squeeze; the result of market perceptions that sticky UK inflation in particular will mean higher rates for longer in the UK. It now costs the government two percentage points more to borrow over 10 years than the German government. That was 0.7 percentage points just three months ago.  When the government came into office 13 years ago it promised to avoid the-then fate of the Greeks in the borrowing markets.  But it is now notably cheaper for Greece (3.99%) to borrow over 10 years than Britain (4.67%). This does not reflect solvency fears, but it is a judgement for UK authorities on whether inflation is under control.  This week the government borrowed effectively £4bn over two years from the markets at a gilt auction. It had to pay, at 5.7%, the highest rates this century over two years, the second highest this century on any UK government bond.  Added to all of this, interest rates are higher for the government to borrow over two years than it is over 10 years.  That's unusual and often a sign of a coming recession. In the jargon, the yield curve is ""inverted"". This is very consequential for banks' business models, their savings rates, and risks to their funding or liquidity. All of this provides the backdrop for those mortgage lending rates. The move so far from just above zero to 5% is the ""biggest and fastest move any of us can remember"" according to Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England. So really the question is, why have house prices not fallen even further? And the related point is - should that in fact be the aim, or at least a test of what the Bank of England is trying to do in getting inflation down? Late last year Jerome Powell, the US Federal Reserve Chair, was very clear in public that a ""housing correction"" was an immediate sign that raising US rates was having the desired effect. To be clear, we are not yet seeing a price correction, arrears, a spike in repossessions, or people forced to sell, that would be expected from the hike in interest rates. To give some context, typical house prices on the Halifax measure are now £285,932. That is down on the peak last August of £293,992, but still well up on the figure two years ago (very relevant for those remortgaging two-year fixes) of £260,358. The pre pandemic level of house prices in December 2019 was £238,963. Is the housing market more cushioned from rate rises? Clearly the prevalence of fixed rates makes a difference. But two thirds of the impact of the existing rate rises will hit the economy as people roll off those fixed rates. But even that can not explain the relatively benign impact so far. The mortgage banks are behaving differently to how they have acted in previous aggressive rate rise cycles. They are really trying to avoid repossessions. Their departments dealing with arrears are no longer even called ""Collections and Recoveries"" as they were back in the 1990s. They are extending mortgage terms, offering payment holidays, switching appropriate customers to interest-only deals. They are also using their customer data to identify subtle financial stresses at an early stage. They run models of hundreds of thousands of their customers to find the key signs for what might become arrears. Regular trips to a discount supermarket, from a former Waitrose customer, is, I'm told, a clear sign for intervention. Using machine learning they can calculate probabilities of whether customers will face a negative budget by, say, the end of the year. Much of this is automated, and allows early interventions and the consideration of more subtle patterns of spending across the population. In the 1990s, actual human bank managers would be enforcing more rigid affordability guidelines. ""Literally the last thing I ever want to do is repossess someone's home,"" I was told by one top mortgage industry boss. ""We do an income and expenditure analysis, a budget analysis with somebody who's struggling to pay. So long as they can afford to pay a pound - I want to keep them in their home."" The candidates for repossession are those who are obstructive or do not communicate at all. Or in cases where candidates for flexible treatment can simply no longer afford to live in their homes, and would be better served in selling up, downsizing and extracting equity. While these numbers will inevitably grow, for now, they remain remarkably low. Just over 400 repossessions a month occurred in the first three months of the year. In the early 1990s it was more than 5,000 a month. There is another reason for the, so far, soft landing in the housing market. The economy is very divided and unequal. The poorest section of society do not have mortgages. The richest are still up from the period of lockdown-forced savings and super low interest rates. In the middle, millions of households face a significant and painful squeeze from rising mortgage rates, but the banks' models tell them it can be afforded, albeit with significant adjustments to spending habits. The jobs market, for now, remains resilient, even as companies' borrowing costs are also starting to spike. To rephrase former Conservative Chancellor John Major, if it isn't hurting, is it working? Are the Monetary Policy Committee turning the tap harder and harder on the interest rate hose to try to dampen down the inflationary fire, but finding only a slow trickle of water? Put another way, will the Bank of England have to raise rates higher than it predicted, to temper demand and spending power in the economy? Allan Monks, the UK economist at JP Morgan, calculates that had every mortgage been variable, then the affordability shock to the economy would already be the same as the 1980s. He can see scenarios where interest rates might have to go as high as 7% to rein in inflation. Conversely the former Bank of England chief economist, Andy Haldane, fears what he called ""monetary austerity"", calling for some calm in financial markets and on the Monetary Policy Committee.  Even before new inflation figures that might show inflation still above 8%, there are some important milestones this week. On Tuesday mortgage lenders are up in front of MPs. On Wednesday, the Bank of England releases its biannual assessment of financial stability of the banking system and households. And on Monday we hear from the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and the Bank of England governor at Mansion House.  Financial markets are flashing a warning signal. The housing market has so far been intriguingly immune. That might not be good news."
liquidity conditions,Profits fall at Standard Life Aberdeen,2024-09-15,2018-08-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-45097375,"Standard Life Aberdeen has blamed ""challenging"" market conditions after reporting a continued outflow of funds. The fund manager said £16.6bn left the business in the first half of the year. Its assets under management and administration stood at £610.1bn, compared with £626.5bn for the same period in 2017. Pre-tax profits from continuing operations fell 12% from a year earlier to £311m - below analyst expectations of £325m. The Scottish fund giant was formed by the merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management last year.  In its half-year report, the company said macroeconomic and political uncertainties continued to affect investor sentiment, driving investors to look for new strategies. Chief executives Martin Gilbert and Keith Skeoch said conditions for the asset management industry were ""challenging"". They added: ""Our investment and distribution teams are winning new mandates and we have a good and diverse pipeline of business from around the world.  ""We are actively taking steps to improve our investment performance in key areas and are encouraged by the impact of these initiatives."" Meanwhile, the company also confirmed that it was accelerating plans to return £1.75bn to shareholders, adding that the first £175m tranche of its share buyback programme would begin ""in the next few days"". The group announced the move in May, saying that it would follow the sale of its European insurance business to Phoenix Group. The transaction is expected to complete in the third quarter. ""Challenging market"" is a familiar euphemism for chief executives facing an uncomfortable ride.  And that's where job-sharing Martin Gilbert and Keith Skeoch appear to be, with the half-year results for Standard Life Aberdeen. The share price is down since they merged, and they readily concede it is undervalued. The share buyback, of £1.75bn, is partly intended to give it a help upwards. That money is partly made available by the sale of the insurance division to Phoenix, which will see around 3,000 people, mainly in Edinburgh, transfer to the new employer by the end of next month. Shareholders are also benefiting from the successful float in Mumbai this week of the joint venture HDFC fund manager in India. The Gilbert/Skeoch strategy is to focus on asset management in Edinburgh, with more than £600bn under management. The biggest asset manager in Europe, that should give them real clout. But it has been losing ground. Instead of being bigger than the sum of the parts, they've become smaller. Assets Under Management have lost another £16bn net, to reach £610bn.  But as the chief executives say, they are facing a market that is ""liquidity-driven"". A lot of it is being driven towards tracker funds rather than the more expensive actively-managed ones. Those who manage funds actively, carrying the cost of research, are finding ""compression"" of charges. Shareholders will be aware that's another euphemism, referring to the downward pressure on what Standard Life Aberdeen can charge in management fees, while rivals are cutting as low as zero (though read the small print carefully). With fees compressed and a net outflow of funds, if the firm can't push up earnings, then the target of cutting its earnings ratio from 69% to 60% (slow progress in recent months) is going to require more than the £350m currently being taken out of its cost base."

liquidity conditions,"Rolls-Royce 'to cut up to 8,000 jobs'",2024-09-15,2020-05-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-52514444,"Rolls-Royce could axe up to 8,000 jobs after aircraft manufacturers were forced to cut production during the Covid-19 pandemic. The aeroplane engine maker employs 52,000 people worldwide, with 23,000 staff in the UK. According to a company source, senior leaders have warned ""cuts could be as high as 8,000, but efforts to mitigate the impact are ongoing"". It had announced plans to save £750m but now ""needs to take further action"". Rolls-Royce is expected to tell staff the actual number of job losses by the end of May. The aviation industry has been badly hit by the pandemic as many flights across the world have been suspended. The impact has forced aircraft manufacturers to cut production - Airbus has cut its production by a third and has furloughed 3,200 staff. Rolls-Royce, one of the world's largest makers of aircraft engines, had previously warned the virus was a ""macro-risk for everyone"". The Financial Times first reported the potential job losses, and said the restructuring plan ""would shrink the workforce...by up to 15%"". Derby council leader Chris Poulter said it was ""worrying"" after Rolls-Royce confirmed some of the 15,000 staff at its two sites in the city could be affected. As well as Derby, the firm has operations in six other UK locations. It also has a presence in the US, Germany, India, Singapore and Japan. A Rolls-Royce spokesman said the pandemic was ""unprecedented"", adding: ""We have taken swift action to increase our liquidity, dramatically reduce our spending in 2020, and strengthen our resilience in these exceptionally challenging times.  ""But we will need to take further action. We have promised to give our people further details of the impact of the current situation on the size of our workforce before the end of this month."" It added negotiations were ongoing and it would ""consult with everyone affected"".  The Unite union said it was ""making no comment whatsoever at this stage"".

liquidity conditions,Santander rescues rival from collapse,2024-09-15,2017-06-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40184347,"Spanish bank Banco Popular has been rescued from the brink of collapse by larger rival Santander for one euro. Buying Banco Popular will cost Santander 7bn euros (£6.1bn) - around 2bn euros more than analysts had expected. Banco Popular was described by the European Central Bank (ECB) as ""failing or likely to fail"" due to its dwindling cash reserves. The bank has struggled after billions in property investments turned sour. The ECB said: ""The significant deterioration of the liquidity situation of the bank in recent days led to a determination that the entity would have, in the near future, been unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fell due."" The Single Resolution Board (SRB) - the body set up last year to deal with winding up struggling banks - pushed forward the sale after it was informed of the seriousness of the problem on Tuesday night.  Banco Popular bosses have spent the last few months attempting to shore up the bank's balance sheet by selling various assets. A bidding process for Banco Popular ended last month, but started to look shaky as a handful of institutions pulled out. Santander chairman Ana Botin said it was a good deal for the bank.  ""The combination of Santander and Popular strengthens the group's geographical diversification at a time of improving economic conditions in both Spain and Portugal."" However, shareholders appeared to disagree, with shares falling by 3% in early trading. Aberdeen Asset Management's head of credit research Laurent Frings said: ""This isn't a big surprise. The regulator has been looking for a solution to Banco Popular's problems for a while and time has essentially run out. ""But this is a test case for the Single Resolution Board, which was created in response to the euro area crisis to try to make the banking system safer."" He added: ""This shouldn't pose any real problems for other banks or the banking system in Spain or Europe. ""It's essentially a case of the regulation doing exactly what it was created for. But it does show that there is real risk in investing in these second tier names in the banking sector."" Banco Popular customers will be unaffected, and the ECB already protects all EU savers with deposits of up to 100,000 euros. But shareholders and bondholders will lose out as their investments become worthless. The SRB was set up to deal with any struggling banks after the 2012 eurozone crisis threatened the economies of entire countries. In Spain, banks had so much risky debt it worried investors buying sovereign wealth bonds, making borrowing by the country more expensive. Government ministers were eventually forced to borrow 41bn euros to prop up its lenders and reassure investors. With the SRB in place, the risk is supposed to be taken off individual countries when a bank is struggling. The body's creation was also aimed at calming tensions, which led to protests and riots against banks in 2013. Officials in Frankfurt at the ECB monitor the EU's 125 biggest banks and the SRB steps in when a collapse looks likely. They can either reorganise the bank's structure, liquidate it or force through a sale - as they did with Banco Popular and Santander. Banco Popular unveiled a 3.5bn-euro loss last year as bosses continued to struggle to deal with nearly $40bn (£31bn) of toxic property loans.  It launched three rounds of fundraising from investors over the last five years, raising a total of 5.5bn euros."
liquidity conditions,Woodford investors in line for £235m compensation,2024-09-15,2023-04-20,By Kevin Peachey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65335843,"Investors who lost money when a fund managed by big-name stockpicker Neil Woodford collapsed are in line for compensation. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said people who had money invested when the fund was suspended could receive a share of £235m in redress. That would amount to about 77p in every pound they had invested. For the money to be paid, investors will need to approve the plan. Various other conditions will also need to be fulfilled, such as the sale of some assets. Therese Chambers, from the FCA, said the proposal offered the best possible outcome for the 300,000 trapped investors who lost money. Mr Woodford was one of the UK's most high profile investment managers and when he set up his own managed fund, he came with an impressive reputation. He was as close to a household name as is possible in the world of investing.  Investors, ranging from ordinary people to pension funds, put money into the Woodford Equity Income Fund. At its peak, the fund was reportedly managing more than £10bn. But as they became increasingly worried about the investments being made on their behalf, many withdrew their money. More than £500m was taken out in four weeks and in June 2019 the fund was frozen. It was later closed and is being wound up. The fund administrator which made that decision was Link Fund Solutions. As the authorised corporate director of the fund, it had a responsibility to ensure that the fund was being managed with appropriate levels of liquidity and risk, and that all investors were treated fairly. The FCA said there were ""critical mistakes and errors"" made by Link in its duties. As a result, those who had money in the fund when it was suspended were left with a disproportionate share of the remaining assets that were less easy to access, and difficult to use to repay investors who wanted to leave. Nearly four years on, some of those assets remain unsold. The FCA and Link Group have agreed a pay-out of about £235m to these investors, which is funded, in part, by the sale of the Link business. This is less than an earlier statement by the FCA, which suggested investors would get a share of £298m. Investors are receiving a letter now about the proposal, and should receive further information about the timetable of events in July. They will need to vote to approve the deal for payments to be made. ""It would be a surprise if Woodford investors didn't approve the deal given how long this has dragged on for,"" said Ryan Hughes, from investment platform AJ Bell. ""While it will take some time for this redress process to complete and for payments to be made, investors are one step closer to being able to finally put this whole sorry episode to bed.""  The events leading up to the fund's collapse in October 2019 are still being investigated by the FCA in what it described as a ""complex"" inquiry. The saga also prompted separate lawsuits on behalf of investors. Mr Woodford has said he was ""very sorry for what I did wrong"", but has criticised the decision by Link to suspend the fund."
liquidity conditions,Ministers agree two-week TfL bailout extension,2024-09-15,2020-10-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-54568920,"Transport for London (TfL) has secured a last-minute extension of its bailout to keep services running for two weeks. The government will continue the terms of the current £1.6bn bailout package, until 31 October - roughly equivalent to £113m. The original bailout was due to run out on Saturday. ""The two-week extension will enable TfL to continue running safe, reliable and frequent transport services,"" the Mayor of London said. A spokesperson for Sadiq Khan said London transport was ""more critical than ever as the capital enters tier 2 and with Covid cases on the rise"". ""Sadiq will continue to fight for appropriate longer-term funding for TfL, and a fair deal for Londoners,"" the spokesperson said. TfL bosses have asked for a £5.7bn funding package to keep services running for the next 18 months. The mayor's office claimed the government was asking for the £15 congestion charge to the North and South Circular. A spokesperson added ""taking free travel away from children and older people"" was a red line for the mayor. City Hall had complained of punitive conditions attached to the first grant at the last minute, including extra borrowing, slashing free travel for older people and under 18s and raising fares next year. So we have a two-week respite - but we might be back here again on 31 October. The strings attached to the second bailout are controversial to say the least. City Hall says the government wants to extend the congestion charging zone out from central London, to a huge area within the North and South Circular.  Free travel for under-18s and over-60s would also end.  Deputy Mayor of Transport Heidi Alexander made it clear they would not support those moves. And it also raises questions about the devolution of power and who should be moulding transport policy in the capital. Londoners certainly did not vote for those policies. Can Number 10 and the mayor see a way through and compromise? TfL Commissioner Andy Byford previously said TfL's finances were ""right on the wire"".  The transport authorities funds are down £45m a week compared to last year, Mr Byfrod told the TfL Finance Committee. TfL's Liquidity Policy means it has to maintain a minimum level of cash reserves of at least 60 days' worth of forecast costs - about £1.2bn. Without a bailout the network would be forced to issue a Section 114 order, the equivalent of bankruptcy for a public company.  TfL only allowed to run services it was legally obliged to maintain. Due to a 200-year-old law, the Woolwich Ferry - which links Woolwich and North Woolwich - is the only commuter service TfL is legally obliged to run. Buses for children who live more than two miles from school would also continue to run.  TfL would also carry out limited road repairs and licensed taxis and private hire vehicles.  But the Tube, Overground, rail services, trams and most buses would stop running. The Department for Transport said: ""We have agreed an extension to the support period for the TfL Extraordinary Funding Agreement, allowing further time for negotiations. ""These discussions will ensure London has a safe, reliable network.  ""It would be inappropriate to disclose further details at this stage."""
liquidity conditions,Lager laager: When the on-trade switches off,2024-09-15,2020-10-22,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-54644899,"It's just a pint of lager, but according to Time Out website, it's brewed in the eighth coolest neighbourhood on the planet. With the current focus on the hospitality trade, Tennent's sheds some light on what's been going on in Scotland's pub trade. From its Wellpark brewery on the edge of Dennistoun in Glasgow, it has a huge reach into Scottish drinking habits. Lager is the biggest selling drink in the on-trade of pubs and restaurants. And within the lager category, Tennent's sells nearly half of the Scottish total. Or at least, it did. Now, we can't be so sure, except to note that, temporarily, there is no on-trade in Scotland. The market has been upended by lockdown and the subsequent months of tentative reopening of licensed premises, and now a renewed bar on selling alcohol for consumption on the premises. All companies have had to put up their defences - in this case, a sort of lager laager. And many have reached out to support business clients as well, in a bid to help them survive the pandemic onslaught. So what can we learn from the half-year figures put out by Ireland-based C&C, owners of Tennent's for the past 11 years, and also of Magner's cider? The figures cover March to the end of August. With dependence on the on-trade in normal times, the company mobilised its financial firepower to help out with its trade customers. As an enthusiastic user of jargon, C&C points out that it is ""structurally integral to the markets we serve"". Old kegs, gone stale during lockdown, were replaced one-for-one. Moratoriums on loan repayments were agreed. There was support with the hygiene materials, screens and extra costs to prepare pubs for reopening. C&C has a stake in Admiral Taverns, including around 950 tenanted outlets. That required €7m of liquidity support.  Big, long pub chains are more a feature of the English on-trade than the Scottish ones. And they're shedding jobs. In the case of Marston's, 2,150 are going.   From C&C comes a strong hint that it could be going in the same direction: ""We have begun to take action to permanently right-size our fixed cost base."" Being diversified, C&C also owns wholesale distributors of drinks, Matthew Clark and Bibendum. It's the biggest such distributor to the hospitality sector in Britain and Ireland, supplying 35,000 licensed outlets. There too, a seemingly catastrophic fall in volumes, of 63% - from 16 million cases of wine and spirits to 5.8 million. So the company shifted suddenly into supplying the off-trade, and while that's dominated by the big supermarkets, Matthew Clark managers saw the opportunity in stepping up service to the independent convenience store operators, and throwing in a loyalty scheme. The result was revenues in those sales went up by 71%. You can also see the measures necessary to handle the financial challenges from such drastic changes in revenue. The Dublin company's half-year results show it had to persuade creditors to ease up on loan conditions, known as covenants, and that has been secured through to February 2022.  Debt rose by €45m, to €371m, and liquidity was helped by making use of the Covid corporate financing facility, the support scheme aimed at big stock exchange-listed firms and operated through the Bank of England.  That apparently puts London-listed C&C in reasonable (or in its word ""robust"") condition to withstand renewed restrictions, hospitality closures and constraints.  But the prospects for having a recognisable on-trade of pubs, clubs and restaurants to recover its business model are not at all robust. The vital Christmas trade looks ""uncertain and challenging"", and in the jargon, there is ""limited near-term visibility"". In other words, none of us have the foggiest.r"
liquidity conditions,Bank of England steps in to calm markets,2024-09-15,2022-09-28,By Daniel Thomas & Noor Nanji,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63061614,"The Bank of England has said it will step in to calm markets after the government's tax-cutting plans sparked a fall in the pound and caused borrowing costs to surge. It warned that if the market volatility continued there would be a ""material risk to UK financial stability"". The Bank will start buying government bonds at an ""urgent pace"" to help restore ""orderly market conditions"". The pound, which has been volatile, rose 1.4% against the dollar to $1.08.  It comes after the currency hit a record low on Monday following the chancellor's mini-budget, which pledged $45bn worth of tax cuts, funded by borrowing, as part of a plan to boost economic growth.   The government borrows money to fund its spending plans by selling bonds, or ""gilts"", to investors such as pension funds and big banks on international markets.  The investor then gets to receive a stream of future payments, or ""yield"", based on the interest rate the government has offered.  Due to concerns over whether the government's plan will work, investors have been demanding much higher interest rates to lend to the UK government. But the Bank now hopes to lower these prices by buying its bonds.  The government's long-term borrowing costs fell after the bank's intervention on Wednesday, although still remains high. The Bank of England was forced to intervene after the market turmoil put pressure on pension funds, which invest in government bonds because they are usually so stable. So called Liability Driven Investment funds - which support defined benefit pensions schemes - were facing a collapse in the value of the bonds they hold, which in turn could have forced them to rush to sell other assets, sparking yet more market panic. However, industry group the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) said that ""pension schemes are long-term investors and moments like this come from time to time"". ""While this is a complex situation as there has been a lot of volatility in the gilt markets in recent days, we would not expect any significant issues for savers,"" said Joe Dabrowski, deputy director of the PLSA. Nevertheless, he said there will be ""some operational challenges and pressures on liquidity"" in the short term. Mr Dabrowski added that ""this is not ideal, [but] they are challenges that can be overcome and the statement from the Bank of England is a helpful step to achieving that"".  The Bank has already said it will ""not hesitate"" to hike interest rates to try and protect the pound and try and stem surging prices. Some economists have predicted the Bank of England will raise the interest rate from the current 2.25% to 5.8% by next spring.  The projection has led hundreds of mortgage products to be taken off the market.  The Bank said its bond purchases would be ""time limited"" and carried out on ""whatever scale is necessary"" to ease investor concerns. It will also postpone the planned start of a gilt sale programme that was only announced last week.  Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the Bank had been forced to step in to avoid the early stages of a financial crisis and warned fears over the economic outlook were growing.  ""This shows that the Bank is going to do all it can to prevent a financial crisis and it is already working. While this is welcome, the fact that it needed to be done in the first place shows that the UK markets are in a perilous position.  ""It wouldn't be a huge surprise if another problem in the financial markets popped up before long."" Despite the Bank's action, the pound continued to fall with some analysts warning it could even reach parity with the dollar.  ""What today shows us, is that the market doesn't see this as a problem that just the Bank of England can clean up,"" she said. ""This is just firefighting,"" said Jane Foley, a currency strategist at Rabobank. She said pressure was growing on the government to make clear the financial cost of its tax cut and spending plans. There has been widespread criticism of the government's plan, with International Monetary Fund warning on Tuesday that the measures are likely to fuel the cost-of-living crisis and increase inequality. The government says it will not reverse its tax cuts, but has promised to release further plans to boost growth and reduce public debt on 23 November. In a statement, the Treasury acknowledged global financial markets had seen ""significant volatility"" in recent days. It said Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng was ""committed"" to the Bank's independence, adding: ""The government will continue to work closely with the Bank in support of its financial stability and inflation objectives."" But Labour called on the chancellor to urgently clarify how he planned to stabilise the economy. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said people would be ""deeply worried"" about the cost of their mortgage, about their pensions, and the cost of living. ""The Chancellor must make an urgent statement on how he is going to fix the crisis that he has made."" This is an immense show of force from the Bank of England trying to calm borrowing markets. It does raise some questions. It underlines that this is a crisis, and the Bank has responded in emergency mode. The clear cause of this crisis was the chancellor's mini budget, leading to a loss of market confidence and spiralling borrowing rates on government debt, which it says could become a ""material risk to financial stability"". So it will now, for a temporary period, buy up those loans in unlimited quantities. The effective interest rate being charged to the UK government in these markets was spiralling to 20 year highs. That has now fallen back. But it was not a decision made by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, who were informed of the decision after it was made by the Bank's financial experts. It actually comes as the Committee had been set to enact the exact reverse policy - selling government debts. The process was due to start next week and has been delayed. It is a massive intervention, but it could confuse markets about the clarity of policy making and lines of accountability. Sterling has fallen sharply again, close to all time lows. This will not solve the government's problems. It might buy them some time."
liquidity conditions,Carillion survival 'undermined' by banks,2024-09-15,2018-01-16,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42710795,"Carillion was in talks with the government since October as part of a desperate bid to stave off collapse, according to the chief executive. Keith Cochrane says the construction giant was left with just £29m in cash by the time it went bust on Monday. Until the last moments, directors still believed a rescue was possible, but banks became more demanding, he said. The details are included in a document Mr Cochrane has prepared as part of the insolvency process. His statement sets out attempts to save Britain's second-biggest construction company after three profits warnings and a collapse in the share price. Efforts to sell off parts of the business failed and Carillion's banks became more demanding, only agreeing fresh funding under tight new conditions that the company was unable to meet, the statement discloses. There had been regular meetings with the government and its advisers in the final few months of 2017, Mr Cochrane says. But on 31 December a ""formal request"" was made for support from the government. Even as late as last weekend, directors believed that ""a constructive dialogue"" was underway with banks and the government about providing short-term funding.  Directors wanted the government to ""guarantee"" more funding for four months while Carillion continued its restructuring, and be allowed to defer tax payments. Both requests were refused, according to Mr Cochrane. But his document adds that ""certain of the group's lenders took unilateral action which in the company's view undermined the group's efforts to conserve cash"". He singles out Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) as one of the banks that wanted to impose tough new lending conditions. RBS said in a statement to the BBC that it had ""provided considerable support and forbearance to Carillion over many months"". ""The judgement of the bank was that the restructuring plan put forward by the company was not viable and therefore we took the difficult decision not to extend further funding and increase our exposure to the business."" Running out of cash and owing more than £1.3bn to its banks, Carillion declared itself insolvent on Monday.  Rather than attempt an orderly administration of Carillion in the hope of salvaging something from the business, the Official Receiver was appointed to liquidate the business. Accountants EY and PwC both rejected requests to become administrators because there was no money left to keep the company ticking over, Mr Cochrane says. Meanwhile, Treasury minister Liz Truss told the Commons on Tuesday that ""it would be completely wrong for a public company that got itself in this state to be bailed out by the state"". Business Secretary Greg Clark has asked for an investigation by the Official Receiver to be broadened and fast-tracked.  The conduct of directors in charge at the time of the company's failure and previous directors will be examined. ""It is important we quickly get the full picture of the events which caused Carillion to enter liquidation,"" said Mr Clark. ""Any evidence of misconduct will be taken very seriously."" At the same time, the role of Carillion's auditor, KPMG, will be examined by the Financial Reporting Council.  The company employed 43,000 people worldwide, 20,000 in the UK, and had 450 contracts with the UK government.  The government has said that staff and contractors working on public sector service contracts will continue to be paid. But there is concern that big projects, including the construction of hospitals and roads, will be delayed while the details are worked out. There are also big worries for an estimated 30,000 smaller firms which have been working on Carillion projects in the private sector. Many are owed money and are waiting to find out if they will get any of it back. Andy Bradley is the managing director of Flora-tec, which is owed £800,000 by Carillion for landscaping services. ""The government actively encouraged businesses like mine... to get involved in public sector contracts, to make sure the little guy got a slice of the pie.  ""When Carillion started to get into trouble last year we were considering that we would scale back our involvement with them. ""However... the government continued to give them billion-pound contract after billion-pound contract and that said to me, as a small supplier, that the government had done their due diligence. ""We were following the government lead... only to be given a sucker punch. ""I had to make 10 people redundant yesterday. That's 10 people with mortgages, car loans, all that stuff. It's an absolute disgrace."" On Monday, the government said that firms working on Carillion's private contracts would be paid for another 48 hours. But the latest statement from the Insolvency Service indicates there might be more flexibility. It says that the liquidator is talking to Carillion's private sector clients about which services will continue; however contracts will be ended if the client no longer wants to pay for them. ""No one has been dismissed at this point and staff will continue to be paid for the work they perform,"" a spokesperson for the Insolvency Service said. Carillion was hit by cost overruns on big projects, problems with contracts in the Middle East and a large deficit in the company pension scheme. Chief executive Richard Howson stepped down in July last year after a profit warning. There has been much criticism over the size of Mr Howson's pay award in 2016 which, including bonuses, totalled about £1.5m. Finance director Richard Adam, who retired in December 2016 after nine years at Carillion, received almost £1.1m in salary and bonuses in 2016. Are you a Carillion employee or contractor?

It is the second cut in interest rates in just over a week, bringing them down to 0.1% from 0.25%. Interest rates are now at the lowest ever in the Bank's 325-year history. The Bank said it would also increase its holdings of UK government and corporate bonds by £200bn with an effort to lower the cost of borrowing.  It's a dramatic move by Andrew Bailey, who only took over from Mark Carney as Bank of England governor on Monday. Last week, the Bank announced a 0.5% cut in rates to 0.25% and a package of measures to help businesses and individuals cope with the economic damage caused by the virus. The move coincided with additional measures announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the Budget. However, the Bank said the measures it had taken so far were not going to be enough, and believed ""a further package of measures was warranted"". ""The spread of Covid-19 and the measures being taken to contain the virus will result in an economic shock that could be sharp and large, but should be temporary,"" it added. The move comes as international investors are trying to secure more cash, in particular dollars. This means they're ditching assets such as UK government gilts, which are the ""IOU"" notes the government hands over to private investors willing to lend it money.  As the gilts are sold, the price drops and the yield - the effective interest rate compared to the price - rises. What that means is the cost of borrowing to private investors as well as to the government rises - just when the Bank of England wants it to fall and the government is about to borrow huge sums.  The Bank of England's plan to buy £200bn more bonds is aimed at fighting that effect.  The fresh rate cut takes interest rates to the lowest they can feasibly go, said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at payments company Equals Group.  ""Lower rates and additional quantitative easing can keep markets satisfied and borrowing costs for both businesses and the government down but unless money is forced into the hands of small businesses soon, then it will be for nothing; they are the ones laying off staff due to a liquidity shock,"" he added. Karen Ward, chief European market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: The support to the economy and health system will require vastly higher government borrowing. The central bank showing willing to buy government debt will ensure the market can absorb this additional issuance without undue stress."" The Bank of England Governor has said today's second emergency rate cut in just over a week occurred after financial markets became ""borderline disorderly"", with fears about coronavirus leading to a rush into the US dollar away from sterling and lending to the UK government. ""We've seen very sharp moves in financial markets in the last few days, which is the pace of which frankly, was increasing very rapidly. And we were moving into conditions that were if not disorderly, frankly, bordering on disorderly let me put it that way,"" Andrew Bailey told journalists.  The Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee had an emergency call this morning so that rate cuts and further ""quantitative easing"" could be agreed and announced, with the Bank needing to be ""on the offensive"" because: ""We can't wait for the hard economic data it will be too late by then"", he said.  He said he had seen a range of private forecasts about the economic impact of the current crisis: ""We don't have a precise forecast - every picture we look at has a very sharp V in it"". The governor also partly blamed rumours that appeared to emerge from Westminster of a shutdown to London for adding to the volatility in markets that saw sterling fall 5% against the dollar. Such a shutdown would be likely to impact on the functioning of the City. He said: ""I do have to say that, you know, there were rumours going on the market this time yesterday that there was going to be a lockdown in London. And I'd observe that did cause market prices to start moving around at that point. But I think the government has been clear, and it's clear that that is not the intention at the moment."" The governor also said that he had already intervened to try to get loans to businesses to keep people in employment, and he said the Bank had its thinking cap on as regards further monetary boosts it can make.  He reiterated his lack of enthusiasm for zero or negative interest rates because of their impact on the banking system's capacity to lend, and suggested that was the reason for limiting the cut to an unusual 0.15% (rather than the usual 0.25% or 0.5%) to a record low of 0.1%.  The key Monetary Policy Committee will meet again next week."
liquidity conditions,British electric van maker enters administration,2024-09-15,2024-02-05,By Theo Leggett,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68204358,"The UK-based operations of the electric van maker Arrival - a firm once championed by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson - have been placed in administration. Arrival planned to build innovative electric vans for sale around the world.  The Banbury-based business was worth £9bn just three years ago  It had been described as the future of the UK automotive industry, but struggled to get its designs produced. Between them, Arrival UK Ltd and Arrival Automotive employed 172 people. Nearly 40 have been made redundant, while others are being retained to assist with the sale of the business and assets. Arrival was founded in the UK by the Russian billionaire and former government minister Denis Sverdlov in 2015. It intended to use simple manufacturing processes to build electric vans, buses and taxis cheaply. It planned to produce them in so-called ""micro-factories"", which would be much smaller than traditional manufacturing plants and could be set up relatively easily. It was launched on the Nasdaq stock market in the United States in 2021, and briefly had a valuation of $13bn (£9bn), making it the biggest ever initial stock market listing for a UK tech company at the time. However, despite already having received orders for 10,000 vehicles from the US distribution giant UPS, and having investment from both UPS and Hyundai, it struggled to get its designs into production. Setbacks included a fire at its Banbury facility while one of its vans was being demonstrated in November 2022. Early last year, Arrival said it would cut its 800-strong workforce in half and switch production from the UK to North Carolina in the United States. It still employs some 400 people globally. However, the company continued to struggle to raise the money it needed. At the end of January, the company said its shares had been suspended from trading on the Nasdaq, and it had been told they would be removed from the index. According to the administrator of the UK side of the business, EY, ""the group's liquidity position has been impacted by a challenging market and macroeconomic conditions resulting in delays getting the group's products to market. ""As such, the joint administrators are now exploring options for the sale of the business and assets of the companies"". Those assets include Arrival's electric vehicle designs, which will now be put up for sale."
liquidity conditions,Superdry warns of uncertainty amid Covid sales hit,2024-09-15,2021-01-19,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55716398,"Fashion chain Superdry has warned of ""continued uncertainty and disruption"" caused by Covid-19, as the impact of continued shop closures led to a sharp drop in sales. The warnings came as its half-yearly results showed a big rise in losses. Superdry said prolonged store closures and ""subdued"" footfall would continue to hit its revenues in 2021, sending the share price down 11%. But it said worries for the future were technical and its cash pile was strong. The retailer was in the midst of a turnaround plan when the virus struck. Unlike some of its competitors, it has an extensive store network, with many of its outlets in prime city centre locations which have seen fewer shoppers during the pandemic as more people work from home. In its results covering the 26 weeks to 24 October last year, Superdry reported a statutory pre-tax loss of £18.9m, compared with £4.2m a year earlier. Founder Julian Dunkerton said the brand had ""continued to focus on the reset"", but that with 70% of stores closed, it would take time to see ""the benefits of all our hard work"". The firm said that ""the risks of the recovery in consumer demand"" and its ability to meet new covenants from lenders represented ""material uncertainty"". This could ""cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern"", meaning that ""it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business"".  However, Superdry said its net cash reserves had been positive throughout 2020 and remained strong, at £54.8m as of 9 January. ""We continue to have a total of over £130m of available liquidity at hand. Our £70m asset-backed lending facility remains available, having not been used in the year to date, and is currently still undrawn,"" the company added. The longer trading restrictions on the High Street are kept in place, the greater the signs of financial distress among retailers. Superdry has had a chequered few years, with changes in strategy and senior management, but despite that, has been regarded as one of the stronger British fashion retailers, with an international spread of business and a well-established brand.  Lockdowns are taking their toll, however. Its interim results, which cover the six-month period to 24 October, are bleak, with sales down 23% and a £19m net loss - swollen by a £7m deficit on currency hedging.  The real sting comes with the directors acknowledging there could, if trading does not improve, be a threat to the company's future. They highlight the conditions the company's lenders have put on its loans and say there could be a risk to Superdry's ability to continue as a going concern.  The directors go on to say that they consider that the company does have enough money to see it through, but the warning underlines the tough trading conditions some retailers now face and how even the best-placed players now fear for their future."
liquidity conditions,"I still can’t eat cornflakes, says woman with long Covid",2024-09-15,2023-12-22,Richard Price,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cmmdjd0m1eyo,"A lecturer at Keele University has spoken of how she had to throw out a box of cornflakes after long Covid left her with a number of unusual symptoms. Sarah Taylor found out she had the condition after waking up on New Year’s Day in 2022, to discover she had ""brain fog"" and exhaustion. Her symptoms left her unable to return to work. “All my muscles were just rigid, so getting up the staircase was like a fight. I’d have to haul myself up,” she said. When she had initially tried to return to her job, she said she was unable to last a full week and was forced to take sick leave. She was then told she had to wait three months before the possibility of being referred to a long Covid clinic. On finally attending the clinic, one of things that was assessed was how she swallowed. This involved a medical professional watching her while she ate, she said. As a result, Ms Taylor established she was unable to swallow foods with different textures, such as cornflakes. She said the difference between the crunchiness of the cereal and the liquidity of the milk would cause her to cough. Another symptom of long Covid she experienced was difficulty recalling names – including those of her students. “When you’re just looking at them and there’s a sea of faces, and you can’t match the names to the faces, I do think it impacts things there,” she said. According to the NHS, most people with Covid-19 felt better within a few days or weeks of first experiencing symptoms and made a full recovery within 12 weeks. For some people, however, symptoms last longer – and developing what has been diagnosed as long Covid. Sufferers often experience extreme tiredness, shortness of breath, muscle aches and loss of smell. The NHS says the range of symptoms experienced by people also include problems with memory and concentration, chest pains and difficulty sleeping.

liquidity conditions,Ten major events that shaped business in 2023,2024-09-15,2023-12-28,Meredith Turits,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231219-ten-major-events-that-shaped-business-in-2023,"Soaring profits, stellar collapses, court cases and more – this year, big business moments abounded. Amid an uncertain economy, international political tension and leadership shake-ups, 2023 delivered big moments in business that shaped our year. They'll set the stage for the months to come. February: TikTok bans go global Prior to 2023, some governments around the world had banned the use of Chinese tech-company Bytedance's TikTok on devices, citing security concerns around data sharing with the Chinese government. In 2023, these bans spread – quickly. In February, the European Commission, European Parliament and EU Council all imposed TikTok bans on government employee devices; Canada, too, mandated the removal of the app from federal devices. Shortly after, countries including the UK, New Zealand and Denmark made similar moves. Currently, more than a dozen countries have either partial or full bans in place.  In late February, the US government gave employees 30 days to uninstall TikTok from their work devices. More than half of US states have since adopted similar bans, and even some universities and private-sector companies have moved to take these decisions. In March, the Biden Administration pushed Bytedance to sell the app, but the Chinese government swiftly announced their opposition. In May, Governor Greg Gianforte of Montana signed a bill to ban TikTok within the state, but in November, a federal judge granted a temporary injunction to stop the ban, citing First Amendment protections. March and May: Three US banks fail The failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March, and First Republic Bank in May, marked the most consequential US banking crisis since 2008. Combined, the three banks held more than $500bn (£399bn) in assets – a number that, adjusted for inflation, exceeds the holdings of the 25 banks that collapsed during the global financial crisis. The banks failed for various reasons, but their implosion kicked off a crisis of consumer confidence in the US banking system, in an economy already experiencing soaring inflation. The US government took steps to quell the panic, including providing emergency aid as well as a promise that customers beyond the FDIC insurance limit at these financial institutions would be ""made whole"". By May, the crisis seemed widely contained. But some US banks still remain vulnerable to rapid interest-rate increases, and continue to hold onto immense piles of cash amid uncertain economic conditions. Regulators have been making moves, including increasing scrutiny of risk management, to hopefully prevent similar failures in the future. May: 'Summer of strikes' kicks off with the Writer's Guild of America Organised labour was immensely active this year. Across the UK, for instance, workers in sectors including transport, healthcare, law, education and more walked out in droves, looking for higher pay, better conditions and future job security in a changing technological landscape. Perhaps the highest-profile strikes happened in the US, where millions of workers initiated work stoppages across a range of industries including health care, hospitality, education and manufacturing. The summer was a particularly active period, vaulted into the widespread public eye when the Writer's Guild of America (WGA) ­– representing more than 10,000 American screenwriters – clashed with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers over contract terms. It wasn't the union's first strike, but it lasted into September – 148 days, considerably longer than its 100-day work stoppage in 2007. In July, the Hollywood actors' guild (Sag-Aftra) joined in solidarity, then began pushing for their own contract improvements soon thereafter. Meanwhile, on 15 September, tens-of-thousands of labourers in the United Auto Workers union (UAW) began a six-week rolling strike across the three major US auto manufacturers: GM, Ford and Stellantis. The scale of the collective action was staggering, but so were workers' gains after negotiations. In many cases, global workers scored unprecedented pay rises and job-security protections, especially in an environment of rising living costs and rapid technological advancement.  May: Nvidia hits $1tn ($797bn) market cap There are few companies with a $1tn market value around the world, and in May, chipmaker Nvidia joined the vaunted club. On 30 May, the company exceeded the mega milestone, making them only the fifth in the US – joining Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon – with such a market cap. It's an important signifier for where analysts think business is heading. Nvidia makes about three-quarters of the chips for computers that power generative artificial intelligence, and the company's ascension in such a short period of time reflects the changing tech landscape around the world, as investors are betting big on the AI boom. July: Twitter becomes X In October 2022, after an excruciating period of back-and-forth negotiations, Elon Musk closed a deal to own Twitter, to the tune of $44bn (£35.1bn). The takeover began as a hostile one; within a couple weeks, the company began layoffs of nearly half its workforce. It was a startling way to cap Twitter's wild year – and only laid the foundation for what came next. Many of the biggest changes began to hit in summer 2023, beginning with the appointment of Linda Yaccarino as CEO in June, amid a crisis of dwindling advertisers ­and dwindling revenue. But the public really felt the effect in July, when Musk declared the ""Twitter"" name a relic, renaming the platform ""X"". It was a move both analysts and users panned – experts say the switch may have cost Musk essential, singular brand equity.   Since then, Musk's ownership has continued to be the subject of immense controversy and financial tumult. In October, X's value dropped to more than half of the purchase price. The platform has not only lost users, but haemorrhaged tens-of-millions of advertising dollars. Musk's response to the attrition came in a 23 November interview with DealBook's Andrew Ross Sorkin, in which the billionaire launched a profane attack slamming the brands that have left.  Another problem has just popped up for Musk and his X – in late December, the EU formally announced it suspects the platform has breached its rules in areas including disinformation and countering illegal content. September: Rupert Murdoch steps down After a shaky year in business, 92-year-old Rupert Murdoch announced he was stepping down as chairman of the board of both News Corp and Fox. Settling a Succession-esque battle, Murdoch's son Lachlan became chairman of both companies, alongside his role as Fox's CEO and executive chair. In April, Rupert Murdoch's Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit from the voting-machine company, Dominion, over its reporting of the 2020 presidential election, at the cost of  $787.5m (£620m). The billionaire global media mogul leaves during a critical time, as the 2024 US election approaches. It remains to be seen how much the business will change – if at all – under the stewardship of Lachlan, whose management style may mirror his father's. October: FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried goes on trial Throughout the past few years, experts hailed Sam Bankman-Fried as an economic pioneer – even saviour. As the founder and CEO of Bahamas-based cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Bankman-Fried legitimised the turbulent crypto market, spurring investors to infuse billions into the company. However, after running into a liquidity crisis in November 2022, the once exalted company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  In October 2023, former billionaire Bankman-Fried and several employees of FTX and crypto hedge fund Alameda Research went on trial to face charges including wire fraud, securities and commodities fraud and money laundering. Several employees pled guilty, while Bankman-Fried went on trial for a month in New York City. After testifying, 31-year-old Bankman-Fried was swiftly found guilty on all seven charges he faced. He awaits sentencing.  Since FTX was such a household name, Bankman-Fried's conviction has left a stain on the cryptocurrency industry. Others in the space are trying to move on, but it's proving difficult. Investors are sceptical and largely gun-shy to infuse capital into industry, and regulators have a close eye on what will happen next.  One additional issue eroding confidence is the November resignation of Changpeng Zhao (CZ) as CEO of massive global crypto exchange Binance. Shortly after Bankman-Fried's conviction, Zhao pled guilty to money laundering violations. The US government has ordered him to pay a $50m (£39.8m) fine, and he faces up to 18 months in prison – if not more. October: Microsoft acquires Activision Blizzard Despite the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)'s attempt to block Microsoft's acquisition of video-game developer Activision Blizzard, the $68.7bn (£54.7bn) deal closed in October. As Microsoft's largest-ever purchase, the move bolsters the company's power and profile in the gaming space.  Perhaps more importantly, however, the completion of the acquisition dealt a blow to the Biden administration's wide-reaching plans to fight mergers and acquisitions that could cause price hikes for consumers. Since October, more than $170bn (£135.4bn) worth of mergers have gone through, leaving questions open as to whether President Biden's anti-trust efforts are working.  In December, the FTC the once again challenged the legality of the merger, though anti-trust lawyers say they face a major uphill battle in their newest appeal. November: WeWork files for bankruptcy protection  Once valued at $47bn (£37.4bn), global coworking giant WeWork filed for bankruptcy protection on 6 November. Shares tumbled, leaving the troubled company valued at less than $50m (£41m). The spectacular fall had been years in the making, especially after its failed attempt at IPO in 2019, but experts still saw its downfall as stunning. Although WeWork's bankruptcy was largely due to a flawed business model that relied on excessive real estate holdings, the bankruptcy has left a question hovering over the coworking industry: does anyone still want these spaces? Experts who study work trends and entrepreneurs in the industry both say yes. Hybrid-working patterns are still leaving people wanting connection, and growing revenue figures in the industry indicate sustained demand. December: Purdue Pharma settlement reaches the US Supreme Court At year's end, the high profile lawsuits against US OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma found their way to the Supreme Court. The justices are currently deliberating whether to allow a multibillion dollar bankruptcy plan to move forward. If it does, the Sackler family – which owns the pharmaceutical company – would be shielded from any civil liabilities going forward, after a March 2022 agreement to pay out $6bn (£4.78bn) of personal holdings. The outcome of this case may set a precedent for how US corporations can use bankruptcy law to protect themselves from civil litigation. Arguments are ongoing, with a decision that will likely drag into 2024. If 2023 serves as an indicator for 2024's business landscape, there will be a lot to watch in the new year."
liquidity conditions,Is it ever OK to hike prices?,2024-09-15,2020-04-28,Christine Ro,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200427-coronavirus-can-price-hikes-by-businesses-ever-be-justified,"People hate price gouging. Can businesses navigate supply chain stress and changing consumer behaviour without raising prices – and should they? From eggs to yeast, shoppers around the world have been encountering empty grocery store shelves during the Covid-19 pandemic. Many have changed their shopping patterns as a result, visiting smaller shops, planning shopping trips for off-peak hours, replacing the usual staples, buying as a group or  – in some cases – paying higher prices.   Certain items have surged in both demand and cost. There are reports of small hand sanitiser bottles selling for €10 in Ireland and small boxes of face masks selling for more than $200 in the US. Shoppers in the UK are outraged by increased prices of meat, lentils and rice. But some people argue that price increases during crises, though they instinctively feel unfair and exploitative, might be justifiable. A key difference is between price increases which reflect the higher cost of doing business during extraordinary circumstances, and price gouging, which is one type of profiteering. Though price gouging isn’t a technical economics term with a precise definition, it’s usually understood to refer to exorbitant price increases of essential goods, often following shocks or in crises.   Yet it can be challenging to identify a reasonable mark-up that reflects businesses’ higher risks and costs, as well as to pinpoint where in the supply chain the cost increases are hitting hardest. This is especially tough amid the explosion in loosely regulated, border-spanning online sales. From price hikes to price caps The good news for high-income countries is that the food supply system is generally flexible and resilient. “The food supply chain operates on a ‘just in time’ basis,” explains Richard Sexton, an agricultural economist at the University of California, Davis. “The retail food stores have no capacity to hold excess inventories and no interest in doing it.”   The shortages in the early days of the pandemic were mainly due to panic buying, especially of non-perishables like tinned beans. “When we get an unexpected demand spike like the hoarding due to coronavirus or hoarding that might precede a natural disaster such as a hurricane, the supply chain cannot readily adjust to replenish supplies,” Sexton says.   In many cases these delays will be a temporary phenomenon as manufacturers and distributors catch up. Effects on food prices will vary, but some commodities (like sugar) are dropping in price while others (like rice) are increasing, due to changing demand and some countries’ export restrictions. These global food price changes are unlikely to be passed onto consumers immediately.   But retail delays and customer stockpiling (which has subsided in the UK and more widely) mean some goods appear to be in short supply in the short term. This creates conditions in which retailers might put up prices and consumers might be inclined to pay more. One possible response is capping prices for day-to-day essentials.   Sexton is in favour of limiting purchases of some products, something many large supermarket chains have implemented, but price caps are another story. “Price caps – below a price that would clear the market – would only exacerbate shortages.” People would be able to hoard low-cost goods, and suppliers would have less incentive to pump out more low-margin products. Sexton notes that this can be a hard message to swallow: “As a society, nobody wants to see anybody profiteering from an international tragedy, so the idea of limiting that is very appealing. But in a lot of cases, the impact of price increases is to call forth more supplies.” Matt Zwolinski, a political philosopher at the University of San Diego, agrees that higher prices have the vital function of signalling to manufacturers that it’s worthwhile to create more supply. Otherwise it may not be worth disrupting their businesses and taking risks during a health emergency. “Price increases both limit demand and increase supply. And for a lot of goods, that’s exactly what we need,” Zwolinski argues.   When it comes to grocery deliveries, for example, he says we should “pay drivers more, charge customers more and get the supply up to a level where it’s sufficient to meet the massively increased demand”. He believes that this applies even in the case of essential medical equipment like ventilators (although desperate US states have engaged in bidding wars for ventilators and other critical equipment). In general, many economists believe that price caps aren’t effective, and could even be counterproductive, in emergencies. They might encourage fighting and overcrowding in stores as people compete for scarce-yet-affordable goods. If price hikes lead people to conserve in-demand goods more carefully, price caps can worsen shortages. A black market, with even higher prices, may be likely to emerge.   Yet Nobel Prize Laureate Paul Krugman has bucked this common belief among economists by writing, “if disasters are followed by a free-for-all, with very high prices for essentials, the stakes of inequality become much higher. Those who can’t afford high prices face extreme privation, even death, while those with sufficient wealth face no more than inconvenience.”   This is especially significant for items whose use is beneficial for everyone’s health, not just the individual’s. South Korea, one of the rare bright spots of pandemic response, has reduced the market price of face masks in addition to limiting the number each person can buy. This has required a high level of coordination to avoid rationing, a government push to ramp up production of masks, and pharmacies willing to lose money on the sale of an important public good.   So price caps can promote public health. But, unless governments are willing to provide substantial support, they may not be able to keep businesses afloat. Tough decisions facing small businesses   It’s at the small business level that fluctuations in both supply chains and consumer patterns can be felt most keenly.   Janine Tozer runs Not Just Pets, two pet supply shops in Frome and Bath, in England. She explains that some items “are becoming almost impossible for us to purchase from our suppliers”, and sales have suffered as a result. So far, though, supply prices haven’t increased significantly, and her business is somewhat fortunate in that there are plenty of substitutes for customers’ first-choice items.   Tozer understands businesses’ temptation to raise prices of sought-after products as a buffer against all the uncertainty. That uncertainty – about when government support will kick in, about whether people will once more buy the pet accessories that generate greater profit than pet food, about whether customers will return after lockdown finally ends – is the hardest part.   As infection rates climbed across the UK, some MPs and councils investigated reports from residents of price spikes in local retailers. Some have been named and shamed, particularly on social media. Andrew Goodacre, CEO of the British Independent Retailers Association (Bira), says he has no support for businesses that are seen to be exploiting consumer demand. But naming and shaming isn’t a structural response. Bira’s members have a cash liquidity problem that ripples up and down the supply chain. Many hardware stores, for instance, which are considered essential businesses in the UK, can’t afford to pay for delivered supplies due to plummeting sales, and thus manufacturers can’t guarantee further supply. The government support to small businesses will help, but not all businesses will be able to hold on until then – or survive even with the assistance.   Consumer anger might be reduced if retailers better explain the reasons for their price hikes, if any. Tozer acknowledges that if wholesale prices were to rise substantially, without a good explanation from suppliers, she would have to pass on some of those higher prices to consumers. She would prefer to limit quantities per customer rather than raise prices, but in any case she would inform customers of the reasons for pricing changes, rather than letting them assume the worst.   “We always try to convey anything that changes within the business to our customers,” Tozer says. “I think being transparent is the only way to go especially in the current situation because people want to know what’s going on.” Shaping regulation – and reputation    Yet all the transparency in the world may not be enough for consumers worried by the state of their finances. People are instinctively repelled by anything they perceive as price gouging, and moral psychology research suggests that this is a powerful feeling.   Apsana Begum, a member of parliament representing the densely populated East London area of Poplar and Limehouse, says she’s heard plenty of people vent about high prices. Especially in the early days of the crisis, it was hard for people to pay two or three times the normal prices for toilet roll and hand wash at smaller businesses. “This was actually causing a lot of anger locally, and understandably so.”   Begum is sympathetic to the small businesses struggling to keep the lights on and applauds the many traders that have not sought to profit from the emergency. Some butchers, especially, report increased prices from suppliers and are just trying to pay the bills. Other costs that may have increased, for retailers of all sizes, include hazard pay and more overtime for existing staff, the hiring of temporary employees, higher transport costs and purchases of more protective and cleaning equipment (even though some governments are covering portions of these expenses).   Yet Begum believes that overall the government needs to do more to safeguard a sense of community responsibility among retailers. Last month she tabled an early day motion (a motion submitted for parliamentary debate) calling for stronger government action against price hikes. Begum urges more analysis of how businesses in different categories, including suppliers and wholesalers, are affected by the crisis. Also helpful, she says, would be further resources directed to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is fielding complaints from consumers and pleading with businesses not to price gouge.   Nicole Kar, head of UK competition at the law firm Linklaters, believes that this motion could lead to action if it’s accompanied by a groundswell of people complaining on social media, consumer advice organisations campaigning and – especially – further government consideration of “wartime” measures against profiteering. In many countries, she explains, price gouging is not in itself illegal. In the UK, only monopolistic practices or collusion between businesses would typically be illegal.   France has capped retail and wholesale prices of hydroalcoholic gels for sanitising hands. China has prohibited unnecessary stockpiling of some protective medical equipment and food. Australia has made it illegal for retailers to purchase items like goggles and resell them for a mark-up of more than 20%. US states have a patchwork of laws, but California’s anti-price gouging statute limits price increases to 10% if a state of emergency is declared. Kar says that so far South Africa has gone furthest. Its government has calculated an unfair or excessive price as being higher than cost increases and an average mark-up between December 2019 and February 2020. A “dominant firm” that contravenes these laws could face a fine of 10% of annual turnover, or a representative could face up to 12 months in prison. This kind of government action is ultimately more effective than the slow case-by-case process of regulators receiving and responding to complaints. “We haven’t seen any actual enforcement at the moment,” Kar says of the CMA in the UK, which is likely to resort to writing warning letters and making examples of high-profile profiteers.   It’s often very difficult, however, to identify exactly where in the supply chain the price increases are stemming from, and it’s especially hard to police online sales – where price hikes have been noted by consumer groups. These price gouging laws and warnings also typically won’t apply to the small businesses where many of the price hikes have been seen, because the laws often focus on “dominant” companies, as in South Africa. Agricultural economist Sexton explains of smaller firms: “They’re being squeezed more by the shortages than the big supermarkets, simply because they’re less important customers for the distributors.”   Some business owners, meanwhile, might argue that if they are working harder to serve communities despite potential health risks, they perhaps deserve to earn a bit more and potentially pay their staff more. As has been pointed out, those currently keeping nations running are often on the lowest incomes.      Overall, economists and others, including the people interviewed for this article, tend to agree on one point: price gouging comes with significant risks to reputation. While this is especially likely to keep large chains in check, smaller businesses can’t afford to let their reputations take a dive either. As Tozer of Not Just Pets puts it: “I just wonder… if you’ll retain the custom in the future if you do this, because people might see you as being unscrupulous.” She believes that to keep customers in the long run, it’s important to avoid raising their ire.   Surely customers would agree with that as well.  "
liquidity conditions,Ryanair warns refunds to take up to six months,2024-09-15,2020-05-01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52498691,"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has said it will take up to six months to refund passengers for flights cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. He told the BBC the airline was struggling to process a backlog of 25 million refunds with reduced staff. However, he pledged: ""If you want a cash refund, you will receive a cash refund."" Ryanair is set to cut 3,000 jobs - 15% of its workforce - as it restructures to cope with the coronavirus crisis. It said the 3,000 posts under threat were mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs. There are likely to be pay cuts of up to 20% for remaining staff, the airline added. Mr O'Leary told the BBC that the planned cuts were ""the minimum that we need just to survive the next 12 months"".  He said that if a vaccine was not found, ""we may have to announce more cuts and deeper cuts in future"". Brian Strutton, the general secretary of pilots' union Balpa, said: ""There has been no warning or consultation by Ryanair about the 3,000 potential job losses and this is miserable news for pilots and staff who have taken pay cuts under the government job retention scheme. ""Ryanair seems to have done a U-turn on its ability to weather the Covid storm."" The restructuring could involve closing some UK regional hubs, Mr O'Leary said, but he would not say which ones were at risk. He said Ryanair hoped to announce details of job losses and pay cuts by 1 July. Mr O'Leary, whose pay was cut by 50% for April and May, has now agreed to extend it for the remainder of the financial year to March 2021.   Litigation lawyer Jonathan Compton, a partner at law firm DMH Stallard, took issue with the idea that ticket refunds could be delayed. ""Where a flight is cancelled, the legal position is clear, the airline must provide a full refund within seven working days,"" he said. ""Regulators need to get more active here. The relevant regulator is the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The CAA must start instructing airlines to start making refunds, no ifs or buts, and it needs to do this now."" Ryanair said it expected to report a net loss of more than €100m (£87m) for the first three months of the year, with further losses in the second quarter. In a sideswipe at rivals, it said its return to scheduled services would be rendered more difficult by competing with flag carrier airlines, ""who will be financing below cost selling with the benefit of over €30bn in unlawful state aid, in breach of both EU state aid and competition rules"". Ryanair said it had entered the coronavirus crisis with reserves of almost €4bn in cash and continued to ""actively manage"" those resources in order to survive the pandemic. Mr O'Leary described airlines such as Lufthansa, Air France and Alitalia as ""subsidy junkies running around Europe hoovering up state aid"". Meanwhile, Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air is resuming flights from Luton airport starting on Friday, but passengers will be required to wear masks while on board. The airline is among the first European carriers to begin restoring services that have been suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic. The flights will be heading for destinations in Spain, Portugal, Israel, Slovakia, Serbia, Romania and Hungary.      But Wizz Air warned that because of ""rapid changes in travel restrictions, the list might be adapted"". The move comes despite unchanged advice from the Foreign Office against all foreign non-essential travel.  In another development, London's Heathrow airport, normally the busiest in Europe, has said it expects passenger numbers to have fallen 97% in April as demand slumped. Numbers fell 18.8% to 14.6 million during the first three months of the year, the airport said. But it added: ""Heathrow remains open - and continues operating safely to help people get home and to secure vital supply lines for the UK."" Financially, it was ""robust"", it said. ""Heathrow has £3.2bn in liquidity, sufficient to maintain the business at least over the next 12 months, even with no passengers,"" it added. Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye told the BBC's Today programme that until a coronavirus vaccine could be developed, airports would have to introduce measures to minimise infection once lockdowns started to ease. ""What this might include - and this needs to be agreed with governments and the aviation sector - is a combination of measures and that might include some kind of health screening as you come into the terminal so that perhaps if that's a temperature check, if you have a high temperature, you may not be allowed to fly,"" he said. ""As you go through the airport, you will probably be wearing a face mask, as people from Asia have been doing ever since Sars came out."" Have you been affected by job losses at Ryanair?

liquidity conditions,How to buy fabulous fine art,2024-09-15,2014-02-23,Megan Snedden,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20140221-how-to-buy-fabulous-fine-art,"Art Shares Can't finance your own Rembrandt? Try art on for size instead. Renting art from online companies such as Sydney Art Exchange in Australia, Rock Around Asia in Bangkok, and Get Art Up in San Francisco
is becoming a popular option for prospective collectors.  The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art offers two and three-month
rentals based on the purchasing price of an artwork. A piece valued at $30,000
could be yours for three months at $1,200 excluding sales tax and installation
service charges of around $100 per hour. It is also common for groups of people to pool money into an art fund,
then hire an adviser who will buy a work and sell it for profit some years
later, said Jim Minich, managing director at CTC Consulting a part of BMO Financial Group's Chicago office.  Bill Dimas’s love affair with fine art developed as a child growing up in the small city of Corinth on the Greek mainland. When not visiting ancient archaeological sites, Dimas passed his time happily painting murals on his bedroom walls. Travelling through Europe as a teenager, he dragged friends through every gallery in a bid to catch a glimpse of the Great European Masters. Eventually moving to Sydney, Australia, Dimas, met John Wiltshire, a fellow enthusiast. They bought their first three works together from a contemporary artist in New Zealand for $250 to 500NZD ($209 to $418) while the paintings were still wet. “We were just starting our careers, but realised great work doesn’t necessarily have a particular price point,” Dimas said. To an aspiring collector, looking in on the contemporary art world it might seem an exclusive, inaccessible, club where multimillion-dollar purchases are common. But today there are more ways than ever for inexperienced buyers to educate themselves and with luck get their hands on their very own masterpiece, especially contemporary paintings.   New ways to track down coveted pieces are myriad with many galleries also launching online stores, auction houses and references online making art buying more accessible and affordable. Hunting for the next Andy Warhol could mean not only finding works for $1,000 or less but also earning a fortune from your investment twenty years down the track. If an emerging artist develops a successful career then their works skyrocket in value. Jeff Koons’ statue Balloon Dog (Orange) broke world records last year at a Christie’s auction when it sold for $58.4m. But when he was starting out as an artist, his work sold for a fraction: as little as $3,000 in 1985. While tastes vary, buying is almost always motivated by passion; a work could have far more emotional value to someone than its price tag belies. Dimas and Wiltshire, for instance, still own those first paintings they bought. “Art goes beyond business. We had no idea who this artist was but we loved what we saw, and his work just happened to be in our price point,” Dimas said. For most people, knowing exactly what to buy, where to buy it and at what price will secure the most lucrative deal or sentimental purchase. But expert assistance might be necessary, depending on how much you’re looking to invest. Here’s a look at how to buy fabulous fine art. How to buy it Begin your quest on a weekend afternoon or evening and you just might find yourself rubbing elbows with famous painters at opening exhibition parties. Gallery directors like Angela Di Bello of Agora Gallery in New York, will give you a comprehensive background of the artists on display. If you make a genuine impression, Di Bello said most galleries will give a 10% discount on art purchases. Others might go as far as introducing you to the artist. The rise of the art websites — there are more than 300 now — is another big trend that helps would-be buyers. Experts also say these online transaction platforms could eventually increase valuation of art because they add liquidity to the lower end of the market. Think of it as the younger generation coming in and saying “‘there’s got to be a way to make this accessible to us,” said Tze Chun, CEO of online art marketplace Uprise Art. Chun’s company sells the work of contemporary emerging artists for $10,000 or less and gives the option to pay off some works in unlimited monthly instalments of $50 to $100, without interest. Also online, Artstar sells limited edition fine art prints, but if it’s the originals you’re after,  there’s Paddle8 and Artnet. Always remember to read the website’s terms and conditions. If you need to limit your options and want the satisfaction of walking away with a painting under your arm art fairs are becoming increasingly popular. The global Affordable Art Fair visits the Americas, Asia, and Europe, selling pieces between $100 and $10,000. Art to profit from? If you’re looking for long-term value, Australia-based curator Amanda Love, a private art consultant, said it is important to first set a budget and then invest in major works within that price bracket. Quality should play into your decision, but remember that a work develops historical importance based on its critical acclaim in the art community — which can take time — she said. “There’s no point in buying a fifth-rate Picasso when you could buy a fabulous Rebecca Warren sculpture for the same price,” Love explained. Love charges a per-annum $2,000 retainer to guide her clients through the art world, helping them forge relationships and educate themselves by previewing works in museums, galleries and through her members-only archive. It can take two years or more for some clients to decide on a purchase. Many large auction houses like Sotheby’s in Beijing and Zurich have consultants who match private buyers and sellers and advise on auction sales. Can’t afford a consultant? Websites like Artsy and ArtDiscover help buyers research the work of some 18,000 artists from around the world.  And you could still learn a thing or two at auctions, even if you don’t go to buy. Diana Wierbicki, head of art law at Withers Worldwide in New York, said some people are attending the sales just to gauge pricing trends and artist popularity, later buying works privately. To finance a pricey work, banks will typically lend art buyers 50% the value of the piece with interest rates of as low as 2%, said Jim Minich, managing director at CTC Consulting a part of BMO Financial Group's Chicago office. Buyers can take a personal loan to finance less famous works. Post-purchase, some owners use their collection as collateral and borrow money against its value, investing the cash in stocks or mutual funds. The fine print of ownership New buyers beware: there are many logistical elements involved in the acquisition process. You might want to hire a lawyer to ensure loans taken out by the former owner of a piece of art are paid off. Some people take loans to finance their purchase while others might put the art up for collateral on another loan. It’s critical on pricey works to make sure the art isn’t tied up in a loan. “It used to be a hand shake-type industry, which was fine when prices were lower. Now that it’s an asset class, it needs to be treated more like real estate,” Wierbicki said.Always negotiate contracts and pricing. If you don’t negotiate (and understand) the terms laid out in the contract, Wierbicki said, later on if, say,  you find out the work is a forgery, it can be impossible to get your money back. Newbies may not know that just because someone presents you an invoice with a price, that amount is not a concrete asking price, she added. You should also always familiarise yourself with local laws when purchasing overseas. At auctions in Paris, for example, a museum has the authority to trump a buyer. To ensure authenticity, buyers must also secure an official bill of sale. Forgeries are near impossible to spot if you aren’t trained and art stolen by the Nazis during World War II has recently emerged on the market, adding to ownership questions. Art insurance covers physical damage, accidents or theft and can be added onto your home insurance for $2 annually per every $1,000 of coverage. For low-value works, a homeowners policy should be sufficient. Passionate collectors like Dimas and Wiltshire say they enjoy art collecting as a lifestyle, not necessarily an investment. To that end, the pair opened aMBUSH Gallery to help develop Sydney’s street art scene. “We had been buying art from the heart and decided to give these artists a fair go,” Dimas said. “Seven years, 86 projects and over 3 million visitors later, we’re still going.”"
