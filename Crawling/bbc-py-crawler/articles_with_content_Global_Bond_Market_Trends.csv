Global Bond Market Trends,A J-pop sensation's guide to Tokyo's music scene,2024-09-14,2024-05-05,Mayra Peralta,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240503-a-j-pop-bands-favourite-live-music-experiences-in-tokyo,"YOASOBI breaks musical barriers both in their native Japan and overseas. Here's how they enjoy Tokyo's hottest live music, from buskers in Shibuya to concerts at Nippon Budokan. Vibrant subcultures and the second largest music market in the world make Tokyo a bucket list-worthy ""music destination""; delighting locals and visitors alike with its sheer diversity. We spoke with chart-topping J-pop sensation YOASOBI, aka Vocaloid music producer Ayase and singer Ikura, to get a feel for the city’s musical landscape. The SpeciaList Comprised of composer Ayase and vocalist Ikura, YOASOBI is a record-breaking J-pop duo taking over global music charts with singles such as Idol and The Brave. Originally drawing musical inspiration from fiction published on Monogatary.com, the pair are renowned for transforming written works into sonically innovative chart-toppers. Their hit Idol surged as the first song performed in Japanese to top Billboard’s Global Excl. US chart. ""Given that Tokyo is the capital and the biggest city in Japan, a lot of the creative talent and artists gather [here] to explore cutting-edge sounds and music,"" says Ayase, whose wildly popular collaborations with Ikura were originally based on short stories from Monogatary.com; Sony Music Entertainment Japan's social network for creative artists. ""A lot of the trends and sounds are set in Tokyo; that’s why the music scene is so high level."" Long before YOASOBI became internationally famous, Tokyo eclectic musical culture and venues allowed them to perfect their unique, literary-inspired sound. ""In Japan and Tokyo, there's a lot of individuality, so whether you go to the clubs or live houses or maybe [to] a specific venue to see an artist you like, there's not just one space where all that culture is packed into,"" says Ayase. Discovering Tokyo is an endless journey of exploration, with something to offer to every music enthusiast, from nostalgia-fueled city pop to experimental sounds. Here are Ayase and Ikura's favourite ways to experience Tokyo's contemporary music scene. Frenetically dynamic, Shibuya has become one of Tokyo's most popular destinations. Spanning 15 sq km and brimming with venues that cater to different music crowds, the district attracts everyone from curious passersby enjoying street performances to connoisseurs exploring the live music scene.  Shibuya is the epicentre of trends and a mandatory stop for visitors, says Ayase. He recommends first-time travellers and those who want to discover Tokyo’s music offerings start off by exploring the district on foot. ""Shibuya is where you can experience the hottest trends in terms of music,"" he says. ""It centres around the younger generation so they drive a lot of the culture, whether it’s fashion, the clubbing scene or music. The town is very lively so [...] you’re going to hear music almost 24/7… You can walk in the city and see these huge LED billboards where a lot of artists are promoting their latest work and teasing their music videos.""  Ikura encourages visitors to pay attention to buskers in the area. ""At the corner of the Shibuya Scramble Crossing, in front of Tsutaya, you can find street musicians playing,"" she says. A landmark of Shibuya's world-famous intersection, the Tsutaya book store is located right in front of the Shibuya JR [train] Station and is, as Ikura explains, ""just two steps away from the Hachiko [dog] statue"". Address: 2 Dogenzaka, Shibuya-ku, 150-0043 Tokyo Instagram: @city_shibuya_official Perhaps no other place on the planet flaunts the diversity of Tokyo’s live music landscape quite so well as ""live houses"" – venues of varied sizes and aesthetics that host gigs every night. And there’s no shortage of options; all acts and musical genres, from jazz to heavy metal, find a place in the eclectic Tokyo scene. A superb example is Shibuya Gee ge, an unassuming and intimate venue with a motley selection of show listings. The live house, which is slated to celebrate its 14th anniversary in September 2024, is equipped with a grand piano and a high-quality audio system often commended by local artists. Before rising to global stardom, Ikura occassionally performed here and still recommends it without a second thought. ""You can find good singer-songwriters playing at this venue,"" she says.

Originally conceived as a martial arts hall for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Budokan is an octagonal arena-style venue steeped in music history. ""We have a lot of sentiment and memories there because it's a very famous venue where the top artists from Japan perform,"" says Ikura. The storied venue has witnessed legendary moments of music history over the years. In 1966, the arena welcomed The Beatles for a five-date concert, establishing a rock 'n roll tradition perpetuated by groups such as Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Cheap Trick. Tip Keeping up with music acts and events in Tokyo is not always an easy feat. Ayase’s tip: make the internet your ally. ""The entire town has a lot of music playing all the time so you can go to the clubs or any type of live house to listen to bands, pop, EDM,"" he says. ""If you look at social media, you can find all kinds of events and performances that are ongoing. So go to Shibuya, have some drinks, have some fun, look up events online and attend."" Budokan's reputation as one of Japan's most iconic concert halls grew exponentially over the years as stars sold out concerts and recorded critically acclaimed live albums. Nowadays, the venue remains a coveted and prestigious location for international and local acts. ""Performing there is usually the dream of upcoming artists and it was our dream as well,"" Ikura says. ""YOASOBI became really active in the middle of the Covid-19 [pandemic] so we couldn’t do a lot of performances in front of an audience. In December 2021, we got to perform in the Budokan for the first time with a live audience and it was such a memorable experience for us to be performing in the same venue where [emblematic] artists have performed.""

Located in Western Tokyo, about 20km from Shibuya, this enchanting spot is Ikura’s recommendation for outdoor music performances. ""When I was still a student, I used to hang out a lot in the area of Kichijoji. I spent a better part of my teen years there, more specifically, in a park called Inokashira Park,"" she says. ""I used to perform on the street back when I was really young. That experience of performing in front of the public put me on the path of [becoming] an artist and my music-writing and music-making career originated there. Kichijoji and that park are very intimate place for me in terms of my musical history."" Inokashira Park, however, is not only relevant to Ikura’s personal story; the park has served as the filming location of music-centered movies such as Parks, starring Mei Nagano, and hosts outdoor concerts and music festivals every year. Address: 1-18-31, Gotenyama, Musashino-shi, Tokyo   Recognised as the home of counterculture movements in Tokyo, the Koenji neighbourhood reflects Tokyo’s edgy and unconventional spirit, and is littered with vintage shops, music bars and live houses. In fact, Koenji is known as the birthplace of the punk movement in Japan. ""There’s a lot of culture there between actors, actresses, bands, artists, creatives and even comedians,"" says Ayase of the creative hub, just two metro stops from Shibuya. The artistic offerings in Koenji are varied, ranging from vintage record stores to indie rock and punk basement bars. However, Ayase, who has long been part of the neighbourhood’s artistic community, recommends walking around the Koenji Station for the most authentic experience. ""There are a lot of musicians playing their songs in this station area,"" he says. ""I used to be in a [rock] band and we moved to Tokyo with the dream to perform and make it big one day. The first place I arrived in Tokyo was Koenji. It was a very fun experience for me, looking back. I think [about] it as a big milestone for my musical career."" Address: 4 Chome-48-2 Koenjiminami, Suginami City, Tokyo 166-0003 You can't talk about Tokyo’s contemporary music scene without mentioning its nightlife and gig culture. ""I think there’s a very strong club culture in Shibuya so whether [you’re looking for] a hip hop-type of vibe or an EDM type of vibe, you can find a lot of those clubs in this area in Shibuya called Dogenzaka,"" says Ayase. With a slew of entertainment spaces dedicated to different genres, Dogenzaka Street is a go-to for whoever wants to lose themselves to the beat. Options are endless and cater to different tastes, but Ayase mentions a specific Shibuya institution that has been open since 1996, pioneering the ""all music-genres"" scene and accommodating different music acts from DJs to rappers.   ""Club Asia, specifically is a good example,"" he says. ""But there’s also a lot of live houses that you can attend close to the Shibuya Station. There’s definitely a lot of options.""

Global Bond Market Trends,'We're getting more orders thanks to the virus',2024-09-14,2020-02-27,By Simon Browning,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51654215,"Thirty years ago Bhavik Master's parents watched in dismay as orders for their fine knitwear, chunky winter jumpers and cardigans disappeared overseas.  Retailers had discovered they could cut costs by ordering from Chinese manufacturers.  Now though the tables may be turning thanks to the coronavirus. ""We're seeing an increase in inquiries and confirmed orders coming through,"" says Bhavik. Their factory, based in Leicester under the brand Paul James, is located in a sprawling network of long narrow rooms, filled with looms, colourful yarns and expert sewers seated in rows. Like dozens of British manufacturers in towns and cities across the UK they could soon be piecing together orders for clients they once lost, because the coronavirus is causing chaos for big retailers and their supply chains.  As factories in China remain largely closed, High Street shops are urgently looking at how they can plug gaps for products that are due on shelves in as little as eight weeks.  ""A lot of retailers are worried they'll have no stock in the stores soon because so much comes from the Far East now, particularly in textiles,"" says Kate Hills from Make it British. She set up the new trade body a decade ago when she saw the impact the outbreak of the Sars virus was having on the fashion industry. She struggled to find UK firms to manufacture garments. ""We're so heavily reliant on boats coming from China [but] it takes weeks to get here. We are going to start running out of stock in the stores unless we find manufacturers locally and that's what businesses are now trying to do."" For decades, big British retailers turned their backs on UK garment manufacturers. Hundreds of textile factories in towns across the UK closed as High Street stores preferred to buy cheaper clothes from China.  But the virus has laid bare how exposed global trade is to a sudden shock, as supply lines have been interrupted. It is presenting big opportunities for the factories that did survive to fill those gaps.  ""In particular, it is things like seasonal products,"" says Ms Hills. ""We're coming into the season for swimwear and that's nearly all made in China and you're going to start seeing a lack of those products in stores or certainly a lot less than you would have before.""  In a survey sent out to her members across the UK, almost 100 responded, describing the increase in demand they've seen. ""All different sorts of products people are looking to make here now: knitwear, dress factories getting increased orders, even demand for face masks - we're being asked if we know people who can make them!"" Bhavik can't divulge who his new customers are, but he thinks it is high time British retailers realised the benefits of ordering closer to home.  ""I think in the 80s and 90s, China was very good at investing in its local factories and local production and investing in modern machinery. But now the rest of the world has caught up, and I think it is time for brands to look further afield and spread that production risk,"" he says. A product made in a UK factory can reach the shop shelves eight to 12 weeks after it's ordered, much faster than the five to six months it takes to transport it on a boat from China. In that time, a fashion trend may have passed altogether.  Specialised Canvas in Chesterfield has also seen a growth in orders following the coronavirus outbreak. It is one of the only manufacturers in the UK of pathogen isolation chambers, used to transport and treat people with severe infection and health problems. They made chambers that were used for Ebola patients.  As concern about how to treat coronavirus intensifies, managing director Paul Noble says ""manufacturing products for infection control is seeing increased inquiries and orders for products to be used potentially in the treatment of the outbreak"". On the first floor of the factory, engineers Karen and Ellen meticulously put parts of the isolation chambers together. They cut and bond panels of thick industrial plastic into sections. Today they are making funnels so arms can reach inside the chamber to treat patients. They will be bought by the government and used by the NHS, RAF and Ministry of Defence.   The other side of Paul's manufacturing business, which makes bags and straps, is also seeing growth propelled by clients wanting to make more in the UK. As part of the survey results, manufacturers described how some retailers appeared surprised at the low costs of producing in the UK now, with the added bonus of proximity to the market, cutting transport costs and potentially enhancing their environmental credentials.  A small increase in demand at this early stage doesn't represent an immediate switch back to UK production, and there may not be businesses left now that can meet every increase in demand. ""I do know some factories who are turning some of the new orders away as they want to stick with loyal original customers,"" says Kate Hills. ""They're worried they'll come in, place new orders and then go back to China when virus has blown over. They don't want the hassle of working with them anymore."""
Global Bond Market Trends,Glasgow hails increase in visitor numbers,2024-09-14,2018-07-31,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-45018809,"The number of tourists who visited Glasgow rose by almost 20% last year. Travel Trends data from the Office for National Statistics also found expenditure increased by more than a third to £319m. Glasgow's growth outperformed the Scottish average which saw visitor numbers increase by 17% to 3.2m and spending up 23% to £2.3bn. The majority of the city's tourists in 2017 came from Europe and North America. David McDonald, chairman of Glasgow Life and deputy leader of Glasgow City Council, said: ""Attracting more international visitors through creative marketing and inspirational content is at the heart of Glasgow's tourism plan. ""Our focus is on showcasing Glasgow as an outstanding global city - one that's welcoming, vibrant and culturally rich with an unrivalled visitor experience and world-class customer service. ""We know the global tourism market is fiercely competitive, but there's no shortage of compelling reasons to visit Glasgow and that's reflected in these record figures, which is a real boost to our reputation and tourism economy."" The figures were published as the city prepares to co-host the inaugural European Championships with Berlin. They found visitor numbers increased by 19% to 787,000 while expenditure increased by 36%. The ONS figures also highlighted a 40% rise in the number of people visiting from North America compared with 2016. European tourists spent £114m while North American visitors contributied £86m. The average trip lasted five nights. Glasgow also attracted more North American visitors than Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool. The city has benefitted from major events such as Celtic Connections, the World Pipe Band Championships and the World Irish Dancing Championships which generated nearly £34m for the local economy. Glasgow also welcomed a record 500 conferences, worth £123m  Malcolm Roughead, chief executive of VisitScotland, said: ""Tourism is the heartbeat of the Scottish economy and touches every community; generating income, jobs and social change.  ""The results of this rise in overseas tourism to Glasgow will see ripple effects across the city and beyond."""
Global Bond Market Trends,Caution prevails on low-key deadline day,2024-09-14,2021-02-02,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/55803508,"Joshua King completed a move to Everton in the last minutes of deadline day, while Ben Davies and Ainsley Maitland-Niles joined Liverpool and West Brom respectively To say transfer deadline day was quiet would be an understatement - and is illustrated by the fact late attention centred on whether Bournemouth's Joshua King would opt for Everton or Fulham, and whether Southampton would seal a loan for Liverpool's Takumi Minamino. In the end, Norway striker King chose Everton while Saints landed Japan forward Minamino as both deals were confirmed in the early hours of Tuesday morning, with Southampton submitting a deal sheet for Minamino that allows clubs two hours beyond the 23:00 GMT deadline to complete a transfer. They may not go down as the most exciting 'after-hours' signings we've seen but were pretty much as intriguing as it got for hardcore followers of the window, with caution rather than drama dominating the last day of trading. Recap of deadline day as it happened All the deadline-day deals in one place Just three permanent deals were completed by Premier League clubs, and double that number of loan moves. The total of transfer fees paid for players in the winter window was the lowest since the £60m spent in 2012. According to financial services firm Deloitte, £70m was spent this time - way down on the £230m paid out last year.  Reigning champions Liverpool gave us most of the interest, bringing in two centre-backs within a couple of hours in order to ease their defensive problems. Even then, though, one cost a couple of million and the other was on loan. Some of Deloitte's other key findings from the window include: There were only 24 Premier League transfers during the window, compared to the average of 46 across the previous three years' January windows. The 'big six' Premier League clubs (Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester Utd, Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea) made just three permanent transfers and three loan fee transfers, accounting for 35% of the total spend. The current bottom four clubs in the table only spent £6m on seven new players. The clubs in the same position last season completed a total of eight signings for a value of £40m. The volume of transfers in January 2021 across the other four 'big five' European leagues was just over half their previous three-year average for January. Liverpool brought in defenders Ozan Kabak, left, and Ben Davies, right, on deadline day Liverpool turned to the Championship and the Bundesliga to bolster their injury-hit defence as Ben Davies made a surprise move from Preston in a deal worth £2m, while Turkey's Ozan Kabak arrived on loan from Schalke. Brighton's capture of highly rated Ecuador midfielder Moises Caicedo and Everton's signing of King were the only other permanent moves. Caicedo joined the Seagulls from Independiente del Valle for £4m while King's switch from Bournemouth was for a nominal fee. The other deals were all loans. In addition to Liverpool adding Kabak and the Saints completing a late deal for Minamino, Newcastle brought in Arsenal midfielder Joe Willock for the remainder of the season while his Gunners team-mate Ainsley Maitland-Niles moved to West Brom, who also brought in midfielder Okay Yokuslu on a loan deal from Spanish side Celta Vigo. Fulham bolstered their attacking options with the loan signing of former Sunderland striker Josh Maja from Bordeaux. The two biggest deals completed in the whole window were Manchester United's purchase of Amad Diallo - the Red Devils paying Atalanta an initial £19m for the winger, with a further £18.2m in add-ons - and West Ham's £20m signing of Said Benrahma from Brentford.  Both those deals had been agreed last summer. Aston Villa's signing of midfielder Morgan Sanson from Marseille for a reported £14m, external was the only other major deal done in January.  The obvious reason is the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on clubs' finances. Deloitte estimates, external the top 20 highest-earning football clubs in the world alone will have lost two billion euros (£1.77bn) as a result of Covid-19. Dan Jones, partner at the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said: ""Premier League clubs were understandably cautious in the January transfer window given the ongoing financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  ""Despite this, Premier League clubs' very busy summer window, at a time when the rest of European football was more restrained, saw total net expenditure for the 2020-21 season reach a new record level of £950m.  ""It remains to be seen if the relatively low activity in January will continue throughout 2021. We certainly do not expect to see another new record this summer."" Jones added: ""During the January 2021 window, Premier League clubs' expenditure on players from non-English clubs fell to just £45m. In the previous two January transfer windows, Premier League clubs' spend on this category of expenditure averaged £165m.  ""While new post-Brexit rules on acquiring players from overseas may have contributed to this, the financial impact of the pandemic was, by far, a more important factor."" Former Liverpool player Don Hutchison told BBC Radio 5 live: ""It might happen again in the summer but I think the pandemic in this window is why no-one was seeing a couple of £100m players coming in."" An additional challenge is the fact transfer deals are now subject to new immigration criteria as a result of Brexit. Britain left Europe's customs union and single market on 31 December last year The UK left the European Union on New Year's Eve last year and clubs have found their pursuit of some players scuppered because they no longer qualify for a work permit because of the change in rules. West Brom boss Sam Allardyce said earlier this month, external that he missed out on three players because of the new regulations, and that they have made life ""a bit more difficult"". Sami Khedira left Juventus to join Hertha Berlin in Germany on deadline day Similar trends can be seen across the other 'big five' European leagues as the financial impact of the pandemic is felt across the continent. The volume of transfers in January 2021 across the other four 'big five' European leagues was just over half their previous three-year average for January., while transfer spend in the January window has plunged from a collective 660m euros to €195m euros across the Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1 and Serie A. Juventus midfielder Sami Khedira made a permanent move to Bundesliga side Hertha Berlin while a couple of players left the Premier League to head to Turkey - Everton striker Cenk Tosun joined Besiktas on loan and Galatasaray signed Newcastle full-back DeAndre Yedlin on a free transfer. Elsewhere, Olivier Ntcham left Celtic for French side Marseille on loan until the end of the season Dennis Bergkamp (left) and Mauricio Pochettino may be making a few visits to Vicarage Road in the future It may have been a quiet transfer window but there were still some moves that caught the imagination. Championship side Watford appeared to have turned back the clock by signing Bergkamp and Pochettino - but it wasn't the Arsenal legend or the former Argentina defender who made the move to the Hornets. It was their sons. Midfielder Mitchel Bergkamp, 22, joined the club on a six-month contract while winger Maurizio Pochettino, 19, signed on a free transfer after leaving Tottenham. Nineteen-year-old winger D'Margio Wright-Phillips - son of Shaun Wright-Phillips and grandson of Ian Wright - was reported to be on his way on loan, external from Manchester City to Stoke, while the Potters let Tom Ince - son of Paul - join Championship rivals Luton on loan. Not necessarily, because clubs can sign free agents after the deadline - at any stage of the season in fact - but they must have left their previous club before the transfer window closed. No loan signings can be made by EFL or Premier League clubs after the deadline, except in extreme circumstances - such as a club's senior goalkeepers all being unavailable. It was perhaps no surprise that the January 2021 transfer window was a pretty quiet one - the world had enough on its plate to worry too much about West Ham adding an extra body in midfield. But there were enough intriguing moves in the Premier League and further afield for us to put a quiz together. So, can you name these 10 January moves?

Global Bond Market Trends,What if the world cancelled debts for climate?,2024-09-14,2023-12-13,India Bourke,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231212-what-if-the-world-cancelled-debt-for-climate-and-nature,"From Barbados to Belize, nations are beginning to swap debt for action on climate and conservation. But how far can this help without deeper reform of the global financial system? Hundreds of miles off the coast of South America lie the rocky, volcanic islands of the Galapagos. Teeming with unusual creatures – from jaunty, blue-footed birds to dragon-like iguanas – these bountiful isles have long inspired innovative thinking. A visit by the 19th-Century naturalist Charles Darwin prompted his famous theory of evolution, which proposed that species that are more adapted to their surroundings are more likely to survive. And now the islands are playing host to a very contemporary adaptation experiment: debt relief in exchange for spending on climate and nature. Earlier this year, Ecuador, which has sovereignty over the Galapagos, announced a record-setting deal. With the help of the private Credit-Suisse investment bank and the US development bank, it refinanced $1.6bn (£1.3bn) of government bonds at a discounted rate and issued a new ""blue bond"". In exchange, at least $12m (£10m) a year of the money saved via this cheaper loan will now be funnelled into conservation efforts in the remote archipelago.

This email is currently available to non-UK readers. In the UK? Sign up for newsletters here. Known as debt-for-nature or debt-for-climate swaps, these new financial tools are gaining ground in among severely indebted countries, from Barbados to Belize. Plus, in freeing money to restore ecosystems and build resilience, some believe they are shaping up to be part of the answer to a wider question: how to fund the world's climate change response? Closing the climate funding gap According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), developing economies will need an annual $2.4 trillion (£1.9tn) of investment in climate action in the coming years. But wealthier nations have so far been slow to deliver on financial pledges to help poorer nations adapt to a hotter world. The new ""loss and damage"" fund announced at this year's COP28 launched with $400m (£318m) from rich nations. But developing nations stand to lose 1,000 times that much each year to climate change, by one estimate. This money could fund projects that bolster natural defences, such as restoring mangroves to help protect against floods, or reforming agriculture to improve food system resilience.   Yet many nations are also not in a position to finance the above shifts. Loans can help – and in 2020 71% of public climate finance was provided this way – but last year more than 50 developing countries were already in severe debt. Some nations are currently paying their creditors more than 12 times what they spend on climate measures. Much of today's economic vulnerability is also being caused by exogeneous shocks, not by poor macro management, explains Vera Songwe, co-chair of UN's independent high level group on climate finance. From Covid-19 to the war in Ukraine, to climate disasters, recent global events have slowed economic growth and pushed up interest rates. The result is that many poorer nations' debt burdens are skyrocketing, through no fault of their own. ""We can't fix the climate issue unless we fix the debt issue,"" as the president of Kenya recently summed it up. Debt-for-nature in a nutshell Put simply, being in debt can be very expensive for the indebted nation. Plus is can also be risky for creditors, since if a nation becomes unable to pay back its debt it will default. In the case of some severely indebted nations, deals have been negotiated where creditors sell back their portion of the debt at a reduced rate – and so relieve themselves of the risk. New cheaper loans are then issued in exchange for a commitment that some of the saved money is set aside for action on nature or climate. One way for indebted nations to respond to debt crises is by boosting exports of primary resources like fuel, forests or fish – but keeping these assets intact is now key to capturing carbon and saving biodiversity. Equally, debt can't be fixed without climate action either, for when climate-linked disasters strike, economies are further strained. Twenty-eight of the most severely indebted nations are already among the most climate-vulnerable. Urgent debt relief is thus needed ""to avert a deepening development crisis,"" the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has warned. Bonding with nature In the midst of these combined nature, climate and cost of living crises, are debt swaps for poorer nations the answer? In 2015, the Seychelles wrote off almost $22m (£16.8m) of its debt in exchange for creating 13 new marine protected areas where fishing, oil exploration and other development is either banned or severely restricted. Belize, in 2021, was about to default on half a billion dollars, but it similarly shrank its debt by creating a blue bond to steer the savings into a fund for conservation. And in Portugal this year, the government pledged to reinvest the $650m (£524m) it is owed by Cape Verde back into the archipelago's green transition. (Read more about the deal that saved the Seychelles' troubled waters). One advantage of such ""swaps"" is that they don't undermine a nation's credit rating, which would make it more expensive for them to borrow in the long-term. That might happen if debt was entirely written-off, says Andrew Deutz, managing director of global policy and conservation finance at The Nature Conservancy, an international conservation organisation has helped to roll-out a number of the schemes in Belize, Gabon and Barbados. Deutz explains that by partially guaranteeing new, cheaper loans, nations' more expensive creditors can be paid off and the savings put towards marine protection. This may be ""a pretty weird thing for an NGO"" to do, he admits, as they are not a bank and their balance sheet is limited, but they're hoping to build a coalition that can ""accelerate"" and build from their proof-of-concepts. Plus, there are early suggestions that the concept is helping conservation. The Belize deal has already led to an expansion of its ocean protection zone and the designation of public lands as mangrove reserves, according to an inaugural impact report. Meanwhile, in the Seychelles, where the new conservation effort has been in place for longer, 400,000 sq km (154,000 sq miles) of sea is now protected and blue whales have made a return. You might also like:   Among the first beneficiaries of Belize's new fund is MarAlliance, a non-profit founded by marine conservation scientist Rachel Graham. The $327,000 (£260,000) that they've been awarded for three years will help restore the Gladden Spit and the Silk Cayes marine reserve. These stretches of ocean are home to unusually large populations of spawning finfish, and used to be a feeding hotspot for visiting whale-sharks. More than 20 years ago, Graham's research was instrumental in getting the area declared a special reserve, which helped replace unsustainable local fishing jobs with tourism opportunities. Since then, however, management has lapsed and poaching has increased – to the point where sharks are barely sighted anymore. ""We're going to assess the status of the spawning aggregations and study why the sharks aren't coming,"" Graham says. ""Should we expand the protected area to help meet local and national conservation goals? Can we help support the local NGO in community engagement, managing the site and enforcing the protections? And how is climate change impacting habitats and fish stocks? These are some of the questions we are tackling."" The new funding should help find answers to these challenges. But there are also drawbacks to the mechanism as it currently stands, Graham stresses. Overburdensome reporting requirements hold up work and limit the type of organisation that can apply for grants, with smaller non-profits unable to afford the extra administrative costs. ""We've run out of time: we have to implement the solutions now."" Cancelling injustice Not everyone thinks such debt-swaps are a good approach, however. Administrative concerns aside, wider questions still remain about their impact. The deals can have high transaction costs and are not on their own enough answer a nation's debt problems, warns Jayati Ghosh, professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, in the US. The amount of debt relief the country gets is marginal, there is no adequate monitoring of the nature-benefits that will accrue, and the money is nowhere near enough to allow a country to deal with loss and damage costs, or even proper climate mitigation, she says. But Deutz points out they can do some things other interventions so far have not. ""As a conservation or climate finance mechanism, these debt-for-nature swaps are actually extraordinarily efficient delivery mechanisms compared with existing alternatives in the marketplace.""   Alternatively, another option is to cancel a significant part of the debts outright. In 1950s Germany, Ghosh notes, creditors hoped to avoid a return to Nazism by wiping out half the nation's debt and transformed the other half into soft loans – which have low interest rates and no debt payment required if the country had a trade deficit. And today, some campaigners argue debts should be cancelled in countries that need it, with assistance provided in the forms of grants not loans. More than 500 economists, climate experts and activists recently signed an open letter calling for action to this effect. ""Eliminating climate debt is essential for acknowledging the uneven burden of climate change on overexploited nations, which have the least contribution to global emissions,"" says Anuna De Wever, a climate activist who was prominent in Belgium's school strikes for climate. ""We will not stand a chance against the climate crisis if we don't tackle the grave inequality that continues to exist through colonial legacies."" But cancelling a nation's debt outright is complicated by the diversity of creditors that now exist. Plus, for those that can avoid it, default or debt cancellation is not the preferred option, warns Songwe. ""Many African countries worked hard to improve their macro performance and obtain market access; they do not want to lose that"" she says. Cancellation may be ""useful and important"" for some nations that are really struggling, but not for all. Cooperation not competition Instead, a wider menu of reforms could all play a role in helping making debt more affordable and bolstering climate finance at the same time. The Bridgetown Initiative, co-launched by the Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley in 2022, has recently become a touchstone for calls to modernise the current global financial system. Its suggested reforms include automatic pauses in debt repayments if climate disaster strikes, extending the length of loans, reducing their costs, and setting up a facility to help if exchange rates change. Multilateral institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) can lend at cheaper rates than capital markets. And as Mottley reminded world leaders at this year's global financial summit in Paris, they were established ""to help the world in the reconstruction effort after World War Two. We are in a moment that is equal to World War Two with respect to climate."" Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2e. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2e per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. The Paris summit did not result in any major reform, but the presidents of Kenya and France, alongside a host of major philanthropic foundations and NGOs, have signalled their support for the Bridgetown Initiative. Plus a raft of coalitions and institutions, including a UN advisory board, are now making similar proposals.  One of these proposals is short-term liquidity buffers, for example through a debt service mechanism which reprofiles their debt, says Songwe, so that indebted nations can plough the savings back into growth and bring down their debt to GDP ratio, which makes debt easier to repay. Another is to speed up the time in which nations can access debt resolution, adds David McNair, executive director at The One Campaign, a group that fights poverty. A further suggestion is to encourage the UN's International Monetary Fund to reform the way it issues special drawing rights. These reserve assets are released in quotas and can be traded for hard currency at the IMF's low interest rate. If they were issued regularly and selectively to countries facing climate threats or suffering in the wake of disasters, they could be much more effective, Ghosh argues. So where does all this leave debt-for-nature swaps? ""Since they free up resources towards traditionally underfunded areas like conservation, they can be an important tool,"" says Rishikesh Bhandary, assistant director of the Global Economic Governance Initiative at Boston University. ""But they are just one tool in a range of instruments that will have to be deployed to tackle sovereign debt."" At this year's COP28, Colombia, Kenya and France announced an expert review on debt, climate and nature. And while there is clearly still a way to go on turning the range of proposals into action, the various calls for reform all suggest that the debt and climate crises stand a better chance of being solved together than they do apart.

Global Bond Market Trends,Modernising Arab fashion,2024-09-14,2017-10-26,Liza Foreman,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20171026-the-visionaries-contemporising-arab-fashion,"A new generation of designers is busy contemporising traditional dress. A new guard of designers is bringing traditional Arab clothing into the modern era. The evolution of this style is about embracing and developing, rather than rejecting, heritage and tradition. Designers showing at Fashion Forward Dubai (FFWD), a designer showcase in its tenth season this week, have been part of this development, including women’s outerwear brand Utruj, Emirati designer Zareena, and ready-to-wear brand Mashael which is interested in “Saudi heritage, and breathing new life into handicrafts,” according to designer Mashael Alrajhi. (Credit: Zareena/Getty) “We see these styles evolving at Fashion Forward each season,” says Bong Guerrero, CEO and co-founder of Fashion Forward Dubai. The organisation's event is running from 26 to 28 October this year. “Arab fashion is one of the industry's fastest growing sectors and is estimated to be worth $368 billion by 2021,” he adds. Fashion Forward Dubai, a fashion platform for Dubai and the Middle East, provides development and exposure for those in the fashion industry with a focus on the region. It encourages members of the regional and international fashion communities to come together in support of Middle Eastern design. (Credit: Mashael Alrajhi/Getty) London College of Fashion graduates Nelly Rose and Odette Steele are part of a growing number of designers focused on updating the abaya, the traditional robe-like cloak dress worn by many Arab women. Italy’s Dolce & Gabbana also launched an abaya collection last year, selling designs decorated in house patterns. Rose and Steele collaborated with Indonesia’s Dian Pelangi in 2016, to create a hip collection of so-called modestwear, or updated abayas. Showing at Jakarta and London Fashion Weeks, some of these were decorated in modern-looking prints. “Embracing the layers traditionally associated with Arab and modest fashion, I used these as a canvas to interpret traditional culture with a modernity of expression,” says Rose. “Working with modest fashion is to work at the intersection of many borders. The luxury and richness of traditional textiles and fabrics can be interwoven with an urban element.” (Credit: Dion Muharon) It has become a global market, she says. “This is what makes it so exciting. You know that you are enabling a piece which can be worn by any woman in the world and that is inclusive of all beliefs.” Rose is also currently working with artisans from Guatemala to “elevate traditional design” there into something more contemporary. Palestinian designer Faissal El-Malak recently spent three months travelling in the region, looking at traditional textiles for his next collection. El-Malak trained at Paris’s Atelier Chardon Savard. He settled in Dubai in 2014 and has shown his collections at Harvey Nichols, Dubai and in Fenwick of Bond Street this summer, among other places. He has worked with Egyptian, Yemeni and Tunisian textiles in the past, and makes Western-style clothing using fabrics that are “far from their initial and traditional use,” he says. “The fabrics from Yemen are exclusively used by men in their daily wear. The fabrics from Tunisia are ceremonial fabrics used for weddings and formal traditional wear,” he says. “Taking the textiles out of their context and changing the way they are used and their reach has been a source of pride for the artisans and myself.” “I thought about our traditional crafts, such as the embroidery and the mother-of-pearl work,” he says. He has now commissioned a Beirut design studio to “create modern interpretations of the traditional Palestinian embroidery” that he will produce for next season. He is also working with an association that collaborates with Palestinian refugee women in camps in Lebanon. “I hope that with every collection my work with every artisan grows into a richer collaboration, in addition to aiding crafts and artisans from the region,” he says. “Dubai has been great place to launch, as the market is still hungry for newness and for regionally-based design.” (Credit: Faissal El-Malak) Randall Bachner, an American photographer-turned-designer, relocated from New York to Marrakech more than four years ago to launch Marrakshi Life, a clothing-and-lifestyle brand that has created a modern style adapted from Moroccan traditions. Everything is handmade.   Bachner employs 20 fabric weavers, as well as tailors, to make his hip, urban pieces. He started by selling menswear, but the brand is now unisex, and his designs re-work traditional silhouettes in quality fabrics that epitomise understated, and often utilitarian, luxury. He relies heavily on local artisan know-how, and this is a cornerstone of the brand’s identity. “The work of the weavers is what brought me to Morocco and kept me here,” he explains. “Every day, we learn from the weavers new techniques or how to address a new texture or motif. It is a constant exchange of information.” Together, they have been re-thinking tradition. “Prior to living here, I was always attracted to the local, slim-cut, plain front-tailored trousers, and narrow tailored shirts,” says Bachner. “However, this silhouette in 40-plus degrees is not so comfortable. Because of this, I began to open my mind to a looser silhouette and started playing with drop-crotch trousers, long shorts and flowing kaftans, robes and tunics.” What did he keep from tradition and what did he omit? Bachner says he doesn’t use embroidery, or gold or metallic threads. “This would be much more the norm in Arabic fashion,” he says. “But it is important that ML remains non-embellished, so that it can be worn in urban settings, as well. I think we have achieved this in the choices we make weaving the textiles.” (Credit: Marrakshi) The Arab world represents “the most important market,” for fashion, says Jacob Abrian, Founder and Chief Executive of the Arab Fashion Council, a non-profit representing more than 20 Arab countries. “The spend on luxury fashion by Muslim consumers is expected to reach over $480 billion by 2019. This is not only from modest fashion but in the luxury sector, including fashion accessories.” According to Abrian, the trend to modernise Arab styles can be seen in general in womenswear, with some more conservative changes being made to menswear. Updating colours and using new materials is key. “It is quite common to see abayas with different layers of fabrics and more trendy materials, like lace, designs or even transparent PVC,” he says. “It needed someone like Dolce & Gabbana to make the traditional dress more trendy,” he adds. “There were obviously many designers who set the trend before them but a renowned International name has motivated others to express their style in a more obvious way.” Who is buying? “Fashionable women in the Arab world are driving the modest trend, and it is most relevant for their culture, however women from around the world have embraced it,” he says. Indeed, Dubai-based brand Bouguessa’s client list includes Beyoncé and Jessica Alba. (Credit: Bouguessa/Getty) “Dubai and the region is increasingly becoming a hub where cultures from the East and the West merge, creating a contemporary melange that has influenced local and global markets,” says Jazia Al Dhanhani, Chief Executive Officer of the Dubai Design and Fashion Council. “Many designers have taken this direction to customise traditional clothing into everyday wear, and to allow women from the region to celebrate global fashion trends, without compromising on their uniqueness and heritage.” (Credit: Marrakshi) “There is also an increase in modestwear found in the West within the diasporic communities, that find it integral to their roots and culture,” adds Jazia Al Dhanhani. “It will continue to gain prominence internationally and locally with the influx of global fashion houses that are locating their offices in Dubai.” (Credit: Nelly Rose/Odette Steele/Dian Pelangi/Getty)"
Global Bond Market Trends,Best Coachella in recent history?,2024-09-14,2019-04-23,Eve Barlow,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20190423-coachella-2019-built-for-the-streaming-generation,"How do you put on a festival performance for the streaming generation? How do you curate a lineup for an audience undefined by genres or isolated subcultures? How do artists and fans around the world harness these opportunities for maximum gain without compromising their own artistic integrity? These are questions faced by anyone involved with live music festivals, but perhaps Coachella has found the answer. The festival had sought a fresh start after its peak historic moment with Beyoncé headlining in 2018, and the resounding opinion everywhere – backstage in the artist village, among the general public in the main fields, and in the dressing rooms of the performers – was that 2019 was the best Coachella festival in recent history. In the current landscape, it's hard to predict where music is going and when, but Coachella's approach in 2019 seemed to be to follow the populace, not attempt to dictate it. The headliners: rapper and activist Childish Gambino; psychedelic disco tycoons Tame Impala; and pop superstar Ariana Grande were just the top-tier reflection of the diversity throughout the three days. From Blackpink to J Balvin, Rosalia to Billie Eilish, Maggie Rogers to Bad Bunny, it was an embarrassment of homegrown and international riches. For those participating in a #couchella at home, the action could be caught on a streaming service provided by YouTube, who have had a strong presence onsite since their partnership with Coachella began in 2011.  If this is the way a festival needs to adapt to current trends, how does this impact the experience of the people taking part? To find out, I asked people from four different perspectives. Here's what they had to say. The pop star: Ellie Goulding (appeared on Sahara Stage for Diplo’s set)  Coachella gives streaming artists the platform. Now there are bands who are finding that their place is perhaps not as streaming artists. And there are streaming artists that now need to have their place. Coachella is perfect for that. The fact they had the first ever K Pop girl band to play shows that. I bet a few people were scratching their heads wondering who Blackpink were, but I love the fact that Coachella gave them a set because people should know who they are. I spent many years on the road doing festivals alongside lots of bands. I remember occasionally seeing Florence, Lorde, maybe Haim. Often there weren't any other female singers on lineups. That's stuck with me. Coachella is extremely diverse and has so many females playing. They give the people the artists they want. Every headliner they had deserved to be there. I was talking to Childish Gambino's production manager last night, and he said that no one could ever touch Beyonce's set. With Childish Gambino it was a totally different game – he got people involved. Every single person in the crowd is holding their phone up, there's not one person with their hands in the air. Instead of saying – put your phones away – he embraced it and went down in the crowd to take pictures. The first time I played Coachella, the sets weren't like that. It was a lot less spectacle. Artists are realising that when you have a set at Coachella you gotta up your game. That's a perfectly OK challenge to have. Artists are always looking for ways to increase their creativity. It's not just going up and singing. I used to think I could get away with my guitar and prancing around a bit. When you're offered a Coachella set you have to think outside the box, do something more interactive, more of a spectacle. The indie band: Charlie Steen of Shame (played the Sonora Tent) We've done over a hundred different festivals now. The main difference I've noticed here is the segregation in the pit. I know that's a Coachella stereotype with its artificiality. But at festivals like Glastonbury you have the same amount of A-listers and performers as they do here, and yet everyone's in the same boat, and the music's on 24 hours. Here it's weird. There's grass in the desert. There's snow-y mountains when you look past the palm trees. Everything's off kilter but in a fascinating way. We were quite surprised when we got offered to play this festival. It was a generous offer too. For our humour, satire and irony, it's a dream. We've been touring throughout the week, and so have [other bands on the bill] Parcels and Iceage who we're touring with. It's good exposure. If you can't afford a ticket to Coachella, you know one of the bands are probably gonna come through your town soon. In terms of the actual Coachella stream? Honestly, I didn't even think about it. The streaming service: Ali Rivera (Head of Artist Partnerships at YouTube) [Coachella co-founder] Paul Tollett is a curator. We've had so many conversations over the years about how he uses platforms to find artists. The reason our partnership is so amazing is because he's such a big YouTube fan. He spends tonnes of time finding bands, going to shows, then digging deep on the content that we have. We've been working so closely with Coachella to identify artists who are huge on the YouTube platform. Coachella spends a lot of time diving through YouTube's data, figuring out where fans are coming from: the US, the UK, Asia… These markets are blowing up. We're able to show from our data where people are viewing. That helps us determine who to book and when to put them on. For instance, over the weekend we saw this huge re-surge in numbers on the Blackpink broadcast when the Asian market finally got to watch it. We really leaned into Latin artists this year – J Balvin, Rosalia, Bad Bunny. Coachella have been expanding their roster, trying to lean into what's popular on YouTube. That reflects upon who shows up here. In the near future, we're going to lean more into the global nature [of the festival], continuing to book artists who are breaking on YouTube. For weekend two, we did 'Coachella Curated' on the stream for the first time this year because we don't want to compete with weekend one. It's not in the fans' best interests to see the second weekend exactly the same as the first. The second weekend, we stream one song per artist and the headliners' full sets. How can we create programming that's really unique and also captivating to the audience? It's an experiment, and we're going to evolve and tweak that. The artistic director: Jemel McWilliams (choreographed performances by Lizzo and Janelle Monae) Coachella's lineup is a natural progression. There's a lot of merging of our typical lines in genres. There's so much crossover. It's beneficial to us as a people. That's the truth of what America is, the truth of what the world is. Representation is important. Coachella is pioneering in the festival space. It's better than it's been in years. Beyoncé was the biggest moment the festival has probably ever had; a black woman with a full stage of over 100 black cast members, and there's no way that one can deny that the people want that? A homecoming for everyone. Let's expand this thing out. Whether we're playing this Coachella stage or the Greek theatre, we approach it the same way, and that keeps us from mentally letting in the pressure of this being the biggest US festival. We wanna go out there, have a good time, be rockstars. Whatever happens, happens. Janelle has this thing where she says, 'Oh well, peace'. What happened with Lizzo last week was a challenging position to be in as an artist. Imagine this, you've prepared for this huge amazing show. And nothing went smoothly for her. Imagine for 45 minutes you have to keep this crowd entertained, engaged. You have your ears on, she has no idea what's going on, so she keeps bantering, while we're trying to fix technical things in the background. My hat is off to her. That was magic on that stage. That was true stardom to push through. If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

Global Bond Market Trends,Governments make big bets on the computer chip industry,2024-09-14,2024-01-12,By Hannah Mullane,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67576918,"I'm at the UK's newest computer chip plant in Durham. Formerly a ceramic pipe factory, from the outside it looks like a  big warehouse.  But inside the vast space is being transformed into a sophisticated hub for the manufacturing of computer chips. Pragmatic Semiconductor has already built one production line, which the industry likes to call fabrication lines, or fab lines. Sealed off in its own large room, the production line has all the expensive machinery needed to make the computer chips, and the air inside is carefully controlled to avoid any contamination during production. Pragmatic has the money to build another such production line, and funding of £182m ($230m) announced late last year will fund production lines three and four. As well as from private investors, Pragmatic secured funding from the government-backed UK Infrastructure Bank and British Patient Capital, a subsidiary of British Business Bank. But the Cambridge-based company will need much more money to complete its plan to build eight production lines in the old pipe factory.  From phones and computers, to cars and washing machines, almost every product with an on-off switch relies on the production of computer chips, also known as semiconductors. It is an industry that has seen a lot of turbulence over the last few years. There's been disruption to supply chains during the pandemic, and geopolitical tensions in Asia, where 90% of the world's most advanced chips originate.  David Moore, chief executive of Pragmatic Semiconductor, which is the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the UK, says the industry is going to need multiple types of semiconductors to solve ""different kinds of problems"" in the chip sector. Most semiconductors are made using silicon, but his company is taking a different approach.  They are making flexible chips - they actually bend - at their plant in Durham, which can be used in wearable technology, clothing authentication, and even in parcel labels to track and trace items. Rather than sitting on silicon wafer, Pragmatic's chips are built on a flexible thin film.  This approach results in chips that are cheaper and faster to manufacture than the standard silicon chip.  ""If you take a standard silicon manufacturing facility, it's going to take multiple years and billions of dollars to make,"" Mr Moore said. ""Our fabrication plant can be 10 to 100 times cheaper depending on what you compare it with.  ""In silicon, it will take three to six months to go from the start of the process all the way to a finished wafer product. For us, we can do that in less than 48 hours."" But it is no panacea. The flexible chip may be cheaper and quicker to make, but the advanced chips in phones, computers and other leading tech will still need the most advanced silicon-based computer chips. More technology of business A serious shortage of those chips in 2021, underlined how dependent global industry is on a few key suppliers.  In particular, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) makes 90% of the world's most advanced semiconductors.  In an effort to cut that dependency governments are spending huge sums to create stronger domestic chip industries. In August 2022, the US government signed into law the US Chips Act, which pledged $52bn (£41bn) to boost domestic production of computer chips. The European Union has its own project worth €43bn (£37bn). On a smaller scale the UK has promised £1bn of investment in the sector. Analysts says that the big chip manufacturers are responding to such government incentives. Germany has seen a huge wave of investment. A Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer has decided, together with three European headquartered companies, to invest €10bn in Dresden. ""We see that 80% of of global production is currently in Asia, the reliance on Asian countries means we really need to strengthen our resilience here in the EU,"" notes Hendrik Abma, director general of the European Semiconductor Industry Association.  ""I think the realisation about the importance of semiconductors for industry here in Europe, for our technical development, has been underestimated in the past."" As well as Germany, Mr Abma notes that Belgium, Lithuania and the Czech Republic, have seen significant investments. Following the US Chips Act, almost 500 companies applied to the US government for funding for projects, according to Hannah Dohmen, research analyst at Georgetown's Centre for Security and Emerging Technology in Washington. Plants are planned in New York, Arizona, Texas, Ohio and Idaho, she says.  And outside the US and Europe, other projects are planned. ""We're also seeing India attempt to enter the chip manufacturing space. A country that has a strong history in chip design but will be starting from scratch in manufacturing,"" Ms Dohmen added. ""India are looking to be a big player in the space, and with intensifying competition with China. This has prompted the US and other allied countries to strengthen tech cooperation with India."" It all sounds very positive but building computer chip plants is not easy. Plans by TSMC to build advanced chips in Arizona have run into trouble, with the company blaming a shortage of skilled workers.  Others worry that the rush to build plants in Europe and the US, will just mirror what already exists in Asia.   ""There's a risk of duplication and wastefulness across the industry,"" Ms Dohmen said. Meanwhile, Mr Moore predicts more diversification in how semiconductors are made and what they're used for. ""You go from tens of billions of connected things to hundreds of billions and trillions of connected things, ultimately you end up with that very challenging element of not being able to supply to it, and so alternative supplies in high volume are what are going to be required. ""And being able to provide those cost effectively and at scale - that's the big challenge."""
Global Bond Market Trends,Ten ways Trump has changed America,2024-09-14,2018-01-12,By Anthony Zurcher,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42653793,"It's a quarter of the way through Donald Trump's presidential term - long enough to judge his performance so far. There have been promises kept, promises broken and promises ignored. But how much have his policies changed things? A business tycoon with no political experience, he said he came to Washington to make waves.  Has he succeeded? The Trump administration tackled the immigration issue pretty much right out of the gate, with its ill-fated executive order closing the US border to entrants from a handful of majority-Muslim nations. Implementation of that effort led to chaos at US airports and a quick suspension at the hands of US courts.  Since then, the White House has rolled out two new border orders, adding a few countries to the banned list and removing one (Sudan). The latest measures have, at least so far, largely withstood legal challenge. Immigration enforcement has also been ramped up - 143,470 arrests for violations for the year ending in October - a 30% increase. Mr Trump also announced an end to the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme, which granted normalised residency status to roughly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US when they were young. The order has been temporarily suspended by the court, and is the subject of ongoing negotiations in Congress. About 200,000 Salvadoreans face an uncertain future because the White House has brought their temporary protected status (TPS) to an end. Mr Trump is pushing for sweeping changes to the US immigration system, including reductions in the total number of entrants, the termination of the visa lottery system and greatly reducing the ability of current US residents to bring relatives into the country. Those measures will be strongly opposed by Democrats, however. As for the Mexican border wall, perhaps the most memorable of Mr Trump's campaign promises, funding is still in doubt and - and the money to pay for it will almost certainly come from US taxpayers, not Mexico. Making waves? The president has sweeping authority on immigration and border issues - and he's used it, even if some lower courts have tried to clip his wings. Still, there's nothing Mr Trump would like more than to stand in front of a shiny, new border wall. Because of the controversial move by Senate Republicans to block consideration of Barack Obama's nominee for a vacant Supreme Court seat in 2016, Mr Trump had the opportunity to put his mark on the high court just months after taking office. The president's judicial accomplishments stretch well beyond one Supreme Court pick, however. Senate Republicans also largely refused to confirm Mr Obama's lower court nominees for the last two years of his term, leaving a record number of open slots for Mr Trump to fill. He's had 12 circuit court and six district court judges confirmed so far. There are currently 149 vacancies left - with 47 presidential nominees awaiting Senate approval. All these judges will hold lifetime appointments, guaranteeing that after one year in office Mr Trump has already cemented a lasting conservative legacy on the US judicial branch. It's also a reason Republicans are eager to maintain control of the Senate in the upcoming mid-term elections. If Democrats take control, expect Mr Trump's ability to get his people on the federal bench to be sharply curtailed. Making waves? Through fortune and political force of will, the stars have aligned for conservatives eager to make their mark on the judiciary. Some were concerned that Mr Trump may be unreliable when it comes to picking nominees, but he's more than exceeded their expectations. In his inaugural address, Mr Trump outlined an ambitious new programme of US infrastructure investment. ""We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels, and railways, all across our wonderful nation,"" he said. ""We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labour."" Since then, Mr Trump's big infrastructure plan has always been just around the next bend of the road. Instead, Congress and the administration first focused on healthcare reform, an effort that ended in a string of disappointments. Then they turned their gaze on tax reform, which had a much happier ending. Aside from a few press events, such as a June announcement of an air traffic control initiative that has since gone nowhere, infrastructure talk has been little more than empty words.  ""It's infrastructure week"", in fact, has become a running joke among Washington insiders grown used to seeing the White House's intended talking points and objectives derailed by controversies big and small. Making waves? Where would Mr Trump be today if he had led with a bipartisan infrastructure programme that was met with overwhelming public approval, instead of travel bans and an extended, acrimonious fight over healthcare? For much of the year, it looked as though Mr Trump's efforts to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a conservative plan would fall flat.  It took two tries for the House of Representatives to pass a bill - which was unceremoniously abandoned by the Senate. The upper chamber's efforts to craft their own version were dramatically derailed by Senator McCain's late-night ""no vote"", and a subsequent, bare bones effort met with defeat as well. Beneath those dramatic legislative failures, however, the administration has taken significant steps to chip away at the foundations of the Democrat's signature law. The president suspended payments to insurance companies to help them control the costs of insuring poorer, sicker Americans. The administration greatly curtailed efforts to encourage Americans to sign up on the government-run health insurance exchanges - although enrolment numbers held firm in 2017.  Congressional Republicans also placed a stick of Obamacare dynamite in the tax bill the passed in December, repealing the requirement that all Americans buy health insurance as of January 2019. The move could lead healthier Americans to forego insurance until they get sick, driving up premiums. Meanwhile, under Mr Trump's watch, Congress has yet to renew a health-insurance programme for children from less-affluent families, causing concern among states that manage the system. In October Mr Trump declared opioid addiction to be a public-health emergency, although no new resources have been allotted to deal with the situation and the order will expire later in January.  Making waves? It's taken a year, but Mr Trump is making strides toward repealing Obamacare. The ""replace"" portion of the task, however, is still far out of reach. In meetings with foreign leaders, the president has repeatedly emphasised ""reciprocal"" trade and encouraged friendly nations to buy US-made products. The president quickly ended US participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and initiated talks with Canada and Mexico to restructure the North American Free Trade Agreement - negotiations that presently seem to be severely strained.  The US and Canada have also been mired in a dispute over softwood lumber, dairy products and aircraft sales, leading to US ""duty investigations"" that could lead to new tariffs. In January, Canada filed a formal complaint against the US with the World Trade Organisation, alleging violations of international rules. Although Mr Trump talked up confrontation with China on the campaign stump, action toward the US's largest trading partner has been muted. Meanwhile, the US trade deficit with China grew to $35.4bn in November, the largest gap over two years. The overall US trade deficit in November was $50.5bn, the largest in five years, indicating that the total mark for 2017 could reach five-year highs as well. While Mr Trump campaigned on closing the US trade gap, the widening deficit can be attributed largely to continued US economic growth. Making waves? Mr Trump has hinted at big trade moves to come, but in the first year the primary change is that US support for expanding free trade across the world has ground to a halt.  At the end of 2017, Mr Trump boasted that he had signed more legislation than any previous president. While that claim was clearly not true - the 94 bills that reached his desk rank well behind John F Kennedy's 684 and trail all modern presidents - he did close out the year with one major legislative accomplishment. Mr Trump promised voters he would enact major tax reform on individuals and businesses, and in the waning days of 2017 Republicans - with no Democratic support - enacted sweeping tax cuts for businesses and many Americans. Top personal rates were slashed, a tax credit for families with children was doubled and the standard deduction for individuals who do not itemise their tax returns was increased. The total cost of the changes to the tax code has been estimated at $1.5tn over 10 years - and it would be more, except the individual tax reductions are set to expire after eight years. Some of Mr Trump's more ambitious reform goals were left on the cutting room floor, however. While there are provisions to allow corporations to repatriate overseas earnings and changes to a more territorial-based business tax system to discourage outsourcing, there's little to encourage existing overseas factories to relocate back to the US.  Another survivor was the carried-interest loophole used by hedge-fund managers and other powerful Wall Street investors to pay greatly reduced taxes - which was condemned repeatedly by Mr Trump during the campaign. There were also some prominent losers in the president's tax reforms, namely individuals in high-tax, largely Democratic states, who will lose the ability to deduct state and local taxes over a $10,000 cap. Mr Trump is revelling in the recent announcements by major corporations that they are passing some of their tax savings along to employees and customers - although polls continue to show that many Americans think the new law won't help their bottom line. Making waves? Mr Trump can lay claim to the most substantive change to US tax law in 16 years, enacting the kind of massive corporate tax cut that Republicans have been after for decades. In a mid-December press event, Mr Trump stood in a White House room next to a towering mound of white papers. ""For many decades, an ever-growing maze of regulations, rules, restrictions has cost our country trillions and trillions of dollars, millions of jobs, countless American factories, and devastated many industries,"" the president said. ""But all that changed the day I took the oath of office."" While it may not have happened quite so instantly, the first year of the Trump administration has seen a significant reduction in the amount of federal regulation, and no place has that been more marked than in the way the government deals with environmental issues. Shortly after his inauguration, Mr Trump gave final approval to several long-delayed oil pipelines. The recently completed tax bill opened vast swaths of Alaskan wilderness up to new oil and gas drilling. Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt recently announced energy exploration would be permitted off much of the rest of the US coastline (although Florida, with its Republican governor, became a notable exception).  The government's environmental department, the EPA, also rescinded Obama-era regulations on carbon emissions from coal-based power plants, although those changes will likely be bogged down in legal challenges for years. According to a New York Times tracker, the administration has sought to reverse at least 60 federal environmental regulations and has succeeded in 29 instances. Mr Trump also greatly reduced the amount of federal protected land in Utah, opening the door for increased development in the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. It was the largest such rollback in US history. On 1 June the president also announced the US was withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, although the benchmarks the US agreed to were not mandatory. Making waves? President Obama had taken significant administrative steps to increase environmental regulation and enforcement over the objection of Republicans in Congress. Now the Trump administration is using that same authority to tear it all down. Mr Trump's first year in office has been filled with economic good news. The stock market, as the president frequently points out, is driving to new highs, with the Dow Jones index recently passing the 25,000 mark.  Unemployment, which was at 4.8% when the president took office, has reached a 17-year low of 4.1%. In the third quarter of 2017, gross domestic product growth hit 3.2%, the highest level since the first quarter of 2015.   The hard numbers indicating robust growth are translating into new levels of economic optimism. The US Consumer Confidence Index hit a 17-year high in November, before dropping slightly in December. Also in November, a small-business confidence index hit the highest level in its 45-year history. Of course all these glowing numbers represent the continuation of trend-lines that began during the Obama administration - a fact that a majority of the nation seems to acknowledge.  In a recent Quinnipiac survey that showed 66% of the public believes the economy is ""excellent or good"",  49% think it is because of Mr Obama while only 40% credit Mr Trump.  Making waves? The rising economic tide is buoying Mr Trump's hopes that a public presently divided about his presidency will eventually give him his due. He has three more years to make his case. During his presidential campaign, Mr Trump promised an ""America First"" foreign policy that asked allies to carry more of the financial and military burden. He's now had a year to show what that looks like in action.  The president delivered a blunt speech to Nato allies in Belgium, surprising many observers by declining to reiterate US support for the pact's mutual-defence arrangements  Mr Trump engaged in a very public exchange of insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, calling him ""little rocket man"" and saying his nation would be met with ""fire and fury"" if they continued their bellicose rhetoric.  The most notable use of US military force during Mr Trump's first year was his missile strike on a Syrian air base in response to that nation's use of chemical weapons. The highest-profile incident of US combat casualties, on the other hand, came when a group of special forces were ambushed in Niger leading to four deaths - drawing attention to the increased US military presence in Africa. In Syria and Afghanistan, Mr Trump has given his generals a free hand to prosecute the ongoing military engagements. Over the course of the year, the so-called Islamic State has been largely defeated on the battlefield and its influence curtailed. The conflict in Afghanistan drags on, however, as the president increased the number of US troops there to 14,000. He also recently threatened to cut off aid to Pakistan if it does not do more to support the US fight against Islamic militants. Mr Trump put his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in charge of the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, although the most dramatic development in that area was the president's move to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital - thrilling the Israeli government but prompting stern condemnations from Palestinian officials and much of the global community. With great fanfare, he declined to recertify Iranian compliance with multinational nuclear deal, although that is largely a symbolic act unless sanctions that have been suspended are reimposed.  Making waves? Mr Trump talks about foreign policy like no other modern American president. Critics will say he's undermining US standing on the world stage, but when it comes to actual policy this isn't the paradigm shift feared - or hoped for - by some There's never been an American president quite like Donald Trump.  No one has ever held the office with no prior elective or military leadership experience. No one, in modern times at least, has been as blunt or as disruptive a force on the national and international stage. For many of the president's supporters, this is exactly what they wanted. They supported the candidate who told them the system was broken, the other politicians on the stage with him were phony and the process was a joke.  They asked for different, and different is what they got. Mr Trump has said he is defining ""modern day presidential"" with his free-form use of social media, his continued practice of giving unscripted campaign-style rally speeches and his willingness to disregard many of the time-honoured traditions of politics.  In some ways his has been a conventional presidency. His court appointments are largely in keeping with conservative desires, his tax package was a longtime Republican wish-list and his efforts at deregulation are out of the party's anti-big-government playbook.  But the way Mr Trump has operated, and the way he has talked about how he is going about running the nation, has been one-of-a-kind. Making waves? It remains to be seen whether Donald Trump is permanently changing the way politics is conducted in the US. A quarter of the way through his term in office, however, it should be quite clear that US politics isn't changing Donald Trump."
Global Bond Market Trends,UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050,2024-09-14,2019-06-12,By Roger Harrabin,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48596775,"Greenhouse gas emissions in the UK will be cut to almost zero by 2050, under the terms of a new government plan to tackle climate change. Prime Minister Theresa May said there was a ""moral duty to leave this world in a better condition than what we inherited"". Cutting emissions would benefit public health and cut NHS costs, she said. Britain is the first major nation to propose this target - and it has been widely praised by green groups. But some say the phase-out is too late to protect the climate, and others fear that the task is impossible. The UK already has a 2050 target - to reduce emissions by 80%. That was agreed by MPs under the Climate Change Act in 2008, but will now be amended to the new, much tougher, goal.  The actual terminology used by the government is ""net zero"" greenhouse gases by 2050. That means emissions from homes, transport, farming and industry will have to be avoided completely or - in the most difficult examples - offset by planting trees or sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere. The government's advisory Committee on Climate Change  recommended the ""net zero"" target in May.  Its report said if other countries followed the UK, there was a 50-50 chance of staying below the recommended 1.5C temperature rise by 2100. A 1.5C rise is considered the threshold for dangerous climate change. Laurence Tubiana, an architect of the crucial Paris climate agreement, told the BBC: ""This is a historic commitment that will reverberate right around the world.  ""All eyes will now turn on the rest of the EU to match this pledge."" Theresa May said the UK led the world to wealth through fossil fuels in the industrial revolution, so it was appropriate for Britain to lead in the opposite direction. ""We have made huge progress in growing our economy and the jobs market while slashing emissions,"" she said. ""Now is the time to go further and faster to safeguard the environment for our children. We must lead the world to a cleaner, greener form of growth."" Number 10 said it was ""imperative"" other countries followed suit, so there would be a review within five years to ensure other nations were taking similarly ambitious action and British industries were not facing unfair competition. Scotland has already committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2045, five years ahead of the UK government's target. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) recommended Wales should aim to cut emissions by a lower target of 95% by 2050 due to the importance of the farming industry to rural communities. But the Welsh government has since said it wants to go further - and will commit to net-zero by 2050, like the rest of the UK. Northern Ireland is the only devolved administration which does not have its own climate change legislation and emissions targets. If ministers decided to clamp down on meat-eating or on flying, that would meet serious opposition. But the government will attempt to make the clean revolution as painless as possible. Technology improvements like LED light bulbs, for instance, save emissions without people noticing. The same is true if people get hydrogen central heating instead of gas, or if they are obliged to drive electric cars rather than petrol vehicles. But there will need to be a massive investment in clean energy generation - and that has to be funded by someone. The government hasn't yet spelled out if the cost will fall on bill-payers, or tax-payers, or the fossil fuel firms that have caused climate change. And then there's the international dimension. Prof Dieter Helm, from the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University, said: ""From the UK's end, doing this unilaterally, we have to be very careful that we don't simply say: 'we're going to reduce the emissions from our cars and our power stations here in Britain, but we're going to carry on importing those emissions from overseas.' ""We don't make very much in this country. Manufacturing is only 20% of the economy. Most of the stuff that you go and buy in the supermarket... it's all imported."" Chancellor Philip Hammond has warned of a potential cost of £1 trillion by 2050. The cash will have to come from somewhere, he said - maybe from schools, hospitals and the police. However, Chris Skidmore, the acting energy minister, said the costs would amount to between 1 and 2% of the UK's GDP - which was the same amount factored in to reach the previous 80% reduction target. Therefore it would not be the case that there would be less money to spend elsewhere, he said.  He added that the green economy would generate jobs and the cost of green technologies was coming down all the time. The climate change contrarian Bjorn Lomborg, author of Skeptical Environmentalist, said: ""Mr Hammond is right to highlight the cost - and in fact, he is likely to be underestimating the real price tag."" Campaigners said Mr Hammond's sums did not take into account the benefits of cleaner air and a more stable climate. Following the Committee on Climate Change's recommendations last month, scientists, campaigners and health professionals have been urging Mrs May to bring in a net zero target before she stands down. The government will lay a ""statutory instrument"" in the Commons on Wednesday - a tactic that allows it to be fast-tracked through both houses of Parliament if other parties agree - which on this issue they generally do. Like any government decision it could be overturned by future governments. But the majority of Tory leadership candidates are backing it - and revoking the Act would need a majority Commons vote at a time when the public appear very concerned about the climate. Mrs May has taken the unusual step of announcing that a group of young people will advise the government on priorities for environmental action. They will start their review in July. This is seen as a nod towards young voters, many of whom have recently taken to the streets protesting that their environment was being destroyed. The magnitude of the task is clear. The UK is already slipping away from its mid-term carbon targets of cutting emissions by 80% by 2050. ""Achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions is necessary, feasible and cost-effective,"" said professor Phil Taylor, head of engineering at Newcastle University. ""But UK policy is still way off the mark and the foundations are not in place to be able to meet this target. ""Even with all the evidence before us we are still opening new coal mines, extending Heathrow airport and pushing forward with fracking. ""We have unambitious building regulations, and our drive to phase out petrol and diesel cars by 2040 is too late."" Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, director of the Royal Institution, warned that the public might not support carbon-cutting measures such as turning down thermostats in the home. And he questioned the ability of the government to insulate enough houses in time. ""The prize for improving the efficiency of buildings is significant,"" he said. ""However, there is a practical challenge in terms of the number of sufficient skilled workers to undertake the work, and then of course the barrier of getting homeowners to get the work done."" There will be major difficulties, too, in supplying low-carbon heating to homes and industries as natural gas is phased out. Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK's chief scientist, said it was a ""big moment"" for the climate but there were questions around plans to allow for international carbon credits which allow the UK to pay to offset its emissions elsewhere in the world.  Such off-setting had a history of failure, was not cost-efficient and shifting the burden to developing nations undermined the commitment, he told the Guardian. Chris Skidmore, the acting energy minister, said the government did not ""intend"" to use international carbon credits but had kept it ""as an option"". ""We need to be able to decarbonise in the best possible way so we don't want to rule it out,"" he said. Mrs May's announcement indicates that she has taken notice of potential industrial pitfalls. To assuage Treasury fears about competitiveness, she has stipulated that the net zero policy should be reviewed in five years to see whether other nations were taking similar actions. That might prove problematic if US President Donald Trump - who denigrates climate change - is still in the White House. Meanwhile, the radical green group Extinction Rebellion is warning that the climate is changing so fast that 2050 is far too late to eliminate emissions in order to ensure that temperature rise stays well under 2C.

Global Bond Market Trends,The rise of Korean make-up in the West,2024-09-14,2018-10-20,By Mary-Ann Russon,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45820671,"For thousands of years the fashion conscious have used make-up to get their look just right, and keep up with fast-moving trends. Now, the global beauty industry is experiencing a revolution driven by South Korea. Say hello to K-beauty. Young people in Western countries have become infatuated with K-pop - Korean pop music - and Korean soap operas.  Many Korean celebrities and pop stars, including the seven-member boy band BTS, are known for their signature looks. But it's not just Korean entertainment - in the last 18 months, there has also been a rise in Korean beauty trends coming over to the West. In 2017, South Korea's beauty industry was estimated to be worth just over $13bn (£10bn), according to retail researchers Mintel. The fascination with Korean cosmetics is due to how innovative they are, says Marie Claire's digital beauty editor Katie Thomas. South Korea's beauty industry is typically about 10-12 years ahead of the rest of the world, she says. ""It's not that there's been a big boom, we're just catching up with them essentially, [helped by] the expansion of Instagram and beauty blogging."" Before even putting any make-up on, Koreans put in a lot of effort to take care of their skin.  ""It's sort of ingrained in Korean culture from a very young age to look after your skin,"" Ms Thomas says, explaining that the Korean ethos is to ensure that you have good skin, rather than needing foundation and other products to cover up unsightly blemishes. You might be used to the typical daily three-step routine of using cleanser, toner and moisturiser before applying make-up, but in South Korea, skincare regimes range from seven to 12 steps, with a focus on hydrating the skin using gentle, natural ingredients. ""Some people would see it as excessive, but the fact is, you're feeding your skin with these incredible ingredients. It's so different in the UK [in comparison],"" says Ms Thomas. Much more research is carried out into new products in South Korea than in other countries, she says, because there are so many competing brands, each trying to be the best.  ""The Korean beauty industry doesn't shy away from introducing new, unique ingredients to their formulas that would never be considered in the West,"" says Karen Hong, the founder of K Beauty Bar, a concession stand for Korean beauty products found in Topshop's flagship store in London's Oxford Street. Unique ingredients such as...? ""Snail mucin for moisturising, pearl for brightening, green tea for oil control and propolis from bees for soothing and nourishing,"" she reels off. In the US, 13% of 10 to 17-year-old girls are interested in trying K-beauty products, and 18% of 18 to 22-year-old women have used these products.  According to Mintel's global beauty analyst Andrew McDougall, Korean beauty trends have grown in popularity thanks to ""clever digital marketing strategies"" on social media that have gained the interest of Western beauty influencers, bloggers and journalists. Consumers' interests are piqued by colourful packaging, as well as reviews and demonstrations on Instagram and YouTube, he explains. ""It's consumers who are more informed and do their own research, and it's influencers who put them on the K-beauty path in the first place,"" says Mr McDougall. Katie Thomas agrees: ""That K-pop fun quite cartoony approach is very much part of their industry. But it does do very well. People do buy into fun packaging - things they can take a picture of on their bathroom shelf."" Some products can be found in Topshop and TKMaxx, but other than that, most British consumers can only buy these products online. YesStyle.com is one such company, and it sees Korean make-up as big business. The Hong Kong-based e-commerce firm carries more than 150 Korean brands, and it expects sales of K-beauty products to top $25m in 2018. Its founder Joshua Lau says the website's success has been down to reviews from verified buyers that give Western consumers the confidence to take a chance on new items. YesStyle's beauty editor Romy Rose Reyes says that Western consumers have been intrigued by the ""Chok Chok"" no make-up make-up look, where the aim is to have ""dewy and bouncy skin with an extra glow"". According to Ms Reyes and Ms Hong, looking ""natural"" and ""youthful"" is in, and the matte look favoured by European and US markets is now out. To that end, there is an emphasis on: Western cosmetics makers have been taking notice too. ""We see some Western brands take on a few of these skincare steps into their own regimes,"" says Marie Claire's Katie Thomas. ""For example, Yves Saint Laurent has cushion foundation and cushion blushers. It's a bit less scary for consumers - an easy way into K-beauty with a known brand."" This summer, Primark launched its K-Pop range of cosmetics, which sold out quickly. Primark told the BBC that it was inspired by a ""huge trend"" it saw based on skincare innovations from South Korea, and it is continuing to stock face masks. ""We found this was a range that really worked for the younger consumer, who was not necessarily after serious skincare,"" a company spokesperson said. So is it just a fad, or is the K-beauty trend likely to last? Ms Thomas thinks it's here to stay, because young people are very concerned about the environment, and how damage to it affects humans as well as plants and animals.  ""People are becoming more attuned to what is happening to their skin - there's so much pollution that gets into our skin that we don't know about,"" she says. ""Anything related to environmental damage is very much coming over to the Western market."" But while much of this applies to women, in Korea cosmetics is big business for both male and female consumers, so is K-beauty likely to take off with men in the West? ""In Korea there is a different attitude amongst men towards skincare and make-up - they're not afraid to express themselves as long as they look and feel good, especially the younger generation. But this isn't a trend that has reached the general male population in the West yet,"" says Karen Hong. Mintel's Andrew McDougall agrees.  ""Men in the West are increasingly becoming more active consumers in the beauty and personal care area, though there is a long way to catch up,"" he says. He points to Chanel's recent launch of a make-up line targeted at men called Boy de Chanel - the company chose to debut the products in South Korea, rather than its native France.  Mr McDougall also adds that he doesn't wear make-up or use a fancy skincare routine himself."
Global Bond Market Trends,How 6 countries are quarantining,2024-09-14,2020-03-28,BBC Travel,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20200327-what-coronavirus-reveals-about-the-worlds-culture,"As the world bunkers in, the unique cultural ways that countries are coping with the coronavirus pandemic is revealing a lot about about each nation's distinct character. Our coverage during coronavirus While travelling is on hold due to the coronavirus outbreak, BBC Travel will continue to inform and inspire our readers who want to learn about the world as much as they want to travel there, offering stories that celebrate the people, places and cultures that make this world so wonderfully diverse and amazing. For travel information and stories specifically related to coronavirus, please read the latest updates from our colleagues at BBC News. It’s been said that a person’s true character is revealed in a crisis – and if the coronavirus pandemic has taught us anything so far, the same can be said for a country. As the world increasingly bunkers in to help slow the virus’ spread, one of the most interesting phenomena taking place is the creative, quirky and inspiring ways that different cities and countries are coping with the pandemic and defining their own distinct “quarantine culture” along the way. In Italy, self-isolating residents have been filmed belting opera from their balconies. In Belgium, the nation’s iconic friteries are still doling out French fries. And throughout Scandinavia, some people are still pedalling to work on bikes. In many ways, this global pandemic is laying bare what really matters to different nations, and in the process, revealing a lot about a country’s character. It’s also reminding us of the many people, places and cultures that make this world so wonderfully diverse. We recently asked a few of our contributors to talk about the emerging quarantine cultures where they live.   France   What is France without its boulangeries? While the beret may have fallen out of fashion, the traditional French baguette never will – not even in a pandemic. Following Italy’s lead, the French government here in Paris has imposed strict lockdown measures which require anyone leaving their home to produce a signed form justifying why they’re outside. It has also shuttered all “non-essential” businesses. But while supermarkets and chemists have remained running in this time of need, the official decree issued by the French Health Ministry lists some 40 exceptions that are also deemed “indispensable for the continuity of the life of the nation” – including boulangeries, butchers, wine and cheese shops and the much-beloved tabac corner stores. Now, every morning from Paris to Provence, the scent of freshly baked bread wafts through France’s empty streets as some 33,000 bakeries throughout mainland France remain open. At my local boulangerie, neighbours continue their daily routine of picking up a fresh baguette, ensuring a safe social distance from one another. According to Dominique Anract, president of the National Confederation of French Patisseries and Bakeries (CNPBF), “the baguette is emblematic of French culture.” Anract explained the vital role boulangeries play in a French person’s life. “The first place you visit as a small child is the boulangerie to buy bread. While for the elderly, the only human contact during the day is often with the local boulanger (baker).” You may also be interested in:  • Italy's inspiring response to the coronavirus  • The travel 'ache' you can't translate  • Your questions answered: how Covid-19 has affected travel To Anract, the decision to keep bakeries open in a pandemic makes perfect sense. “Boulangeries are a basic necessity for feeding the French people, many of whom don’t live in close proximity to supermarkets.” Here in Paris, wine seems to be just as valuable as hand sanitizer these days. “The French cannot consider having a good meal without drinking wine. It’s like a meal without bread,” said Thierry Givone, a French wine instructor who runs Wine Tasting In Paris. Some local wine shops have even started delivering “survival packs” of six or 12 bottles to quarantined residents. Our newfound embrace of social distancing may interrupt the cheek-kiss practice of bises, but no pandemic will deny us of our joyful joie de vivre spirit. - Kasia Dietz   Germany Berlin’s nightlife is nothing short of legendary. Over the decades, clubs like Tresor and Berghain have cemented the city’s status as the holy grail for hedonists everywhere, and the world capital of techno. But with the German government recently banning meetings of more than two people, and even Chancellor Angela Merkel retreating to self-isolation, the question of where to party here on a Friday (or Tuesday, or Sunday) night has just one answer: home.  Enter United We Stream (UWS). This government-backed initiative from Berlin’s ClubCommission, an association of around 245 independent clubs and concert venues, is keeping the party alive via daily livestreamed DJ sets from the club floor as ravers self-isolate. Although we’d usually queue outside of a club at 02:00 or later here, the livestreams are held from 19:00 to midnight and viewers are also encouraged to donate to help support the quarantine-affected clubs and artists. “This UWS online party demonstrates a deep solidarity among the Berlin clubs that we are all in the same boat,” said Dimitri Hegemann, who founded Tresor in 1991. It may be unusual to have a night in at the club, but for Berliner Kaisa Berger, the chance to listen to her favourite DJs spin while sitting on her couch in her pyjamas as her dog snoozed next to her is the best of both worlds. “I really enjoyed my ‘party’. At some point, I was even dancing around my living room,” she said. “And then at midnight, the stream ends, and you can go to sleep and wake up the next day refreshed, ready for the next virtual club visit at 19:00 again.” Raquel Fedato, who organises the popular Berlin party Pornceptual sees UWS as a way for the community to come together. She and her partner recently livestreamed a set from Alte Münze, a club in Mitte where Pornceptual is held. “Seeing our DJ friends play again was an uplifting experience,” she said. “While it is still somewhat odd to dance in front of a screen, it took my head off the odd times we are going through."" Strange times though they are, the spirit of Berlin’s nightlife isn’t going away anytime soon – at least not while people can virtually come together. And once the pandemic is over? “In the long term I don’t know what will happen,” said Hegemann. “But I know after [Covid-19], people will take off, and the party won’t stop.” - Krystin Arneson India   In an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day lockdown of the world’s second-most populous country this week, ordering a nation of 1.3 billion people to stay indoors. People are still struggling to understand the ramifications of the lockdown and how to meet their essential shopping and medical needs, but in a country accustomed to bidets, so far, we have not been hoarding toilet paper. Shortly after Modi’s announcement, India’s most famous celebrity couple – Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli and his beloved Bollywood actress wife, Anushka Sharma – took to Twitter to tell their legion of 55 million combined followers to “follow what’s been told to us and stand united.” Yet, what may be hardest for Indians these next three weeks is learning how to – literally – stand divided. Now, we Indians may have many sterling qualities, but queuing up is not one of them. In a country with so many people, the notion of personal space is practically non-existent. And as anyone who has visited here knows, a straight line is usually a circle with dozens of strangers huddling together and shouting over each other to be heard at a shop counter. So, amid the lockdown, supermarkets have started trying to teach Indians how to stand apart at a safe distance and proceed on a first-come-first-served basis by drawing numbered circles with chalk outside of shops. In the state of West Bengal, the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee even paid an unplanned visit to the local market to draw circles on the road herself and explain the concept of social distancing to the masses. Queuing isn’t the only lesson we’re learning. For the past few days, anyone making a phone call in India has had to first listen to a recorded message about the importance of covering your mouth while coughing and washing your hands. But if this viral video from the Kerala Police Department proves anything, it’s that we find the importance of hand hygiene much more delightful when it’s accompanied with an elaborately choreographed Bollywood-style song and dance. - Charukesi Ramadurai  Britain   Even in an age of wellness booze and so-called “nolo beer” (no- and low-alcoholic drinks), the British pub remains as it always has been: a bastion of long-held traditions with atmosphere, ale and – of course – a lack of elbow room and social distancing. Why fix what ain’t broken? As UK Prime Minister and recent Covid-19 infectee Boris Johnson recently said, it’s an inalienable, free-born right for us Brits “to go to the pub”. The coronavirus pandemic has put paid to all that. Boozers rang last orders on Friday 20 March and us frazzled Brits are having to be far more creative when it comes to post-work pints. But with apps like WhatsApp, Skype, Zoom and HouseParty giving us a platform to bevy and banter online with friends from St Ives to Swansea to Shetland, the age of digital drinking and the virtual happy hour has been born. One such pub, Jim the Janny’s Virtual Pub, based in Dundee, now has nearly 13,000 patrons and counting and is fine company of an evening. And so, we’ve embraced the virtual birthday party, the online stag do and on-screen pub quiz. The Lancashire-based Virtual Pub Quiz, for one, saw a world-enlarging 340,000 interested in taking part this week. Our latest digital baptism? The Covid ceilidh, a traditional Scots gathering of folk music and Highland dancing, encouraging fiddlers, bagpipe players and accordionists to strike up the band at home. So, what are you doing this lockdown weekend? There’s still time to open your own virtual pub, or you can jig to a Flying Scotsman, Gay Gordons or Highland Barn Dance. Me? I’ll be attending my first digital happy hour Saturday night with 12 friends from across Glasgow and Edinburgh. Not needing an excuse these days, we’ll take any spirit raiser. - Mike MacEacheran Australia If there is perhaps one tradition that combines Australians’ love for the outdoors, laid-back attitude and knack for surviving on an island swarming with crocodiles, sharks and deadly snakes and spiders, it’s Easter camping. Normally this time of year, hordes of Aussies would be preparing to spend the holiday weekend barbecuing around a campfire with friends and family before our cold winter settles in. The Easter holidays may have been cancelled as the country retreats indoors, but we Australians are an inventive bunch. This week, The Caravan Industry of Australia has started encouraging the more than 300,000 people who would otherwise be setting up camp over the Easter weekend to pitch a tent in their backyards (or living rooms) instead. Indoor campers can marvel at Australia’s wildlife via livestreams from the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, Melbourne Zoo and CaPTA Group Wildlife Parks in Queensland. And all Aussies can still enjoy that most iconic of Australian pastimes, backyard cricket, with Cricket Australia simulating matches and developing tips to ensure that future-world-champion Aussie kids maintain their form. Down under, Covid-19 has largely confined many of us to our homes, but during an impromptu balcony rendition of I Still Call Australia Home we’ve been reminded by Opera Australia performers Tom Hamilton and Tomas Dalton that it’s really not a bad place to be. - Catherine Marshall Korea Between its bustling night markets, round-the-clock work schedules and seemingly indefatigable smartphone culture, Seoul is an unlikely capital for a country known as the Land of the Morning Calm. But during the last several weeks, South Korea’s aggressive social distancing measures have inspired a sweet, serenity-inducing global trend: the rise of soothing online videos showing how to make Korean dalgona coffee. Socialising in South Korea often means meeting up at a cafe, and according to Reuters, the nation actually has one of the highest densities of coffee shops per capita in the world. But with fewer people out, Koreans have instead opted to recreate our cafe culture at home by uploading tutorials of how we whip instant coffee with sugar, milk and ice to make a fluffy, peanut-butter-coloured coffee known locally as dalgona. According to Google Trends, this online craze started frothing higher and higher in late February. And as more people around the globe have been stuck at home making coffee themselves, more and more people around the world have been trying to whip Korean coffee themselves. There are now ASMR-style dalgona videos with 3.5 million views, a global #dalgonacoffeechallenge on Twitter and more than 64 million views for the hashtag on TikTok. The only thing sweeter than the dalgona coffees here may be the trend of leaving handwritten thank-you notes – sometimes accompanied with small gifts – that we have been giving to our nation’s hardworking delivery workers. In Korean culture, a handwritten thank you is a deeper sign of gratitude than a verbal or emailed thank you. The Korea Times once quoted a member of a Korean linguistic association as saying, “our ancestors believed handwritten letters showed a person’s emotions.” Of the thousands of Instagram images showing handwritten thank-you notes and prayers in Korean for delivery men and women, one of the most popular phrases so far is, “I hope there are no more victims of the coronavirus.” - Hahna Yoon Neighbourly love is an uplifting and emotionally engaging BBC Travel series that shows how acts of generosity can have profound effects in destinations around the world.

Global Bond Market Trends,Why buying vintage is ‘the new luxury’,2024-09-14,2020-11-17,Bel Jacobs,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20201113-why-gen-z-and-millennials-go-wild-for-vintage-clothes,"For Gen Z, upcycled, reclaimed fashion is opening up a new sense of individuality and self-expression, while helping to save the planet, writes Bel Jacobs. Few followers of fashion will forget the moment Kate Moss arrived at a New York fashion week dinner, perfect in a pale yellow dress, worn off-the-shoulder, by 1950s French couturier Jean Dessès. That was 2003 and, for a couple of years, Moss wannabes rifled frantically through the rails of local second-hand stores, in the hope of finding something that would approximate Moss’s air of louche glamour. But buying vintage is hard work and, by 2007, when Moss teamed up with Topshop to create clothes inspired by her favourite looks (including the Dessès dress), there was a sense of relief. Vintage was great and all that, we thought –  but readymade was so much easier.   More like this: -          What does a ‘life of luxury’ mean today? -          Fashion photography’s reluctant star -          Why we need soft textures right now    Moss herself was simply continuing a tradition among hip cultural influencers. “In the 1970s, Yves Saint Laurent sent models down the runway in rehashes of his mother’s ’40s evening gowns; Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music suited up in Humphrey Bogart drag and retro GI gear, and kids recreated those looks with flea-market finds,” expert Alex Fury wrote in the Financial Times. “Then again, so did people like Paloma Picasso and Loulou de la Falaise, buying vintage clothes for authenticity and validity – the real deal, not a pale imitation.” Fast forward to the 2020s and vintage is back again –  and this time, arguably, it’s back for good. “When Kate Moss was buying things at flea markets and matching them with super expensive pieces, it felt like the conversation was more naive, more related to the old paradigms of what fashion was – very trend-based, very season-based, very throwaway,” muses Ivan Dauriz, of online store Tug. “Now, we’re seeing a massive change. People will always want to have new looks but they’re becoming more and more aware of the impact of their choices on the environment, and that possibly the best thing all of us can do in this climate crisis is limit the resources we take out of the planet. Vintage speaks to what’s happening right now.” And the world is speaking back. A recent report from second-hand clothes sales platform ThredUp estimated that the total resale market is expected to more than double in value from $24bn (£18bn) to $51bn (£39bn) by 2023, accounting for 10% of the retail market. Depop, a social app targeting Millennial and Gen Z shoppers, now has 13 million users and revenue growth of 100% year-on-year for the past few years, since its launch in 2011. On average, Depop users – 90% under the age of 26 – collectively follow and message each other 85 million times each month. More than ‘back for good’, vintage looks set to become the new norm.  What’s better is that it’s going back to its roots, to the vintage market stalls where true aficionados have been ruggedly plying their trade through the vicissitudes of fashion. When British brand Connolly wanted to do something different during lockdown, they turned to fashion stylist, vintage consultant and Portobello stallholder Frank Akinsete to curate and upcycle eight pieces from the brand’s previous collections. The resulting dip-dyed, hand-block printed capsule collection, named after Akinsete’s blue Burmese cat Rocky and photographed on fellow stallholders, was achingly cool and utterly of its time – and beyond.  Akinsete remembers vintage’s 1990s resurgence, when he and business partner Govella Pangidzwa, opened Souled Out, a small shop on Portobello Green. “The timing was perfect. Portobello was like East London now, super hip. Kate Moss and Helena Christensen, Björk and Kylie, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana: they all came in.” What’s different today? “It’s more than just trendy, it’s a lifestyle – [the popularity of vintage] has come through education and it’s a response to fast fashion – and that’s good.” Currently, Akinsete is working with auction house Bonhams as it prepares its Cool Britannia exhibition for next spring, for which he’ll be curating a section on vintage fashion.    Waking up    This added element of craft and regeneration, of upcycling and repair offers another contemporary dimension to Vintage 2.0. Central Saint Martins student Boy Kloves, who has already collaborated with Converse and dressed the band Haim for V Magazine (and whose way with Hawaiian shirts and vintage napkins will take your breath away) is one of a cohort of designers wholly open to its possibilities. “There’s a rise in young people looking at things that already exist, that are beautiful, that are usable, not only to take inspiration from – but also to use as fabrics for creation,” he says.     “Global warming is a crisis facing our generation; it’s a new thing you have to consider as a young person,” he continues. “Designers and makers are very much problem solvers in their own right. Vintage and upcycling as a method are ways to address the problem in interesting ways.” It is this embedding – of concern for the climate crisis, of the perception of vintage as the logical retort to fast fashion and of upcycling and repair as alternative forms of making – that is the surest sign that vintage has real traction. A generation that has everything to gain and nothing to lose by embracing sustainable practices is waking up, and they mean business.   Even TikTok, the social media platform dominated by dance challenges, is on board – via the talents of Tommy Groenendijk and 22-year-old Jordan Deery, aka Vintage Stock Reserve (VSR). The Florida-based students keep their 1.7 million followers happy with lively upcycling workshops. “Once you start finding heat at the thrift shop, it quickly turns into an ever-growing addiction. It’s like wearing archived collectibles; each piece has history behind it,” Groenendijk told Vogue.com. Alongside patchwork denim jackets and tie-dyed tees, the pair discuss the environmental footprint of clothing, demonstrating that sometimes it’s not the message, but the way it’s delivered that can have maximum impact.  It’s a viewpoint that resonates with Fashion East alumnus Caitlin Price who teamed up with her sister, vintage buyer Emily Price, last year to launch 3am Eternal, a collection of upcycled evening wear. “As much as everyone likes to go shopping, when you consider the amount of waste that is created, there has to be an endpoint to fast fashion,” says Caitlin. “There’s just so much out there. People really respond to the fact we use existing designer pieces they love, brands they love, and that we give it our own spin. It’s accessible, it’s playful but there is also a lot of care and attention. They’re very much one-on-one bespoke. They’re pieces we want people to be inspired by.” It’s certainly a different way of making clothes. “It’s harder,” laughs Kloves. “You have these irregularities, times when you don’t know exactly how it’s going to turn out. It’s an added element to think about but it’s more interesting. It has its own life and you give it a new life and put your own stamp onto it.” Dauriz agrees: “We have a studio in Genoa where we do repair and customisation. But sometimes, when it’s not possible to do a minor change, it might be worth upcycling totally. Because our aim is to completely minimise waste, we create completely new garments from old garments we cannot sell - instead of throwing them away.” All this talk of recycling and upcycling and using old clothes in new ways: fast fashion brands must be shaking in their shoes because the whiff of rebellion is very definitely in the air. New York-based creative director Brynn Hemingway has collaborated with many brands; earlier this year, she launched Display Copy, a new fashion platform dedicated to showcasing and elevating upcycled and vintage fashion. “[Vintage] is Gen Z’s creative expression to find things outside the traditional fashion system and make it their own,” she says. “I was watching the documentary River Blue and it’s heartbreaking. And every time they flashed to a Gap window, my campaign was there. I can’t change the world but I can change the conversation with my community. Display Copy came out of that personal struggle.”    “My hope is that vintage becomes the new luxury and thrift becomes the new streetwear. For the sake of the planet, it has to be that way,” she continues. “Fashion is how we signal our intent,” adds former Vogue.com editor-in-chief and founder of Designer Jumble Abigail Chisman. “[By buying vintage], you display your understanding of the current political climate. And through craft, we’re saying that recycling isn’t enough. We need not to be throwing things away. And where once mending represented necessity, now it represents skills. Right now, there’s a really meaningful need for change. It’s not even a fashion thing. It’s a must.”     Released from the hegemony of trends and the endless march of the high street, buying clothes becomes a source of joy and real creativity, she adds. “I don’t get people coming into my shop and saying, ‘I gather plaid is in’. Now, people come in and see what they like. It’s liberating. A client, a girl of 20, came in and bought herself the most beautiful pair of Claude Montana butter soft leather culottes. And her mum said: ‘Your friends aren’t going to get those.’ And she turned around and said: ‘And?’ That’s where the magic happens. We’re seeing a return to individuality.” All of this comes as no surprise for Herbie Mensah, a longtime Portobello stallholder like Frank Akinsete and a dab hand at up-cycling vintage. He too has high-profile names nipping across his doorstep, looking for inspiration. “I go to a lot of charity shops and it’s mad. There’s stuff from ASOS, Primark and a lot of it is hardly worn. I’m thinking, why do people buy stuff for the sake of buying it and then simply discard it? I rarely buy new and now, during lockdown, I have a whole new clientele – because people want to save money, and find something well made and original. And a lot more of the younger generation are coming in too. What do I think about that? Fair play to them.”   If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

Global Bond Market Trends,A new way of living and dressing,2024-09-14,2020-09-22,Bel Jacobs,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200921-is-2020-a-turning-point-for-fashion,"What we wear has always revealed our values and aspirations, particularly in times of turbulence and upheaval. And now, writes Bel Jacobs, it’s a time for change. 2020 has unarguably been one of the most challenging years in living memory, with countless experts and commentators dedicating themselves to analysing our current upheaval. And yet, there are still few better places to examine cultural change than fashion. “Fashion is a potent visual marker of our times,” says Caroline Stevenson, head of cultural and historical studies at London College of Fashion. “Trend analysis of any given era will reveal society’s values and aspirations.”    More like this: -        The story of the ‘queen of flowers’ -        The ultimate power adornment? -        The birth of Black is Beautiful   It will be interesting to see what trend analysis will make of this time. The world has been in trouble before; both World Wars, for example, led to a flurry of measures designed to make clothing as practical – and as thrifty – as possible. In efforts to conserve precious materials for the war effort, single-breasted suits replaced double-breasted; trouser turn-ups were abolished – much to the annoyance of their male wearers. After World War One, zip fasteners and elastic were frowned upon, except in women’s knickers. Similar trends of thought ran through the Great Depression of the 1930s, when Americans turned their backs on flippy flapper dresses towards more reserved silhouettes. Utility clothing, as it was called, was streamlined and efficient – and sometimes gently embellished. One of the Imperial War Museum’s civilian siren suits boasts puffed shoulders, bell-bottom cuffs, piping decoration and a natty hood. The urge to creative expression runs deep. Meanwhile, handmade and hand-repaired clothing became de rigueur, with the introduction of the government-backed ‘Make do and mend’ scheme, created to encourage people to revive and repair worn-out clothes. When the world moved out of World War Two in the 1950s, a new silhouette emerged, as embodied by Christian Dior’s New Look: “Fitted jackets, padded hips, wasp-like waist and A-line skirts,” says Stevenson. “The New Look represented a new image of prosperity.”   Pared-down lines characterise design in times of trouble; few cultures are going to start embracing extravagance when the chips are down – except, apparently, during the 1960s, a tumultuous decade marked by the civil-rights movement, anti-war protests, political assassinations and the emerging ‘generation gap’. After centuries in which everyone pretty much dressed the same, young people finally got wardrobes of their own – and mined all the revolutionary potential of Eastern influences, of prints and patterns and of army-and-navy surplus clothing stores. The cover of The Beatles’ 1967 album Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Bandremains iconic. But what of this new decade? How can fashion reflect the drifts and swings that the world’s population has endured over the past few months? Can it survive the store and factory closures, the reputational damage, and an audience of economically stricken and fearful consumers? And if it does survive, what form will it take? In trying to answer these questions, fashion futurists have had a busy, if somewhat frantic, six months. Top of the agenda for many brands is health, says Abi Buller, of strategic foresight consultancy, The Future Laboratory. “Already, we’re seeing garments that reflect these heightened concerns. Diesel’s Upfreshing collection, for example, features an ‘antibacterial’ coating.” And just as there is space for puffed shoulders while the bombs drop, there’s also space for humour. Dumbgood’s face masks featuring phrases such as “I know too much about life to have any optimism” speak directly to the streetwear brand’s Gen Z followers. Defiance is rife in this new world. Forecasters have seen an upswing in survivalist clothing; modular designs that can adapt to different climates and protect their wearer. “Living conditions in cities are expected to get harder,” says futurist Geraldine Wharry. She cites Nike’s ISPA as an example of imaginative response: “Improvise. Scavenge. Protect. Adapt” is a “four dimensional design logic inspired by and geared towards the built environment”. There is also the urge to nest. “As we navigate an uncertain future, clothing will become less a tool for shaping outward identities and more an extension of our homes, offering comfort and reliability amidst global turbulence,” says Stevenson. “We are no longer dressing to be seen. Our priorities have shifted to demand maximum comfort. We are now more likely to value ‘well-loved,’ ‘cosy’ and ‘worn-in’ garments that allow us to move with ease. [They represent] the antithesis of fast fashion and an entirely new understanding of style beyond visual representations of identity,” she adds. On one day in March, menswear brand Band of Outsiders sold more than a 1,000 sweatshirts.  Meanwhile, the need for social distancing has found an unusual ally: digitisation. “Digital Fashion Weeks are already emerging, welcoming larger audiences and virtual participation,” says Buller. “People will continue to be creative with clothing that prioritises protection in physical settings – and with digital garments and filters in digital spaces.” Wharry is also fascinated by digital’s possibilities: “Initiatives such as the latest Burberry campaign with Kendall Jenner [the model shot a series of 360 degree photographs of herself before they were rendered, via CGI technology and motion capture, into a digital replica of herself] indicate a greater adoption of how digital fashion could allow us to express ourselves through digital skins.”   Deep change   But the change goes deeper. Ideas of exponential growth, of personal success and of gratification and identity through consumerism – much-lauded through the 1980s and 1990s – have been revealed as pipe dreams, and quite destructive ones at that. “After decades of expansionism, we are contracting, regrouping, reconsidering and refocusing,” says Buller. “There’s definitely been an increased awareness around conscious consumption,” agrees Tom Berry, director of sustainability for online luxury platform Farfetch. “It’s very encouraging. And this, in turn, will fuel further change.” People are buying less but they’re buying better. “People seem willing to invest in higher quality items at a higher price point,” says Berry. “Unconscious consumption is falling out of fashion. It’s incredibly important that this thought trickles down through all levels of the market.” And, if spending more on a single item when incomes are low seems counter-intuitive, think again: “Less disposable income means less money to throw away on clothing each season. Priority will go to clothes that will be fashionable longer than a couple of months,” fashion historian Allison Pfingst told Instyle Magazine, earlier this year. Fashion trends, the most potent driver of speed in the industry, look set to come under some serious scrutiny.   This, along with the understanding that we might actually have enough out there already to keep ourselves decked out for decades, has led to a resurgence of interest in making and mending; the wartime cabinets seem to have got it spot on. Designers are also working on this. British menswear brand Connolly invited Portobello Market vintage-clothing stall owner and stylist, Frank Akinsete, to upcycle pieces from previous collections, highlighting the creativity of Akinsete and his fellow market-stall holders, in a moving photo series. Christopher Raeburn, of design studio Raeburn, recently launched Raefound, an evolving, non-seasonal range of unworn military clothing and accessories.  “What we’re trying to design here is system change, not new clothes,” Raeburn told Vogue on its launch. “It’s responsible design.” He’d be delighted with youngsters Kevin Germanier and Maddie Williams, and of initiatives such as the Redress Design Award, all developing new business models that repurpose and reuse old clothing. At the same time, but linked in spirit, resale and second-hand markets look set to soar to a chunky $51bn (£40bn) by 2023, according to GlobalData. “We’ve also seen significant interest in the pre-owned market, both in terms of consumers wanting to buy pre-owned products but also using services that help them sell unused items,” agrees Berry.   “Fashion still plays a key role in society, both functionally and culturally,” he continues. “At an individual level, the ability to express yourself – or at a collective level the ability to enable connection and belonging – is enabled by fashion. This won’t go away, but the industry does need to live up to its responsibilities, and be part of creating a more positive future.” Buller’s hopes are high. “Fashion in 2030?” she says. “Everyday garments will become more utilitarian, making space for creative digital collections that allow people to continuously reinvent their looks in ways that are less wasteful and harmful to the environment. And retail models will be reinvented with a greater focus on made-to-garment and circular design.” It’s all to play for.   If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

Global Bond Market Trends,The young Singaporeans leaving the nest,2024-09-14,2022-06-24,Samantha HuiQi Yow,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220622-the-young-singaporeans-striking-out-on-their-own,"Most young, single Singaporeans live with their parents. But some are moving into their own places as social norms evolve. When Alan, a civil servant, decided to move out of his family home in Singapore, it still took the 27-year-old another month to broach the topic with his parents. He feared they would not understand or, worse, get upset.  After all, Alan’s home was a pleasant place. The family’s three-bedroom condominium, where his younger brother also lived, wasn’t far from the city-state’s central business district (CBD), where many of his favourite haunts were. There was homemade dinner on the table each night, and his laundry was always done for him. “There wasn’t a push factor, just pull factors,” he says. “I’d lived with my parents my whole life, so I just wanted to experience what it’s like being by myself, you know?”  In the West, leaving home is just another milestone in adulthood. Yet in most Asian societies it is not as culturally accepted; moving out is sometimes perceived as showing disrespect to your parents. In Singapore, living at home until marriage is common practice; an estimated 97% of unmarried individuals between the ages of 15 and 34 lived with their parents in 2013.  While the trend is in part driven by ingrained ideas of filial piety, it’s also linked to government policies on accommodation for young people. Most Singaporeans – more than 80% as of 2022  – live in public housing units, apartments subsidised by the state that are known as HDBs (after the Housing Development Board). About 90% of those who live in HDBs own their home. But crucially, only married heterosexual couples – Singapore does not recognise same-sex marriages – and single individuals older than 35 can buy these public housing units.  Those who can’t buy HDBs can rent (or indeed buy) via the private property market – but costs are much higher. Calculations by research firm ValueChampion show the average price per square foot of a private-sector condominium is more than triple that of an HDB unit. These cost constraints, says Dr Chua Beng Huat, a professor of sociology at National University of Singapore (NUS), “effectively keep most young, unmarried people living at home with their parents”.  Yet Alan, who now rents a flat in Hougang, a neighbourhood in north-east Singapore away from the CBD, with two friends from junior college, is among a growing number of millennial and Gen Z Singaporeans bucking the long-time cultural norm. Some young people, for various reasons, are deciding that the price of independence is worth it – and striking out on their own.  ‘Literal space to grow into an adult’  In recent years, Singapore’s renting culture, previously mostly limited to expatriates, has taken root among locals. Despite climbing rental prices, the number of single Singaporean residents under 35 living alone or away from their parents more than doubled from 2015 to 2020.  Many more may be thinking about moving. One 2021 survey by local real estate portal PropertyGuru showed seven in 10 respondents between the ages of 22 and 39 were considering moving out. “Once you pass a certain age, it can become uncomfortable [to live with your parents] because the freedom of what you can do at home is restricted,” says Chua. Coupled with a lack of privacy, it’s a “difficult position” for an adult to be in. Family Tree This story is part of BBC's Family Tree series, which examines the issues and opportunities parents, children and families face today – and how they'll shape the world tomorrow. Find more on BBC Future. Like Alan, Brenda Tan didn’t feel a push factor when she moved out of her family home at 22 – but she certainly wanted more independence. She’d spent time in shared university dormitories and lived with housemates during a semester abroad in New York, but felt that the next step should be a solo space. “[Living with your parents can feel like] everything is on autopilot and done for you,” the content creator said in a video that chronicled her move into a studio apartment. “You’re not fully taking control of your space, or your diet sometimes… you just eat what’s on the table.”  Being on her own has allowed Tan, now 26, to take ownership of every aspect of her life, from choosing her preferred brands of household items to being able to work more creatively. “Moving out has made me grow up in a way that I truly enjoy. I feel like I’ve blossomed into myself. I have the literal space to grow into an adult.”  Of course, challenges linked to living with parents have always existed, as have young people’s aspirations for independence. But Chua believes the fact that the youngest generations are, on average, better educated, and thus higher earners, than previous generations plays a significant role. Census data from 2020 shows that 57% of residents between 25 and 34 were university graduates, up from 46.5% a decade ago, which already nearly doubled from 24.4% in 2000. Improved earning power, and perhaps changing spending priorities, have made it easier for young Singaporeans to move out and pay rent.  Another factor is that Singaporeans are getting married later in life. “Previously, many, if not most, of this age group would’ve been married,” says Chua, meaning that they would have qualified to buy an HDB. This is increasingly not the case, yet single young adults are also less willing to wait until marriage for a taste of independence.  This doesn’t mean filial piety is eroding, argues Chua. If anything, it’s the way of showing it that’s changing. Fellow NUS sociologist Dr Tan Ern Ser agrees, saying that while young people “have their own preferred lifestyle, which involves moving out of their parental home to live on their own or some other arrangements”, it doesn’t mean they care less about their parents. In fact, “living away from parents could be experienced as less stifling, and may paradoxically strengthen the parent-adult child bond”.  For some, push factors  While many of the nest-fleers will be independence-seekers like Alan and Brenda Tan, William Tan, an estate agent, has seen a rise in renting among one particular group: the LGBTQ community. Tan says that while the majority of potential tenants in the past were expatriates, he’s observed a shift. A Facebook group he set up for LGBTQ-friendly listings is seeing more requests from young Singaporeans. It’s hardly surprising; since housing policies greatly restrict options for the community, renting is more or less the only choice for under-35s seeking their own place. While Singapore’s society has made strides in destigmatising homosexuality, conservative values held by many still make it hard for some to be out. A 2018 survey found that six in 10 respondents believe gay marriage is always, or almost always, wrong. Another survey found that Singapore’s youth were less accepting of family members being in a same-sex relationship than friends or colleagues.  Tan believes that Covid-19 likely accelerated the desire to move out for many LGBTQ young people. “There possibly was a lot of conflict happening [in homes] because of the last two years working remotely,” he says. In his experience, “a lot of them [in the community] are trying to move out for their mental health, because maybe they come from a very toxic or unfriendly home environment”.  Push factors like a poor home environment are of course not limited to young people in the LGBTQ community. For those living in smaller-sized houses, or needing to share a bedroom, home can feel like a pressure cooker.  Jia lives in a two-bedroom HDB flat with her parents and older sister. After graduating from university amid the pandemic, she quickly found a trainee job. But working remotely was a “nightmare”. Her sister was doing the same and their online meetings sometimes clashed, resulting in a distracting environment. Her parents, she admits, are not on the best of terms – and being stuck indoors for long periods during lockdown meant verbal arguments grew frequent. “I can’t escape the noise because it’s a small space,” she says. “Sometimes I’d be speaking on a call and my parents would be shouting in the background.”  Jia mulled over moving out countless times. The thought of a quieter work and living space was tempting, but in the end practicality won out. For now, she’s decided that she’d rather save the bulk of her salary than spend it on rent. There was also another reason holding her back: “I think I would’ve felt super guilty leaving my parents behind.”  This doesn’t mean she rules the possibility out, especially since converting her traineeship into a full-time role now earns her about 50% more. But, ultimately, the deciding factor is still her parents. “Now that we’re all out of the house more, everyone’s in a better mood, it’s bearable,” she says. “But if things [between them] get really bad again like two years ago, I think I’m going to put myself first this time.” ‘Best money I’ve ever spent’  Singapore has built a successful housing model – one that’s widely and frequently praised. But, as recent subtle shifts show, the needs and aspirations of some young people may be changing.  Tweaking the public housing rules to make more low-cost accommodation available to young people could provide relief for many, especially marginalised groups. NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser suggests the public housing board could consider renting out unsold flats or building specially designed rental flats “to cater to young people who are assessed to need their own space”, arguing that current policies should “consider accommodating emerging patterns of preferred living arrangements among young Singaporeans… and seek to accommodate even those who fall outside the rules”.  Until then, if current trends continue, young Singaporeans leaving the nest to rent will become less taboo and more mainstream, driven by a prioritisation of their independence and wellbeing, and enabled by rising disposable incomes. Changing attitudes around what it means to be filial will also help young adults to leave their family homes.  Brenda Tan certainly doesn’t regret her decision – in fact, she feels surer about it than ever. Looking back, the pros she has experienced aren’t rooted just in a sense of freedom, but a sense of responsibility. “It’s the best money I’ve ever spent,” she says. “Living alone lets me recalibrate my emotions. That has been invaluable for me.”  Alan echoes the sentiment, even though his parents weren’t happy with his decision. “I think they took it personally, as if I was saying I hated living with them,” he recalls. They tried to dissuade him – but gave up when Alan’s resolve was clear.  Since moving out, his costs have risen significantly. He still gives his parents a monthly “allowance” of $287 (S$400, £237), something he’s done since earning his first full-time paycheck. He also pays more bills than before – such as groceries, utilities and his insurance payments which were all previously covered by his parents – as well as paying rent on his own shared place. But he considers the additional expenses a worthy trade-off for the independence he’s gained.  “I’m so much more in control of my life now,” he says. “You can’t put a price on that.”  Alan and Jia are using one name only for privacy reasons"

Good luck,2024-09-14,2022-04-26,Meredith Turits,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220421-are-there-enough-remote-jobs-for-everyone-who-wants-one,"Millions of workers are on the hunt for remote jobs. But there may not be enough flexible positions for all of them. Workers want remote jobs. As a widescale return-to-office sweeps the globe, many employees are fighting to stay out of the office as much as possible – and some have plans to leave employers who won’t accommodate a flexible future. Data from a May 2021 Morning Consult survey of 1,000 US adults showed nearly 40% would consider jumping ship if their employers didn’t offer remote-work flexibility. That number shot up to 49% for millennials and Gen Z. Increasingly, many workers have anecdotally reported doing so, too. Although this is throwing some employers into a frenzy, not all are jumping to respond to workers’ demands by opening a remote- or hybrid-work option, or at least keeping jobs quite as location flexible. This is because a supply-and-demand problem may underpin these figures: despite an overabundance of open positions in many countries including the US and UK, and a job market that continues to favour employees, some data shows there simply may not be enough location-flexible jobs for everyone who wants one. These trends differ by countries and industries, but figures are increasingly indicating a far-reaching worker interest that may not align with job-market reality. It might be a tough pill to swallow for workers who feel their options abound – and the result is that some jobseekers may have to bend to an in-office future they’re resisting. A supply-and-demand conundrum Recent global figures from job sites Indeed and LinkedIn, shared with BBC Worklife, show worker interest in jobs with a remote component is outpacing the number of such available roles in many cases. Even as remote-job postings have shot up during the pandemic, “the share of job searches that contain keywords related to remote work has risen even more in most large economies”, points out Pawel Adrjan, head of Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) research at Indeed. “If we look at the US overall, searches for remote work have gone up four-and-a half times as a share of all searches since 2019, and the share of remote job postings has gone up by only 3.2 times.” In the US, postings that explicitly mention remote work between January 2020 and March 2022 are up 319%, yet searches are up 458%. In the UK, remote-job postings have increased a similar 329%, while the number of searches has skyrocketed 790%. This mismatched pattern also holds in countries such as Italy, Germany and France, where remote-job postings have declined (or are generally less available) since their pandemic peak.  Across the world, demand has been outstripping supply in many cases – and, according to Adrjan, people are still very actively searching for at least partially remote roles, even as the pandemic wanes in some economies. He says the supply of these jobs is getting even tighter in countries with weaker broadband infrastructures, like Italy, and in those where cultural acceptance of remote working isn’t as high, like France and Japan. In these economies, the share of remote postings is dropping, as employers begin transitioning newly open roles back to the office. Similarly, LinkedIn’s data on remote jobs – positions explicitly labelled as remote, or ones that contain related keywords, such as ‘work from home’, including hybrid roles – showed a dramatic increase in the number of applications. In March 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic, paid remote jobs attracted 1.8 times the share of applications than paid non-remote jobs; in March 2022, this figure was higher at 2.6 times. Even as the number of remote roles increased, they couldn’t keep pace with the number of applicants for these jobs. “The key takeaway here is that the supply of, and employees’ demand for, remote jobs have both grown rapidly over the past two years, but demand has grown faster,” says Mary Kate Fields, data communications manager at LinkedIn. ‘There’s going to have to be some give’ While remote-work options do still exist, of course, the specific industry of a particular job has a lot to do with how flexible employers are willing to be about where workers are getting jobs done. This is particularly the case where face time is increasingly essential as restrictions ease, like travel, retail and construction, according to LinkedIn’s data as well as Karin Kimbrough, LinkedIn’s chief economist. Oliver Price, UK solutions director for technology at recruiting consultancy Robert Half, agrees that sector influences how many workers can have location-flexible arrangements. Technology is a good example, he says; because the labour market is still so competitive for occupations like developers, workers can afford to press for the remote work they want. “If [an employer has] had a job requisition open and it’s been incredibly challenging to hire the right person, and the right person comes along but has a slightly different personal situation… you have to at least consider that,” he says. In other words, some workers may be in a position to leverage their talent to secure a more preferable remote-work arrangement. Still, as the Great Reshuffle continues, driven largely by workers looking for more flexible accommodations, the reality is some jobseekers may be disappointed by their options. And, says Kimbrough, it’s important to remember that only a third of employers are offering remote work at all – which means at two-thirds of companies, the option isn’t even on the table.  There is one caveat, however – somewhat “hidden” remote roles. Adrjan explains that there may be some companies who are willing to negotiate location flexibility and make personal accommodations, even if they may not explicitly be advertised in job listings. After all, adds Price, employers do need to recruit and retain talent, and understand they may have to give a little on their end to do so. Ultimately, however, Kimbrough says “there’s going to have to be some give by jobseekers”, especially as employers across the globe dig their heels in about a return-to-office as the global economy slows and the labour market rebalances. Price agrees “candidates are having to be a bit more flexible than they even likely want to be at this current period in time”.  “[Workers] have been in the driver’s seat for at least a year, if not longer, but that won't last forever,” says Kimbrough. As we get through this jobseeker-friendly period in the job market, she adds, workers may have to cede their position of power. “I think, ultimately, you’re going to see jobseekers having to compromise a little bit more.”"
Global Bond Market Trends,The secrets of ‘elastic thinking’,2024-09-14,2018-05-16,Dhruti Shah,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180515-how-to-become-an-elastic-thinker-and-problem-solver,"Why your mind should be like a rubber band. Tools for Elastic Thinkers Source: Elastic: Flexible Thinking in a Time of Change Every day at the Alliance Rubber Company’s factory in Hot Springs, Arkansas, a lot of pinging takes place. The family-owned company has known for years that elastic is big business. In 1923, founder William H. Spencer realised he’d hit upon a novel commercial idea when he created rubber bands by cutting up the inner tubes of Goodyear tyres before using them to wrap up newspaper bundles. Since then, the company has diversified what it produces and now services industries including healthcare, shipping, fitness and the military.   Hot crustacean band The company’s rubber products also play a role in the lucrative global lobster market. Jason Risner, Alliance’s director of business strategy, explains: “Traditionally when lobsters and crabs were caught for consumption purposes, their claws were secured with wooden pegs. This was because as soon as the creatures were harvested, they would go into holding tanks underneath fishing boats and fight each other. The wooden pegs also damaged the lobster meat and caused infections. This meant some innovative thinking was needed.” The rubber band has now replaced the pegs to keep lobsters from nipping lumps out of each other. But these humble loops of elastic are saving far more than ill-tempered crustaceans from harm – they help to keep daredevil humans alive too. Rubber bands are used in the packing and deployment systems of parachutes so the canopy can deploy easily. Yet this elastic is very similar to that found in office stationery cupboards or in the hairbands used to tie up hair.   This constant reinvention of their simple product is essential if Alliance wants to continue to succeed, especially as they face rising competition from Thailand and China. The company needs to hire people who are willing to experiment and come up with new innovations in the rubber field, generating ideas that have never been seen before. By default, that means a lot of brain activity from these workers ­– hence all the pinging at the company’s headquarters. It isn’t just the snap of rubber, but also of minds coming up with with creative ways to make their company stand out. For Alliance, hiring people who think in a flexible way is integral to their business model. Unlike analytical thinkers who are driven by logic and sequence, flexible thinkers thrive in situations which involve breaking boundaries and trying new things. The idea of flexible thinking has, of course, been around for aeons but for author, physicist and screenwriter Leonard Mlodinow, it’s now prime time for people to harness the power of ‘elastic thinking’ to navigate an unstable world. Stretch your mind Mlodinow’s book, Elastic: Flexible Thinking in a Constantly Changing World, focuses on the tools required to take advantage of processes that he believes we can all access. Elastic thinking is about stretching your mind and using ‘bottom up’ processing in the brain rather than the top down executive functions that drive analytical thinking. It encompasses a range of processes including, but not confined to, neophilia (an enthusiasm for novelty), schizotypy, imagination, idea generation and divergent thinking. Against the backdrop of the Royal Society of Arts in London on a spring day, Mlodinow explains elastic thinking is not just for artists and writers but for those in all professions. It is also an asset that can be finely honed. “We all have to be trouble-shooters if we want to survive or thrive in today’s changing world,” he says. “Fortunately it’s a skill that’s built into the human brain.” He says human thinking can be set out on a spectrum. “Logical analytical thinking is really good when you are trying to solve a problem you’ve seen before. You can use known methods and techniques to approach whatever issue you are dealing with. Elastic thinking is what you need when the circumstances change and you are dealing with something new. It’s not about following rules.” He describes Uber and Google as strong examples where elastic thinking underpins their creation and adaptability. And what do Leonardo da Vinci and the inventors of Pokemon Go have in common? They are also credited as elastic thinkers. It’s all about connecting the unconnected, trying new things and not being afraid of failure. Much to the chagrin of those overseeing him, renowned polymath da Vinci would deliberately take long breaks away from painting The Last Supper in a bid to give his creative juices time to process. Mlodinow also observes in his book that the Pokemon Go developers ignored widely held beliefs that all gamers wanted to do was “sit and play” and instead, by “leveraging existing technologies in a novel way, they changed the way games developers think."" “You’ll see the new companies – often tech start-ups – that have couches for people to lay around and stare up at the ceiling,” adds Mlodinow. “The workers don’t have managers who are going to come and berate them for that as they know that incubation time is very useful for coming up with and processing ideas.” For those wishing to tap into elastic thinking, Mlodinow suggests carving out time for daydreaming, talking to strangers who are not in your usual social circles, absorbing art out of your comfort zone, and listening to ideas or concepts that you actively disagree with before considering the arguments of the supporters of those ideas and what motivated them. Ollie Cummings, chief operating officer of Nurole, a global online recruitment platform for board and senior executive positions, says there is big demand for flexible thinkers. “We are seeing two trends. One is around cognitive diversity. People want to bring in those who think differently to the board and so avoid ‘group think’. The other is for those who are ‘digitally savvy’.” Order from chaos These desirable traits are something that Lucy Piper, the global head of creative at Intrepid Travel, is very familiar with. She has had a varied career path so far, encompassing film, advertising agencies, copy writing – and much more. “I feel like elastic thinking is key to everything at the moment,” she says. “I’m doing big creative brand work right now and leading projects. It’s about creating processes from scratch and creating order from chaos.” When Piper moved to Australia from the UK in her twenties, she says she realised she would have to make significant changes to her lifestyle and career ambitions, requiring a lot of calculated risks and pivoting between industries. Elastic thinking helped her to be resilient and adapt. “I’m constantly pushing myself out of my comfort zone,” she explains. “I have a personal motto – it’s become a bit of a joke within my team but I’ve seen them apply it too. It’s all about ‘the relentless pursuit of excellence’. I’m trying to achieve high levels of achievement and make it a habit. But it’s about trying different things. We all have it in us. “I will go off on whims though. I took up musical instruments again recently – picked up a guitar and played the piano and tried to flex muscles I hadn’t used in a while.” She adds that she tries to find time in her day for ‘negative space goals’ – deliberate pauses in the day that allow for things like unfocused thinking. The name comes from art: negative space describes the space around the main object of the image at hand. Piper says: “I read about the value of applying negative space to your work so started using it. I’ll make the gaps in my daily life to allow me the time to daydream.” But with the potential to make connections out of almost anything, does this mean life is more difficult because it’s harder to make decisions? Neuroscientist Stacey Bedwell, of Birmingham City University, says: “These individuals may find making certain decisions easier. For instance, being able to imagine various outcomes, without having prior experience or current stimuli, could make certain life decisions or risky decisions easier to make, as the possible consequences can be envisaged.” She says that elastic thinking has helped her in her own career. “As a research scientist, abstract thought and being adaptable is vital to success. To generate new ideas and theories and offer explanations for previously unexplained phenomena, I need the ability to think beyond the present and outside my known environment.” Adapting to change But Leonard Mlodinow warns that elastic thinking can’t just be carried out in isolation and that humans need to be aware of the power of both analytical and elastic thinking in the circumstances that arise in their lives. “If you are 100% on the elastic side, and you have no executive function of your brain ordering your thoughts, you will end up non-functional. The ideas will come so fast and so disconnected you can never get anything done.” Back in Arkansas in the US, Jason Risner from Alliance Rubber Company believes elastic thinkers have helped his business to make technical breakthroughs. “Creative thinking drives our company forward. It’s really crazy what we’ve been able to do and all the markets we’ve been able to penetrate with rubber bands. But we’ve had to look for engineers and people with technical expertise to help with our equipment.    “All of the manufacturing equipment we use is retrofitted to our needs. We’ve had to take things that are meant for bagging potato chips and then retrofit them for our needs.” He believes the company’s success has had a lot to do with its ability to adapt and try new things in the elastic world. And those lobsters mentioned earlier? Risner says there’s a lot of imagination at play at his company right now regarding the connections between the lobster and rubber market. “Billions of lobsters are banded together by hand every year. However, this causes carpal tunnel issues [a wrist injury] for workers, compensation issues for companies and high employee turnover. Year after year, we would see companies fail as they tried to launch a machine to band the lobsters. We’d partner with them and supply the rubber bands for the machines. “Now we’re trying to invent our own machines to fix the problem.” --  To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

Global Bond Market Trends,Gone but not forgotten,2024-09-14,2018-12-25,BBC Culture Editors,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20181218-arts-and-culture-stars-who-died-in-2018,"BBC Culture writers and editors pay tribute to the cultural luminaries we lost this year. Nicolas Roeg Nicolas Roeg was a cameraman on Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, among other 1960s evergreens, before he co-directed Performance (1970). With that background, it was perhaps inevitable that the Londoner’s own films would be visually striking, and that close-ups of Mick Jagger pouting in Performance, Donald Sutherland yelling in anguish in Don’t Look Now (1973), and David Bowie lounging before a bank of television sets in The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976) would adorn countless book and magazine covers. (Angelica Huston’s grotesque make-up in The Witches (1990) was quite something, too, hence it has furnished countless children’s nightmares.) But Roeg did a lot more than design memorable images. Always experimenting with what cinema could do, and what other art forms couldn’t, his psychedelic dramas splintered time and warped reality, mixing the sensual with the ethereal. Watching any of his films, you never know what you are going to see next. He died on 23 November at the age of 90. NB Montserrat Caballé Barcelona was innately linked to the repertoire of soprano superstar Montserrat Caballé – as her birthplace; as the location of the prestigious Liceu Conservatory where a wealthy family funded her vocal studies; and as the title of her 1987 crossover smash duet with Freddie Mercury (who praised Caballé’s voice as “the best in the world”). Yet the whole world was her stage, and she had established her global presence by the mid-1960s – reportedly earning a 25-minute standing ovation for her stand-in lead performance in Lucrezia Borgiaat Carnegie Hall. Caballé earned lavish praise as the embodiment of a bel canto ideal, but she was also unafraid to confront conventions, and the exquisite scale and expression of her voice also evoked an extraordinary lightness and control. Her catalogue amassed accolades including several Grammys, and revealed unexpected twists, from her legendary recitals of Verdi, Bellini and Donizetti, to multi-genre collaborations including Vangelis, Johnny Hallyday, and Iron Maiden’s Bruce Dickinson; she soared in every setting. She died on 6 October aged 85. AH Hubert de Givenchy “Fabric is the most extraordinary thing. It has life,” said Hubert de Givenchy. “You must respect the fabric.” The French fashion designer was known for his stunning, sculptural dresses, and was the creator of the ‘little black dress’. He had many glamorous and notable clients, including Jackie Kennedy, Greta Garbo, Maria Callas, Marlene Dietrich and Grace Kelly. He was a master of understated elegance. Born into an aristocratic family in Beauvais, northern France in 1927, he went on to study at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and then worked for avant-garde designer Elsa Schiaparelli. In 1952 he opened his own fashion house, Givenchy, and became known for his progressive, innovative designs. He met actress Audrey Hepburn in 1953 during the shooting of Sabrina, and he went on to design the black dress she wore in Breakfast at Tiffany’s. Hepburn soon became Givenchy’s close friend, his muse and a major proponent of his fashion. In 1954 the prêt-à-porter collection was launched, and in 1958 he created the iconic ‘Balloon coat’ and ‘Baby Doll’ dress. In 1969, he launched a menswear line. He sold his business to LVMH in 1988. In later life, Givenchy lived in the Château du Jonchet, a restored historic castle near Paris, with long-time partner, the fashion designer Philippe Venet. He retired from fashion in 1995. “Life is like a book,” he once said. “You have to know when to turn the page.” He died on 10 March 2018, aged 91. LB Charles Aznavour The diminutive yet grandly debonair Charles Aznavour brought a quintessential French identity to global pop culture, in deep-rooted ways; one of his formative gigs as a young singer-songwriter was even supporting Edith Piaf at the Moulin Rouge. As he established his success, Aznavour would regularly be described as “the French Frank Sinatra”; he balanced a showbiz presence (joining the likes of Liza Minnelli onstage) with a self-deprecating charm – and a particular grace and bittersweet spirit at the heart of his work. Even English-language classics such as She, The Old-Fashioned Wayand What Makes A Man were steeped in the emotive story-telling of French chanson. His rich filmography also reflected his range, including 1979 Oscar-winner The Tin Drum and Atom Egoyan’s 2002 drama Ararat(which reflected Aznavour’s Armenian heritage). When Aznavour died, tributes included President Macron pronouncing him one of the most significant “faces of France”; he remains one of its most unmistakable voices. He died on 1 October at the age of 94. AH Philip Roth  He may have decisively set down his pen with the publication of his 2010 novel, Nemesis, but Philip Roth’s death earlier this year still registered as an immense loss to literature, especially coming a time when his cautionary 2004 novel, The Plot Against America, feels so eerily prescient. The son of first-generation Jewish-Americans, he was born in Newark on 19 March 1933. His teen years informed Portnoy’s Complaint, his first commercial success, but he made his debut a decade earlier, in 1959, with the fearless Goodbye, Columbus, a novella and short stories that ruffled as many feathers with its descriptions of faith as Portnoy would with sex. Roth, a baseball lover with a peerless work ethic, also brought his wry, steely intelligence to bear on masculinity, class, and identity. In late middle-age, a tumultuous chapter featuring prescription sedatives, a quintuple heart bypass and a bitter divorce ushered in his richest creative period, producing the likes of Sabbath’s Theatre, I Married a Communist, and The Human Stain – all provocative, quintessentially great American novels with universal reach. Roth was arguably the best writer not to have won the Nobel Prize since Tolstoy. He died on 22 May, aged 85. HA Aretha Franklin The Memphis-born Queen of Soul’s reign was a truly extraordinary one, throughout a career that spanned nearly six exceptional decades (she recorded her 1956 debut album aged 14). Aretha achieved millions of international record sales, including countless classics – Respect, (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman, Chain Of Fools, Rock Steady and Spanish Harlem to name a few of her solo numbers – and numerous accolades including 18 Grammy Awards. She drew deeply from her gospel roots, and she created a soundtrack for world history (performing at both Martin Luther King’s funeral in 1968, and Obama’s inauguration in 2009) and everyday heartbreak and joy. Even now, it does not feel right to refer to Aretha’s voice in the past tense, because it always sounds so fantastically, vitally in the moment. She died on 16 August at the aged of 76. AH Robert Indiana A leading proponent in the Pop Art movement, Robert Indiana designed the Love print as his Christmas card in 1965 (the logo had previously appeared in poems and a painting). It became one of the most recognisable artworks of the 20th Century, featuring in paintings and sculptures as well as some 330 million postage stamps. According to Indiana, he only received a fee of $1000 for the stamp design – he called the design the 20th Century’s “most plagiarised work of art”, keeping a collection of knock-offs in his home. But he was happy to recreate it with the word ‘hope’ for Barack Obama’s presidential campaign in 2008, donating all proceeds from the sale of reproductions to the campaign and raising more than $1m. Born Robert Clark in New Castle, Indiana on 13 September 1928, he moved to New York in 1954, becoming lovers with the artist Ellsworth Kelly two years later and adopting the name of his home state. Indiana described himself as an “American painter of signs” – yet his work resounded far beyond the surface; one curator has argued that he inflected Pop Art with “the darker side of the American dream”. He died on 19 May, aged 89. FM VS Naipaul  Sir Vidia Surajprasad Naipaul snagged almost every literary prize worth winning, including a Nobel, but he could be a divisive figure and death has yet to diminish that. He was born in rural Trinidad on 17 August 1932 to Hindu parents of Indian origin. His father, a journalist, had a passion for Shakespeare and Dickens and stoked a fiery literary ambition in his son. After leaving the Caribbean in 1950 for Oxford, where he tried to commit suicide, Naipaul published his first novels while still in his mid-20s. In 1961, his masterpiece, A House for Mr Biswas, appeared. Autobiographical and keenly comic, its themes of identity, exile and post-colonialism recur throughout his writing. Having by then made his home in London, a questing rootlessness sent him roaming across India and Africa, resulting in travel books full of challenging, often unflattering views. He fanned the flames with a high-handed, irascible manner and a sometimes dubious attitude towards women, but his brilliance as a stylist endures. He died on 11 August, aged 85. HA Mark E Smith Fired-up; frequently caustic; weirdly poetic – Mark E Smith was the real-deal indie music anti-hero. Smith formed The Fall after seeing the Sex Pistols’ infamous Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall gig in 1976 (which also triggered the post-punk formation of Joy Division, The Smiths and Buzzcocks); he remained the only constant in The Fall’s raucous career (largely because he repeatedly sacked his bandmates). His death at 60 followed a long period of illness from lung and kidney cancer, which had also forced Smith to cancel gig dates. His legacy rages on vividly, through a 31-album catalogue with The Fall, from 1979’s Live at The Witch Trials, through artful highlights like 1988’s I Am Kurious Oranj (created as a collaboration with dancer Michael Clark), to 2017’s New Facts Emerge, as well as collaborations with the likes of electronic act Mouse On Mars (as Von Südenfed) and Gorillaz. His attitude and diatribes were uncompromising and deeply scathing of mainstream trends, but they were also smartly witty and surreally funky enough to earn him massive love(-uh!) – and a brilliant 20ft tribute mural on the side of a chip shop in his Prestwich hometown. He died on 24 January, aged 60. AH Sridevi Sridevi – born Shree Amma Yanger Ayyappan – was only 54 when she died, but it’s a struggle to think of any other actor who accomplished as much. She appeared in her first Tamil film as a four-year-old child, and acted in three further languages before moving to the Hindi-language world of Bollywood, aged nine. She went on to become Indian cinema’s first female superstar. Reserved and private when she wasn’t performing, she held nothing back when the cameras were rolling. Whether she was lighting up the screen with knockabout comedy or steamy dance routines – see Mr India (1987) for some unforgettable examples of both – no one was more vivacious or expressive. She also used her popularity to change the industry, insisting that her characters were strong independent women, and that she had the same screen-time and pay as her male co-stars. After she married producer Boney Kapoor in 1996, she stepped away from Bollywood, and she didn’t return until shortly before her death. She died on 24 February, aged 54. NB Neil Simon  Back in August, Broadway dimmed its lights in tribute to Neil Simon, the Pulitzer-winning playwright, screenwriter and memoirist long hailed as its king. Born in the Bronx on 4 July 1927, Simon escaped to the cinema as an escape from shyness and warring parents during his Depression-era boyhood. By his mid-20s, he was writing for Syd Caesar’s TV show, and in 1961, he made his Broadway debut with Come Blow Your Horn. It took him three years and 20 rewrites – an uncharacteristically slow start to a career that would be defined by prolificacy. His first real hit, Barefoot in the Park, came just two years later, and at his peak, he had four shows running on Broadway simultaneously. “It’s got to be funny almost every 15 seconds,” Simon once said of his oeuvre, that nevertheless grappled with love, divorce, sibling rivalry and ageing. The Odd Couple, one of his many plays to be embraced by Hollywood, established a dominant theme: seemingly incompatible duos trapped together. While his later works sometimes seemed dated, Simon’s bittersweet humour remains accessible, poignant and above all hilarious. He died on 26 August, aged 91. HA Kate Spade Kate Spade was synonymous with fashionable New York in the 1990s. The US designer and businesswoman was the founder and former co-owner of the brand Kate Spade New York, which created sophisticated but functional handbags. Born in Kansas City, Missouri, she studied journalism and then worked in the accessories department at the fashion magazine Mademoiselle. She and her husband Andy Spade spotted a market for stylish accessible bags, and founded the company in 1993. The business soon expanded into other product lines, including homeware. The bags were simple and elegant, and marked a shift in accessories towards more affordable luxury. The business was partially sold in 1999, and the rest in 2006. In 2016 she and her husband launched a new footwear and handbag brand called Frances Valentine. The couple had one daughter, Frances. Editor-in-chief of US Vogue Anna Wintour said of the designer: “Her bags came to encapsulate a decidedly Manhattan moment in time,” adding that it was impossible to walk a block in the city without seeing one. Spade died on 5 June, at the age of 55. LB Stan Lee By the time Stan ‘The Man’ Lee died, he had lived to see the characters he co-created dominate not just his chosen medium of comics, but cinema and television, too. The roll call of those characters is, to use one of his favoured adjectives, amazing: Spider-Man, the Hulk, The Fantastic Four, Thor, Iron Man, The X-Men, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man, and more. Almost as amazing is that Lee dreamt up nearly all of these Marvel superheroes in the early 1960s. Then and now, they are as human as they are superhuman. Spider-Man is a nerdy teenager, the Hulk a frustrated child; the Fantastic Four is about family dynamics, the X-Men is about school dynamics. And all of his superheroes are outsiders – a condition that Lee, as the son of Romanian-Jewish immigrants, understood only too well. This June also saw the death of Steve Ditko, the visionary artist who co-created Spider-Man and Doctor Strange. You could call it the end of an era, except that the Marvel era rolls on. As The Man said, “Excelsior!” He died on 12 November, aged 95. NB Penny Marshall The woman born Carole Penny Marshall in 1943 in The Bronx, New York might be best remembered as one half of the beloved TV duo, Laverne & Shirley, but it’s as a trailblazer for women in the film industry that she deserves the most credit. Along with her co-star Cindy Williams, the characters of LaVerne DeFazio and Shirley Feeney made their debut on the hit US TV show Happy Days in November 1975, playing dates for Fonzie and Richie. The wisecracking pair were such a hit that a spin-off series soon ensued, running from 1976 until 1983. Marshall directed several episodes of the programme and in 1986 she made her debut feature film, Jumpin’ Jack Flash, which starred Whoopi Goldberg. With Big (1988) starring Tom Hanks, Marshall became the first woman to direct a film that made more than $100m (£79m) at the US box office. She went on to direct Awakenings (1990), starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, which was nominated for an Academy Award for best picture. Along with Jumpin’ Jack Flash, female protagonists featured in several of Marshall’s films, including A League of Their Own (1992), about an all-female baseball league, and Riding in Cars with Boys (2001). Known for her warmth and sense of humour, tributes to Marshall included one from her former husband, Rob Reiner, who wrote on Twitter: “She was born with a great gift. She was born with a funnybone and the instinct of how to use it. I was very lucky to have lived with her and her funnybone. I will miss her.” And from her co-star Williams, with whom she had remained friends until her death, simply “I Love You, Partner.” Penny Marshall died on 17 December, aged 75. RL Pete Shelley Pete Shelley embodied punk spirit with heart, guts and soul. Born Pete McNeish in Lancashire, Shelley co-founded punk/new wave upstarts Buzzcocks with Bolton college mate Howard Devoto (then Howard Trafford). Buzzcocks had intended to debut as support for the Sex Pistols’ infamous 1976 Manchester gig (organised by Shelley and Devoto, and attended by the likes of Mark E Smith); they actually hit the stage at a later date, also scoring success with their independently released EP, Spiral Scratch. When Devoto left to form Magazine, guitarist Shelley took over as Buzzcocks lead vocalist and main songwriter, fuelling smart and sparky late-70s classics such as Orgasm Addict, What Do I Get, Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn’t’ve), and Everybody’s Happy Nowadays. Shelley was innovative, fearless and funny; he was married twice, but warrants respect as a queer icon (his electro-tinged 1981 solo hit Homosapien was initially banned for its gay references). He remained vitally creative, reuniting with Devoto on 2002’s Buzzkunst collaboration and the reformed Buzzcocks (including 2014 album The Way). Shelley died aged 63 at his home in Talinn, Estonia; his catalogue endures as the work of one of Britain’s sharpest songwriters. He died on 6 December, aged 63. AH Tom Wolfe Journalist and novelist Tom Wolfe was known as a contrarian and a dandyish dresser, often to be seen around Manhattan in his dapper, trademark three-piece white suit, starched collar, white shoes and hat. Born in Richmond, Virginia, he was encouraged by his mother to draw and write. In New York in the 1960s and 70s he became one of the pioneers of the New Journalism. He was a brilliant satirist, who delighted in puncturing the pretensions of others, and he had a great flair for trend spotting, inventing idioms such as ‘Radical chic’ and ‘the Me Decade’. Wolfe’s prose style was extravagant and inventive, and he was known for his verbal dexterity and unorthodox punctuation. From 1965 to 1981 he wrote nine non-fiction books, including the acclaimed account of the 60s counterculture, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. The Right Stuff (1979), a non-fiction account of the first Nasa astronauts, won the National Book Award and was adapted into an Oscar-winning film. His 1987 novel The Bonfire of the Vanities was a wide-ranging satire on the vanity, greed and excess of the 1980s. A runaway best-seller, the novel told the story of unscrupulous bond trader Sherman McCoy, a self-proclaimed ‘Master of the Universe’. Wolfe subsequently wrote several more novels including the 1998 best-seller A Man in Full. In 1978 he married Sheila Berger, the art director at Harper’s magazine, and they had two children, Alexandra and Tommy. “He is probably the most skilful writer in America,” wrote William F Buckley Jr in National Review. “I mean by that he can do more things with words than anyone else.” He died on 14 May 2018 at the age of 88. LB Miloš Forman In 1967, Miloš Forman directed The Fireman’s Ball, a low-budget, 71-minute farce shot in a Czechoslovak provincial town with a cast of locals who had never acted before. The next time he made a film in his home country, it was 1984’s Amadeus, a sumptuous, 161-minute historical extravaganza that would win a shelf-load of Oscars. But as different as they might seem, Forman’s films all shared the mocking, anti-authoritarian attitude that he developed while growing up under Soviet rule. The most acclaimed of them is One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975), which won Oscars in five of the main categories: film, director, adapted screenplay, actor and actress. But Forman’s love of misfit rebels with a cause, and his suspicion of the establishment, extended to The People vs Larry Flint (1996), Man on the Moon (1999), and beyond. He died on 13 April, aged 86. NB Avicii Under the stage name Avicii, the man born Tim Bergling in Sweden conquered the European dance scene in his short lifetime. The musician, DJ and record producer became a household name in 2011 with the single Levels, which peaked at number four in the UK singles chart, spent 20 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated for a Grammy in 2013. The international success of Levels catapulted him to fame, and with it came a gruelling tour schedule. Following a previous stint in hospital in 2012, Bergling was forced to pull out of a festival in Miami to have emergency appendix and gallbladder surgery in 2014. Throughout his short but hugely successful career, he collaborated with high-profile artists including Madonna, Coldplay and Rita Ora, and in 2014 Forbes estimated his worth at $28 million. In 2016 Bergling announced that he was retiring from touring, telling The Hollywood Reporter that the decision made him “happier than I have been in a very, very long time”. After his death, his family chose to turn his website into an online memorial to him, writing: “Tim created music that brought people together with timeless memories from all over the world… His music and your memories are forever.” He died on 20 April, aged 28. AC William Goldman In the history of Hollywood, there have only been a handful of famous screenwriters who weren’t directors, too. One of them was William Goldman, who scripted a remarkable number of gloriously watchable classics, including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), All the President’s Men (1976), Misery (1990), Marathon Man (1976) and The Princess Bride (1987) – the last two of which were adapted from his own novels. But he is almost as well known among cinephiles for the irreverent tell-all book he wrote about his Hollywood career, Adventures in the Screen Trade (1983). He saw screenwriting as a craft, not an art, and he was pragmatic about throwing out or adding in whatever it took to improve a film. But that didn’t mean his scripts were calculating or formulaic. Whether he was crafting a political thriller or a comic fantasy, his characters’ scruffy humanity and modern ironic wit were as distinctive as the motifs of any director. He died on 16 November, at the age of 87. NB Dolores O'Riordan When Dolores O’Riordan hit global fame as the young frontwoman of Limerick alt-rockers The Cranberries in the mid-90s, she struck an ingenue kind of figure: at odds with the blokey posturing of that era’s Britpop and grunge scenes. There was a trilling fragility to O’Riordan’s voice, but also a heart-rending sweetness and power, summoned on sweeping anthems such as Dreams and Linger, songs with increasingly political sentiments (Zombie; Salvation) and solo material. O’Riordan struggled with the brutal intrusions of fame; she was courageously frank about her health issues and personal traumas, and after an attempted suicide in 2013, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In recent years, O’Riordan returned to record with The Cranberries (including the 2017 ‘unplugged’ album Something Else) and plan collaborations, before the shock of her sudden death. Her songs retain a rare resonance: there is the pain of what she endured, but also the beauty of what she created. She died on 15 January 2018, aged 46. AH Burt Reynolds Burt Reynolds was one of Hollywood’s most bankable stars from the early 1970s until the mid-1980s, beginning with his breakthrough role in Jon Boorman’s Deliverance in 1972, and continuing through Smokey and the Bandit (1977), The Cannonball Run (1981) and his other car chase movies. After that... well, his trajectory had peaks and troughs, to put it politely, with a hit 90s sitcom (Evening Shade) and a cool comeback (Paul Thomas Anderson’s Boogie Nights in 1997) making fewer headlines than his various bankruptcies and break-ups. But there was no joke you could make about Reynolds that he hadn’t made himself. He owed his early success to his self-deprecating humour as a talk-show guest, and from then on audiences loved the sense that he was a laidback, unpretentious southern guy who was just too manly to take showbiz seriously. “I don’t have any pretensions about wanting to be Hamlet,” he told one journalist. “I would just like to be the best Burt Reynolds around.” And he was. He died on 6 September, at the age of 82. NB Bernardo Bertolucci From Before the Revolution (1964) to The Dreamers (2003), Bernardo Bertolucci’s films often featured left-wing radicals, and the films were radical, too: always venturing boldly into new and dangerous territory. The Conformist (1970) – ranked at 77 in BBC Culture’s list of the top 100 foreign-language films – is a brilliant synthesis of psychoanalysis, politics, architecture, sex and violence. Last Tango in Paris (1972) is so scandalously sexual that US film critic Pauline Kael pronounced it a “landmark” and a “breakthrough” comparable to Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring. The director’s cut of the sprawling 1900 (1976), starring Robert De Niro and Gerard Depardieu, clocked in at five hours. And the multi-Oscar-winning The Last Emperor (1987) was the first western film to capture the splendour of the Forbidden City in Beijing. One of the giants of Italian cinema, Bertolucci’s reputation had diminished by the end of his life. He died on 26 November 2018, aged 77.

Global Bond Market Trends,The young Singaporeans leaving the nest,2024-09-14,2022-06-24,Samantha HuiQi Yow,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220622-the-young-singaporeans-striking-out-on-their-own,"Most young, single Singaporeans live with their parents. But some are moving into their own places as social norms evolve. When Alan, a civil servant, decided to move out of his family home in Singapore, it still took the 27-year-old another month to broach the topic with his parents. He feared they would not understand or, worse, get upset.  After all, Alan’s home was a pleasant place. The family’s three-bedroom condominium, where his younger brother also lived, wasn’t far from the city-state’s central business district (CBD), where many of his favourite haunts were. There was homemade dinner on the table each night, and his laundry was always done for him. “There wasn’t a push factor, just pull factors,” he says. “I’d lived with my parents my whole life, so I just wanted to experience what it’s like being by myself, you know?”  In the West, leaving home is just another milestone in adulthood. Yet in most Asian societies it is not as culturally accepted; moving out is sometimes perceived as showing disrespect to your parents. In Singapore, living at home until marriage is common practice; an estimated 97% of unmarried individuals between the ages of 15 and 34 lived with their parents in 2013.  While the trend is in part driven by ingrained ideas of filial piety, it’s also linked to government policies on accommodation for young people. Most Singaporeans – more than 80% as of 2022  – live in public housing units, apartments subsidised by the state that are known as HDBs (after the Housing Development Board). About 90% of those who live in HDBs own their home. But crucially, only married heterosexual couples – Singapore does not recognise same-sex marriages – and single individuals older than 35 can buy these public housing units.  Those who can’t buy HDBs can rent (or indeed buy) via the private property market – but costs are much higher. Calculations by research firm ValueChampion show the average price per square foot of a private-sector condominium is more than triple that of an HDB unit. These cost constraints, says Dr Chua Beng Huat, a professor of sociology at National University of Singapore (NUS), “effectively keep most young, unmarried people living at home with their parents”.  Yet Alan, who now rents a flat in Hougang, a neighbourhood in north-east Singapore away from the CBD, with two friends from junior college, is among a growing number of millennial and Gen Z Singaporeans bucking the long-time cultural norm. Some young people, for various reasons, are deciding that the price of independence is worth it – and striking out on their own.  ‘Literal space to grow into an adult’  In recent years, Singapore’s renting culture, previously mostly limited to expatriates, has taken root among locals. Despite climbing rental prices, the number of single Singaporean residents under 35 living alone or away from their parents more than doubled from 2015 to 2020.  Many more may be thinking about moving. One 2021 survey by local real estate portal PropertyGuru showed seven in 10 respondents between the ages of 22 and 39 were considering moving out. “Once you pass a certain age, it can become uncomfortable [to live with your parents] because the freedom of what you can do at home is restricted,” says Chua. Coupled with a lack of privacy, it’s a “difficult position” for an adult to be in. Family Tree This story is part of BBC's Family Tree series, which examines the issues and opportunities parents, children and families face today – and how they'll shape the world tomorrow. Find more on BBC Future. Like Alan, Brenda Tan didn’t feel a push factor when she moved out of her family home at 22 – but she certainly wanted more independence. She’d spent time in shared university dormitories and lived with housemates during a semester abroad in New York, but felt that the next step should be a solo space. “[Living with your parents can feel like] everything is on autopilot and done for you,” the content creator said in a video that chronicled her move into a studio apartment. “You’re not fully taking control of your space, or your diet sometimes… you just eat what’s on the table.”  Being on her own has allowed Tan, now 26, to take ownership of every aspect of her life, from choosing her preferred brands of household items to being able to work more creatively. “Moving out has made me grow up in a way that I truly enjoy. I feel like I’ve blossomed into myself. I have the literal space to grow into an adult.”  Of course, challenges linked to living with parents have always existed, as have young people’s aspirations for independence. But Chua believes the fact that the youngest generations are, on average, better educated, and thus higher earners, than previous generations plays a significant role. Census data from 2020 shows that 57% of residents between 25 and 34 were university graduates, up from 46.5% a decade ago, which already nearly doubled from 24.4% in 2000. Improved earning power, and perhaps changing spending priorities, have made it easier for young Singaporeans to move out and pay rent.  Another factor is that Singaporeans are getting married later in life. “Previously, many, if not most, of this age group would’ve been married,” says Chua, meaning that they would have qualified to buy an HDB. This is increasingly not the case, yet single young adults are also less willing to wait until marriage for a taste of independence.  This doesn’t mean filial piety is eroding, argues Chua. If anything, it’s the way of showing it that’s changing. Fellow NUS sociologist Dr Tan Ern Ser agrees, saying that while young people “have their own preferred lifestyle, which involves moving out of their parental home to live on their own or some other arrangements”, it doesn’t mean they care less about their parents. In fact, “living away from parents could be experienced as less stifling, and may paradoxically strengthen the parent-adult child bond”.  For some, push factors  While many of the nest-fleers will be independence-seekers like Alan and Brenda Tan, William Tan, an estate agent, has seen a rise in renting among one particular group: the LGBTQ community. Tan says that while the majority of potential tenants in the past were expatriates, he’s observed a shift. A Facebook group he set up for LGBTQ-friendly listings is seeing more requests from young Singaporeans. It’s hardly surprising; since housing policies greatly restrict options for the community, renting is more or less the only choice for under-35s seeking their own place. While Singapore’s society has made strides in destigmatising homosexuality, conservative values held by many still make it hard for some to be out. A 2018 survey found that six in 10 respondents believe gay marriage is always, or almost always, wrong. Another survey found that Singapore’s youth were less accepting of family members being in a same-sex relationship than friends or colleagues.  Tan believes that Covid-19 likely accelerated the desire to move out for many LGBTQ young people. “There possibly was a lot of conflict happening [in homes] because of the last two years working remotely,” he says. In his experience, “a lot of them [in the community] are trying to move out for their mental health, because maybe they come from a very toxic or unfriendly home environment”.  Push factors like a poor home environment are of course not limited to young people in the LGBTQ community. For those living in smaller-sized houses, or needing to share a bedroom, home can feel like a pressure cooker.  Jia lives in a two-bedroom HDB flat with her parents and older sister. After graduating from university amid the pandemic, she quickly found a trainee job. But working remotely was a “nightmare”. Her sister was doing the same and their online meetings sometimes clashed, resulting in a distracting environment. Her parents, she admits, are not on the best of terms – and being stuck indoors for long periods during lockdown meant verbal arguments grew frequent. “I can’t escape the noise because it’s a small space,” she says. “Sometimes I’d be speaking on a call and my parents would be shouting in the background.”  Jia mulled over moving out countless times. The thought of a quieter work and living space was tempting, but in the end practicality won out. For now, she’s decided that she’d rather save the bulk of her salary than spend it on rent. There was also another reason holding her back: “I think I would’ve felt super guilty leaving my parents behind.”  This doesn’t mean she rules the possibility out, especially since converting her traineeship into a full-time role now earns her about 50% more. But, ultimately, the deciding factor is still her parents. “Now that we’re all out of the house more, everyone’s in a better mood, it’s bearable,” she says. “But if things [between them] get really bad again like two years ago, I think I’m going to put myself first this time.” ‘Best money I’ve ever spent’  Singapore has built a successful housing model – one that’s widely and frequently praised. But, as recent subtle shifts show, the needs and aspirations of some young people may be changing.  Tweaking the public housing rules to make more low-cost accommodation available to young people could provide relief for many, especially marginalised groups. NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser suggests the public housing board could consider renting out unsold flats or building specially designed rental flats “to cater to young people who are assessed to need their own space”, arguing that current policies should “consider accommodating emerging patterns of preferred living arrangements among young Singaporeans… and seek to accommodate even those who fall outside the rules”.  Until then, if current trends continue, young Singaporeans leaving the nest to rent will become less taboo and more mainstream, driven by a prioritisation of their independence and wellbeing, and enabled by rising disposable incomes. Changing attitudes around what it means to be filial will also help young adults to leave their family homes.  Brenda Tan certainly doesn’t regret her decision – in fact, she feels surer about it than ever. Looking back, the pros she has experienced aren’t rooted just in a sense of freedom, but a sense of responsibility. “It’s the best money I’ve ever spent,” she says. “Living alone lets me recalibrate my emotions. That has been invaluable for me.”  Alan echoes the sentiment, even though his parents weren’t happy with his decision. “I think they took it personally, as if I was saying I hated living with them,” he recalls. They tried to dissuade him – but gave up when Alan’s resolve was clear.  Since moving out, his costs have risen significantly. He still gives his parents a monthly “allowance” of $287 (S$400, £237), something he’s done since earning his first full-time paycheck. He also pays more bills than before – such as groceries, utilities and his insurance payments which were all previously covered by his parents – as well as paying rent on his own shared place. But he considers the additional expenses a worthy trade-off for the independence he’s gained.  “I’m so much more in control of my life now,” he says. “You can’t put a price on that.”  Alan and Jia are using one name only for privacy reasons"
Global Bond Market Trends,Want a remote job? Good luck,2024-09-14,2022-04-26,Meredith Turits,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220421-are-there-enough-remote-jobs-for-everyone-who-wants-one,"Millions of workers are on the hunt for remote jobs. But there may not be enough flexible positions for all of them. Workers want remote jobs. As a widescale return-to-office sweeps the globe, many employees are fighting to stay out of the office as much as possible – and some have plans to leave employers who won’t accommodate a flexible future. Data from a May 2021 Morning Consult survey of 1,000 US adults showed nearly 40% would consider jumping ship if their employers didn’t offer remote-work flexibility. That number shot up to 49% for millennials and Gen Z. Increasingly, many workers have anecdotally reported doing so, too. Although this is throwing some employers into a frenzy, not all are jumping to respond to workers’ demands by opening a remote- or hybrid-work option, or at least keeping jobs quite as location flexible. This is because a supply-and-demand problem may underpin these figures: despite an overabundance of open positions in many countries including the US and UK, and a job market that continues to favour employees, some data shows there simply may not be enough location-flexible jobs for everyone who wants one. These trends differ by countries and industries, but figures are increasingly indicating a far-reaching worker interest that may not align with job-market reality. It might be a tough pill to swallow for workers who feel their options abound – and the result is that some jobseekers may have to bend to an in-office future they’re resisting. A supply-and-demand conundrum Recent global figures from job sites Indeed and LinkedIn, shared with BBC Worklife, show worker interest in jobs with a remote component is outpacing the number of such available roles in many cases. Even as remote-job postings have shot up during the pandemic, “the share of job searches that contain keywords related to remote work has risen even more in most large economies”, points out Pawel Adrjan, head of Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) research at Indeed. “If we look at the US overall, searches for remote work have gone up four-and-a half times as a share of all searches since 2019, and the share of remote job postings has gone up by only 3.2 times.” In the US, postings that explicitly mention remote work between January 2020 and March 2022 are up 319%, yet searches are up 458%. In the UK, remote-job postings have increased a similar 329%, while the number of searches has skyrocketed 790%. This mismatched pattern also holds in countries such as Italy, Germany and France, where remote-job postings have declined (or are generally less available) since their pandemic peak.  Across the world, demand has been outstripping supply in many cases – and, according to Adrjan, people are still very actively searching for at least partially remote roles, even as the pandemic wanes in some economies. He says the supply of these jobs is getting even tighter in countries with weaker broadband infrastructures, like Italy, and in those where cultural acceptance of remote working isn’t as high, like France and Japan. In these economies, the share of remote postings is dropping, as employers begin transitioning newly open roles back to the office. Similarly, LinkedIn’s data on remote jobs – positions explicitly labelled as remote, or ones that contain related keywords, such as ‘work from home’, including hybrid roles – showed a dramatic increase in the number of applications. In March 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic, paid remote jobs attracted 1.8 times the share of applications than paid non-remote jobs; in March 2022, this figure was higher at 2.6 times. Even as the number of remote roles increased, they couldn’t keep pace with the number of applicants for these jobs. “The key takeaway here is that the supply of, and employees’ demand for, remote jobs have both grown rapidly over the past two years, but demand has grown faster,” says Mary Kate Fields, data communications manager at LinkedIn. ‘There’s going to have to be some give’ While remote-work options do still exist, of course, the specific industry of a particular job has a lot to do with how flexible employers are willing to be about where workers are getting jobs done. This is particularly the case where face time is increasingly essential as restrictions ease, like travel, retail and construction, according to LinkedIn’s data as well as Karin Kimbrough, LinkedIn’s chief economist. Oliver Price, UK solutions director for technology at recruiting consultancy Robert Half, agrees that sector influences how many workers can have location-flexible arrangements. Technology is a good example, he says; because the labour market is still so competitive for occupations like developers, workers can afford to press for the remote work they want. “If [an employer has] had a job requisition open and it’s been incredibly challenging to hire the right person, and the right person comes along but has a slightly different personal situation… you have to at least consider that,” he says. In other words, some workers may be in a position to leverage their talent to secure a more preferable remote-work arrangement. Still, as the Great Reshuffle continues, driven largely by workers looking for more flexible accommodations, the reality is some jobseekers may be disappointed by their options. And, says Kimbrough, it’s important to remember that only a third of employers are offering remote work at all – which means at two-thirds of companies, the option isn’t even on the table.  There is one caveat, however – somewhat “hidden” remote roles. Adrjan explains that there may be some companies who are willing to negotiate location flexibility and make personal accommodations, even if they may not explicitly be advertised in job listings. After all, adds Price, employers do need to recruit and retain talent, and understand they may have to give a little on their end to do so. Ultimately, however, Kimbrough says “there’s going to have to be some give by jobseekers”, especially as employers across the globe dig their heels in about a return-to-office as the global economy slows and the labour market rebalances. Price agrees “candidates are having to be a bit more flexible than they even likely want to be at this current period in time”.  “[Workers] have been in the driver’s seat for at least a year, if not longer, but that won't last forever,” says Kimbrough. As we get through this jobseeker-friendly period in the job market, she adds, workers may have to cede their position of power. “I think, ultimately, you’re going to see jobseekers having to compromise a little bit more.”"
Global Bond Market Trends,A new face for Africa's men,2024-09-14,2014-11-26,Milton Nkosi,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-30194489,"This video can not be played The male grooming and beauty industry is booming in South Africa and products are now targeting a new audience - black men. The male grooming and beauty industry is booming in South Africa, with products now targeting a new audience - black men, as the BBC's Milton Nkosi finds out. I have never had a facial before. For me, it sounds like something a woman might do. It had never even occurred to me that a man, a black African man, might one day go for a facial. Mere talk of pre-wash facial scrubs makes my hair stand on end.  Well, a lot has changed. Because this boy from Soweto has just dived head-first into male grooming.  I felt like a goat going for a traditional slaughter when I walked into Sorbet Men's Grooming salon in the upmarket Sandton district of Johannesburg - nervous, disoriented, even hopeful of a reprieve.  The hot towel treatment is supposed to open the skin's pores The salon's staff are dressed in trendy black uniforms. R&B music booms from speakers in the ceiling.  ""Hi Milton, welcome to your 1.30pm appointment,"" says the glamorous young receptionist.  I try to put on a confident smile and she ushers me to Lelanie deJager, my groomer.  A blonde, charming lady, she directs me to a swivelling leather chair in front of a spotless mirror.  Lelanie has 18 years' experience in men's grooming, having begun her training in Ireland.  As she prepares me for the initial scrub, she tells me that she loves male grooming and could never work with women.  I smile, still not sure about this. I ask her whether African men are taking to grooming.  ""Like a duck to water,"" she says. Research suggests that African men are becoming more discerning with their skin care According to Siphiwe Mpye, a trends consultant based in Braamfontein, a hipster enclave of Johannesburg, the culture of skin-care has been growing rapidly across Africa, with South Africa leading the way.  As a former editor of South Africa's GQ men's magazine, he knows what he is talking about.  Looking the part himself, he tells me that growth in the beauty and grooming industry is being driven by black African men buying products. But what is driving that, I ask. It is partly because of global trends, he says, but also because sustained economic growth in Africa has been giving men greater disposable income.  So what happened to the traditional Zulu man with a six-pack who prepared to go out by taking a cold shower?  Well, that Zulu man is today's customer for grooming products, says Mr Mpye.  ""The continent has changed, the continent continues to change as the world changes, and as the world changes, Africa is being touted as the future,"" he says. ""I suppose in a lot of ways we are embracing the future right now."" Gone are the days when it was only women who spent time in front of the mirror.  Today, women are looking for partners who are also well-polished and manicured. And the men have got that message.  Tsakani Mashaba says her research found that African males are more prone to razor bumps Businesswoman Tsakani Mashaba, founder of Michael Makiala for Men, says there was a gap in the market for products that catered to the specific needs of black male skin.  Research suggests that black men are more prone to razor bumps because their curly beards are more susceptible to ingrown hairs, she says.  She explains that her products soften the hair so that it continues to grow away from the face. The marketing graduate researched and worked with a biochemist to manufacture the country's first locally produced skin-care range for black men.  ""African men suffered a lot from razor bumps, oily skin and pigmentation. There wasn't a brand out there in the market that catered for that.  ""So I went on a journey to formulate a product for you guys and here we are,"" she tells me, beaming. Milton Nkosi says getting a makeover has not detracted from his masculinity When I grew up, it was much simpler. The local barber would splash on methylated spirit to control razor bumps after a man had had his head shaved clean.  Back in the present, Lelanie has wrapped me in a hot towel for a light steam treatment to open my pores.  After that, she applies a lotion to soften this old township face.  Then comes the razor - a brand new cut-throat blade, like the one used in that memorable scene from the James Bond film, Skyfall.  It is my first time with such a thing. Very gently, Lelanie starts shaving me. When she has finished, it is time for another hot towel and then moisturiser.  I feel almost as if my skin is breathing. I feel new. I feel like a million dollars!  But that township-man feeling has never left me. I still feel like an African man.
