Bond Market Forecast,D-Day 80th commemorations in NI and France,2024-09-14,2024-06-05,Chris Andrews,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv224djxepxo,"Events have been held across Northern Ireland and France to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day. The Royal Irish Regiment (R Irish) took part in a sunrise service on Thursday at Sword Beach in Normandy - the spot where soldiers landed 80 years ago to begin their fight against the occupying German forces. In Northern Ireland, beacons were lit in towns and cities on Thursday night. A veterans’ charity also lit one at the top of Slieve Donard to coincide with commemorations at the UK’s other highest peaks. Buildings have also been lit up blue.  Events were held across Northern Ireland throughout the day. A remembrance service took place at the cenotaph in Londonderry on Thursday morning, where DUP leader Gavin Robinson laid a wreath.  In Lisburn events also began early, with a D-Day proclamation read by a town crier from the Irish Linen Centre and Lisburn Museum.  This was followed by the unveiling of a flag of peace and a wreath laying by the Royal British Legion. A beacon was later lit in Castle Gardens. Beacons have also been lit in Newtownards, Bangor and Ballyhalbert. In Armagh, a service was held at St Patrick’s Church of Ireland Cathedral at 20:00 before the city’s beacon was lit in Market Square.  A town crier read a proclamation at Enniskillen Castle on Thursday morning, and a service was held at St Macartin’s Cathedral.  Enniskillen Castle was also turned blue to mark the occasion. A blue plaque was unveiled at Brookeborough in honour of World War Two Field Marshal Viscount Alan Brooke. In Ballynahinch, swing time and ballroom music events were held in Market Square on Thursday evening before the lighting of a beacon. Portrush East Strand held an event featuring members of the armed forces and a pipes and drum performance. Elsewhere, in County Mayo, events were held at Blacksod Lighthouse, where the crucial weather forecast to give D-Day the green light originated.  At first light on Sword Beach, there was silence on the sand as soldiers from the Royal Irish Regiment paused to reflect along with young Army Cadets. They were there to pay respect to the Royal Ulster Rifles; the only British regiment to land by air and sea on D-Day. Teenagers Hope Durnin and Evie Sloan said it was emotional to be involved. Massed pipes and drums were played on the spot where Piper Bill Millin came ashore on D-Day. Piper Millin was commander Lord Lovat's personal piper in the 1st Commando Brigade when he landed at the beach in Normandy on June 6, 1944. He was the only man who wore a kilt during the landings - the same Cameron tartan kilt his father had worn in Flanders during World War One. Maj Gen Colin Weir of the Royal Irish Regiment said the Royal Ulster Rifles (RUR) who served on D-Day were a “unique band of brothers”. It was made up of soldiers from across Ireland and Great Britain, volunteers for the “great crusade to secure freedom for Europe”. Maj Gen Weir said it was the duty of his regiment to carry on their legacy and pass on “some of that experience of service and sacrifice”. US Special Envoy for Northern Ireland Joe Kennedy met pupils at Enniskillen Model Primary School where wartime American vehicles were on display. The school’s playing fields were the site of a World War Two army camp where Allied Commander General Dwight D Eisenhower inspected troops making final preparations for D-Day. Ninety-six-year-old Phyllis McCartney was 16 when D-Day happened. She recalled memories from that time while at a D-Day tea dance in Lisburn. ""When you are younger you think of the people and are sorry,"" she said.  ""But now, listening to men talking about how their friend was killed beside them, it breaks my heart. “I know one family who lived up the street – he was called Marley – he was in it and he was killed."" Codenamed Operation Overlord, the Allies’ invasion of France on 6 June 1944 marked a breakthrough in the war. Shortly after midnight gliders landed as troops seized key locations on the flanks of the Normandy beaches. By morning, tens of thousands of troops, involving soldiers from across Ireland, landed on five assault zones. They were met by machine gun fire, mortar shells and snipers, but managed to push inland. The battles to come would lead to the liberation of France and a push towards Berlin.

Bond Market Forecast,The man hanged for printing his own ace of spades,2024-09-14,2024-05-19,By Bethan Bell,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-68977464,"As any card sharp, shark or sleight-of-hander knows, the ace of spades has a status that exceeds the rest of the pack. Also known as a Spadille, it has nicknames including the Death Card and the Tax Card, and of the 52, is the most ornate. For one London man in 1805 these three elements joined forces - the intricacies of baroque design meant he was caught trying to evade tax. And he was hanged. The taxing, in various forms, of gambling has always been a major source of income generation for the state. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that in 2024-25 betting and gaming duties will raise £3.6bn, the equivalent of £124 per household, or 0.1% of national income. Individual winners are not taxed on their profits - instead, the money is taken at the point of placing a bet. The government charges 15% on all gambling income for companies. But between 1588 and 1960 there was a tax on physical playing cards - and in 1765 a process was introduced to make sure all vendors and makers would stump up the duty. Makers had to supply the tax office with paper to match their other cards, and the tax office - also known as the stamp office - would print the ace of spades using engraved metal plates, a printing technology that was expensive and not widely available.  The maker would then buy the printed aces from the stamp office - thereby paying the tax. In order to make it more difficult to forge these aces, more and more elaborate designs were used. Richard Harding, a licensed card-maker with shops in Oxford Street and Grosvenor Square, carried on the manufacturing and selling of playing cards.  He did a roaring trade - but made very few demands of the stamp office. A Mr John Hockey from the stamp office was put on the case. He started by buying six packs of playing cards from Harding's business and finding all of the aces were forged. Obviously not one to leave things to chance, he continued to repeat his purchases until he had 90 packs of playing cards. All the aces of spades were forgeries. The habits of this man, with his apparently insatiable desire for packs of cards, must have roused the suspicions of Harding for when his businesses and home were raided - not one forgery was found.  In World Wars One and Two the ace of spades symbol was used as insignia by the 12th (Eastern) Division of the British Army and the 25th Infantry Division of the Indian Army respectively. And during the Vietnam War, the ace of spades - known as the death card - was used in psychological warfare - US soldiers left the card on the bodies of killed Vietnamese and scattered them in villages during raids. Some reportedly stuck one in their helmet band as a sort of anti-peace sign. GIs believed the card would frighten and demoralise Viet Cong soldiers. It did not - there was no superstition attached to it in Vietnam - but did help the morale of American soldiers and Marines. And in 2003, a deck of ""most-wanted"" Iraqi playing cards was issued to US soldiers, with each card displaying the picture of a wanted Iraqi official on it.  Saddam Hussein was placed on the ace of spades card and his son Qusay was allocated the ace of clubs. The dogged men from the stamp office were not about to give up and some of Harding's acquaintances were also paid a visit. A Mr Skelton leased part of a building in his rear yard to Harding, where Harding would, in the words of the prosecution, ""carry on his nefarious business"". Mr Skelton denied any knowledge of Harding's nefarious business. This, however, was cast into doubt when 2,000 aces of spades were found in his home.  More were found at his daughter's house, hidden in a basket of ""foul linen"". Investigators also discovered, buried about a foot beneath the earth at the bottom of his yard, printing plates. In the privy, they found more.  They were for the aces of spades. During the trial, John Hockey, the man who bought 90 packs of cards from Harding, told the Old Bailey he had paid the standard market rate - Harding wasn't therefore getting away with shoddy copies by selling them cheap. So how had he managed to print aces of spades convincing enough they didn't raise the alarm with ordinary buyers? It emerged he paid for an associate, a stone-seal engraver called Hugh Leadbetter, to take copper-engraving lessons. Mr Leadbetter told the court of an invitation to dine at Harding's home: ""It was on a Sunday, and some little time after dinner he called me on one side and said, 'I shall be glad to speak to you'; and after that I went up stairs with him, and he said, 'Leadbetter, can you, or do you, engrave on copper?' ""I said, no, I could not, it was quite out of my profession. ""After dinner he shut me into a room, and gave me some gravers, and told me to do the best I could with them. ""He locked the door; I tried to do it, but finding I could not do it, I left off. He came into the room about the dusk of the evening, he said, 'Leadbetter, what have you done?'  ""I told him I had done a little, I did not know whether it would do or no.""  As it turned out, Mr Leadbetter's skills were not good enough - so he in turn paid another man, Mr Bunning, to do it. Mr Leadbetter told Mr Bunning the work was for a legitimate stamp office engraver who was unfortunately too drunk to do his job with the necessary steady hand, and was therefore at risk of losing his business. ""Bunning said to me, 'Leadbetter, for God's sake, do you know what you are doing of?'  ""I told him I did not. He then said, he could engrave these aces, but if he did, he must give them into the hands of a magistrate. ""A few weeks later Mr Harding came to me, and said, 'for God's sake, help me to bury the plates' for, said he, 'they have been searching my house'. ""And I buried them"".  Harding left his defence to his counsel, and called seven witnesses who gave him a good character. Yet on 21 September 1805 he was found guilty and sentenced to death. Two months later, he was hanged. His remains were at St George Hanover Square Burial Ground in Bayswater until 12 March 1969, when he - and others - were removed to Lambeth and cremated.

Bond Market Forecast,D-Day weather maps up for auction,2024-09-14,2024-04-21,By Rachel Candlin & Sacha Bigwood,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-68845546,"A set of six weather maps used by forecasters ahead of the D-Day landings in World War Two are up for sale. The hand-sketched charts show predicted air pressures over the North Atlantic and Europe from 3 to 7 June 1944, the window of opportunity for the invasion. The forecasts were passed to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who then postponed the landings - on the coast of northern France - by 24 hours. The maps are due to sell in total for between £2,000 and £4,000 on Monday. The team of meteorologists included the late Captain David Davidge, from Bath, who was presented with the charts as a gift on his retirement. His family has now put them up for auction to coincide with the 80th anniversary of the Normandy landings. ""The charts are massively significant,"" said John Rolfe, director of John Rolfe Auctions, which is hosting the sale.  ""This is probably the most poignant lot I've sold in my 20-year career as an auctioneer.""  More than a year in the planning, Operation Overlord, as the campaign was codenamed, was originally due to start on 5 June. This had been judged to be the date most likely to combine calm seas, a full moon and low water at first light.  However, Group Captain James Stagg, chief meteorological officer, recommended the delay as storms had been forecast.  ""You can see the isobars on the fourth (of June); it did look incredibly volatile weather-wise and it wouldn't have been an ideal crossing for masses of troops across the Channel,"" Mr Rolfe said.  The charts are considered by specialists to be very rare, with the only other known set on display in the Map Room at Southwick House, the nerve centre of Allied planning for the D-Day landings, said the auctioneers.  ""It's quite remarkable these charts are hand-drawn. With the weather changing, the fact that they were hand-drawn meant they could be done quickly and shared quickly with our allies,"" said Mr Rolfe. It was the largest military naval, air and land operation ever attempted and marked the start of the campaign to liberate Nazi-occupied north-west Europe The invasion involved the simultaneous landing of tens of thousands of troops on five separate beaches in Normandy. From 06:30 BST on 6 June 1944, the first five assault divisions were delivered to their beaches under cover of a naval bombardment. ""Even though the 6th wasn't ideal, it was certainly much better, judging from these charts,"" said Mr Rolfe.  ""If these maps hadn't been drawn and we had crossed earlier than the 6th, then of course the outcome of the war could be could have been potentially very different for all of us.""  The auction house said it had received significant interest in the maps ahead of the sale in Tetbury, particularly from large organisations, but also from ""fond collectors of militaria"". Mr Rolfe added it was difficult to come up with the £2,000-£4,000 estimate for the charts, as they were so unique.  ""It really is truly impossible, as there's nothing to go on, but we had to come up with a figure but we could be way off,"" he said. ""We'll only know once we sell them because this is the first time anything like this has ever gone through a sale."" Follow BBC Somerset on Facebook and, X.

Bond Market Forecast,Clouds gathering over global economy,2024-09-14,2019-01-03,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46734933,"What does 2019 have in store for the global economy? There are certainly clouds on the horizon, but 2018 as a whole was a reasonably strong year. Global growth will probably be about 3.7% when all the numbers are in, according to the International Monetary Fund. The world's two biggest economies are likely to record respectable rates of expansion.  The biggest of all, the US, had two very strong quarters in the middle of the year. Data for the final three months will come at the end of January, and while they might well show some slowing down, the whole year is likely to register pretty strong expansion of close to 3%. As for China, the slowdown after three decades of stunning growth continues. But it's still likely to be about 6.6% in 2018, which is more than enough to generate significant improvements in average living standards.   Most mainstream forecasts suggest that the recovery after the great recession will continue for another year and more. So what about the clouds? Growth in the US is likely to be slower. The surge in 2018 reflected President Trump's tax cuts. There is some debate about whether the impact will last. Is it a one-off effect that will fade like a sugar rush, or will it have a lasting impact on incentives to work and invest?  There is also the impact of the central bank, the Federal Reserve, to consider. Will it continue raising interest rates to keep inflation close to its 2% target following the four such moves it made in 2018?  President Trump certainly thinks the Fed could do a lot of harm. It is, he has said, ""the only problem our economy has"".  He has repeatedly made similar points, to the extent that his Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, felt the need to say publicly that the president had no desire to sack the Fed chairman Jerome Powell. (It's not clear whether he has the authority to do that, but he certainly could decline to give him another term as chairman when the current one expires in 2022, if he is still president then).   In any event, the prospect of the president exerting what many would consider undue influence over the Fed has the potential to unsettle financial markets. The Fed has been given responsibility for monetary policy, which includes interest rate policy, by Congress. The mainstream view among economists is that keeping that away from the centre of the political arena is better for the long-term control of inflation.  There is another strand to President Trump's economic policy that could undermine economic growth: international trade. The US is already well into a major trade confrontation with China over what President Trump calls the theft by China of the technology of American companies doing business there.  Three months into the year, the tariffs that his administration has already imposed on a wide array of Chinese goods are due to increase from 10% to 25%. China can be expected to retaliate as it did to the first round of tariffs. It is true that Presidents Trump and Xi have held some talks and it is possible that the escalation will be averted. But it is certainly not assured.  And then there are the US tariffs on steel and aluminium, ostensibly imposed to protect national security, which have affected a large number of US trade partners. The prospect of continued trade tensions is a significant cloud over the economic outlook. Europe also has its own problems. The economic data for the third quarter of the year showed a marked slowdown in growth in the eurozone.  Some of this may be a very short-term stumble due to new procedures for testing vehicle emissions, which have disrupted the motor industry. But it could be the start of a more significant loss of momentum in a recovery that was never particularly strong.  A survey of manufacturing industry in the region showed the slowdown continued in December with a contraction in two individual economies, Italy and France.   Europe also has its own trade issue to worry about: Brexit. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March. There is a wide range of possible outcomes, some of which could disrupt trade between the UK and the continent.  More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Stock markets had a rough ride at the end of 2018. Many recorded strong gains early in the year that were more than reversed. Overall it was the worst year for global markets (and many individual ones) since the financial crisis.  Lower share prices can be a warning sign of wider economic problems ahead, sometimes even a recession. But share price falls are not a reliable sign of a coming recession. As the late Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson once joked: ""Wall Street indexes predicted nine of the last five recessions."" The market can give false alarms.  The bond market, where debts including government bonds, are traded, has also been close to flashing a warning about the US outlook.  A phenomenon known as the inverted yield curve has been a more reliable predictor of a downturn, though not very precise as to when.  That said, there are economists who think the US may be heading for a recession, not this year but in 2020. Nouriel Roubini, who foresaw the financial crisis, is one. He also warns that the recession he predicts will be harder for the government and Federal Reserve to deal with.   China also has things to worry about - in the shape of a rising burden of public and private-sector debt, which could yet undermine financial stability. Surveys of business showed that new orders for manufacturers declined in December, for the first time in two years.     All things told, there are some pretty clear reasons for regarding the outlook now as a good deal harder to read and more overcast than it has been for several years. "
Bond Market Forecast,Q&A: how does the Spring Statement affect Scots?,2024-09-14,2022-03-24,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-60860653,"Not all the measures in the chancellor's Spring Statement affect Scots directly, mainly because Holyrood has control of most income tax rates thresholds and rates. But there are significant challenges facing the Scottish government. National Insurance is controlled at Westminster, while income tax rates and thresholds are for Scottish ministers to decide. So the increase in the rate of both employers' and employees' National Insurance Contributions (NICs) affects every part of the UK. On payroll earnings, the NIC rate is going up next month from 12% to 13.25%. Employers face a similar rise in their contribution. The Spring Statement eased the impact of that increase by raising the threshold at which people start to pay NICs - from £9,570 to £12,570.  That means a flat-rate giveaway to everyone paying NICs of £352. It doesn't affect employer contributions. That change brings NICs into line with the starting point of income tax, for all UK income tax payers. The starting threshold is one income tax power retained at Westminster for all of the UK. Rishi Sunak stated his intention to cut the basic rate of income tax at Westminster in 2024, just ahead of an expected election. If he delivers on that, the basic rate would come down from 20p in the pound to 19p. That would not affect tax paid on Scottish income - not directly, anyway, and it would affect tax paid on Scottish savings interest. That block grant provides most of the funds that Holyrood ministers spend, to which revenue is added in Scotland from income tax, business rates and Land and Buildings Transactions Tax. Changes to it are determined by changes to funding for the big ""spending departments"" in Whitehall such as health, education, justice and transport. These gained in funding in Rishi Sunak's Budget for next year, set out last year, but they do not take account of inflation. So spending departments will have to absorb the extra costs they face in the coming year, notably public sector pay. And that constraint is passed on through the block grant to Holyrood.  Public sector pay is already rising more slowly than private sector pay, and that is expected to continue. In real terms (after inflation), it is expected to fall significantly, raising the potential for pay disputes between employers and unions. That is one of the challenges the Scottish government and local authorities will face, unless further funding is released later this year to take account of public sector pay deals. Scottish ministers have powers over welfare benefits which could allow them to mitigate, if only partly, the impact of inflation on those with the tightest budgets.  Holyrood is already spending some of its funds to offset the impact of UK welfare decisions that are seen by MSPs as unfair. The funds to continue doing so are not unlimited. The chancellor's decision to announce a cut in the basic rate of income tax is a strange one, long before he knows how public finances will look, and appears to reverse the impact of a rise in NICs this year, which he says is necessary to pay for health and social care. While that will not apply in Scotland, it should mean that more funds are added to the Holyrood block grant - probably around £500m to £600m.   Scottish ministers could then decide to use that to cut income tax, or to use it for extra spending. The decision is likely to be highly political, as is Rishi Sunak's tax cut.  When most of income tax was devolved to Holyrood, from 2018, the SNP administration chose to make a cut to the lowest rate, worth £20 per year and allowing it to say Scotland has the lowest rate of tax in Britain, but there were bigger increases to tax on higher earners. With two extra bands of tax introduced, making it a five-band system, the main rates applied are one penny in the pound higher. And while Westminster raised the threshold at which higher rate tax payers start to pay 40p on each extra pound earned, to more than £50,000, that threshold was kept lower in Scotland. It is being frozen in 2022-23 at £43,662. That should bring in more funds, but there is evidence from the Scottish Fiscal Commission that the tax base is weaker than previously thought, and that the block grant from Westminster would actually be higher if the powers had not been devolved. So three questions for Scottish ministers:  As Rishi Sunak's intended tax cut is still two years away, there is no rush to answer these. Over time, earnings usually rise and people move up the career ladder. As they do so, they move into higher tax brackets, paying higher income tax rates.  Rishi Sunak last year said he would freeze the thresholds for higher rate tax, as well as the starter threshold of £12,570, which applies across the UK. That can a be a stealthy way of raising tax revenue. But with high inflation and more people moving into the higher brackets, it is much less stealthy and much more of a tax grab. By the next Westminster election, the impact of that is expected to be worth £17bn a year. That is one of the main reasons why the public finances in the spring statement are looking relatively strong. The Scottish government has frozen those thresholds for longer. It hasn't said it will keep them frozen, as Mr Sunak has said, but the Holyrood administration is doing so on higher rate tax into 2022-23. This is one of the mysteries of Rishi Sunak's spring statement. He said higher NICs were required to pay for health and social care, at least in England, with a share of revenue being added to the Holyrood block grant.  Yet having said the revenue is essential, he then took two contradictory decisions: So it's a muddled picture: raising NICs rates, and the threshold, while lowering income tax and freezing thresholds. One effect of this is to raise tax on working people, while a cut in income tax helps those whose income comes from wealth, such as dividends and rents. The chancellor chose not to raise the percentage increase in benefits or pensions, to take account of higher inflation than last September, which is the month on which uprating is set. So benefits rise 3.1%, while prices are forecast to rise on average 7.4%. When challenged on this, the chancellor points to a number of initiatives to help people getting into work and on low wages, including a 6.6% rise in living wage later this year and a more generous tapering away of Universal Credit as people pick up hours of work. He offered a rise in a safety net fund, from £500m to £1bn, handed to local authorities to distribute to those in most need. Of that rise, £45m is being added to the Scottish block grant, for Scottish ministers to spend as they choose. The Scottish government is aiming much of its new welfare budget at families, with a new payment for young children rising from £10 to £25 per week later this year."
Bond Market Forecast,Pound rises as chancellor moves to calm markets,2024-09-14,2022-10-17,By Noor Nanji,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63278821,"The pound rose and government borrowing costs fell on Monday, as investors welcomed the announcement by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt of the reversal of most of the mini-budget tax measures. Sterling extended gains against the dollar, and is trading at around $1.14. The news also saw the interest rate - or yield - on UK government bonds fall, making government borrowing less expensive. However, analysts said tough decisions remained ahead on government spending. An update to the government's mini-budget had been scheduled for 31 October, but Mr Hunt brought forward many billions of pounds worth of tax and spending measures in a bid to reassure the markets. The changes will see a planned cut in income tax scrapped, while a cap on energy bills that had been due to last two years is now only guaranteed until April next year, when it will be reviewed. In a statement, the Treasury said the chancellor had ""taken these decisions to ensure the UK's economic stability and to provide confidence in the government's commitment to fiscal discipline"". Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: ""Jeremy Hunt's focus on reassuring the markets and reinstating confidence appears to have worked so far with gilt yields trading lower and sterling pushing higher.""  However, she added that question marks will remain until the chancellor outlines on 31 October how he plans to cut government spending ""in order to plug the multi-billion pound budget shortfall, raising concerns about the prospect of a new era of austerity"". An utterly extraordinary unBudget - perhaps the biggest U-turn in British economic history. £45bn of unfunded tax cuts has in three weeks and three days seen a £32bn reversal. We may need new terminology. U-turn suggests a controlled manoeuvre. This is like a plane trying to do the jet engine equivalent of a handbrake turn. But it will have real impacts, especially the decision to target the energy help after April. There are reasonable questions now about higher taxes and less help as we enter a recession. Much of this has been inevitable since the Monday after the mini-budget. It should help regain economic credibility. But it is such a political volte face that one wonders if the whole cabinet, government and Conservative party will support it. The new chancellor's message will be this: there is no alternative. On Friday, Prime Minister Liz Truss sacked Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor and said the mini-budget ""went further and faster than markets were expecting"". The mini-budget was blamed for causing turmoil in the financial markets, with the pound slumping to a record low of $1.03 and the cost of government borrowing rising sharply in its aftermath. However, Friday's announcement of the £18bn U-turn on corporation tax and the firing of Mr Kwarteng did not appear to reassure investors, with UK government borrowing costs climbing on Friday afternoon. There had been fears of more turmoil on Monday, with the UK government bond market trading for the first time since the end of the Bank of England's emergency support programme. However, the news of the latest U-turn led to the cost of government borrowing falling across a range of bonds traded on the financial markets. The yield on bonds due to be repaid in 30 years' time dropped on Monday morning as markets anticipated Mr Hunt would reverse tax cuts, and fell further after he did so in his statement, to 4.35%. It had hit 5.17% on 28 September in the aftermath of the mini-budget. However, the yield is still higher than it was before the mini-budget, when it stood at 3.7%. ""Markets seem prepared to give Jeremy Hunt the chance to turn back the clock,"" said Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell. ""The new chancellor has bought the government some breathing space. ""But markets are fickle and two weeks is a long time in economics, as in politics. It's a pretty easy and obvious step to reverse most of those unfunded tax cuts announced in the mini-budget but it's less straightforward to move the debate along. And that's where the real risk lies. Austerity might not be palatable, but it seems to be on the table.""  The shift in the government's economic policies and market turmoil in recent weeks had led to Goldman Sachs downgrading its forecasts for UK economic growth. On Sunday, the investment bank revised its 2023 UK economic output forecast from a 0.4% drop to a 1% drop. Goldman said it expected a ""more significant recession in the UK"", in part due to ""significantly tighter financial conditions"" and the planned higher corporation tax rate from next April."
Bond Market Forecast,Liz Truss's claims on the economy fact-checked,2024-09-14,2022-10-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/63108082,"Prime Minister Liz Truss has defended her government's mini-budget, despite the days of market turmoil that followed it which saw a rise in the cost of government borrowing that has had an impact on mortgages and other parts of the economy. She told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg programme that she stood by it but said the government should have ""laid the ground better"" before announcing the measures, which included tax cuts paid for by billions of pounds of borrowing. Here are some of the claims Ms Truss made in the interview. The prime minister said this after being asked whether she felt any responsibility for people's worries about their mortgages, rents and loans.  She's right that interest rates are rising around the world as central banks, like the Bank of England, raise them to fight the inflation that has been made worse by the war in Ukraine. But the cost of UK government borrowing surged to over 4% after the government's mini-budget on 23 September.  As BBC Economics Editor Faisal Islam has pointed out on Twitter, this lifted the cost of borrowing in the UK above that in Greece.  This rise was not set by the Bank of England - but by the bond markets reacting to the measures in the mini-budget - and it is feeding through into rising mortgage rates with hundreds of products withdrawn from the mortgage market. It also had an impact on UK pension funds - which trade in government debt (30-year bonds) - with the Bank of England having to step in to safeguard the sector with a £65bn support scheme.  Speaking on 29 September, the Bank of England's Chief Economist Huw Pill said that over the course of the past week: ""There has been a significant re-pricing of financial assets. Part of that... reflects broader global developments... But there is undoubtedly a UK-specific component."" The UK's growth has been low in the past decade, and the decline started before the Covid pandemic. The UK economy grew at an average rate of 2.3% between 1982 and 1992 and 2.6% between 1993 and 2002. In the past two decades, the economy has grown by an average of 1.4% each year. But it has been affected by two major global crises - the financial crash of 2008 and the Covid pandemic that started in 2020. Even if you exclude these, growth in the last ten years has not matched previous decades.  The UK saw an average growth rate of 2.5% between 2002 and 2007 (before the financial crash of 2008-09). In the years after the crash and before Covid - 2010 to 2019 - it grew at a rate of 2%. Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng have said their goal is to secure steady growth for the UK of 2.5% a year. The prime minister was asked why the mini-budget had not been accompanied by a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the independent number crunchers who usually mark the government's economic homework.  Market commentators have suggested that its absence contributed to the turmoil over the following days.  Ms Truss claims the government didn't have time to wait for the OBR to produce its forecast.  However, the OBR says it could have done it in time.  In a letter on 29 September, Richard Hughes, chair of the OBR, said a draft forecast was sent to the new Chancellor - Kwasi Kwarteng - on 6 September, his first day in the office.  The OBR then offered to provide an updated forecast to be published along with the 23 September mini-budget, but was not commissioned by the government to do so, ""although we would have been in a position to do so to a standard that satisfied the legal requirements of the Charter for Budget Responsibility enacted by Parliament"", Mr Hughes wrote.  If you look at the government's total debt as a percentage of the size of the economy, this claim is correct.  As of December 2021, the UK had a lower proportion of debt than Canada, France, the US, Italy and Japan, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Adding the extra borrowing needed this year to fund the measures announced in the mini budget would not lift the UK above the next highest nation.

Bond Market Forecast,Aston Martin profits hit by 'disappointing' year,2024-09-14,2020-01-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51017849,"Aston Martin, the luxury British carmaker famed for kitting out James Bond, has issued a profit warning after a ""very disappointing"" 2019. Shares in the 106-year-old firm plunged by as much as 16% after it said annual earnings were expected to fall by nearly half from a year earlier. But the fortunes of BMW-owned rival Rolls-Royce were very different. Rolls-Royce, the car of choice for those who like to be chauffeured, sold a record 5,100 vehicles last year. In a trading update, Aston Martin said the ""challenging trading conditions highlighted in November continued through the peak delivery period of December resulting in lower sales, higher selling costs and lower margins"". It said core retail sales - which covers sales from Aston Martin dealers to consumers - were up 12% from a year earlier. However, wholesale volumes - which covers how many cars the dealers are ordering from Aston Martin itself - were down 7% to 5,809. ""From a trading perspective, 2019 has been a very disappointing year,"" said Aston Martin chief executive Andy Palmer. The company said it was expecting earnings of between £130m and £140m, well below the £247.3m it reported last year. When Aston Martin listed its shares on the London Stock Exchange in October 2018, its shares were priced at £19 each. However, the latest bad news has now dragged the share price down to about £4.50. ""It is remarkable that a company with such a strong brand can consistently issue bad news,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""Aston Martin has been one of the biggest flops on the stock market in living memory and today's trading update does nothing to improve its tarnished reputation. ""The big question is why wealthy people aren't buying its luxury cars. Working for this company should be a marketeer's dream, but the team responsible for attracting customers clearly haven't got the formula right."" Rolls-Royce boss Torsten Müller-Ötvös told the BBC that a big driver of its higher sales was the launch of the Cullinan SUV, which he said now had ""very stable, robust"" orders. But he said sales were not expected to grow at the same rate in 2020. Part of the difference between the successes of the two brands could come down to how they define themselves. ""We are not really in the car business, we are in the luxury goods business,"" Mr Müller-Ötvös said. ""We are famous for bespoke, so you can basically customise a Rolls-Royce to build your own masterpiece, and I think that has attracted quite a lot of clients worldwide."""
Bond Market Forecast,How flying Hamilton reeled in Rosberg,2024-09-14,2016-07-24,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/36880239,"Rosberg's win in Russia took him to equal second in the all-time list of consecutive victories with seven, a measure of his dominance over Hamilton at the time When Nico Rosberg won the Russian Grand Prix in early May it saw him open up a 43-point lead over Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton.  It marked a fourth straight win for the German and seventh in a row overall dating back to last season, as Hamilton's dip in form after wrapping up his third world title continued.  Rosberg's advantage, in the words of Hamilton just this past week, felt like an ""impossible mountain to climb"". Yet climb it he did, and in just seven races, completing the job with victory in Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix. Here we look at how Hamilton reeled in and overhauled his team-mate at the head of the drivers' standings.  How Hamilton won the Hungarian Grand Prix Hamilton delight at Hungary win record Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda called crash in Spain ""stupid"" Pole man Hamilton made a decent start to the race but Rosberg enjoyed marginally the better getaway and passed the Briton around the outside into Turn One. Hamilton was then much faster through the fast Turn Three as a result of Rosberg being in the wrong engine mode and tried to sneak through on the exit of the corner. Rosberg came across the track to defend his position, forced Hamilton onto the grass where he span into his team-mate and eliminated both on the spot. Standings: Rosberg 100, Hamilton 57 - gap 43 points. Hamilton, the driver of car number 44, claimed his 44th career win - and second in Monaco. After dramatically cancelling each other out in Barcelona, Monaco was the scene for Hamilton's fightback to begin in earnest. Hamilton's first win of the year was helped in part by a slow pit stop for Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo after a close battle with the Australian, but was nevertheless richly deserved as he embarked on a superb defensive drive over the final 45 laps to keep his rival at bay. For Rosberg it was an afternoon to forget. He struggled throughout the wet-dry race and could only come home in seventh, ceding 19 points to his title rival in the process. Standings: Rosberg 106, Hamilton 82 - gap 24 points. Hamilton dedicated the win - his fifth in Canada - to the late Muhammad Ali After waiting six races of 2016 to break his duck, Hamilton won again next time out, edging a strategic battle with Sebastian Vettel's Ferrari. For the second race in a row Rosberg struggled, coming off worse in a battle with Hamilton into the first corner to slip to ninth. A late slow puncture also affected his race as he came home a deflated fifth. Standings: Rosberg 116, Hamilton 107 - gap nine points. Rosberg secured Mercedes' first European GP win with victory in Baku One week later and the tables turned again, Rosberg rediscovering his early-season form with a lights-to-flag win at the inaugural race on the streets of Baku in Azerbaijan.  Hamilton started 10th after an ""off day"" in qualifying and struggled to fifth place in the race, hampered by a problem with an engine setting during the race. Standings: Rosberg 141, Hamilton 117 - gap 24 points. Hamilton was booed on the podium in Austria after the Mercedes drivers collided on the last lap Another race enlivened by a collision between the two title rivals. The squabbling pair were running one-two on the final lap when Hamilton went to pass his team-mate around the outside.  Rosberg turned into the corner late and ran into Hamilton, damaging his own front wing and dropping him to fourth place as the Briton came through unscathed for the win. Standings: Rosberg 153, Hamilton 142 - gap 11 points. Hamilton went crowd-surfing at Silverstone after winning the British Grand Prix Hamilton claimed a fourth Silverstone win after a commanding performance in a wet-dry race.   Rosberg had no answer to his team-mate's pace and fell back into an entertaining scrap with the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. The Mercedes man emerged victorious from that battle to take second place, but was demoted to third after the race stewards ruled he had benefited from an illegal radio transmission by his team. Standings: Rosberg: 168, Hamilton 167 - gap one point. The smile was more natural for Hamilton than Rosberg after the Hungarian Grand Prix Yet again Hamilton had the legs on his team-mate, the Briton controlling the pace from the front after passing pole-sitter Rosberg into the first corner.  Rosberg was allowed to close up behind the leader on more than one occasion, but Hamilton always appeared to have a little more in reserve as he paced his way to the chequered flag. The result vaulted Hamilton into the title lead for the first time in 2016, but with 10 races remaining don't be surprised to see the order chop and change between now and the final race in Abu Dhabi in November.

Bond Market Forecast,Clouds gathering over global economy,2024-09-14,2019-01-03,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46734933,"What does 2019 have in store for the global economy? There are certainly clouds on the horizon, but 2018 as a whole was a reasonably strong year. Global growth will probably be about 3.7% when all the numbers are in, according to the International Monetary Fund. The world's two biggest economies are likely to record respectable rates of expansion.  The biggest of all, the US, had two very strong quarters in the middle of the year. Data for the final three months will come at the end of January, and while they might well show some slowing down, the whole year is likely to register pretty strong expansion of close to 3%. As for China, the slowdown after three decades of stunning growth continues. But it's still likely to be about 6.6% in 2018, which is more than enough to generate significant improvements in average living standards.   Most mainstream forecasts suggest that the recovery after the great recession will continue for another year and more. So what about the clouds? Growth in the US is likely to be slower. The surge in 2018 reflected President Trump's tax cuts. There is some debate about whether the impact will last. Is it a one-off effect that will fade like a sugar rush, or will it have a lasting impact on incentives to work and invest?  There is also the impact of the central bank, the Federal Reserve, to consider. Will it continue raising interest rates to keep inflation close to its 2% target following the four such moves it made in 2018?  President Trump certainly thinks the Fed could do a lot of harm. It is, he has said, ""the only problem our economy has"".  He has repeatedly made similar points, to the extent that his Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, felt the need to say publicly that the president had no desire to sack the Fed chairman Jerome Powell. (It's not clear whether he has the authority to do that, but he certainly could decline to give him another term as chairman when the current one expires in 2022, if he is still president then).   In any event, the prospect of the president exerting what many would consider undue influence over the Fed has the potential to unsettle financial markets. The Fed has been given responsibility for monetary policy, which includes interest rate policy, by Congress. The mainstream view among economists is that keeping that away from the centre of the political arena is better for the long-term control of inflation.  There is another strand to President Trump's economic policy that could undermine economic growth: international trade. The US is already well into a major trade confrontation with China over what President Trump calls the theft by China of the technology of American companies doing business there.  Three months into the year, the tariffs that his administration has already imposed on a wide array of Chinese goods are due to increase from 10% to 25%. China can be expected to retaliate as it did to the first round of tariffs. It is true that Presidents Trump and Xi have held some talks and it is possible that the escalation will be averted. But it is certainly not assured.  And then there are the US tariffs on steel and aluminium, ostensibly imposed to protect national security, which have affected a large number of US trade partners. The prospect of continued trade tensions is a significant cloud over the economic outlook. Europe also has its own problems. The economic data for the third quarter of the year showed a marked slowdown in growth in the eurozone.  Some of this may be a very short-term stumble due to new procedures for testing vehicle emissions, which have disrupted the motor industry. But it could be the start of a more significant loss of momentum in a recovery that was never particularly strong.  A survey of manufacturing industry in the region showed the slowdown continued in December with a contraction in two individual economies, Italy and France.   Europe also has its own trade issue to worry about: Brexit. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March. There is a wide range of possible outcomes, some of which could disrupt trade between the UK and the continent.  More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Stock markets had a rough ride at the end of 2018. Many recorded strong gains early in the year that were more than reversed. Overall it was the worst year for global markets (and many individual ones) since the financial crisis.  Lower share prices can be a warning sign of wider economic problems ahead, sometimes even a recession. But share price falls are not a reliable sign of a coming recession. As the late Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson once joked: ""Wall Street indexes predicted nine of the last five recessions."" The market can give false alarms.  The bond market, where debts including government bonds, are traded, has also been close to flashing a warning about the US outlook.  A phenomenon known as the inverted yield curve has been a more reliable predictor of a downturn, though not very precise as to when.  That said, there are economists who think the US may be heading for a recession, not this year but in 2020. Nouriel Roubini, who foresaw the financial crisis, is one. He also warns that the recession he predicts will be harder for the government and Federal Reserve to deal with.   China also has things to worry about - in the shape of a rising burden of public and private-sector debt, which could yet undermine financial stability. Surveys of business showed that new orders for manufacturers declined in December, for the first time in two years.     All things told, there are some pretty clear reasons for regarding the outlook now as a good deal harder to read and more overcast than it has been for several years. "
Bond Market Forecast,Taxing times for Scottish ministers,2024-09-14,2023-10-17,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-67131032,"Britain's public finances are getting tighter, putting constraints on the rhetoric from party political conferences.  Yet there's not so much talk about the pressures for increased taxes next spring. A year out from the likely date of the next Westminster election, the Lib Dems pulled back from their conventional promise to out-tax others with a penny for health or education.  Tories in Manchester were, we were told, under pressure from the party right to offer tax cuts. It seemed hard to believe a fortnight ago, and moreso now, that the person with the audacity to lead the tax-cutting right was Liz Truss.  The Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, was resisting such conference crowd-pleasing promises, at least until next year. His signal has been of a much tighter public spending outlook since government borrowing costs rose steeply. Markets are pricing in an expectation of a more prolonged battle to bring down inflation, meaning sustained higher interest rates. A lot depends on the strength or weakness of China's recovery. But the military, diplomatic and humanitarian tinder box on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean is not helping to reassure. The Institute of Fiscal Studies has set out budget options today, saying the UK government is in a ""horrible fiscal bind"", as borrowing costs eat up a much bigger share of tax revenue.  It is arguing neither spending increases nor tax cuts look sustainable.  In Liverpool, the Labour mantra was about changes that don't cost much, such as bulldozing planning constraints in England. The fiscal message from the Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves, is that change can be funded by getting more tax out of rich foreigners and VAT on private school fees - in other words, someone else, probably not like you. And so the tax and spend roadshow reaches the northern parts of Aberdeen, feeling the cold blasts of both Arctic air and further constraints ahead. The previews of Humza Yousaf's first leadership speech to his autumn conference, on Tuesday, suggest he wants to put the economy ""front and centre"" of the case for independence, but also show that he's returning to one of Holyrood's favourite habits, of distributing more cash to the NHS. The first part of that will be worth watching: the economic case for independence has been where its opponents have sought to focus their attacks, because that's where they sense weakness. ""Improved living standards"" are on offer. That much has long been asserted, but not so much about the connection between independence and faster economic growth, or explaining which levers get pulled to make it happen.  Higher or lower taxes? More or less regulation? A bigger or smaller state? The thrust of the argument of late has rarely gone much further than 'other countries can, so why not us?' Whatever the rhetoric in Aberdeen, it is nearer term decisions on taxation and spending which are likely to dominate Bute House cabinet thinking for this winter. They are looking at the long legacy of Covid, at inflation squeezing public services, and signals from the Chancellor and Treasury suggest their block grant will be even tighter than previously thought. The recent mid-year changes to this year's budget have provided a glimpse of what may be to come when finance secretary Shona Robison has recovered from Covid and returned to the file marked 'budget planning' with only two months until publishing it in draft.  Re-instating a cut to the arts and culture budget, after it had previously been removed, was a politically painful way to send that message.  It's long been puzzling why the SNP has not chosen to get more Scottish identity bang out of relatively small amounts of cultural buck.  The Scottish Parliament's research service noted earlier in summer: ""There has been a long-term trend of reducing real terms spend on culture in some areas of Scottish government funding and local government... spending on culture has not been a budget priority"".  The queue for more funds is long and loud. The continuing pay battle with school staff is one of several brush fires in public sector pay which can be extinguished with settlements, but within a tightly constrained spending envelope, these come at growing cost to others. Councils are often on the front line of these battles and cuts, but they will seek to share that challenge with Scottish ministers. North Lanarkshire's decision last month to shut 39 community facilities including leisure centres and libraries was reversed early this month, but that surely won't be the end of the story in that council area or elsewhere. On the conference agenda for Aberdeen are reminders of the profound problems affecting island transport, and pressure from north-east branches to make good on the promises to improve its road network. In his speech, Humza Yousaf is pledging big funds to reduce NHS waiting lists. There are ever more strident warnings about policing levels. Colleges are looking at redundancies, with limited hope they can avoid sackings or sharply reduced course options. That is one of the sectors on which Audit Scotland, the official spending watchdog, has issued numerous warnings about unsustainable finances. Its boss, the Auditor General, is now issuing warnings about warnings, seemingly in the hope that they will, eventually, be heeded.  A recent blog set out Stephen Boyle's plans to look in further detail at the cost of reaching the Scottish government's net zero commitments, observing that the easy stuff has already been done. ""The task will directly affect most Scots in a way that just hasn't been experienced yet,"" he wrote.  Having warned in April that targets are unlikely to be hit, he followed up with other UK spending watchdogs telling governments this will require them to work more closely together, citing the cost of disagreement over bottle deposit and return. Next comes an assessment of the enormous task of reducing the carbon footprint of heating homes. The Scottish government's own estimate for residential and non-residential buildings is £33bn. There's a clue of what to expect in the headline on the Auditor General's blog: 'Tough decisions ahead on climate change'. Among the easier answers is a rise in tax, using the Scottish Parliament's powers, which are limited, and mainly to income tax. It looks easy enough - if the bills are going up, whack up the revenue. And as the first minister has made clear, those who can contribute most should pay more. So the discussion this autumn is about a new tax band, taking more from relatively high earners. One independent group of advisers to the Scottish government, the Poverty and Inequality Commission, is looking to a widening of Holyrood's tax net, to include income from wealth, and a closer look at the possibilities for a direct tax on wealth itself. One of its commissioners, Alex Cobham, says: ""Tax is our social superpower. It allows us to do a variety of things to live in a better society, a more equal and inclusive society, and lead better lives. ""Although progress has been made towards reducing poverty and inequality in Scotland, with the likes of increasing the Scottish Child Payment to £25 per week, we need to see more action from the Scottish government on tax if it is to deliver on its ambitions to meet the 2030 child poverty targets and help all those who are trapped in poverty."" While a panel of external advisers mull Shona Robison's options in private, the Fraser of Allander Institute has run the numbers on two proposals put forward for a new tax band, and poured a lot of caution over the claims being made for them.  One is from the Scottish Trades Union Congress, with the idea of taxing 44 pence in each pound earned between £75,000 and £125,000 - the latter being the rate at which the highest rate is levied. It's claimed this could raise £88m next financial year. But that's a 'static' estimate, assuming taxpayer behaviour does not change in reaction to the higher tax rate. Some people, however, would not be static. They would choose to reduce their working hours, and some would have more incentive to take earnings in forms that are taxed at lower rates by the UK Treasury - for instance, in dividends on business profits. To a lesser extent, the Allander economists at Strathclyde University say the Scottish government should expect some people to withdraw activity from the economy altogether - for instance, if a second home owner removes her holiday home from the rental market. In the first year, that £88m tax take is forecast to decline to £56m. After five years of more people being caught by the £75,000 tax threshold and also more people responding to it, the static tax revenue estimate of £119m becomes £77m. Another proposal comes from the Institute of Public Policy Research in Scotland, a left-leaning think tank arguing for more progressive taxation. It would like to see higher tax at 45p in the pound on earnings above £58,000.  Assuming no behavioural effects, that could bring in a handy £231m next year. But with those effects, Fraser of Allander estimates revenue of £161m. In the fifth year, with thresholds retained, a static tax estimate of £313m becomes £220m when people have responded. Note that very little of this effect seems to be forecast from people choosing to leave Scotland, which tends to be the way behavioural effects are debated. And much of the modelling of this is close to the estimates made by the Scottish Fiscal Commission, which will be telling Ms Robison about the revenue she can expect if she opts for additional tax take from higher earners.  It has already pointed out that the extra revenue from higher income tax rates is offset by a relatively weak tax base, meaning ministers do not have the extra clout they seek. There's a case, therefore, for strengthening the tax base - for instance drawing high earners into Scotland or doing less to alienate them. There's an electoral calculation in this. How many people would be affected from such tax increases, and how much does it matter? The STUC proposal is seen as affecting 161,000 payers, or 6% of those people paying income tax in Scotland. The IPPR option would draw in 234,000, or 10% of the total. Shona Robison could gamble on those people being willing to pay more in exchange for better public services and a fairer outcome with a stronger social contract. Or the deputy first minister could gamble on those people being politically dispensable.  They're less dispensable where these people are the doctors that NHS Scotland needs to retain and recruit. But many of those people are at senior levels of Scottish business. And that's where the budget choices encounter another part of the fiscal and political jigsaw. Humza Yousaf has set out to have a New Deal with Business. Expect to hear more about it this week. It saw some policies jettisoned soon after he took office, but the love-bombing was less evident when tourism groups were campaigning, unsuccessfully, to pause and rethink the licensing of self-catering and bed and breakfast businesses.  Business responds not only to tax structures but to tax trends. If directors can see more is going to be demanded of high earners in future, it is a disincentive to invest in Scotland and grow a business. Business leaders are warning of other indications that higher tax bills will weigh on corporate profit. David Lonsdale, of the Scottish Retail Consortium, wrote in The Herald recently about Scotland's political parties edging towards more powers for councillors to wield, both to improve council revenue and local accountability. A tourist tax, or transient visitor levy, is already on the way, with the industry demanding that it has to be spent on improving circumstances in which they operate. Workplace parking charges are an option. Council tax faces an increase in bills paid by those in more valuable homes (on a valuation now an increasingly absurd 32 years out of date).  Critics of council tax, also because it is regressive and loads a relatively high burden on to lower income households, want to see it replaced rather than tinkered with. Mr Lonsdale warns his members of Scottish Greens' intentions along those lines. He also warns of change to business rates. These are already seen as a heavy burden on bricks and mortar businesses which compete with much lower-taxed digital firms, notably in retail. But what if councils took charge of setting them? The retailer representative looks to the experience of that in Northern Ireland, and sees councils taking the opportunity to raise business rates steeply. Their primary interest is in balancing the council books, less in growing the economy. Do such tax increases fit with the intention being set out by the SNP leader at his Aberdeen conference to focus on the economy and raise standards of living?  Probably not. Getting the books to balance isn't so difficult, if you pull some tax levers, hope for the best, and ignore the impact on economic growth and investment prospects.  But higher tax bills for households and for businesses are rarely, if ever, associated with improved prospects for economic growth - unless other measures can be deployed to spark life into Scotland's stalled economy."
Bond Market Forecast,PM rebuffs calls to bring forward watchdog's analysis,2024-09-14,2022-09-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63089314,"Prime Minister Liz Truss is resisting calls to bring forward publication of the independent fiscal watchdog's assessment of her tax plans.  The PM said she was ""committed"" to publishing the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast on 23 November, the same day the chancellor is due to set out further economic plans. Some Conservative MPs want this sooner to reassure financial markets. The Treasury argues it should wait until additional changes are announced. These ""supply side"" changes to stimulate growth are expected to include measures in eight areas - business regulation, agriculture, housing and planning, immigration, mobile and broadband, financial services, childcare, and energy.  Last week, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng set out some of the government's tax and spending plans - including support for people facing high energy bills and a surprise announcement that it would scrap the 45% highest tax band for high earners.  However, his mini-budget was not accompanied by a forecast from the OBR, something which helped to fuel market turmoil.  In the days following the announcement, the pound slumped against the dollar and the Bank of England was forced to spend £65bn to protect pension funds. After a meeting between Ms Truss, Mr Kwarteng and the OBR on Friday morning, the government confirmed the rest of its economic plans would be published on 23 November, alongside an OBR forecast. The Treasury will receive the OBR's first draft on 7 October, but that will not be made public.  Some of Ms Truss's own MPs have raised concerns about the timetable.  Waveney MP Peter Aldous said the timing of last Friday's plan had been ""hopelessly wrong"", and the rest of the details should be brought forward to October. Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown said moving the date forward would give international markets and his constituents ""reassurance"".  Elsewhere Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey argued that the government, by waiting until 23 November, was allowing the UK economy to ""fly blind"" for two months.  ""Families and businesses can't afford to wait any longer for this government to fix their botched, unfair budget,"" he said.  Defending the decision not to publish an OBR forecast after the mini-Budget last Friday, Ms Truss said she had wanted to announce support for energy bills quickly and that ""in that timescale"" there could not be a full OBR forecast. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is the independent watchdog for the government's finances.  It usually produces economic forecasts twice a year, to accompany each autumn budget and spring statement.  It scrutinises government plans, to increase taxes or borrowing for example, and predicts what the likely impact on the overall economy will be. These forecasts are so important because a strong one gives investors confidence to put money into the UK economy - whereas a weak one is likely to have the opposite effect. The government can request forecasts from the OBR at any time to get independent advice on big moves. But it did not take the OBR up on its offer ahead of last week's mini-budget. This is thought to have undermined confidence in the markets. This led to the pound dropping to its lowest rate against the dollar in 37 years on Monday, before returning to its previous level. In recent days, the Conservatives have posted some of their worst opinion poll ratings in more than 20 years. A poll published on Thursday by Survation put the party on 28%, more than 21 points behind Labour, while a separate survey by YouGov put the Tories on 21%, 33 points adrift.  Labour's shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said ministers should ""get back to Parliament, revoke the changes, and start again to try and rebuild confidence"". And Conservative MP Martin Vickers urged the prime minister not to scrap the 45p tax rate and the bankers' bonus cap, describing the move as ""a political own goal"".  However, another Tory backbencher, Andrea Leadsom, said the mini-budget was ""unashamedly pro-growth"", and that the markets were ""wrong to be jittery"" about the changes."
Bond Market Forecast,Markets braced for Yellen at Jackson Hole,2024-09-14,2017-08-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41042025,"The world's most powerful central bankers are gathering for their annual meeting at Jackson Hole in Wyoming. Janet Yellen, whose term as US Federal Reserve chair ends in February, is due to speak on Friday. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi will also give a speech at the conference. Stock market investors will scrutinise their speeches for hints on monetary policy and the outlook for interest rates. It could be Ms Yellen's last appearance at Jackson Hole. President Donald Trump has said National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn is a candidate to replace Ms Yellen, who also could be reappointed. Bank of England deputy governor for monetary policy Ben Broadbent will attend the conference, although governor Mark Carney will not be there. Mr Broadbent is a contender to succeed Mr Carney when he steps down in June 2019. The Fed remains the only major central bank to have begun raising rates in recent years.  It is also seeking to cut the huge amounts of government bonds it has built up while pumping cash into the US economy through quantitative easing. Markets will also be waiting to see if Mr Draghi gives any more indications of when the ECB will start to reduce its own bond-buying programme. The recent strengthening of the euro has brought more uncertainty into the timing of the move. In the global financial crisis central bankers stepped in to shore up flagging markets and business investment by loosening monetary policy. However, Allianz chief economic advisor Mohamed El-Erian told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was time for central bankers to ""step back"". ""Central banks had no choice but to step in with these experimental policies, starting in 2010 for the Federal Reserve, because other policy-makers were not stepping up to their economic responsibilities,"" he said. ""So the Fed, and then the ECB later on, went from focusing on normalising markets to taking, singlehandedly, responsibility for promoting economic growth."" But Mr El-Erian said while the Fed had bought ""time for the economy to heal"", it was now time for the political system to ""get its act together"". He said the policies, while beneficial, also came at the cost of financial markets getting used to central bank support. ""Yes, the time has come for [central banks] to step back. They have to do it very slowly, and very carefully, and the biggest hope is that someone will step in - and that means other policy-making entities,"" Mr El-Erian added."
Bond Market Forecast,Qantas accelerates cost cuts as $1.5bn loss looms,2024-09-14,2021-05-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57181224,"Qantas has announced new cost-cutting measures to help it deal with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The Australian carrier also said it would report an annual loss before tax of more than $1.5bn (A$2bn, £1.1bn). But it added that its debt pile had peaked and was likely to fall as domestic travel was on track to hit pre-pandemic levels. Qantas said its international division was losing about $2.3m a week, down from $3.9m last month.  Its latest cost-cutting plans include a two-year wage freeze, slashing travel agents' commissions for international flights and offering voluntary redundancies to cabin crew in its international business. Separately on Wednesday, the parent company of rival Singapore Airlines revealed a record annual loss of S$4.27bn ($3.2bn) - worse than the average S$3.27bn forecast predicted by eight analysts, said a Reuters report.  In a statement on Tuesday, Qantas said it sees more positive times ahead as a rebound in domestic travel to near-normal levels would help it to continue to cut its debts. ""The fact we're making inroads to the debt we needed to get through this crisis shows the business is now on a more sustainable footing,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said in a statement. ""The main driver is the rebound of domestic travel, which now looks like it will be bigger than it was pre-COVID, at least until international borders re-open."" Qantas added that its international division was losing about $2.3m a week, down from $3.9m last month, due to the opening of a travel bubble with New Zealand and robust demand for its cargo services. The airline has pushed back the sale of international tickets, with the exception of New Zealand, to December after the Australian government said it was unlikely to open its borders to widespread travel until the middle of next year. Qantas shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange rose after today's announcement. Separately on Wednesday, the owner of Singapore's national airline revealed the biggest loss in its 74-year history. The $3.2bn loss was far bigger than last year's $159m loss, the first time the company had ever fallen into the red. The firm also announced a $4.65bn bond sale to help to bolster its finances in the face of the Covid-19 crisis. Singapore Airlines, which has no domestic market, has been one of the world's hardest hit carriers during the pandemic, alongside its Hong Kong-based rival Cathay Pacific. On Monday, a planned travel bubble between Hong Kong and Singapore was postponed for a second time after a spike in cases in Singapore."
Bond Market Forecast,"BT cuts 13,000 jobs to slash costs",2024-09-14,2018-05-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44065422,"BT is to cut 13,000 jobs over three years, about 12% of its workforce, as it seeks to slim down its management and back-office roles. The telecoms giant said that the job cuts and other measures would help it to reduce costs by £1.5bn. It added that it would be hiring about 6,000 employees to ""support network deployment and customer service"". A third of the job reductions will come from outside the UK in its Global Services division. Last year, BT was forced to write down the value of the Italian part of Global Services after an accounting scandal that cost the firm more than £500m. The company also said it intended to move out of its existing central London headquarters and into smaller premises.  BT forecast a fall in revenue of about 2% for the 2018-19 financial year. It also said it was keeping its full-year dividend unchanged from last year at 15.4p a share and would freeze it for the next two years. Shares in BT fell nearly 8% in early trading.  Philippa Childs, national secretary of the Prospect union, said the announcement was ""a devastating blow to managers and professionals represented by Prospect"". She said Prospect had been working closely with BT on looking at the impact of organisational changes, but the number of job cuts sounded ""unrealistic"". BT said it was responding to changes in the telecoms market, including ""increasing competitive intensity from established companies and new entrants"". ""It is critical that BT transforms its operating model to build a lean and agile organisation that delivers sustained improvement in customer experience and productivity,"" it said. The announcements came as BT disclosed that its annual pre-tax profits rose 11% to £2.6bn in the year to March. The firm also announced a 13-year plan to plug its £11.3bn pension fund deficit, including regular payments into the scheme and a bond issue. Chief executive Gavin Patterson said BT was in a unique position: ""We have the UK's leading fixed and mobile access networks, a portfolio of strong and well segmented brands, and close strategic partnerships. ""This position of strength will enable us to build on the disciplined delivery and risk reduction of the last financial year, a period in which we delivered overall in line with our financial and operational commitments whilst addressing many uncertainties."" George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the job cuts and HQ move were ""drastic actions"", but added that they ""still aren't going to be enough to dig BT out the hole it's in"".  ""The dividend, which was rising 10% a year not so long ago, is set to freeze for the foreseeable future, and next year's profits look likely to fall again,"" he added. ""There are silver linings here and there. For example, EE and the consumer businesses continue to grow. However, these improvements are being more than offset by challenging conditions elsewhere.  ""Openreach terms are getting tougher, and the business-to-business and global divisions are having a torrid time. Gavin Patterson will have his work cut out if he's to steady the ship.""  BT's share price has halved over the past two years. Investors have become less convinced about the company's ability to make them money, after an accounting scandal, a profits warning and a regulatory fine.  BT clearly thinks it has too many staff doing jobs not needed in the digital world. Its wide-ranging corporate shake-up is an attempt to simplify the business, to squeeze more profit out of each pound it spends.  It's under pressure to pump more money into fibre optic and super-fast mobile networks and to fill the black hole in its pension scheme. It has made more efforts on those fronts today.  Thousands of new hires will be engineers and cyber-experts, focusing not on copper cables, but on building the physical and mobile networks of the future. It's also trying to improve its customer service and mend relations with the regulator.  It's a big job, turning a former monopoly into a consumer-focused TV and phone company. Shares are down sharply, suggesting investors are yet to be convinced by BT's plan."
Bond Market Forecast,ECB forecasts higher eurozone growth,2024-09-14,2017-06-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40201571,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has increased its forecasts for economic growth in the eurozone but kept interest rates on hold. ECB president Mario Draghi also hinted that there was no need to cut rates further. He told a press conference: ""We are now confident that inflation will converge with our objectives."" The ECB now expects growth across the eurozone to be 1.9% in 2017 compared with its March forecast of 1.8%. It also increased its growth projection for 2018 to 1.8% from 1.7%, and for 2019 to 1.7% from 1.6%. Mr Draghi said: ""The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are considered to be broadly balanced"". This was a marked change from his comments in April, which described the risks to growth as ""tilted to the downside"". Meanwhile the ECB has downgraded its outlook for inflation to 1.5% in 2017, from 1.7%. It also revised its inflation outlook for the following years to 1.3% in 2018, and 1.6% in 2019 as against 1.6% and 1.7% respectively. The ECB targets inflation of close to, but below, 2%.  Aberdeen Asset Management Senior Investment Manager Patrick O'Donnell said:""The ECB is essentially in a holding pattern, waiting for more positive inflation data to come in.  ""There's no appetite to risk choking off the growth that the economy has been seeing of late. Doing nothing is probably the right decision at the moment."" Earlier on Thursday, the Eurostat statistics agency said the eurozone economy had grown at its fastest rate in a year during the January-to-March quarter. At that rate, the 19 countries that use the euro would see growth at 2.3% this year, nearly double the rate of the US, which is on course to grow 1.2%. Mr Draghi said the recovery was due to a pick-up in investment and corporate profitability, gains in employment and the global recovery supporting trade and euro area exports.  However, he added that growth prospects were being dampened by ""a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms"". Mr Draghi said that the ECB would continue its stimulus programme buying bonds, adding that the ""ECB will be in the market for a long time"".  The ECB started buying government and corporate bonds in its quantitative easing (QE) programme in March 2015, starting at a rate of 80bn euros a month and then reducing it to 60bn euros.  Mr Draghi said it had made huge difference to lending across the eurozone: ""Financing conditions remain extremely favourable, and this is because of QE. The pass-through of our monetary policy has never been so effective as it is today."" The bond buying programme is expected to top 2 trillion euros by the year end, and its current interest rates mean that banks have to pay a deposit rate of 0.4% to park their funds with the ECB."
Bond Market Forecast,Aston Martin profits hit by 'disappointing' year,2024-09-14,2020-01-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51017849,"Aston Martin, the luxury British carmaker famed for kitting out James Bond, has issued a profit warning after a ""very disappointing"" 2019. Shares in the 106-year-old firm plunged by as much as 16% after it said annual earnings were expected to fall by nearly half from a year earlier. But the fortunes of BMW-owned rival Rolls-Royce were very different. Rolls-Royce, the car of choice for those who like to be chauffeured, sold a record 5,100 vehicles last year. In a trading update, Aston Martin said the ""challenging trading conditions highlighted in November continued through the peak delivery period of December resulting in lower sales, higher selling costs and lower margins"". It said core retail sales - which covers sales from Aston Martin dealers to consumers - were up 12% from a year earlier. However, wholesale volumes - which covers how many cars the dealers are ordering from Aston Martin itself - were down 7% to 5,809. ""From a trading perspective, 2019 has been a very disappointing year,"" said Aston Martin chief executive Andy Palmer. The company said it was expecting earnings of between £130m and £140m, well below the £247.3m it reported last year. When Aston Martin listed its shares on the London Stock Exchange in October 2018, its shares were priced at £19 each. However, the latest bad news has now dragged the share price down to about £4.50. ""It is remarkable that a company with such a strong brand can consistently issue bad news,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""Aston Martin has been one of the biggest flops on the stock market in living memory and today's trading update does nothing to improve its tarnished reputation. ""The big question is why wealthy people aren't buying its luxury cars. Working for this company should be a marketeer's dream, but the team responsible for attracting customers clearly haven't got the formula right."" Rolls-Royce boss Torsten Müller-Ötvös told the BBC that a big driver of its higher sales was the launch of the Cullinan SUV, which he said now had ""very stable, robust"" orders. But he said sales were not expected to grow at the same rate in 2020. Part of the difference between the successes of the two brands could come down to how they define themselves. ""We are not really in the car business, we are in the luxury goods business,"" Mr Müller-Ötvös said. ""We are famous for bespoke, so you can basically customise a Rolls-Royce to build your own masterpiece, and I think that has attracted quite a lot of clients worldwide."""
Bond Market Forecast,Liz Truss's claims on the economy fact-checked,2024-09-14,2022-10-02,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/63108082,"Prime Minister Liz Truss has defended her government's mini-budget, despite the days of market turmoil that followed it which saw a rise in the cost of government borrowing that has had an impact on mortgages and other parts of the economy. She told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg programme that she stood by it but said the government should have ""laid the ground better"" before announcing the measures, which included tax cuts paid for by billions of pounds of borrowing. Here are some of the claims Ms Truss made in the interview. The prime minister said this after being asked whether she felt any responsibility for people's worries about their mortgages, rents and loans.  She's right that interest rates are rising around the world as central banks, like the Bank of England, raise them to fight the inflation that has been made worse by the war in Ukraine. But the cost of UK government borrowing surged to over 4% after the government's mini-budget on 23 September.  As BBC Economics Editor Faisal Islam has pointed out on Twitter, this lifted the cost of borrowing in the UK above that in Greece.  This rise was not set by the Bank of England - but by the bond markets reacting to the measures in the mini-budget - and it is feeding through into rising mortgage rates with hundreds of products withdrawn from the mortgage market. It also had an impact on UK pension funds - which trade in government debt (30-year bonds) - with the Bank of England having to step in to safeguard the sector with a £65bn support scheme.  Speaking on 29 September, the Bank of England's Chief Economist Huw Pill said that over the course of the past week: ""There has been a significant re-pricing of financial assets. Part of that... reflects broader global developments... But there is undoubtedly a UK-specific component."" The UK's growth has been low in the past decade, and the decline started before the Covid pandemic. The UK economy grew at an average rate of 2.3% between 1982 and 1992 and 2.6% between 1993 and 2002. In the past two decades, the economy has grown by an average of 1.4% each year. But it has been affected by two major global crises - the financial crash of 2008 and the Covid pandemic that started in 2020. Even if you exclude these, growth in the last ten years has not matched previous decades.  The UK saw an average growth rate of 2.5% between 2002 and 2007 (before the financial crash of 2008-09). In the years after the crash and before Covid - 2010 to 2019 - it grew at a rate of 2%. Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng have said their goal is to secure steady growth for the UK of 2.5% a year. The prime minister was asked why the mini-budget had not been accompanied by a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the independent number crunchers who usually mark the government's economic homework.  Market commentators have suggested that its absence contributed to the turmoil over the following days.  Ms Truss claims the government didn't have time to wait for the OBR to produce its forecast.  However, the OBR says it could have done it in time.  In a letter on 29 September, Richard Hughes, chair of the OBR, said a draft forecast was sent to the new Chancellor - Kwasi Kwarteng - on 6 September, his first day in the office.  The OBR then offered to provide an updated forecast to be published along with the 23 September mini-budget, but was not commissioned by the government to do so, ""although we would have been in a position to do so to a standard that satisfied the legal requirements of the Charter for Budget Responsibility enacted by Parliament"", Mr Hughes wrote.  If you look at the government's total debt as a percentage of the size of the economy, this claim is correct.  As of December 2021, the UK had a lower proportion of debt than Canada, France, the US, Italy and Japan, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Adding the extra borrowing needed this year to fund the measures announced in the mini budget would not lift the UK above the next highest nation.

Bond Market Forecast,The week ahead in Parliament,2024-09-14,2020-02-28,By Mark D'Arcy,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-51674733," It's quiet, too quiet. On one level Parliament seems pretty serene, especially in contrast to the rolling crisis in the months before the last election. Now there is a government which can expect to get its way in any Commons vote, and fears no backbench rebellion. But wait. The prime minister may seem all-conquering, but he has just lost his chancellor, the classic sign of a government in trouble. And Sajid Javid's resignation statement positioned the ex-chancellor as the champion of low taxes and sound money, and in the process as a lurking long term rival on the backbenches.  The tensions behind Mr Javid's departure will out at the Budget in a couple of weeks. Will the new Chancellor Rishi Sunak shrug off inconvenient fiscal rules to reward new Conservative voters in the North? Will promised tax cuts go ahead? Or will it be a ""jam tomorrow"" budget, of promises postponed and expectations deferred?  So even before we get to Brexit, there are serious tensions for the government to manage, although it remains to be seen if the opposition is deft enough to exploit them.  And while Brexit remains the dominant issue in politics, post-election discussion of it in the Commons, has been curiously low-key, especially when you remember that, just months ago, there were endless convulsions over efforts to rule out a no-deal exit from the EU, and it remains distinctly possible that the UK could indeed exit single market at the end of the year without a replacement trade agreement. The government's election victory has silenced its critics, for now, not least because most of the hardcore Tory rebels lost their seats, and they were the ones offering the most trenchant criticism. After a long interlude, the select committees are about to be formed. The motions naming the ordinary members of the committees are down on the Order Paper for Monday, which means the committees should be able to hold meetings to start agreeing what they want to look at and who they want to talk to.  First out of the traps will be the Public Accounts Committee, the powerful and hard-working financial watchdog, which will be holding its first evidence session, on the evergreen topic of HS2, on Wednesday afternoon - other committees might be fleet-footed and enterprising enough to hold hearings the following week, while the Backbench Business Committee and the Petitions Committee can begin scheduling debates.  It's worth noting that the committees have not been in action since October 2019, so there's been no detailed scrutiny of government for upwards of four months. In 2015 the gap between the State Opening of Parliament and the first committee session was 25 sitting days, and in 2017 it was 20 days; this time it was 28 days. (Hat tip to BBC research guru Daniel Kraemer). That has led to complaints of ministerial foot-dragging, with Labour MPs pointing out that they settled their committee members three weeks ago.  There's an amusing story that the Committee of Selection, which names MPs to committees, was so irritated by the delay that there were threats of strike action. If the motions were not put down they were going to start dragging their feet on naming the members of the committees which consider government legislation, striking back at ministers by slowing down the progress of their bills. The system is now juddering into life, and doubtless there will be calls for such delays to be avoided in future. But there were similar calls, answered by solemn assurances, in 2015 and 2017, so expect the whole non-drama to be re-enacted after the next election, too. One interesting phenomenon, in the run-up to International Women's Day on Sunday 8 March, is a fusillade of presentation bills from Lib Dem MPs on women's issues, including banning demonstrations close to abortion clinics and making community sentences the default for women offenders.  Presentation bills can be put down by any MP, but do not have any debating time attached to them, so they simply go to the back of the queue for discussion on the Friday sittings reserved for Private Members Bills, and are never seen again. It is a way of putting down a marker, and maybe, given that seven of the 11 Lib Dems in the Commons are women, it is a sign of their party adjusting its political priorities.  Here's my rundown of the week ahead: The Commons opens (14:30) with education questions - which may see a debut from new Children and Families Minister Vicky Ford. The usual post-weekend crop of ministerial statements and urgent questions can be expected at 15:30, probably including an urgent question on the future of Heathrow expansion, after the Appeal Court ruling against the third runway. One factor to watch will be whether the MPs in alternative areas for airport expansion - Gatwick, Stansted - get their act together. Then Layla Moran presents the first of those Lib Dem presentation bills, on pupil access to toilets during lessons at state-funded schools. The main debate will be on the second reading of the Medicines and Medical Devices Bill which gives minister regulation-making powers covering human medicines, clinical trials and medical devices. The aim is to allow existing regulations to be updated, post-Brexit. The day's most controversial moment will probably be the motion to bring back the bill to authorise the next stage of the HS2 high-speed rail line. The bill for the section running from Birmingham to Crewe fell at the general election, but can be revived under a ""Lazarus motion"" proposed by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, and treated as having reached the stage of parliamentary consideration it was at, when the music stopped. No HS2 debate is complete without opposition from MPs along the route, so keep an eye out for the likes of Michael Fabricant, Cheryl Gillan and Sir Bill Cash. He will be arguing that since the government has launched a review of the later stages of the HS2 project, the sections running to Manchester and Leeds, this section should also be ""paused"" and included in the review process. Unless the government agrees, this vote looks set fair to produce the first Conservative backbench rebellion of the new parliament, although with Labour backing the motion, the government is in no danger of defeat.  After that MPs will be asked to approve all remaining estimates for spending by government departments - a chance to thrill to the sight of truly humungous sums of taxpayers money being allocated to government departments with pretty minimal parliamentary scrutiny. In the last parliament, a deal was done which allowed the Backbench Business Committee to select particular estimates for debate, but because BBBCom is not in operation, yet, there won't be a chance for that kind of selective examination of particular budgets that MPs thought important. Maybe next time.  The day ends with an adjournment debate led by the SNP's Margaret Ferrier on the return of the Elgin marbles, AKA the Parthenon Marbles. In 2016 she co-signed a cross-party bill to return the sculptures to Greece, righting what the bill's backers described as ""a 200-year-old wrong"". In the Lords (14:30) questions to ministers include former health minister Lord Hunt of Kings Heath asking whether the UK Magnitsky-style sanctions regime for human rights violations will apply to persons engaged in illegal organ trafficking or obtaining organs for transplant without consent. His question is based on a report from the WOIPFG (the World Organisation to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong) showing that more than 7,000 medical professionals in China are involved in illegal enforced organ-harvesting trade and it is believed that thousands of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience have been killed so their organs could be used in the lucrative market for transplants in China. The final judgement of the China Tribunal chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice QC concluded that force organ harvesting has been committed for years throughout China on a significant scale. He wants the government to assure peers that the sanctions regime (which includes a travel ban and asset-freezing) could be applied to these doctors. Then, peers launch into detailed committee stage consideration of the Fisheries Bill, which will extend the UK's territorial fishing rights from 12 nautical miles to an Exclusive Economic Zone of 200 - and create a licensing system for UK and foreign vessels to fish in those waters based around a series of sustainability, scientific and economic criteria.  At this stage votes are unusual, and the purpose of amendments is to ""probe"" the government's intentions and the meaning of the provisions in the bill. But Labour will be arguing for fishing quotas to be switched away from wealthy families who dominate ownership towards smaller operations. They will also be pushing for use of compulsory surveillance technology to enforce fishing limits, and punish deliberate overfishing.  Finally, there will be a short debate on the impact of treatment by unregulated and unregistered people offering psychotherapy or counselling services, on the mental health and wellbeing of their clients, led by Lib Dem Baroness Jolly. The commons day begins (11:30) with the first cabinet minister debut since the government reshuffle, with Alok Sharma at the Dispatch Box as business secretary. Lib Dem Daisy Cooper presents a bill requiring the courts to impose community sentences on women offenders unless they have committed a serious or violent crime, or are a danger to the public. That happens without debate, but Conservative Sir Christopher Chope will have to argue for his Ten Minute Rule Bill on Rule of Law (Enforcement by Public Authorities). That's followed by some spending legislation, the Supply and Appropriation (Anticipation and Adjustments) Bill, and after that, the House will polish off the Prisoners (Disclosure of Information about Victims) Bill: Committee and Remaining Stages. The day ends with an adjournment debate led by South Cambridgeshire's Conservative MP Anthony Browne, on the police response to climate protests in Cambridge. He has criticised the decision to close two roads blocked by protesters, saying: ""However well intentioned, demonstrators cannot be allowed to flagrantly break the law."" In Westminster Hall (09:30) there's a debate on the nursing workforce shortage in England, led by Labour's Mohammad Yasin. He will point to 40,000 vacancies in substantive nursing posts especially in mental health, learning disability, primary and community nursing, and warn that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the NHS staffing crisis will intensify.  Former Downing Street staffer Neil O'Brien has a debate on housing and planning (14:30). Among other things he will float is the idea of creating some kind of bond or fixed-penalty-notice system to make it much easier for councils to fine developers who break planning conditions, for example, failing to provide promised infrastructure.  And with the Domestic Abuse Bill, which fell as a result of the snap election, due to be brought back to Parliament soon, Labour's Liz Twist leads a debate on the impact on children of domestic abuse. (16:30) In the Lords (14:30) questions cover the costs of clinical negligence, local and regional arts and cultural services and radicalisation in prisons.  There's a quick rubber-stamping exercise with the third reading of a Law Commission Bill, the Sentencing (Pre-consolidation Amendments) Bill, which makes a series of uncontroversial technical changes to criminal law around the introduction of the new sentencing code, and then peers move on to the detail of the Divorce, Dissolution and Separation Bill, which aims to simplify the law on ending a marriage, so the process is not unnecessarily antagonistic. Finally, peers consider a series of orders on benefit uprating, covering Tax Credits, Employment Allowance, Child Benefit and Guardian's Allowance.  There's another cabinet debut as the Commons opens (11:30) with new secretary of state Anne-Marie Trevelyan at the Dispatch Box for half an hour of International Development Questions. At 12:00 Boris Johnson faces PMQs, which now seems to have been reliably restored to its traditional half-hour duration under the gimlet-eyed supervision of Mr Speaker Hoyle. Lib Dem Wendy Chamberlain presents a bill requiring the international development secretary to report on the use of UK overseas aid to increase the availability of women's sanitary products. That is followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill, this time from Conservative Peter Bone, to create a bank holiday to commemorate the Brexit referendum.  It will be an interesting morning in Westminster Hall, starting with what promises to be something of a pile-on (09:30) as former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith leads a debate on the security implications of including components manufactured by the Chinese telecoms firm, Huawei, in the UK's 5G internet infrastructure. There's a great deal of disquiet across Parliament on this issue - and the potential risks to security from allowing a company controlled by the Chinese government access to critical UK infrastructure, although the government believes the risks can be managed. Watch out for contributions from heavyweight ex-ministers and select committee grandees like Tom Tugendhat and Tobias Ellwood. It could be a pretty awkward outing for whoever from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport ministerial team is sent to bat for the government.  That's followed by another significant debate (11:00) as former sports minister Tracey Crouch calls for an extension of the position of trust legislation to cover abuse perpetrated by sports coaches. This was a policy she proposed as a minister, but which, she says, ""got stuck"" in the Ministry of Justice. She wants to hear what the MoJ plans to do to close the loophole, and when. As noted above, the first green shoots of select committee activity will appear, in the form of a PAC hearing on HS2, based on this National Audit Office report,     which found that phase one is now forecast to cost between £31bn and £40bn, £3.9bn to £12.9bn (14% to 47%) more than its available funding. In the Lords (15:00) questions to ministers range through doctor retention in the NHS, regulating genome-edited crops and management of investigations into historic sexual offences - this last is from Labour's Lord Campbell-Savours, a critic of the conduct of such inquiries.   Peers then put the finishing touches to the Birmingham Commonwealth Games Bill , which creates the legal framework for the 2022 Games, with what will probably be a brief third reading debate. Then they move on to their second day of detailed committee stage scrutiny of the Fisheries Bill.   There will also be a short debate on the problems and possible solutions for children in the school system with dyslexia and other neurodiverse conditions. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss survived the reshuffle and regular predictions of her sacking. She takes questions in the Commons (09:30), after which the Lib Dem Christine Jardine presents her bill to ban the differential pricing of similar products marketed to men and women. Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg takes questions on forthcoming Commons business, and then MPs move on to the annual debate on International Women's Day.  In the Lords (11:00) questions to ministers cover the effectiveness of the Crown Prosecution Service in prosecuting rape, health outcomes for lesbian, bisexual and trans women, and compensation for sub-postmasters as a result of the Horizon accounting system litigation, as compared to the losses they incurred due to Post Office Ltd's policies.   The main debate is on the role of the BBC and public service broadcasting to the UK's economy and creative culture - led by the Labour's Lord Young of Norwood Green. And there is also a short debate on educational opportunities available to children and young people from working-class backgrounds - led by the Labour former Education Secretary Baroness Morris of Yardley.  Neither House sits."
Bond Market Forecast,Thousands take part in Twelfth of July parades,2024-09-14,2023-07-12,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-66157393,"The Orange Order and approximately 600 bands have taken part in parades at 18 locations on Wednesday to mark the Twelfth of July. As well as Belfast and Ballymena, parades were held in towns including Ballinamallard, Magherafelt and Kilkeel. Bangor, Northern Ireland's newest city, also hosted a demonstration. The processions mark the victory of King William III over King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. William, a Protestant, had become King of England, Scotland and Ireland the previous year, after Catholic James II was deposed, and his victory secured his position. Orange Order Grand Master Edward Stevenson said the event was a ""day to remember"". He said there had been ""extraordinary"" numbers of people celebrating.  ""The weather conditions weren't entirely favourable for all throughout the day, but the rain could not dampen the spirits of those on parade,"" he said. He said there had been visitors from Scotland, England, Wales, the US and Canada taking part in the parades. Last week, an internal Orange Order document suggested the institution was considering plans to shorten the Belfast parade. It followed what the Orange Order described as ""abysmal"" scenes at the 2022 march relating to anti-social behaviour and excessive drinking. The organisation's grand secretary, Rev Mervyn Gibson said he hoped it would be a ""family friendly day where we go out and celebrate our culture"". ""Today is about the glorious Twelfth of July and celebrating victory at the Battle of the Boyne,"" he told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme on Wednesday. Before the parade Rev Gibson said he was not worried about the forecast: ""I think if King William was scared of a bit of water, he'd never have crossed the Boyne so a bit of rain isn't going to dampen our spirits."" This year's parades are being held in: On Sunday, the annual Rossnowlagh parade in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland took place, as is tradition ahead of the Twelfth. Up to 60 lodges from Donegal as well as counties Cavan, Leitrim and Monaghan were joined by lodges from across Northern Ireland. On Tuesday night, the ""Eleventh Night"" was marked by bonfires in many Protestant areas across Northern Ireland. The BBC will broadcast highlights from eight demonstrations in a special hour-long programme on BBC One at 21:00 BST and on BBC iPlayer."
Bond Market Forecast,The economic forecast turns dreich,2024-09-14,2023-10-25,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-67221829,"If you're after good news about the Scottish economy, look away now. It's not unrelentingly grim, in that there are underlying strengths there, and opportunities to be seized, and many businesses are getting along just fine. But momentum is in short supply. It may even be ""apathy"", according to the director of the Fraser of Allander Institute. The economists there have just published their regular updated forecast, and given Scotland's economy a further downgrade for this year.   The weight of negative findings from business surveys and other data points to growth of only 0.2% this year. That is down on the June figure forecasting 0.5%. Growth forecasts for next year and the year after have not been downgraded. At 0.7% and 1.2%, they look stronger than this year, but they're a long way short of a healthy recovery. The good news is that it could have been worse. Nearly a year ago, the Bank of England forecast that we'd be in a prolonged though shallow recession by now, lasting all of this year and well into 2024. The winter months weren't so bad. The economy weathered the surge in energy prices. It has been the summer that has slowed things up. The higher cost of borrowing money is one obvious reason. This should hardly come as a surprise. The whole point of the Bank of England raising the cost of borrowing is to choke demand out of the economy, and any inflation that comes with it, in the hope that can be achieved without causing a recession. It hasn't cut inflation as fast as hoped. Decline has stalled - that is, prices in the year to September rose at the same pace as the year to August, and that was only one notch down on the year to July.  It has been helped downwards by food price inflation coming off a high of more than 19% towards a mere 10% inflation over the year. Some items have actually fallen in price month-on-month, including dairy and eggs.  But the decline in the Consumer Price Index measure of inflation has had the brakes applied by fuel costs going up. This impacts any part of the economy that relies on road and air transport of goods and people. Prices are affected by the global cost of crude oil and a renewed weakening of the pound against the US dollar, in which the black stuff is bought and sold. The Fraser of Allander economists, at Strathclyde University, explain their gloomy prediction with their recent survey evidence from across Scottish private sector firms.  It shows firms struggling to absorb higher input costs for much longer. Those who don't wish to lose custom or market share have been seeking to manage costs, with a squeeze on profits, but say they can only do so for so long. Today's report says some are responding with shrinkflation, getting less for the same price, and hospitality firms throwing in extra charges with your bill. But this evidence suggests something that the Bank of England fears when it looks at the outlook for inflation - pent-up pressures, notably in wage costs, are continuing to push consumer prices up. Some firms aren't making it through. Figures published on Wednesday point to a rise in the number of company insolvencies in Scotland, up nearly 5% in July to September when compared with the same period last year, at 283 firms.  They're down by a small number on the second quarter of this year, but up nearly 20% on pre-pandemic levels. ""The year-on-year rise in corporate insolvencies has been driven by an almost 35% rise in compulsory liquidations,"" according to Iain Fraser of R3, which represents the insolvency trade. ""This increase suggests that, faced with financial challenges of their own, more and more creditors are now increasing their efforts to pursue debts they are owed to meet their own financial obligations. ""Times remain tough for Scottish businesses,"" he continues. ""Inflation is still a big worry for many. Prices are going up, and businesses are struggling to reasonably pass on these extra costs to customers.  ""As we head into the colder months and energy bills rise, these increased costs are only set to exacerbate current challenges, particularly for higher risk sectors like hospitality and retail."" Further evidence from the Allander survey, and another this week from Scottish Chambers of Commerce, show Scottish firms are reluctant to invest. Their plans are being delayed or cancelled because of rising interest rates and costs. Without investment, and without the productivity gains it can provide, it is hard to see where more economic growth will come from.  There are public funds to help them, with the British Business Bank recently adding a big new fund to the efforts of the Scottish National Investment Bank, both trying to identify the areas where their involvement can leverage investment from others. That sluggish investment has knock-on effects for the public sector. The added pay bill for the Scottish public sector is put at around £1.7bn. Tax revenues and the block grant from Westminster don't look likely to close the resulting gap between spending and revenue. The Treasury in London and the Scottish government are both preparing to set out tax and spending plans next month and December, and with the cost of servicing debt sharply up in the expectation of sustained high interest rates, the Institute of Fiscal Studies says the UK is in a ""horrible fiscal bind, as low growth and high debt interest payments mean no room for manoeuvre. ""The UK economy remains stuck between weak growth on the one hand and the risk of persistently high inflation on the other.  ""Fiscal and monetary policy must strike a delicate balance - an ill-timed fiscal loosening, such as an unfunded package of pre-election tax cuts, might give a short-term economic sugar rush, but could prove unsustainable and ultimately mean a protracted recession as interest rates rise even further to bring inflation back under control."" Tax cuts are being pushed by Conservative MPs at Westminster, while tax raises seem a more likely response at Holyrood. Audit Scotland warns that infrastructure projects are outstripping the funds available, and some will have to be delayed or cancelled. They are also part of the plan to improve productivity and economic performance. The first minister's new commitment to a council tax freeze has made it even more difficult to make the budgets balance without an income tax raid by Holyrood on higher earners, and that too could be expected to weigh on the economic growth rate. For one of the most recent takes on the private sector in Scotland, the Purchasing Managers Index for September identified a contraction in output, the first since January. It is only slight, and not as clear as the figure for the UK as a whole.  Inflow of new work has weakened as well, which is often an indicator of further problems down the line. But being in business is no place for the terminally gloomy.  There are signs of optimism rising in the PMI survey, for Royal Bank of Scotland, in the belief that customer demand will return.  There is also a positive outlook about employment. The weak level of demand is not seeing workers laid off, and many are still struggling to find the skilled staff they want to hire. This week's job figures for the UK, from the Office for National Statistics, suggest the June-to-August number of those seeking work remained at 4.3% of working age adults. That's higher than it was, but still low by historic standards, and rising much less steeply than you might expect from the less happy data. How about Scotland's unemployment? There's a problem there. The PMI figures show Scottish recruitment running at a stronger rate than the UK as a whole, much of that in the service sector. The ONS figure for May-to-July rose quite steeply to match the UK rate. But the official counter of things has not published figures for Scotland, or other nations or regions of the UK. There isn't even a breakdown between male and female. The problem is one of data quality. The Labour Force Survey is failing to reach a representative sample of workers. Eight years ago, it reached more than 90,000 people across the UK over three months. This year, it was only just over 50,000, with too few home renters and young people responding to ONS questionnaires.  The survey is being re-launched for online responses as well (how modern!), and should be back to health by March. But for the winter ahead, even those who measure tough times are having a tough time."
Bond Market Forecast,Holyrood Budget: growing pains,2024-09-14,2017-12-15,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-42363801,"A good budget requires a rabbit to be pulled from the finance minister's hat. That's ""good"" in the journalist's sense that it's at least interesting. As a financial magician, Derek Mackay still has plodding patter. Last year's budget speech from the finance secretary, likened to a pupil reading a lesson at the school carol service but only under protest, had improved to the point of sounding a bit like Jackanory. But when he reached into his hat of magic tricks to give his budget a bit of wizardry, it seemed as if said rodents had been breeding. Like rabbits. Not one new tax band, but two. A rate hike here, a cut there, contriving to make Scotland both the highest and lowest taxed part of the UK. By the time he sat down, Mr Mackay's bunnies were hopping all over Holyrood and beyond, their whiskers twitching at the prospect of some green shoots for a nibble.  Unfortunately, those are the frosty winter shoots on which an economic recovery depends. At first glance, this looked a politically astute budget. Going further than expected for the NHS. A raft of measures to please the business lobbyists. A big wad for rural broadband.  Most of those who speak for business were willing to welcome most measures, particularly on business rates. The tourist sector was particularly positive about both business rates being linked to a lower inflation index, and broadband reaching hotels on the periphery. Housebuilders like the business rate changes too, and a small cut to the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax levied on first time buyers. But the rest of the property sector was disappointed there wasn't more change to the LBTT, which has put a dampener on things towards the upper end of the market. Engineering Scotland liked the look of more research funding. The Scottish National Investment Bank is seen positively. The Federation of Small Businesses saw some positives, but remarked that it had sought ""ballast in choppy markets, but instead the Scottish government steered into uncharted economic waters"". Experts and analysts have more doubts than business. Reform Scotland, the think tank, thinks the tax cuts bring unnecessary risk and could lead to lower revenue.   IPPR Scotland reckons a lot of the tax cut on low earners will go to second, part-time earners in better off households, who may not be the most deserving. The Chartered Institute of Taxation noted the potential for some anomalies, as the new starter rate becomes entangled with the tapering of Westminster's benefits system. Hargreaves Lansdowne, the wealth managers, note that tax relief on pensions may now require a lot more paperwork. Politically, the tax reform showed Scotland can go its own way, without necessarily frightening the horses. With a bit of take and give, the reform is expected to bring in an extra £164m - merely 1.3% up on an income tax take of nearly £12bn. It had most of what will be needed to win over the Scottish Green MSPs with whom Mr Mackay hopes to get his budget over the line at Holyrood. But economically, the seismic change to Scotland's income tax is likely to overshadow one very small, very significant number that wasn't even in the budget speech: 0.7%. That's the amount by which the Scottish Fiscal Commission (SFC) expects the economy to grow next year.   For three years after that, growth is forecast to remain below 1%. Way off in 2022, it rises to the unimpressive heights of 1.1%. The UK growth forecast, from the Office for Budget Responsibility, was the main, unwelcome surprise of Phillip Hammond's November budget. Conceding it had been over-optimistic about Britain's return to productivity growth, it adjusted to the reality of very slow improvements. That delivered a growth forecast for next year of a dismal 1.4%. So using parallel assumptions about Scotland's productivity, which has been going backwards of late, the SFC forecasts a growth rate of only half as much. Some of that gap can be explained by faster population growth south of the Border, but not all.  In a cautiously worded document from the SFC, the warnings are stark: ""The growth that has been achieved in recent years has been driven by factors which include a boom in the construction industry, strong labour market growth, a falling savings ration and support form the oil and gas industry. These factors are unlikely to continue to support growth to the same extent in the coming years. ""Future downside risks include the UK's changing relationship with the EU, a weakening outlook for global trade, Scotland's industrial and demographic structure and weak onshore demand linked to activity in the oil and gas sector."" On earnings, it's starker still: ""Real household disposable income [that's the useful stuff that matters, including tax and benefits] is not expected to see any growth until 2020-21 because of a combination of slow wage growth, very limited employment growth and inflation"". And much of this has to do with productivity being so weak, having ""a profound impact on GDP and the Scottish economy as a whole"". This downgrade in growth forecast is measurable when compared with the Scottish government's forecast last February. Things have taken such a downward lurch that the increase in tax rates is wiped out by the reduction in tax revenue. Next year, Derek Mackay's income tax changes are expected to add £164m to the total revenue, yet total revenue is down more than £200m on expectations in February. That gap widens rapidly over subsequent years. By 2021-22, contrasting February's estimate with this month's figures adds £188m from the change to tax bands and rates, yet the total tax take is down by more than £900m - from £14.59bn to £13.66bn. Welcome to the world of tax revenue volatility, or what they sometimes like to call buoyancy. It's an exciting new world for MSPs, but forces them to think much harder about the ways in which growth can be increased. One last question that puzzled me about Derek Mackay's speech. Was this tax rise a one-off or not? Taxpayers who are being asked to pay more might well be willing to accept such incremental change this year, but probably want to know the big picture and the further horizon.  Will higher earners still be paying to counter Westminster's spending squeeze - which is expected to last into the mid-2020s - with further, unending tax hikes?"
Bond Market Forecast,Holyrood tax: the devil's in the data,2024-09-14,2019-06-01,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-48484264,"A young scientist stunned us recently with the first ever picture of a black hole, somewhere far out in space. It was probably based on very clever science and maths.  But even if it wasn't, who was to contradict her? Who can offer an alternative vision of a black hole? Black holes fascinate and bamboozle us, because they are mind-bendingly difficult to comprehend. That's why they fit easily into headlines and what passes for political debate. So when you hear or read there's a £1bn black hole facing the Scottish government, take special care. It's an impossibly big number to comprehend for those more used to a household budget. And no-one else can disprove a mind-bending negative. The hole in question in recent days consists of changes to the budgets with which Derek Mackay, the finance secretary at Holyrood, has to work from next April. He says they have opened up because of austerity being imposed from Westminster. His Tory opponent, Murdo Fraser - minding the back of said Westminster government - says they are a measure of the SNP's mismanagement of the economy. Now, austerity can be blamed for stuff. The SNP may or may not be mismanaging the economy. But it seems neither politician is right about these numbers. The culprit looks more like dodgy data. And that's the price to be paid when you set up a largely new system of devolved taxation.  Let's see if I can explain. Income tax revenue is providing more than £11bn for the Scottish government this year. The figures on which the budget is based were set by the Scottish Fiscal Commission last year, derived from its best guess of what revenue could be expected to roll in. That guess had to take a stab at how many taxpayers there are in different bands of earning, and how much might slip out of the country to avoid the extra 1% being charged on higher earners in Scotland, when compared with the rest of the UK. Because tax has not been handled this way before, and because there hasn't been this differential within the UK, quite a lot of it is informed guesswork. And small assumptions can make a big difference when the total adds up to more than £11 billion. Now then: while the Scottish Rate of Income Tax brings spondulicks rolling into Mr Mackay's coffers, the Westminster government is pulling back on the amount it sends up the M1 to Holyrood in the block grant.  In a formula agreed by both governments, it withholds the amount that would otherwise be heading north if the tax had not been devolved.  So if the Scottish government rakes in less or more than Westminster's tax choices would have done, through having different tax rates and different growth, then Scottish ministers have to deal with the consequences - either a shortfall on the Westminster baseline, or a surplus. In addition to the block grant, the Treasury adds funds to pay for devolved powers to handle some aspects of welfare spending.  More on that later. And (here we're getting to the important bit for this week) the Treasury adjusts future funds in the block grant if it finds that past funding has been over- or under-generous. That is a calculation of how much the forecast out-turns for income tax collection varied from the actual out-turn. This summer, we will get the full and final figure for the amount of Scottish income tax raised in 2017-18.  It is expected (yes, it's still a forecast) that it will be £229m less than the Scottish Fiscal Commission forecast it would be. If that turns out to be right, then the block grant for 2020-21, starting next April, will have £229m less than it would otherwise have done. In summer of 2020, we'll find out precisely how much was raised in 2018-19. The Scottish Fiscal Commission's current forecast for that (less likely to be accurate now than the one for 2017-18) is £608m.  And the forecast shortfall from the current financial year, 2019-20, will only become clear in summer of 2021, then to mean an adjustment forecast at £188m for 2022-23. Let's stop a moment and get these numbers in perspective. They add up to just over £1bn. That makes for a good headline. What does it mean? Not much. Public finance is best understood one year at a time.  So let's take the biggest of these one-year numbers: £608m.  This year, the Scottish government total budget, including new welfare spending and pensions, comes to around £42bn. So that very large figure of £608m is one pound in 70. Not much then? Well, look at it another way. It's around half of all the funding for Scottish policing during the current financial year. To return to the ""consolidation"" figure, or block grant adjustment, does it have to be a shortfall? No. It's very likely that there will always be an adjustment to be made because the forecast is unlikely ever to be bang on target.  But as the Fiscal Commission gets more informed and smarter about the behaviour of the economy and taxation system, the gaps between forecast and actual out-turn should get smaller. And they should be, theoretically, as likely to turn out as surpluses as they are shortfalls. Why, you might well ask, has this gap opened up so wide, and only become clearer now?  The biggest cause of the change is that the Office for Budget Responsibility, forecasting for the whole UK economy and Westminster budgets, reckons that tax revenue has come in ahead of previous expectations. That kiboshes the argument that this has to do with austerity. But it does raise the question of why a (sort of) windfall to the UK Treasury from income tax payers doesn't seem to be applying to Scottish taxpayers.  One theory I offer is that more assertive tax collection from higher earners - tackling tax avoidance measures such as Employee Benefit Trusts, for instance (remember them?) - is having a disproportionate effect on the part of Britain where most higher earners live. As if to confuse us, the Scottish Fiscal Commission published this week, in the same document, a sharply reduced forecast for growth of total output from the Scottish economy. For this year, it's down from last December's forecast of 1.2% to only 0.8%, rising to merely 0.9% next year, before it rises slowly above 1% out to 2024-25. The main reason is given as Brexit uncertainty, including low business investment, productivity gains that are not only weak but weaker than the UK, and cautious consumer spending. The world economy is stuttering a bit as well, as trade wars loom large. That is now significantly below the growth rate expected for the UK as a whole. But the gap is largely explained by immigration.  If you adjust for Gross Domestic Product per person, the rest of the UK - with a faster-growing population - doesn't look like it's growing that much faster. This forecast is based on an orderly Brexit at the end of October - taking the bold assumption, as the Scottish Fiscal Commission has to do, that government policy is what the government will do. (No, they don't sound too convinced by that either.). Dame Susan Rice, as chairwoman, says a ""no deal"" Brexit brings with it a ""substantial risk to the downside"" of these forecasts. If, like me, you leapt to the instant assumption that lower growth means lower income tax receipts, you and I would be wrong, at least on this occasion.  Lower growth, while we've got very low unemployment, is being accompanied by higher income tax receipts, apparently because real wages have started to rise. So when an opposition MSP says this ""black hole"" budget shortfall has to do with SNP policy, he or she is missing most of the picture.  It is mainly because of a) a better understanding of how much Scottish income tax has been raising and will raise b) strengthening of UK tax collection and c) it comes despite a modest rise in expected Scottish tax collection. If you're still with me (well done), what the Scottish Fiscal Commission is saying to the Scottish government is that volatile revenue is the new normal for Holyrood. And when they say ""get used to it"", it's not said glibly. They mean: Seriously, Get Used To It.  This has to be managed, in a way that Holyrood ministers and their officials, plus scrutinising MSP committees, have not had to do until now. And while these block grant adjustments, or consolidations, are going to throw (sometimes big, awkward) numbers at the finance secretary every year, the next big fiscal locomotive hurtling up the East Coast Line is welfare spending. In the current year, that is less than half a billion pounds.  Next year, they reckon (another forecast), it will be more like £3.5 billion.  A seven-fold increase. What is different is that much of the benefits budget is demand-led and harder to predict than spending on public services.   That is, you can forecast fairly accurately what it's going to cost to employ police officers and teachers, and how much it will cost to build a given road or hospital. But benefits are claimed by people when they become eligible for them, and if they know how to claim. That eligibility changes as the labour market flexes. And claim rates change when governments and others draw attention entitlements. The Scottish government - and who could argue with this? - wants to be open about entitlements, and humane in the way people are assessed. But that comes at a cost, and it's one which is illustrated in the latest report by the Scottish Fiscal Commission. The small changes to devolved welfare spending so far include a new grant for Pregnancy and Baby Care. Eligibility included parents whose children were recently born, so there was catching up to do. The previous, equivalent grant had 4,000 applications in Scotland in a year. Helped by social media marketing, the newly-designed Scottish grant got 4,000 applications in its first day. In its first year, the benefit cost 67% more than had been expected. The total was a small sum in the greater scheme of things. But it illustrates the risks of a demand-led system, when ministers want to sound, and to be, relatively generous.  That £3.5bn of extra budget may not meet raised expectations. And if not carefully forecast and managed, responding to the demand could eat into budgets for other spending departments. A further element of uncertainty in tax revenue is VAT.  Holyrood is not getting powers to set and collect it, but to have assigned to its budget the amount that is calculated to be raised in Scotland each year. That should come to more than £6bn. The formula for calculating the VAT due to Scotland has been agreed between governments. But the data to plug into that formula is far from robust. Experts have been saying for months what Derek Mackay now acknowledges - that there's too much risk attached to the methodology, when small adjustments can have colossal effects, by the hundreds of millions of pounds. It looks like VAT assignment is on hold. To plug looming gaps, the Scottish government has borrowing powers, but these are constrained within the terms of the new devolution arrangements. Even if they were not, they would be constrained by the operations of the bond markets - as the SNP's Sustainable Growth Commission sought to explain to gung-ho enthusiasts for winning independence and going on a borrowing spree. The current borrowing powers are being deployed, for capital projects. They can't cover the scale of the gap in spending that results from these block grant adjustments, or consolidations.  So tough decisions lie ahead - tax increases, spending cuts, spending postponements, or a firmer push on public sector efficiency through reform. Is this a special problem for Scotland? It's clearly new, and within the UK's financial set-up, it's got unusual dimensions. But it's more about Scotland joining the world in which governments have to make choices about taxation and to live with the consequences.  At 20 years of age, the Scottish Parliament may not have reached the independence some wish for it, but it is reaching the age of far greater maturity."
Bond Market Forecast,Are markets signalling that a recession is due?,2024-09-14,2019-08-14,By Andrew Walker,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49346972,"Financial markets have flashed a warning sign about the economic outlook for the UK and the US.  It is known in the jargon as an ""inverted yield curve"". It means that it is cheaper for those countries' governments to borrow for 10 years than for two.  It is an unusual development and it often comes before a recession or at least a significant slowdown in economic growth. Wall Street shares plunged on Wednesday, as investors' concerns about a potential recession were stoked by the news. The main US stock market indexes fell between 2.3% and 2.6%. Meanwhile in Europe London's FTSE 100 slipped 1.4%, Germany's Dax lost 2.2% and the French Cac 40 fell by 2.1%. This warning sign is coming from the bond market, the place where governments and companies go to borrow money by selling bonds.  A bond is a promise to make certain payments in the future, usually a large one when the bond ""matures"" and smaller ones in the interim, typically every six months.  How much investors pay for the bond determines the yield they will get - the higher the price, the lower the yield.  One factor affecting the yield that investors want is how long they have to wait for the big final payment.  Usually, a longer wait means they expect a higher yield.  It compensates them for tying their money up for longer, when there is more risk that unexpected inflation could erode the value of their returns.  What is unusual is that the yield on UK government bonds (gilts, as they are known) with two years to maturity went above the yield on the 10-year equivalent. The same thing happened in the US.  It is seen as a sign that investors want the assured returns from holding a longer-term bond and are worried about the shorter-term outlook for the economy.  Is the inverted yield curve reliable? According to economists at the US Federal Reserve: ""Periods with an inverted yield curve are reliably followed by economic slowdowns and almost always by a recession.""  The time between the inversion and the onset of a recession is, however, not uniform.  That said, there is something about the current situation that didn't apply to earlier episodes: quantitative easing, the policy pursued by many central banks after the financial crisis (and before, in the case of Japan) of buying financial assets, mainly government bonds.  That had the effect of raising bond prices - which, remember is equivalent to reducing the yield from them.  So QE may well be making a contribution to the yield curve inversion that is taking place now.  The yield curve inversion does not tell us anything about what might be the specific reasons for any impending recession.  This time, there are several possible candidates out there.  The global trade conflict is a factor for many economies. Concerns held by many (though by no means all) businesses and investors about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit are a UK-specific issue that may be contributing.  The UK has just recorded one quarter of declining economic activity, so the idea of an imminent recession is not at all fanciful, although the figures have been influenced by stockpiling ahead of planned Brexit dates and the subsequent rundown of those stocks.  In the US, it would take a significant further slowdown to produce a recession.  Germany has also registered a quarter of declining activity, according to new figures, so a recession could be under way there too.  The yield curve for the German government is not inverted. But there is something else about government bonds there that is a clearly sign of a weak economic outlook: the fact that yields are below zero.  In effect, investors pay the government to lend to it.  That reflects the ultra-low interest rate policy of the European Central Bank, but it is also a sign of a weak economic outlook.  "
Bond Market Forecast,Scottish economy facing 'subdued' growth,2024-09-14,2017-12-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-42352146,"Scotland's economy is facing ""subdued"" growth over the next five years, according to the Scottish Fiscal Commission. The independent body has predicted the Scottish economy will grow at less than 1% per year until 2022. Its five-year forecast suggests GDP growth will be 0.7% in both 2017 and 2018, rising to 1.1% in 2022. It said the outlook was ""driven by slow productivity growth and exacerbated by demographic challenges"". The commission's economic forecasts were published alongside the Scottish government's draft budget for the first time. In its report, the body estimated that the taxes now devolved to Scotland would raise almost £16bn in the next financial year. However, it said the economic outlook impacted on forecasts of income tax revenue, with the prediction for 2018-19 being revised down from £12.3bn to £12.1bn. Included in that figure is the Scottish government's new five-band income tax system, which the commission said would raise an additional £164m in 2018-19, rising to £199m by 2022-23. The report said it expected that new relief for first-time buyers would reduce Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) revenue by £6m in 2018-19. It also estimated that policies on non-domestic rates announced in the draft budget would reduce tax revenues in 2018-19 by £96m. What is the Scottish Fiscal Commission? The commission was established on a non-statutory basis in June 2014 to scrutinise the Scottish government's devolved tax forecasts.  In April this year, it became a non-ministerial department, structurally and operationally independent of the Scottish government.  It is now responsible for producing independent forecasts for Scotland on issues such as tax revenues, expenditure on social security and onshore Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It works closely with the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility, Revenue Scotland, the Scottish government, HMRC and other bodies. Commissioners are accountable to and give evidence to the Scottish Parliament. It is chaired by Susan Rice, whose previous roles have included chairwoman and chief executive of Lloyds TSB Scotland and senior vice-president at NatWest Bancorp in New York.  She has also been a member of the Scottish government's Council of Economic Advisers. Current roles include chairwoman of Scottish Water and president of the Scottish Council of Development and Industry. The commission said: ""The growth that has been achieved in some recent years has been driven by factors which include a boom in the construction industry, strong labour market growth, a falling savings ratio and support from the oil and gas industry.  ""These factors are unlikely to continue to support growth to the same extent in the coming years."" The report also said: ""Future downside risks include the UK's changing relationship with the EU, a weakening outlook for global trade, Scotland's industrial and demographic structure and weak onshore demand linked to activity in the oil and gas industry. ""In combination, this means limited increases in average earnings and a more modest outlook for employment growth in the coming years compared to the recent past."" The Fraser of Allander economic institute said the commission's five-year growth forecast was ""arguably the big story of the budget"". Director Prof Graeme Roy said: ""The independent body predicts that growth in Scotland will remain below 1% to 2021, well below Scotland's average growth rate since the early 1960s.  ""Despite this weak outlook for growth in the economy, the commission's forecasts for tax revenue growth are more optimistic, enabling Mr Mackay to offset a reduction in the resource block grant from Westminster through a targeted income rise focused on higher earners.""  Professional services firm KPMG said the forecasts made for ""extremely sobering reading"". Jenny Stewart, head of government and infrastructure for KPMG in Scotland, said: ""The outlook forecasts economic growth in Scotland at 0.7% in 2018, only half the forecast UK rate of 1.4%.   ""This rate is much lower than the long-term historic growth rate of 2% in Scotland and suggests a particularly difficult backdrop for businesses making future investment decisions."""
Bond Market Forecast,US inflation accelerates in January,2024-09-14,2018-02-14,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43057242,"US consumer prices rose faster than expected in January, a sign of firming inflation that bolstered expectations of higher interest rates. The Consumer Price Index grew by 0.5% against forecasts of a 0.3% rise. The report followed earlier data showing accelerating US wage growth. That raised concerns the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates faster than previously thought. The report on wages triggered days of volatility on the financial markets.  Bond yields climbed higher on Wednesday, but stock market reaction to the inflation report was relatively muted. After opening lower, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were higher by mid-afternoon. ""The fact that... losses are being trimmed, suggests that the market could be slowly starting to get to grips with the new higher inflation environment reality,"" said Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index. The consumer price index is a different measure of inflation from the one the Federal Reserve typically emphasises. The Commerce Department also reported that US retail sales declined 0.3% in January, an unexpected drop that analysts said made it more difficult to draw a clear picture of the US economy.  Economists have long said they expect higher inflation in the US due to stronger economic growth and low unemployment.  But those expectations were confounded last year, as relatively soft inflation lagged the roughly 2% target set by the Federal Reserve. New data pointing to price and wage increases suggest the dynamics could be changing. On Wednesday, the US Bureau of Labour Statistics said there had been price increases across a number of areas including gasoline, clothing, medical care and food. Over the 12 months to January, inflation remained at 2.1%. The so-called core index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, also increased 0.3% in January - the most significant rise in a year. Jacob Deppe, head of trading at online trading platform Infinox said Wednesday's report showed ""an important, albeit slight"" rise that will intensify policy questions. The Federal Reserve uses higher rates to curb inflation and has said it expects to raise rates this year. Investors worry that the bank could move too aggressively, triggering higher borrowing costs for companies and consumers that choke economic growth. New policies, including tax cuts approved last year and increased government spending, further complicate the situation, adding to the inflationary pressures. ""The fear is the Fed hikes too far, too fast,"" Mr Deppe said. ""US monetary policy will have to walk a tightrope in order not to kill off growth, while steering a path towards normal economic conditions."""
Bond Market Forecast,"BT cuts 13,000 jobs to slash costs",2024-09-14,2018-05-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44065422,"BT is to cut 13,000 jobs over three years, about 12% of its workforce, as it seeks to slim down its management and back-office roles. The telecoms giant said that the job cuts and other measures would help it to reduce costs by £1.5bn. It added that it would be hiring about 6,000 employees to ""support network deployment and customer service"". A third of the job reductions will come from outside the UK in its Global Services division. Last year, BT was forced to write down the value of the Italian part of Global Services after an accounting scandal that cost the firm more than £500m. The company also said it intended to move out of its existing central London headquarters and into smaller premises.  BT forecast a fall in revenue of about 2% for the 2018-19 financial year. It also said it was keeping its full-year dividend unchanged from last year at 15.4p a share and would freeze it for the next two years. Shares in BT fell nearly 8% in early trading.  Philippa Childs, national secretary of the Prospect union, said the announcement was ""a devastating blow to managers and professionals represented by Prospect"". She said Prospect had been working closely with BT on looking at the impact of organisational changes, but the number of job cuts sounded ""unrealistic"". BT said it was responding to changes in the telecoms market, including ""increasing competitive intensity from established companies and new entrants"". ""It is critical that BT transforms its operating model to build a lean and agile organisation that delivers sustained improvement in customer experience and productivity,"" it said. The announcements came as BT disclosed that its annual pre-tax profits rose 11% to £2.6bn in the year to March. The firm also announced a 13-year plan to plug its £11.3bn pension fund deficit, including regular payments into the scheme and a bond issue. Chief executive Gavin Patterson said BT was in a unique position: ""We have the UK's leading fixed and mobile access networks, a portfolio of strong and well segmented brands, and close strategic partnerships. ""This position of strength will enable us to build on the disciplined delivery and risk reduction of the last financial year, a period in which we delivered overall in line with our financial and operational commitments whilst addressing many uncertainties."" George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the job cuts and HQ move were ""drastic actions"", but added that they ""still aren't going to be enough to dig BT out the hole it's in"".  ""The dividend, which was rising 10% a year not so long ago, is set to freeze for the foreseeable future, and next year's profits look likely to fall again,"" he added. ""There are silver linings here and there. For example, EE and the consumer businesses continue to grow. However, these improvements are being more than offset by challenging conditions elsewhere.  ""Openreach terms are getting tougher, and the business-to-business and global divisions are having a torrid time. Gavin Patterson will have his work cut out if he's to steady the ship.""  BT's share price has halved over the past two years. Investors have become less convinced about the company's ability to make them money, after an accounting scandal, a profits warning and a regulatory fine.  BT clearly thinks it has too many staff doing jobs not needed in the digital world. Its wide-ranging corporate shake-up is an attempt to simplify the business, to squeeze more profit out of each pound it spends.  It's under pressure to pump more money into fibre optic and super-fast mobile networks and to fill the black hole in its pension scheme. It has made more efforts on those fronts today.  Thousands of new hires will be engineers and cyber-experts, focusing not on copper cables, but on building the physical and mobile networks of the future. It's also trying to improve its customer service and mend relations with the regulator.  It's a big job, turning a former monopoly into a consumer-focused TV and phone company. Shares are down sharply, suggesting investors are yet to be convinced by BT's plan."
Bond Market Forecast,Qantas accelerates cost cuts as $1.5bn loss looms,2024-09-14,2021-05-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57181224,"Qantas has announced new cost-cutting measures to help it deal with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The Australian carrier also said it would report an annual loss before tax of more than $1.5bn (A$2bn, £1.1bn). But it added that its debt pile had peaked and was likely to fall as domestic travel was on track to hit pre-pandemic levels. Qantas said its international division was losing about $2.3m a week, down from $3.9m last month.  Its latest cost-cutting plans include a two-year wage freeze, slashing travel agents' commissions for international flights and offering voluntary redundancies to cabin crew in its international business. Separately on Wednesday, the parent company of rival Singapore Airlines revealed a record annual loss of S$4.27bn ($3.2bn) - worse than the average S$3.27bn forecast predicted by eight analysts, said a Reuters report.  In a statement on Tuesday, Qantas said it sees more positive times ahead as a rebound in domestic travel to near-normal levels would help it to continue to cut its debts. ""The fact we're making inroads to the debt we needed to get through this crisis shows the business is now on a more sustainable footing,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said in a statement. ""The main driver is the rebound of domestic travel, which now looks like it will be bigger than it was pre-COVID, at least until international borders re-open."" Qantas added that its international division was losing about $2.3m a week, down from $3.9m last month, due to the opening of a travel bubble with New Zealand and robust demand for its cargo services. The airline has pushed back the sale of international tickets, with the exception of New Zealand, to December after the Australian government said it was unlikely to open its borders to widespread travel until the middle of next year. Qantas shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange rose after today's announcement. Separately on Wednesday, the owner of Singapore's national airline revealed the biggest loss in its 74-year history. The $3.2bn loss was far bigger than last year's $159m loss, the first time the company had ever fallen into the red. The firm also announced a $4.65bn bond sale to help to bolster its finances in the face of the Covid-19 crisis. Singapore Airlines, which has no domestic market, has been one of the world's hardest hit carriers during the pandemic, alongside its Hong Kong-based rival Cathay Pacific. On Monday, a planned travel bubble between Hong Kong and Singapore was postponed for a second time after a spike in cases in Singapore."
Bond Market Forecast,PM rebuffs calls to bring forward watchdog's analysis,2024-09-14,2022-09-30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63089314,"Prime Minister Liz Truss is resisting calls to bring forward publication of the independent fiscal watchdog's assessment of her tax plans.  The PM said she was ""committed"" to publishing the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast on 23 November, the same day the chancellor is due to set out further economic plans. Some Conservative MPs want this sooner to reassure financial markets. The Treasury argues it should wait until additional changes are announced. These ""supply side"" changes to stimulate growth are expected to include measures in eight areas - business regulation, agriculture, housing and planning, immigration, mobile and broadband, financial services, childcare, and energy.  Last week, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng set out some of the government's tax and spending plans - including support for people facing high energy bills and a surprise announcement that it would scrap the 45% highest tax band for high earners.  However, his mini-budget was not accompanied by a forecast from the OBR, something which helped to fuel market turmoil.  In the days following the announcement, the pound slumped against the dollar and the Bank of England was forced to spend £65bn to protect pension funds. After a meeting between Ms Truss, Mr Kwarteng and the OBR on Friday morning, the government confirmed the rest of its economic plans would be published on 23 November, alongside an OBR forecast. The Treasury will receive the OBR's first draft on 7 October, but that will not be made public.  Some of Ms Truss's own MPs have raised concerns about the timetable.  Waveney MP Peter Aldous said the timing of last Friday's plan had been ""hopelessly wrong"", and the rest of the details should be brought forward to October. Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown said moving the date forward would give international markets and his constituents ""reassurance"".  Elsewhere Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey argued that the government, by waiting until 23 November, was allowing the UK economy to ""fly blind"" for two months.  ""Families and businesses can't afford to wait any longer for this government to fix their botched, unfair budget,"" he said.  Defending the decision not to publish an OBR forecast after the mini-Budget last Friday, Ms Truss said she had wanted to announce support for energy bills quickly and that ""in that timescale"" there could not be a full OBR forecast. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is the independent watchdog for the government's finances.  It usually produces economic forecasts twice a year, to accompany each autumn budget and spring statement.  It scrutinises government plans, to increase taxes or borrowing for example, and predicts what the likely impact on the overall economy will be. These forecasts are so important because a strong one gives investors confidence to put money into the UK economy - whereas a weak one is likely to have the opposite effect. The government can request forecasts from the OBR at any time to get independent advice on big moves. But it did not take the OBR up on its offer ahead of last week's mini-budget. This is thought to have undermined confidence in the markets. This led to the pound dropping to its lowest rate against the dollar in 37 years on Monday, before returning to its previous level. In recent days, the Conservatives have posted some of their worst opinion poll ratings in more than 20 years. A poll published on Thursday by Survation put the party on 28%, more than 21 points behind Labour, while a separate survey by YouGov put the Tories on 21%, 33 points adrift.  Labour's shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said ministers should ""get back to Parliament, revoke the changes, and start again to try and rebuild confidence"". And Conservative MP Martin Vickers urged the prime minister not to scrap the 45p tax rate and the bankers' bonus cap, describing the move as ""a political own goal"".  However, another Tory backbencher, Andrea Leadsom, said the mini-budget was ""unashamedly pro-growth"", and that the markets were ""wrong to be jittery"" about the changes."
Bond Market Forecast,Taxing times for Scottish ministers,2024-09-14,2023-10-17,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-67131032,"Britain's public finances are getting tighter, putting constraints on the rhetoric from party political conferences.  Yet there's not so much talk about the pressures for increased taxes next spring. A year out from the likely date of the next Westminster election, the Lib Dems pulled back from their conventional promise to out-tax others with a penny for health or education.  Tories in Manchester were, we were told, under pressure from the party right to offer tax cuts. It seemed hard to believe a fortnight ago, and moreso now, that the person with the audacity to lead the tax-cutting right was Liz Truss.  The Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, was resisting such conference crowd-pleasing promises, at least until next year. His signal has been of a much tighter public spending outlook since government borrowing costs rose steeply. Markets are pricing in an expectation of a more prolonged battle to bring down inflation, meaning sustained higher interest rates. A lot depends on the strength or weakness of China's recovery. But the military, diplomatic and humanitarian tinder box on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean is not helping to reassure. The Institute of Fiscal Studies has set out budget options today, saying the UK government is in a ""horrible fiscal bind"", as borrowing costs eat up a much bigger share of tax revenue.  It is arguing neither spending increases nor tax cuts look sustainable.  In Liverpool, the Labour mantra was about changes that don't cost much, such as bulldozing planning constraints in England. The fiscal message from the Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves, is that change can be funded by getting more tax out of rich foreigners and VAT on private school fees - in other words, someone else, probably not like you. And so the tax and spend roadshow reaches the northern parts of Aberdeen, feeling the cold blasts of both Arctic air and further constraints ahead. The previews of Humza Yousaf's first leadership speech to his autumn conference, on Tuesday, suggest he wants to put the economy ""front and centre"" of the case for independence, but also show that he's returning to one of Holyrood's favourite habits, of distributing more cash to the NHS. The first part of that will be worth watching: the economic case for independence has been where its opponents have sought to focus their attacks, because that's where they sense weakness. ""Improved living standards"" are on offer. That much has long been asserted, but not so much about the connection between independence and faster economic growth, or explaining which levers get pulled to make it happen.  Higher or lower taxes? More or less regulation? A bigger or smaller state? The thrust of the argument of late has rarely gone much further than 'other countries can, so why not us?' Whatever the rhetoric in Aberdeen, it is nearer term decisions on taxation and spending which are likely to dominate Bute House cabinet thinking for this winter. They are looking at the long legacy of Covid, at inflation squeezing public services, and signals from the Chancellor and Treasury suggest their block grant will be even tighter than previously thought. The recent mid-year changes to this year's budget have provided a glimpse of what may be to come when finance secretary Shona Robison has recovered from Covid and returned to the file marked 'budget planning' with only two months until publishing it in draft.  Re-instating a cut to the arts and culture budget, after it had previously been removed, was a politically painful way to send that message.  It's long been puzzling why the SNP has not chosen to get more Scottish identity bang out of relatively small amounts of cultural buck.  The Scottish Parliament's research service noted earlier in summer: ""There has been a long-term trend of reducing real terms spend on culture in some areas of Scottish government funding and local government... spending on culture has not been a budget priority"".  The queue for more funds is long and loud. The continuing pay battle with school staff is one of several brush fires in public sector pay which can be extinguished with settlements, but within a tightly constrained spending envelope, these come at growing cost to others. Councils are often on the front line of these battles and cuts, but they will seek to share that challenge with Scottish ministers. North Lanarkshire's decision last month to shut 39 community facilities including leisure centres and libraries was reversed early this month, but that surely won't be the end of the story in that council area or elsewhere. On the conference agenda for Aberdeen are reminders of the profound problems affecting island transport, and pressure from north-east branches to make good on the promises to improve its road network. In his speech, Humza Yousaf is pledging big funds to reduce NHS waiting lists. There are ever more strident warnings about policing levels. Colleges are looking at redundancies, with limited hope they can avoid sackings or sharply reduced course options. That is one of the sectors on which Audit Scotland, the official spending watchdog, has issued numerous warnings about unsustainable finances. Its boss, the Auditor General, is now issuing warnings about warnings, seemingly in the hope that they will, eventually, be heeded.  A recent blog set out Stephen Boyle's plans to look in further detail at the cost of reaching the Scottish government's net zero commitments, observing that the easy stuff has already been done. ""The task will directly affect most Scots in a way that just hasn't been experienced yet,"" he wrote.  Having warned in April that targets are unlikely to be hit, he followed up with other UK spending watchdogs telling governments this will require them to work more closely together, citing the cost of disagreement over bottle deposit and return. Next comes an assessment of the enormous task of reducing the carbon footprint of heating homes. The Scottish government's own estimate for residential and non-residential buildings is £33bn. There's a clue of what to expect in the headline on the Auditor General's blog: 'Tough decisions ahead on climate change'. Among the easier answers is a rise in tax, using the Scottish Parliament's powers, which are limited, and mainly to income tax. It looks easy enough - if the bills are going up, whack up the revenue. And as the first minister has made clear, those who can contribute most should pay more. So the discussion this autumn is about a new tax band, taking more from relatively high earners. One independent group of advisers to the Scottish government, the Poverty and Inequality Commission, is looking to a widening of Holyrood's tax net, to include income from wealth, and a closer look at the possibilities for a direct tax on wealth itself. One of its commissioners, Alex Cobham, says: ""Tax is our social superpower. It allows us to do a variety of things to live in a better society, a more equal and inclusive society, and lead better lives. ""Although progress has been made towards reducing poverty and inequality in Scotland, with the likes of increasing the Scottish Child Payment to £25 per week, we need to see more action from the Scottish government on tax if it is to deliver on its ambitions to meet the 2030 child poverty targets and help all those who are trapped in poverty."" While a panel of external advisers mull Shona Robison's options in private, the Fraser of Allander Institute has run the numbers on two proposals put forward for a new tax band, and poured a lot of caution over the claims being made for them.  One is from the Scottish Trades Union Congress, with the idea of taxing 44 pence in each pound earned between £75,000 and £125,000 - the latter being the rate at which the highest rate is levied. It's claimed this could raise £88m next financial year. But that's a 'static' estimate, assuming taxpayer behaviour does not change in reaction to the higher tax rate. Some people, however, would not be static. They would choose to reduce their working hours, and some would have more incentive to take earnings in forms that are taxed at lower rates by the UK Treasury - for instance, in dividends on business profits. To a lesser extent, the Allander economists at Strathclyde University say the Scottish government should expect some people to withdraw activity from the economy altogether - for instance, if a second home owner removes her holiday home from the rental market. In the first year, that £88m tax take is forecast to decline to £56m. After five years of more people being caught by the £75,000 tax threshold and also more people responding to it, the static tax revenue estimate of £119m becomes £77m. Another proposal comes from the Institute of Public Policy Research in Scotland, a left-leaning think tank arguing for more progressive taxation. It would like to see higher tax at 45p in the pound on earnings above £58,000.  Assuming no behavioural effects, that could bring in a handy £231m next year. But with those effects, Fraser of Allander estimates revenue of £161m. In the fifth year, with thresholds retained, a static tax estimate of £313m becomes £220m when people have responded. Note that very little of this effect seems to be forecast from people choosing to leave Scotland, which tends to be the way behavioural effects are debated. And much of the modelling of this is close to the estimates made by the Scottish Fiscal Commission, which will be telling Ms Robison about the revenue she can expect if she opts for additional tax take from higher earners.  It has already pointed out that the extra revenue from higher income tax rates is offset by a relatively weak tax base, meaning ministers do not have the extra clout they seek. There's a case, therefore, for strengthening the tax base - for instance drawing high earners into Scotland or doing less to alienate them. There's an electoral calculation in this. How many people would be affected from such tax increases, and how much does it matter? The STUC proposal is seen as affecting 161,000 payers, or 6% of those people paying income tax in Scotland. The IPPR option would draw in 234,000, or 10% of the total. Shona Robison could gamble on those people being willing to pay more in exchange for better public services and a fairer outcome with a stronger social contract. Or the deputy first minister could gamble on those people being politically dispensable.  They're less dispensable where these people are the doctors that NHS Scotland needs to retain and recruit. But many of those people are at senior levels of Scottish business. And that's where the budget choices encounter another part of the fiscal and political jigsaw. Humza Yousaf has set out to have a New Deal with Business. Expect to hear more about it this week. It saw some policies jettisoned soon after he took office, but the love-bombing was less evident when tourism groups were campaigning, unsuccessfully, to pause and rethink the licensing of self-catering and bed and breakfast businesses.  Business responds not only to tax structures but to tax trends. If directors can see more is going to be demanded of high earners in future, it is a disincentive to invest in Scotland and grow a business. Business leaders are warning of other indications that higher tax bills will weigh on corporate profit. David Lonsdale, of the Scottish Retail Consortium, wrote in The Herald recently about Scotland's political parties edging towards more powers for councillors to wield, both to improve council revenue and local accountability. A tourist tax, or transient visitor levy, is already on the way, with the industry demanding that it has to be spent on improving circumstances in which they operate. Workplace parking charges are an option. Council tax faces an increase in bills paid by those in more valuable homes (on a valuation now an increasingly absurd 32 years out of date).  Critics of council tax, also because it is regressive and loads a relatively high burden on to lower income households, want to see it replaced rather than tinkered with. Mr Lonsdale warns his members of Scottish Greens' intentions along those lines. He also warns of change to business rates. These are already seen as a heavy burden on bricks and mortar businesses which compete with much lower-taxed digital firms, notably in retail. But what if councils took charge of setting them? The retailer representative looks to the experience of that in Northern Ireland, and sees councils taking the opportunity to raise business rates steeply. Their primary interest is in balancing the council books, less in growing the economy. Do such tax increases fit with the intention being set out by the SNP leader at his Aberdeen conference to focus on the economy and raise standards of living?  Probably not. Getting the books to balance isn't so difficult, if you pull some tax levers, hope for the best, and ignore the impact on economic growth and investment prospects.  But higher tax bills for households and for businesses are rarely, if ever, associated with improved prospects for economic growth - unless other measures can be deployed to spark life into Scotland's stalled economy."
Bond Market Forecast,Markets braced for Yellen at Jackson Hole,2024-09-14,2017-08-24,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41042025,"The world's most powerful central bankers are gathering for their annual meeting at Jackson Hole in Wyoming. Janet Yellen, whose term as US Federal Reserve chair ends in February, is due to speak on Friday. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi will also give a speech at the conference. Stock market investors will scrutinise their speeches for hints on monetary policy and the outlook for interest rates. It could be Ms Yellen's last appearance at Jackson Hole. President Donald Trump has said National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn is a candidate to replace Ms Yellen, who also could be reappointed. Bank of England deputy governor for monetary policy Ben Broadbent will attend the conference, although governor Mark Carney will not be there. Mr Broadbent is a contender to succeed Mr Carney when he steps down in June 2019. The Fed remains the only major central bank to have begun raising rates in recent years.  It is also seeking to cut the huge amounts of government bonds it has built up while pumping cash into the US economy through quantitative easing. Markets will also be waiting to see if Mr Draghi gives any more indications of when the ECB will start to reduce its own bond-buying programme. The recent strengthening of the euro has brought more uncertainty into the timing of the move. In the global financial crisis central bankers stepped in to shore up flagging markets and business investment by loosening monetary policy. However, Allianz chief economic advisor Mohamed El-Erian told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was time for central bankers to ""step back"". ""Central banks had no choice but to step in with these experimental policies, starting in 2010 for the Federal Reserve, because other policy-makers were not stepping up to their economic responsibilities,"" he said. ""So the Fed, and then the ECB later on, went from focusing on normalising markets to taking, singlehandedly, responsibility for promoting economic growth."" But Mr El-Erian said while the Fed had bought ""time for the economy to heal"", it was now time for the political system to ""get its act together"". He said the policies, while beneficial, also came at the cost of financial markets getting used to central bank support. ""Yes, the time has come for [central banks] to step back. They have to do it very slowly, and very carefully, and the biggest hope is that someone will step in - and that means other policy-making entities,"" Mr El-Erian added."
Bond Market Forecast,Investors nervous as market sell-off intensifies,2024-09-14,2022-10-12,By Daniel Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63230008,"The turmoil on UK financial markets has intensified after the Bank of England insisted its emergency bond-buying scheme would come to an end this week.  The cost of government borrowing over 10 years briefly surged to its highest level since 2008, as investors demanded higher returns to lend to the UK.  The Bank has been buying government bonds to prevent a sell-off which could put some pension schemes at risk. On Wednesday it stressed this help would end on Friday come what may.  The Bank first stepped in last month after promises of huge, unfunded tax cuts in the chancellor's ""mini-budget"" sparked a dramatic reaction on financial markets.  The pound hit a record low and bond prices fell sharply, forcing the Bank to promise to buy up to £65bn of government bonds to support their price. So far it has only spent around £10bn of this pledged amount. But while the intervention initially worked, bond yields - in other words the interest rates the government pays to investors - are now close to or above the highs seen straight after the mini-budget.  On Wednesday, government borrowing costs over 20 and 30 years both hit their highest levels since 2002. The Bank increased bond-buying in response as it battled the sell-off.  The pound remained stable at $1.10 against the US dollar. The movements came after Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey bluntly told pensions funds they had ""three days left now and you've got to sort it out"". Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index, said ""those words seemed to hit the market quite hard"" with the pound falling. If there is further market turmoil on Monday after the Bank pulls out on Friday, ""Andrew Bailey has put himself in a very tight corner there"", she said. ""If this does all break loose on Monday, and we have a very risky financial position, what are the Bank of England going to do? And I think they will need to step in."" Investor concerns about the mini-budget were heightened by the lack of a forecast by the independent financial watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). However, on Wednesday Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg told ITV's Robert Peston that the OBR's ""record of forecasting accurately hasn't been enormously good"" and that ""there are other sources of information"". He also hit back at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which had openly criticised the government's tax cut plans, saying they were likely to increase inequality, and that the plans would ""complicate the fight"" against soaring prices. He said: ""I think the IMF is wrong on both counts. I think it's particularly wrong on energy, and frankly doesn't know what it's talking about. ""The IMF is not holy writ and the IMF likes having a pop at the UK for its own particular reasons. I'm afraid I would never lose too much sleep about the IMF."" The UK government raises money it needs for spending by selling bonds - a form of debt that is paid back plus interest in anywhere between five and 30 years. Pension funds invest in bonds because they provide a low but usually reliable return over a long period of time. However, the sharp fall in their value after the mini-budget forced pension funds to sell bonds, threatening to create a ""downward spiral"" in their prices as more were offloaded, which left some funds close to collapse. Earlier, pensions industry body the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association had warned the Bank against the help ending ""too soon"". It suggested the support should be extended until 31 October, when chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is due to detail his economic plan explaining how he will balance the public finances. The statement will be accompanied by independent forecasts on the prospects for the UK economy. Mr Bailey told the BBC he had stayed up all night to try to find a way to calm markets and said the Bank was doing everything it could to preserve financial stability, but said it had always been clear that the help would be temporary. ""I'm afraid this has to be done, for the sake of financial stability,"" he added. The recent turmoil has fed through to the mortgage market, where hundreds of products have been suspended as the volatility has made it difficult for lenders to know how to price these long-term loans. Last week, interest rates on typical two and five-year fixed rate mortgages topped 6% for the first time in over a decade. On Wednesday, the Bank said this was likely to put households under severe pressure next year. The number having to spend 70% or more of their disposable income on mortgage rates and essentials is set to reach its highest level since before the financial crisis in 2008, it said.  The government has said it remains confident in its tax cut plan, with Mr Kwarteng telling MPs he was ""relentlessly focused on growing the economy"" and ""raising living standards"". But Mr Bailey's words further increase the pressure on the government, and the chancellor, to come up with an economically credible and politically viable debt plan, and quickly. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""This is a Tory crisis that has been made in Downing Street, and that is being paid for by working people."" Former IMF deputy director Mohamed El-Erian told BBC News that the economy was on ""shaky ground"". In its latest World Economic Outlook report on Tuesday, the IMF acknowledged the mini-budget would ""lift growth somewhat in the near term"", although it would ""complicate the fight"" against the cost-of-living crisis."
Bond Market Forecast,How did the crisis affect your finances?,2024-09-14,2018-09-11,By Simon Read & Daniele Palumbo ,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45483636,"Ten years after the financial crisis, and the shockwaves are still being felt on people's finances. Personal debt levels are at record highs and our banks are fast disappearing from the high street. Low interest rate have left savers enduring a decade of paltry returns, but it's never been cheaper for mortgage borrowers. In the changed financial environment, the question to ask is: ""Are my finances fit for the next decade?"" Here, we examine four personal finances areas - homes, savings, borrowing and banking - to discover the lasting legacy of the financial crisis. The average UK house price fell from a pre-crisis peak of £190,032 in September 2007 to a low of £154,452 in March 2009, according to data from the Office for National Statistics and the Land Registry. Since then, the price of an average house has recovered to £228,384. Is that good news for homeowners? Not necessarily. There's no such thing as an average house, and for homeowners there's been a real north-south divide in the last decade in terms of property prices.  Londoners and those in the south-east have seen prices soar, but elsewhere in the country, the picture is much different. Richard Donnell, insight director at Hometrack, said: ""Although a decade has passed since the crash, house prices have still not recovered back to the levels seen in 2008 in many markets across Britain.  ""Northern Ireland and parts of northern England, Scotland and Wales are the areas most affected. House prices continued to fall in the markets most affected for up to four years after 2008 as demand for housing was impacted by tighter credit availability and weak economic growth."" In the capital, house prices started to bounce back strongly in 2010 on rising employment and increasing numbers of overseas investors, he said. It means the whole of the London housing market has house prices that are more than 50% higher than 2008 levels. What will happen next? Experts reckon prices will continue to rise but by less than in the last decade, and much less so in London.  The UK Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted property price growth will fall to 2.4% by the end of 2019, while estate agents Strutt & Parker have predicted a 2.5% rise a year over the next two years. Meanwhile, accountants PWC have forecast that average UK house prices will rise by 4% a year until 2025. For Britain's savers, the last decade has been a disaster, especially those that had enjoyed decent returns in the years before. In fact. £1,000 tucked away in a savings account a decade before the crash would have yielded a healthy £652 in interest. But anyone who stashed £1,000 in an account in the last ten years would have earned interest of just £149. That's because in September 2008, the average deposit account paid interest of 3.1%, according to Bank of England data. That now stands at 0.43%.  Ten years ago you could get 5% on instant access savings, more than 6% on a one-year bond and 7% on a five-year bond from well-known established high street names. Now the best rates are nowhere near as generous, with just 1.35% offered on instant access, 2.05% for one year and 2.70% for five years. According to James Blower, founder of The Savings Guru, around 30 new banks and 40 new providers have entered the savings market since the crash.  ""The best interest rates almost entirely come from these new providers,"" he said. Yet the traditional big financial institutions still hold around 85% of savings in the UK, with many savers' loyalty repaid by getting little or no interest on their nest-eggs. Hargreaves Lansdown analysis suggests there has been a huge rise in the amount of money held in accounts paying no interest in the last decade, from £48bn in September 2008 to £164bn today.  ""While the value of the savings market has continued to grow around 5% a year to more than £1.5tn, the new entrants have taken much of the growth in the market, rather than make significant progress against the big players,"" said Mr Blower. But things could improve soon, predicted Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""At this point, savers have reason to be marginally more optimistic about the future,"" she said. ""That's because the regulator is looking more closely at how the industry functions, in an effort to protect savers from the lowest rates."" Average household debt has climbed from less than £3,000 to £4,000 in the last decade. There are lots of reasons for this, not least the easy credit that is available through plastic cards. Credit card companies have been competing to offer ever-longer interest-free periods to attract customers. In 2008 the longest 0% balance transfer was 15 months. Today, it is 36 months, although at one stage it reached a record high of 43 months.  Analyst Andrew Hagger, of Moneycomms,co.uk, said: ""I'm not sure this is a good thing for all. Some savvy customers have moved balances around and paid little or no interest but others have struggled to repay their debt when their 0% deal ended - so are now being charged 20% APR or more."" He said it was one reason why personal debt levels have risen. ""It's been easy and cheap money a-plenty over the last decade but paying it back will prove to be a long and costly struggle for some."" Overdrafts have also changed in the last decade. Most banks have changed the way they charge, moving from charging by a traditional interest rates to either daily or monthly fees. ""Providers have proclaimed that daily fees are easier to understand,"" said Mr Hagger. ""That may be true, but at the same time they are also much more expensive for customers and a big profit driver."" The simple truth is that the way to reduce debt is to pay it off as quickly as you can and ignore the temptation of easy credit. With interest rates on the rise, what seems manageable debt now can quickly spiral into problems. There's a completely different banking landscape from 10 years ago, not least because traditional players have been busy closing branches. But at the same time the crisis marked the beginning of the entry of a whole new range of challenger banks.  Back in 2008, the most likely challengers looked set to be the supermarkets, Tesco and Sainsbury's. Now the biggest challenge to traditional banking comes from branch-free app banks, such as Starling or Monzo.  Julian Skan, senior managing director in banking at Accenture Strategy, said: ""Wider competition is now coming from platform players, which didn't exist ten years ago, and who have greater opportunities to bite at banking revenues."" But he warned that computer attacks are likely to increase in the years ahead, bringing a fresh challenge. ""Resiliency in the face of growing cyber risks is the new threat,"" Mr Skan said. But there also needs a change in outlook, according to Bevis Watts, managing director of ethical challenger Triodos Bank UK. He said: ""The pace of change has been far too slow and more needs to be done to re-purpose banking for good, through greater transparency on how money is used, carbon disclosure, impact reporting and using risk capital weightings to account for environmental and societal risks."" In other words, banks need to respond to the changing demands from customers in the next decade."

Bond Market Forecast,ECB forecasts higher eurozone growth,2024-09-14,2017-06-08,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40201571,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has increased its forecasts for economic growth in the eurozone but kept interest rates on hold. ECB president Mario Draghi also hinted that there was no need to cut rates further. He told a press conference: ""We are now confident that inflation will converge with our objectives."" The ECB now expects growth across the eurozone to be 1.9% in 2017 compared with its March forecast of 1.8%. It also increased its growth projection for 2018 to 1.8% from 1.7%, and for 2019 to 1.7% from 1.6%. Mr Draghi said: ""The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are considered to be broadly balanced"". This was a marked change from his comments in April, which described the risks to growth as ""tilted to the downside"". Meanwhile the ECB has downgraded its outlook for inflation to 1.5% in 2017, from 1.7%. It also revised its inflation outlook for the following years to 1.3% in 2018, and 1.6% in 2019 as against 1.6% and 1.7% respectively. The ECB targets inflation of close to, but below, 2%.  Aberdeen Asset Management Senior Investment Manager Patrick O'Donnell said:""The ECB is essentially in a holding pattern, waiting for more positive inflation data to come in.  ""There's no appetite to risk choking off the growth that the economy has been seeing of late. Doing nothing is probably the right decision at the moment."" Earlier on Thursday, the Eurostat statistics agency said the eurozone economy had grown at its fastest rate in a year during the January-to-March quarter. At that rate, the 19 countries that use the euro would see growth at 2.3% this year, nearly double the rate of the US, which is on course to grow 1.2%. Mr Draghi said the recovery was due to a pick-up in investment and corporate profitability, gains in employment and the global recovery supporting trade and euro area exports.  However, he added that growth prospects were being dampened by ""a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms"". Mr Draghi said that the ECB would continue its stimulus programme buying bonds, adding that the ""ECB will be in the market for a long time"".  The ECB started buying government and corporate bonds in its quantitative easing (QE) programme in March 2015, starting at a rate of 80bn euros a month and then reducing it to 60bn euros.  Mr Draghi said it had made huge difference to lending across the eurozone: ""Financing conditions remain extremely favourable, and this is because of QE. The pass-through of our monetary policy has never been so effective as it is today."" The bond buying programme is expected to top 2 trillion euros by the year end, and its current interest rates mean that banks have to pay a deposit rate of 0.4% to park their funds with the ECB."
Bond Market Forecast,Bank warns it's too early to cut interest rates,2024-09-14,2023-11-02,By Dearbail Jordan & Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67286913,"The UK economy is likely to see zero growth until 2025, while interest rates remain high for longer or rise further, the Bank of England has warned. It came as the Bank left rates on hold for the second time in a row at 5.25%, the highest level in 15 years.  Rishi Sunak has pledged to get the UK growing by the end of the year, but the lower forecasts put this in doubt. Despite the subdued outlook, Bank boss Andrew Bailey said it was ""much too early to be thinking about rate cuts"". However, the Bank expects inflation - the pace at which prices rise - to fall sharply in the coming months. This means the prime minister is on track to meet his promise to halve inflation to about 5% by the end of the year.  Up until September, the Bank of England had raised rates 14 times in a row to tame soaring inflation, which has been squeezing household budgets. It has led to increases in mortgage payments, squeezing borrowers, but also resulting in higher savings rates. ""We will keep interest rates high enough for long enough to make sure we get inflation all the way back to the 2% target,"" said Mr Bailey.  ""We'll be watching closely to see if further rate increases are needed."" The most recent inflation figure was 6.7% in the year to September. The Bank expects it to continue to fall as energy and food price rises ease and predicts that it will remain at around 3% throughout next year, above the 2% target. Mr Bailey told the BBC, however, that if the Israel-Hamas conflict spreads throughout the Middle East, it could have a knock-on effect on energy prices. ""It is a risk, clearly, that any sort of wider disturbance in the Middle East can obviously threaten energy prices, both oil and gas, and we watch that very carefully. So yes, we do see that as a risk going forwards.""   But he said that the conflict - which he described as a ""human tragedy"" - had not resulted in much movement in energy prices yet, describing that as ""obviously encouraging"".  While the Bank is not predicting a recession, it expects zero growth from now, across the whole of next year - when there is likely to be a general election - and into 2025. ""UK economic growth is slowing,"" the Bank said. Mr Bailey described the outlook for UK economic growth as ""subdued"" but he said that the situation was ""not that unusual"". Germany, which is Europe's biggest economy, has slipped in and out of recession.  ""If you look at other countries, you're seeing pretty similar pictures quite frankly and one or two others are in recession at the moment,"" he said. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt promised there would be measures to get Britain growing again when he unveils the government's plans to try and boost the economy in its Autumn Statement later this month.  ""The Autumn Statement will set out how we will boost economic growth by unlocking private investment, getting more Brits back to work, and delivering a more productive British state.""  But Labour said 13 years of ""economic failure"" had ""left working people worse off"", while the Liberal Democrats called the interest rates decision a ""cold comfort for the millions of hard working families"". Mortgage rates have shot up as the Bank of England has put up interest rates. That has affected first-time buyers, people remortgaging and those on variable and tracker deals.  In the UK, the rate on an average five-year, fixed-rate residential mortgage is 5.87%, down slightly from levels seen earlier this year but still high compared with a few years ago. Ebony Cropper from Warrington and her fiancé are saving up for a deposit to buy their first home. But while they are budgeting hard, their rent went up an extra £45 a month in August making the job harder. ""We got engaged this year but then I think [the wedding] has got to wait because it's a big expense as it is for just one day and a house is more important,"" she told the BBC. ""It just feels a bit futile at the moment because your goal [of owning a home] is getting further and further away."" Although interest rates are currently on hold, there is more pain to come from the rate increases we've already seen, warned Dr Anna Valero, fellow at the London School of Economics and a member of the chancellor's economic advisory council. ""Because of the way monetary policy transmits through the economy there is this lag.  ""Since we've had all these previous rate hikes, they still need to be felt - through people who will be renewing mortgages through next year, through businesses seeing increased borrowing costs and then all the implications [from that],"" she told the BBC. 1. Make overpayments. If you still have some time on a low fixed-rate deal, you might be able to pay more now to save later. 2. Move to an interest-only mortgage. It can keep your monthly payments affordable although you won't be paying off the debt accrued when purchasing your house.  3. Extend the life of your mortgage. The typical mortgage term is 25 years, but 30 and even 40-year terms are now available. Read more here"

Bond Market Forecast,Are autumn tax cuts really 'impossible'?,2024-09-14,2023-11-17,By Dharshini David,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67405495,"The nights are drawing in, money for many households is tight - but the chancellor has told people not to expect treats in his Autumn Statement. Jeremy Hunt has said tax cuts are ""virtually impossible"" and instead warned of ""frankly very difficult decisions"".  But are his hands really tied? Is he being forced to be Scrooge rather than Santa? Or is it a matter of choice?  Does it boil down to what the chancellor - any chancellor in the same circumstances - decides? After all, he and the prime minister set the boundaries and their political priorities. Here are some things to contemplate when judging any chancellor's claims:  Almost all rich countries have a set of rules, to maintain credibility with financial markets, but it's the government which sets its own rules. The financial markets - or the bond markets to be more precise - help fund the government's plans. But if they aren't convinced of a government's creditworthiness, or if they are concerned its plans are risky, the interest rate they charge for that funding will go up. So governments want to convince them to lend at affordable rates.  To do that the UK government sets some rules for themselves called fiscal rules. These rules currently include getting the annual deficit down to less than the equivalent of 3% of national income (or GDP) within five years. And secondly making sure that by then, the total debt amassed over the years is falling when measured as a proportion of GDP. Breaching such rules can be costly: the big giveaway in Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-Budget of September 2022 led to a surge in borrowing rates (which also swelled mortgage rates). That's because of market concerns about the implications for inflation and the amount the government would have to borrow. The fiscal rules are self-imposed, but it's the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that assesses if the government is meeting those rules. It produces two forecasts a year of how the economy might perform, based on technical models and assumptions about what will happen to things like energy prices for example. Those models are used to predict what will happen to government finances. Forecasts are a best stab at what might happen in, what has of late been a particularly, uncertain world. They'll differ from other economists' forecasts - but it's the OBR's ones that matter when it comes to assessing the government's projected finances in relation to the rules. A projected shortfall is often referred to as a black hole, any wiggle room is called headroom. As Jeremy Hunt says higher interest rates have been deployed by the Bank of England to fight the recent stubborn bout of inflation. And that has vastly bumped up the government's borrowing costs.  But higher inflation has also delivered the chancellor a boost in revenues from things like VAT and income tax. VAT is a percentage of an item's value, so when things go up in price, the government gets more tax. Also as prices rise, there's pressure to put up wages, then workers get dragged into higher tax brackets - known as fiscal drag - which means the government collects more income tax.  So economists reckon the chancellor could have over £10bn of headroom. But what matters is what the OBR thinks - and even headroom of this size would mean this chancellor has far less to ""play"" with then many of his predecessors in relation to his rules.  Whether and how the government meets its rules, how it uses headroom, depends on its policy choices, the tax and spending plans aligned with its political priorities, as well as on how the economy is performing.  Those choices mean there are trade-offs, winners and losers. So it's not a case of the chancellor unable to ""afford"" to do something or that he ""must"" adopt a particular policy. For example, if he wanted to extend the freeze in fuel duty that would cost £4bn (as the OBR is obliged to assume that duty rises annually). If he didn't have headroom, he could offset that by raising taxes elsewhere or squeezing spending.  Even if the OBR agrees the chancellor has several billions of pounds of headroom, he may not opt to splash it right now. There is after all, a general election looming - and likely a spring Budget beforehand. It might be considered more politically advantageous to dole out sweeteners to voters then. Moreover, if the economy suffers an unexpectedly sharp downturn in the meantime, that could wipe out some of that headroom - potentially leaving the chancellor in the embarrassing position of having to claw back cash to meet his rules. Or, come the spring, there could actually be more headroom; which he may well choose to use up rather than leave as a generous gift to whoever is chancellor following the election. So instead, this Autumn Statement may focus on the key terms and longer-term measures, such as levelling up, boosting the supply of workers, tackling growth, that the government wants to use to frame its election strategy. So a pre-Christmas spree seems unlikely, regardless of your wishlist. That's not to say Mr Hunt won't be tempted to offer around a little platter of canapés, a taster of what could come in the spring. But don't get too distracted by any nibbles served up. Remember, whatever a chancellor says in this or any such speech, tax cuts aren't ""impossible"" -  they've just chosen not to put them on the menu this time. "
Bond Market Forecast,Mortgage lending lowest since 2016 excluding pandemic,2024-09-14,2023-03-29,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65112278,"Mortgage lending in February fell to its lowest level since 2016, excluding the pandemic, the Bank of England has said. But the number of mortgages approved by lenders rose slightly, suggesting the slowdown may be stabilising.   It comes as higher borrowing costs make buying property less affordable. Homeowners borrowed £700m in February, down from £2bn in January, the Bank said. That is the lowest level since April 2016 apart from the Covid crisis. However, mortgage approvals rose to their highest level for three months, climbing to 43,500 in February from 39,600 in January. Karen Noye, a mortgage expert at Quilter, suggested people were still in ""wait-and-see"" mode as borrowing costs remained high. But she said the rebound in approvals meant ""green shoots might be appearing"" in the housing market.  ""It's clear that home-buyers are cautiously returning back to the market in early 2023 after the huge shocks at the back end of last year made many put their house hunts on ice. How this all feeds through to house prices is yet to be seen."" Mortgage rates began to rise last year as interest rates climbed, but they spiked in September after Liz Truss's mini-budget caused panic on financial markets.  Rates have stabilised but remain much higher than they were a few years ago, squeezing people's purchasing power.   It has fed through to house prices, which in the year to February saw their biggest annual fall in more than ten years, according to Nationwide. Nevertheless, the Bank of England forecast that fewer households were likely to struggle to afford mortgage payments this year than previously forecast due to falling energy prices.  In December it warned 670,000 households could face difficulties.  Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest, said buyers were going for smaller homes to reflect their budgets as the ""cost-of-living crunch is still very real"". ""The cost pressures mean buyers simply cannot afford the same properties they could a year ago and must consider smaller or cheaper homes if they want to push ahead with a purchase at this time,"" she said. The mini-budget last autumn sparked market turmoil, with the Bank of England having to step in to stabilise pension funds. It bought up government debt to stop a fire-sale by some pension funds of assets which could have led to their collapse. On Wednesday, the Bank laid out a range of ways pension funds could protect themselves in future, to avoid another crisis. It urged the funds at the heart of last year's crisis - known as Liability Driven Investment funds - to have enough money to withstand a surge in government bond yields, as well as other measures. It came as the Bank of England's committee watching for financial risks said the UK economy had remained resilient, and banking system robust, despite global stresses."
Bond Market Forecast,National winner follows up with double,2024-09-14,2014-04-07,BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/horse-racing/26921908,"Victorious Grand National trainer Dr Richard Newland followed up his Aintree success on Saturday with a double at Market Rasen on Sunday. But he needed a helicopter ride to ensure that he would make the 152-mile journey on time from his Worcestershire yard to the Lincolnshire course. And he had to make the booking two days before Pineau De Re's win at Aintree. ""I booked it on Thursday. And I had to explain it was dependant on our horse winning the National,"" said Dr Newland. ""I've never flown in a chopper in my life before,"" he told BBC Hereford & Worcester. ""But I'd heard a story about AP McCoy doing it the day after he won the National in 2010,, external so that he could pick up some rides the next day. ""All they'd done when they took the booking was to ask me the name of the horse. ""And, when I rang straight after the race, to confirm the booking, they said 'don't worry, it's all fine and we've all backed it too'."" The investment in the helicopter ride proved worthwhile when Dalmo, the 13-8 favourite, made all the running to hose up in the opener, a Lady Riders' Selling Handicap Hurdle ridden by amateur Ali Stirling.

As to the yard's plans for 11-year-old Pineau De Re, Dr Newland admits that he has one eye on the great three-times winner Red Rum's achievement of triumphing in back-to-back Nationals in 1973 and 1974. ""It's not lost on me that the last horse to win the Grand National back to back was Red Rum,"" added the former GP, who has just 12 horses in his hard at Claines, on the outskirts of Worcester. ""We have to find out what the handicapper does to him. ""In the last 13 years, no Grand National winner has won another single race since. ""Lots come back and run good races but it's almost as if they've had their career-defining moment. ""When you've got a horse like this, there's not many races you can line him up at. ""But, if he's sound and well, then we definitely aim to run him next year.""

Motoring organisations have urged drivers to ensure their vehicles were well prepared for the wintry conditions before setting out on their journeys. Steve Crosthwaite, of the Highways Agency, said motorists should check the latest travel advice prior to leaving.  He told BBC News: ""We are using salt to treat the road network and have ploughs and snow blowers on standby if necessary.

The AA said it was responding to about 1,000 breakdowns an hour, with nearly 8,000 reported before lunchtime on Monday. Tasmin Jeff-Johnson, from the RAC, urged motorists to take sensible shoes and a warm coat on any snow-affected journey. She also advised drivers to take a shovel and pieces of old carpet to provide traction in case of breakdown.

Bond Market Forecast,"Inflation spike temporary, says Bank deputy",2024-09-14,2021-07-22,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57922199,"The Bank of England should not relax its efforts to boost the UK's economy despite the forecast of higher inflation this year, deputy governor Ben Broadbent has said. The pick up in the rate of inflation, which the Bank expects to hit more than 3%, is mainly due to temporary rises in goods prices, he said. Economic uncertainties around the pandemic remain, he added. But some Bank policymakers have suggested a change might be needed. Last week, Michael Saunders and deputy governor Dave Ramsden - who are both members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committe (MPC) - said that the time for tighter monetary policy might be approaching. But another MPC member, Jonathan Haskel, said reducing support for the economy was not the right option for the foreseeable future and Catherine Mann, who joins the MPC on 1 September, has warned against curbing stimulus too soon. Rising bills have prompted some headlines warning of a return to an era of high inflation and rate rises.  ""Not so fast"" is the message from one who actually matters. The deputy governor may be just one of the eight (usually nine) strong panel that sets interest rates. But he's usually a good barometer of the mood in the Bank of England. What we're seeing, he indicates may be an adjustment: supply catching up with demand as the economy opens.  There are physical bottlenecks, issues with production and transport of internationally traded goods.  We've focused on spending on goods - a new TV say - rather than services - cinema trips - under lockdowns.  And firms have had to pay more to recruit staff as furlough limits jobseekers.  These, Mr Broadbent says, should settle. The spike in inflation may be temporary.  But it takes interest rates a year or two to have an impact on inflation, and that's the horizon policymakers actually focus on.  What happens then, he says, depends on the labour market.  Will today's higher inflation and skills shortages allow workers to secure sustained pay rises, putting pressure on prices? Or will the end of furlough keep a lid on wages with an influx of jobseekers? There's much uncertainty - but our pay packets may hold the key to the future of interest rates. The UK's central bank has two main tools to control inflation, which is measured by how fast the prices of goods and services rise. One of those tools is setting interest rates, which the Bank does by controlling the rate it charges banks to borrow money. The second tool it uses is creating money digitally to buy government and corporate bonds, which is debt issued by the public and private sector, traded as assets. This is called ""quantitative easing"". The Bank currently has a bond-buying target of £895bn. Mr Broadbent said on Thursday that now is probably not the right time to start paring that support back, despite the recent pick up in inflation. ""While we know it's going to go further over the next few months, I'm not convinced that the current inflation in retail goods prices should in and of itself mean higher inflation 18 to 24 months ahead, the horizon more relevant for monetary policy,"" he said. Most of the inflation in goods prices is down to oil price rises, he said, which is likely to ""fall away"" in the early part of 2022. Pressure will probably remain on goods suppliers even if some of the heat comes out of consumer demand, and there are still risks to global supply chains from Covid outbreaks. Mr Broadbent's comments came as the European Central Bank decided to hold interest rates as they are and gave forward guidance that rates would probably be lower for longer. The Bank of England will give its next decision on UK interest rates on 5 August."
Bond Market Forecast,Interest rates rise again in bid to cool prices,2024-09-14,2022-02-03,Szu Ping Chan,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60197463,"Interest rates have risen for the second time in three months as the Bank of England tries to curb a rapid rise in the cost of living. The hike to 0.5% from 0.25% came as the Bank warned that price rises could speed up. Prices are expected to climb faster than pay, putting the biggest squeeze on household finances in decades. It comes as the chancellor unveiled a support package to help households cope with a 54% jump in energy bills. Rising gas and electricity costs are the main factors pushing up prices across the economy. Inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), is expected to peak at 7.25% in April, and average close to 6% in 2022. This would be the fastest price growth since 1991 and is well above the Bank's 2% target. Despite that, the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has suggested workers need to accept pay restraint, and should not ask for higher wages, in order for inflation to be tamed more quickly.  There are also increasing signs of broader price pressures across the economy. Prices of household appliances such as fridges climbed almost 10% over the past year. Goods shortages also meant retailers were offering fewer bargains in the January sales compared with previous years. Food prices and rents were also likely to creep up in the short term, the Bank warned. Pay increases are not expected to keep pace with rising prices. Post-tax incomes are forecast to fall 2% this year, after taking into account the rising cost of living.  This represents the biggest fall in take-home pay since records began in 1990. Despite this, the Bank said there had been a ""material pick-up in pay settlements"" this year, with the average worker enjoying a 5% pay rise. ""Acute"" staff shortages in sectors such as hospitality, engineering, construction and IT also meant many employers were offering staff ""ad-hoc"" bonuses to keep them. The pandemic meant other workers had retired early, stayed in education or cut down their hours for a better work life balance. The Bank said this had created other labour shortages that could take ""many years to be resolved"". Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said the jobs market was ""extraordinarily tight"", adding that when he speaks to businesses up and down the UK, labour shortages are the ""first, second and third thing people want to talk about"". The Bank's decision to raise interest rates will make borrowing more expensive, potentially hitting some households harder. The Bank cannot do much to ease the energy price shock or rapid price rises in some consumer goods, so it is sticking to its job by trying to keep inflation stable, the Bank's deputy governor for monetary policy Ben Broadbent said. The rates rise coupled with soaring prices will make it more difficult for some people to afford mortgage repayments. Naomi Mellor, a vet who lives in Hatfield with her husband, sold their house in April, but their next purchase fell through, so they're renting. She said rising mortgage rates have had a big impact on what they can afford. ""We're looking at a rise in our energy bills, a rise in our fuel bills and a rise in our mortgage repayments, which altogether is going to contribute to probably £200 to £300 a month more in our monthly bills. ""We're trying to buy a house and the rising mortgage rates have had a big impact on what we can afford and how much we're going to be repaying on a monthly basis,"" she said. The Bank's rates decision will add just over £25 to the typical monthly repayment for people on a tracker mortgage. Those who have a standard variable rate mortgage will pay an extra £15 per month on average. Nearly two million people in the UK have one of these two types of mortgage. While savers will hope for higher returns, many big banks failed to pass on the full increase in December, when interest rates were increased from a record low of 0.1%. The worst squeeze on the income of households since 1990 is what the Bank predicts. Record energy bill rises from April will take inflation to a peak of 7.25% in April, more than treble the Bank's normal target. Some have called it ""Black Thursday"" for living standards. In raising interest rates again and signalling more rate rises in the coming months, and nearly voting for even more on Thursday, the Bank is putting the nation on the couch in an exercise in mass psychology. Inflation rises can be self-fulfilling. If workers, consumers and businesses expect 7% rises to persist, they will pre-emptively put up prices and ask for wage rises that then bring this about. What the Bank is trying to do is to confine what is happening right now to being a one-off shock. To stop the inflation becoming ""ingrained"" as Bank governor Andrew Bailey put it today. There is a presentational issue here. In ordinary circumstances interest rates are raised to temper booming or bubbly growth - to take the punch bowl away from the party. But there is no punch bowl. There is no party. In fact the Bank lowered its forecasts for growth of the economy to 3.75% from 5%, even though Omicron was not as damaging as feared. The Bank's answer is that this series of rate rises will be enough to stop a spiral of inflation, but will not go so high as to kill off the recovery. It is a delicate balancing act indeed. The recent rapid rise in prices led to some members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to call for a bigger rate rise. Four of the nine members voted to increase rates to 0.75% to ward off fears that price rises could become more sustained. The MPC voted unanimously to end new purchases as part of its £895bn bond buying programme to support the economy. The Bank also forecast that the rapid spread of the Omicron Covid variant will hit growth this year. The economy is forecast to stagnate in the first three months of this year, while the Bank also cut its annual growth forecast for 2022 from 5% to 3.75%. Policymakers expect the economy to grow by around 1.25% in 2023. While consumers are expected to dip into their savings to maintain living standards, this is expected to slow down later this year, weighing on growth."
Bond Market Forecast,Nearly 800 mortgage deals pulled amid rates fears,2024-09-14,2023-05-30,Daniel Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65752400,"Nearly 10% of UK mortgage deals have been taken off the market since last week amid concerns about how high interest rates will go, figures show.  Financial data firm Moneyfacts said nearly 800 residential and buy-to-let deals had been pulled as lenders were reassessing their offers. Meanwhile, average rates on two- and five-year fixed deals have also risen. It comes after higher-than-expected inflation figures raised forecasts of how much UK interest rates will go up. Official figures last week showed the UK inflation rate - which charts rising prices - slowed in April by less than expected to 8.7%.   That led to a strong reaction in the markets, with investors now predicting the Bank of England will have to raise interest rates above their current level of 4.5% to as high as 5.5% to try to slow price rises. The change in expectations has led to big movements in prices and interest rates in the bond markets, and this has a knock-on effect on mortgages. So-called swap rates, which lenders use to price home loans, have increased. According to Moneyfacts, since the start of last week, the number of residential mortgages on the UK market has fallen by 373 - from 5,385 deals to 5,012.  The number of buy-to-let mortgages has fallen by 405 to 2,343. Are you affected by issues covered in this story? Get in touch. Mortgage rates have also gone up, with the average rate on a two-year fixed deal rising to 5.38%, and the average rate on a five-year fixed now standing at 5.05%. They are far higher than they were last May, when two- and five-year fixed rates stood at 3.03% and 3.17% respectively, although they are still some way off the levels seen last October, just after the mini-budget spooked markets and drove up borrowing costs.  ""Borrowers searching for a new deal may well be concerned about the latest developments in the mortgage market,"" said Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts.  ""Over the past few days, we have seen a few lenders withdraw selected fixed products, with some pulling out of the market, at least temporarily. Product choice has started to fall, and as may be expected, average fixed mortgage rates are on the rise.""  Property prices have been falling over the last six months as borrowing costs creep up, squeezing people's buying power. But earlier on Tuesday the property website Zoopla said buyer confidence appeared to be improving, with sales agreed reaching their highest point of the year so far in April.  However, boss Charlie Bryant told the BBC's Today programme last week's inflation figures had caused some uncertainty,  ""What we've seen over the course of the last few months is that if rates settle around the 4-4.5% level, that is affordable for most buyers. If you look at the rates that came in shortly after the mini-budget at the back end of last year, we saw those rates going up to 5-5.5%, which brought in those faster house price falls."" He added: ""We do need to see what happens following the inflation data at the beginning of last week, which saw swap rates increase, which may lead mortgage lenders to push rates up a little bit and that may have more of an impact again.""

Bond Market Forecast,Mortgage rates rise after inflation surprise,2024-09-14,2023-05-25,Kevin Peachey & Jemma Dempsey,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65713905,"Mortgage costs are rising after higher than expected inflation figures this week raised forecasts of how much UK interest rates will go up. A range of lenders have increased the cost of new deals, with Nationwide the most significant with increases of up to 0.45 percentage points on Friday. It comes amid expectations the Bank of England will have to raise interest rates higher than previously thought. Yet the activity is far less frenzied than after last year's mini-budget. Official figures showed UK inflation in April slowed by less than expected to 8.7%, with core inflation - which strips out volatile factors such as food and energy - at a 31-year high. That led to a strong reaction in the markets, with the last few days described as ""pretty tumultuous"" by Luke Hickmore, investment director of fixed income at Abrdn. The reason for that is that markets now think the Bank of England will have to raise rates above their current level of 4.5% to as high as 5.5%.  This change in expectations has led to big movements in prices and interest rates in the bond markets, and this has a knock-on effect on mortgages. So-called swap rates, which lenders use to price home loans, have increased. ""The inflation number was a real surprise, it stayed high and sticky and that's really worried investors,"" Mr Hickmore told the BBC's Today programme. ""It will affect mortgage and borrowing rates over the next year or two."" Robert, a teacher from Hertfordshire, told the BBC he and his wife are facing an increase of £500 on their mortgage payments on their family home.  He has been forced to take on a second job to cope. He said his current monthly mortgage payment is £1,400 but his deal expires in August. ""When we looked a couple of months ago the mortgage estimates were around £1,800-ish. They're now for a two-year around £2,000. If we were to fix for five years it's around £1,900.""  How are rising mortgage rates affecting how you live your life? Get in touch. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said he backed an increase in interest rates if it curbed higher prices and soaring inflation, even if it risked pushing the UK into a recession.  Speaking to Sky News, Mr Hunt insisted the ""only path to sustainable growth"" was to bring down the high prices behind the cost of living crisis. When asked if he was comfortable with the Bank acting to bring down inflation even if it led to a recession, Mr Hunt said: ""Yes, because in the end inflation is a source of instability."" The Bank of England has no choice but to increase interest rates further, according to Mohammed El Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz. But he told the Today programme that more action from the government was also needed. ""The Bank of England will increase interest rates but unless the government steps up its efforts to increase productivity, and improve supply chains and labour market functioning, we will end up in a situation where the Bank of England actually pushes us into recession."" Rising prices in the UK have been driven, in part, by higher food bills. But speaking to the BBC, the boss of Sainsbury's, Simon Roberts, said supermarkets had not been using high rates of inflation as a cover for making higher profits. Supermarkets saw higher sales as part of a rebound in overall retail sales in April. Official figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that sales volumes rose 0.5% last month, after activity in March was hit by wet weather. Various lenders have raised mortgage rates during the week, including a number on Friday, The UK's biggest building society Nationwide said it was putting up its mortgage rates to ensure they ""remain sustainable"". Lloyds and Halifax have also increased rates in recent days. According to financial data firm Moneyfacts, a number of lenders have increased rates or withdrawn products from the market in response to this week's inflation figure. While changes are taking place, the situation does not echo the more chaotic scenes seen after the mini-budget of the Liz Truss government last year. Moneyfacts said the average two-year fixed-rate mortgage on the market is now 5.35% and the average five-year fix is 5.02%.  Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said while the markets have reacted negatively to the inflation figures, the latest jump in rates was likely to be ""a knee-jerk reaction"" that settled down. ""We remain confident mortgage rates will shortly peak and the reductions, when they arrive, will be as quick as the recent rises,"" he said.  Earlier this week, the boss of Barclays warned UK homeowners and renters were facing a ""huge income shock"" as rising interest rates hit mortgages and monthly costs, . CS Venkatakrishnan said payments by mortgage holders and tenants would take a chunk of between 28% and 30% out of people's income. compared with an average of 20% in previous years. Read more here"
Bond Market Forecast,Risk of £50bn bond sale sparked emergency Bank move,2024-09-14,2022-10-06,By Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63161404,"The aftermath of the mini-budget could have seen a £50bn fire sale of UK government bonds by funds connected to the pensions industry, the Bank of England has said. There was risk of a downward ""spiral"", it said, as increases in the cost of government borrowing hit the funds. The Bank feared these funds would be forced to sell their government debt holdings, adding to the market turmoil. The cost of borrowing saw record increases for two days, the Bank said. The rise in borrowing costs over four days was ""three times larger than any other historical move"". The Bank stepped in to calm markets last week following fears that some types of pension funds were at risk of collapse.  It pledged to buy up to £65bn of government bonds after the mini-budget sparked turmoil on financial markets and the pound plunged. Investors had demanded a much higher return for investing in government bonds, causing some to halve in value. The Bank said that the market in long-term loans to the government lasting three decades, known as 30-year gilts, saw two days where the effective cost of borrowing saw record increases, on its data which starts in 2000.  A letter from the Bank's deputy governor John Cunliffe to the Treasury Select Committee contains a diagram depicting the trigger for the interest rate shock as the ""fiscal event"", another name for the mini-budget, and that the nature of the move in the UK was not seen in the US or eurozone. Jonathan Haskell, a member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, also said in a speech on Thursday that ""there was undoubtedly a UK-specific factor"" in the market turmoil. This contradicts the claims made by some government supporters that the mini-budget had nothing to do with last week's turmoil, which was instead caused by ""global factors"". The UK's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), had offered to prepare a draft forecast in time for the mini-budget, but the government did not take this up. Mr Haskell added that the Bank uses OBR data in its own forecasts, and a ""sidelined"" OBR ""generates more uncertainty by worsening everyone's information base"". The risk the Bank feared was that the funds connected to the pensions industry, known as Liability Driven Investments, would become forced sellers of their holdings of UK government debt, in an already troubled market. A £50bn sale would represent four times the normal daily trade in the market, and would have pushed the effective cost of borrowing, or yield, even higher than 5%, leading to further problems. Before the mini-budget, this yield had stood at about 3.7%. While individual defined benefit pension funds were not at risk, because they are guaranteed by the sponsoring company, it could have led to a wider financial stability challenge. The Bank of England decided to intervene in the market last Wednesday, bringing down the effective borrowing cost from over 5% to under 4%. As the Bank has eased off its interventions, on Thursday these costs had risen notably again, as high as 4.4%. These rates feed into the costs of long-term mortgages and business lending. The Bank emergency intervention is due to end next week and it has so far bought a fraction of the government bonds it could have, spending just £3.7bn. On Thursday, the Bank said it would wind down its bond buying in ""a smooth and orderly fashion"" once it felt the market was functioning normally again. The Bank also said it is working with the UK's pensions and financial regulators to make sure that that investment strategies used by certain types of pension schemes can withstand market volatility."
Bond Market Forecast,Ed Sheeran 'warms up' Biggest Weekend,2024-09-14,2018-05-26,By Mark Savage,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44264883,"Ed Sheeran has opened up BBC Music's Biggest Weekend in Swansea, before rushing off to play his own show in Manchester tonight. The star strode on stage shortly after midday, playing Castle On The Hill to an estimated 26,000 people. ""Thank you so much for turning up so early,"" he said. ""A part of me thought no-one would be here."" The BBC's festival takes place in three locations on Saturday - with Perth and Belfast also hosting stages. Noel Gallagher, Sam Smith and Underworld are headlining, with full coverage on BBC TV, radio and online. Sheeran played his set solo - looping his guitar and voice using an effects pedal to create a one-man pop symphony. ""What my job is, is to basically warm you up a little bit,"" he told the audience. ""Even if you don't know the words, make them up.  ""You have to sing something."" The skies opened as his set ended, but the rain and thunderstorms that were forecast to descend on Singleton Park for the rest of the day failed to materialise. ""The sun has come out and you should all rejoice,"" said indie singer Isaac Gracie as he basked in the sunshine at the BBC Introducing stage. The balmy weather made a perfect setting for George Ezra's big warm hug of a set, with the crowd chanting out the words to feel-good hits like Paradise and Budapest. ""Shall we have another singalong?"" the singer asked repeatedly, beaming from ear to ear. Anne-Marie, Jess Glynne and Liam Payne also brought big pop hits to the main stage; while Years & Years star Olly Alexander indulged in a bit of  PG-rated choreography, and several risque costume changes. The venue's second stage featured up-and-coming artists including Jorja Smith, J Hus and BBC Sound of 2018 winner Sigrid. ""We decided to go for all the upbeat songs,"" said the Norwegian star afterwards. ""It was pretty explosive."" Over in Belfast, jungle legend Goldie opened the 6 Music stage with the 90s classic Inner City Life. He was followed by local heroes Ash, who had a special occasion to mark. ""It's the 20th anniversary of a gig that we did for the Good Friday Agreement,"" said frontman Tim Wheeler.  ""How fantastic is is to see what Belfast has become over the last 20 years. We have a lot to be proud of."" The band finished their set by welcoming ""two superstars from Derry"", in the form of Damien O'Brien and Michael from punk band The Undertones, who joined them to play Teenage Kicks. While the BBC's events will continue late into the night, Sheeran had to flee to play the third of four headline shows at Manchester's Etihad Stadium. His support act Anne-Marie - who also played in Swansea - told the BBC they'd had to hire private jets to make the two gigs possible. Meanwhile, Sheeran addressed the ticketing situation on his UK tour - which has seen fans who bought tickets on the secondary market having them invalidated, and being told they had to buy new ones. ""I'm not trying to stitch fans up,"" he told Radio 1's Newsbeat, explaining that fans will get refunds, and are being offered replacement genuine tickets at face value.

Bond Market Forecast,US shares suffer sharpest drop in months,2024-09-14,2018-10-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45815183,"US share markets have suffered their sharpest one-day falls in months, as fears about rising interest rates, inflation and trade tensions climbed. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the declines, sliding 4%, or 315.9 points, to 7,422. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 also fell by more than 3%, with losses accelerating towards the end of the day. Netflix fell 8%, while Amazon slid 6%. The slides extended declines in Europe, where exchanges in Germany and France ended the day down more than 2%. The Dow fell 831.8 points, or 3.15% to 25,598.7. The S&P 500 dropped 94.6 or 3.29% to 2,785.6 - the biggest one-day fall since early February. US markets have done better than expected this year, bouncing back after turmoil early in the year to set new records over the summer. But the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, a move that tends to make it more expensive for companies to borrow, hurting bottom lines and turning stocks into a less attractive investment.  The White House issued a statement on Wednesday saying the economy remains healthy. But US President Donald Trump also cast blame on the Fed, which he has repeatedly criticised for raising rates. The central bank has ""gone crazy"", he told reporters. The stock market fall came ahead of America's corporate earnings season, when companies will provide updates to investors about their outlook for the rest of the year. ""The big concern isn't really what third quarter earnings numbers are, but really what the outlook for the fourth quarter and first quarters are,"" Oliver Pursche, vice chairman and chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management, in New York, said. Company costs, such as pay, are rising, and data on published on Wednesday showed a pick-up in inflation. US tariffs on steel, aluminium and Chinese goods are another factor that could drive up costs and force companies to lower their forecasts, Mr Pursche said. ""I suspect that's one of the things underlying market concern,"" he said. Shares in the US energy sector saw some of the steepest declines on Wednesday, as investors reacted to shutdowns caused by Hurricane Michael in Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. Oil exploration firms Hess Corp and Marathon Oil fell more than 7%, while Chevron was down about 3%. Big tech companies also dropped, with shares in Google and Apple falling almost 5%. The sell-off picked up late in the day, sending investors towards bonds. But for the most part, bond prices have remained relatively low. Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA, said she thinks that is a sign that investors are not yet retreating from the stock market. She predicted that shares would rebound as the earnings season gets underway, noting that strong results soothed investors when concerns about inflation triggered turmoil earlier in the year. ""You saw earnings season take off and really stabilise the market,"" she said, adding that underlying economic data remains healthy. ""We're optimistic that is going to happen here."""
Bond Market Forecast,Odeon to open weekends-only at some cinemas,2024-09-14,2020-10-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54387856,"Odeon is cutting the opening hours for some of its cinemas in the UK and Ireland to weekends only because of delays to new film releases. The chain, which operates 120 theatres, said it will affect a quarter of its cinemas, which will now open between Friday and Sunday. Odeon, which employs 5,500 people, declined to comment on job cuts. It comes as Cineworld said it will temporarily close its UK and US venues, affecting 45,000 jobs. According to movie magazine Film Stories, Odeon emailed customers to tell them that from Friday 9 October it was temporarily reducing hours at some cinemas ""in light of the ongoing delays to the release of many new films"". The changes announced by Odeon and Cineworld come after the release of the new James Bond film was delayed again. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to return to cinemas. He said would ""encourage people to go out to the cinema, enjoy themselves and support"" movie theatres. However, the cinema industry has been hit by an absence of blockbuster movie to lure in customers.  Cineworld employs around 5,500 people in the UK and its chief executive Mooky Greidinger, said: ""We did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings in all of our markets.""  The company did not give a date for reopening its 663 cinemas, which include 127 Cineworld and Picturehouse theatres in the UK. Mr Greidinger said the company ""cannot underscore enough how difficult this decision was"" to close the sites. ""Cineworld will continue to monitor the situation closely and will communicate any future plans to resume operations in these markets at the appropriate time, when key markets have more concrete guidance on their reopening status and, in turn, studios are able to bring their pipeline of major releases back to the big screen,"" he said. Rosalyn Lloyd, 30, found out that her job at a Cineworld theatre in Wolverhampton was under threat from social media at the weekend. And she still doesn't know if she'll get a wage this month. ""We've been told nothing at all,"" Ms Lloyd told the BBC. ""When I went to work yesterday, everyone had seen it on social media [and] everyone was down in the dumps which is understandable. ""One woman was crying because she'd been there for nine years."" Ms Lloyd has worked at Cineworld for nearly two years and was placed on furlough earlier this year, though she says because she is on a zero-hour contract the pay was ""very low"". Her immediate problem is a lack of information from Cineworld. ""Are they still going to pay us at the end of October? We just haven't heard anything at the moment. We all are waiting for a call - it is a waiting game."" ""No Time to Die"", which is reportedly actor Daniel Craig's final outing as 007, is a key movie release that had been due in cinemas in April this year, but was then postponed until November because of the coronavirus pandemic. The release date has now been moved to April next year. ""I think the Bond movie is the straw that broke the camel's back to be honest,"" said Robert Mitchell, director of theatrical insights at Gower Street Analytics. ""A lot of films have been moving for some time now and ultimately the cinemas need a pipeline of regular content to draw cinema goers in,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.  While Christopher Nolan's film Tenet opened at the end of August, Mr Mitchell said there had not been a major release since.  ""Bond was really the one that UK exhibitors were really relying on more than any,"" he said. Shares in Cineworld plunged in early trading, down 27% at 28.74p each. Tim Richards, founder and chief executive of the Vue cinema chain, said the company had put safety measures in place at its theatres and noted there was ""pent up demand like we haven't seen ever before"" among customers to go out. However, he added: ""Our problem right now is we have no movies and this [the delay to the Bond film] was a big blow for us."" ""We are likely going to make it through,"" Mr Richards said, adding that Vue's goal is to try to keep as many of its 5,500 workers as possible. Mr Mitchell said he had forecast previously that UK box office takings would reach £500m this year. ""The Bond move obviously shaves a lot off that,"" he said. ""And now that Cineworld is closing and we don't know when it will be reopening, it might be a struggle to get over £400m."" Mr Richards said that outside the US, many cinemas had now re-opened. ""Looking globally right now, 75% of screens, maybe as high as 80% of screens are open.  ""Even if you look at the numbers that Tenet generated in the UK it is going to get very close to Christopher Nolan's previous film Interstellar, maybe 80-90% of what it did.  ""The audience is there and I think what we are seeing is the US studios in particular are taking a very US-centric view and forgetting that 80% of global box office comes offshore from North America."""
Bond Market Forecast,Bank boosts plan to reassure investors,2024-09-14,2022-10-10,By Nick Edser,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63198341,"The Bank of England has announced new measures aimed at ensuring an ""orderly end"" to its emergency bond buying scheme which was introduced to stop a collapse of some pension funds.  The Bank will increase the amount of bonds it can buy in the final week of the scheme, which ends on Friday.  It will also introduce extra support to ease future strains on pension funds.  The Bank initially stepped in after the government's mini-budget sparked turmoil on financial markets. With the deadline for the Bank's bond-buying programme fast approaching, there have been concerns volatility would return once the scheme ends. However, Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the Bank was taking the approach of ""talking loudly and carrying a big stick"" in its attempt to calm concerns, He said the measures are ""designed to reassure pension managers - and pension holders - that help will be provided"".  He added that the Bank's announcement reaffirms that the bond purchases were a short-term measure and ""it remains committed to withdrawing monetary stimulus and tightening monetary policy as it fights inflation"". The mini-budget - which was announced on 23 September - pledged £45bn of tax cuts as part of a plan to boost economic growth, but the level of government borrowing required shocked investors who questioned the sustainability of the public finances. In the aftermath of the statement, the pound hit a record low and investors demanded a much higher return for investing in government bonds, causing some to drop sharply in value. Certain types of funds in the pension industry, which invest in bonds, were forced to start selling, sparking fears of a fresh market downturn. On 28 September, the Bank stepped in to buy government bonds saying its decision was driven by concern over ""a material risk to UK financial stability"". It said it would buy up to £65bn bonds, with a limit of £5bn a day. So far, the Bank has bought only around £5bn bonds in total under the programme and in its latest announcement it said stood ready to increase the size of its daily purchases. On Monday, it doubled the limit to £10bn. This intervention is about a transition off the Bank of England emergency support offered in government bond markets, in the aftermath of the mini-budget. The Bank of England is trying to leave no stone unturned in making sure the withdrawal of this support occurs in an orderly manner. But the Bank is also committing to the timetable to phase out the support this week. Some in the markets had anticipated it would need to be extended. The Bank is demonstrating that this intervention is not intended to limit the rise in government costs, but instead was a temporary and targeted effort aimed at maintaining financial stability. This is the message heard in markets on Monday, with effective borrowing costs, or yields, on government debt on the rise again. These rates were over 4.5% for borrowing over 30 years and five years. The big picture is this: if the Treasury wants to bring down now rising government borrowing costs - which have an effect on mortgages and business lending too - it is up to it to present a credible set of tax and spending plans and independent forecasts, which are now promised for the end of October. The forecasts and the plan will now feed into the Bank of England's interest rate decision in early November. The Bank of England's intervention was a temporary bridge over a specific crisis. The solution here is for the government. The government borrows money to fund its spending plans by selling bonds, or ""gilts"", to investors such as pension funds and big banks on international markets. But a collapse in the price of those bonds in the aftermath of the mini-budget was forcing some funds to rush to sell bonds further forcing down the price. If that process had continued, there was a risk that those pension funds could have got to a position where they could not pay their debts. In its latest statement, the Bank said there had been ""substantial progress"" in addressing the financial problems facing these funds, which had faced the prospect of having to make forced sales of £50bn of bonds. As well as increasing the daily limit on bond purchases this week, the Bank also announced a further measure to help the funds affected by the recent market volatility. Under the measure, these funds will be able to use a wider range of assets - such as company bonds - to access money to help meet any short-term financial demands. It is hoped this means these funds will not be forced to sell government bonds to raise cash, which was what they had to do in the immediate aftermath of the mini-budget. This measure will continue after the emergency bond-buying programme has finished. Before the mini-budget, the yield on government borrowing over a 30-year period stood at about 3.7%. The yield is effectively the interest rate. After the mini-budget it jumped to 5.1% until the Bank's intervention pushed the rate back down. However, in recent days it has crept back up again to around 4.5%."
Bond Market Forecast,Shares drop in worst week since financial crisis,2024-09-14,2020-02-28,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51639654,"US markets have suffered their worst week since the global financial crisis of 2008, as fears over the impact of the coronavirus continued to grip investors. The three main US indexes ended the week down 10% or more from last Friday, despite a last-minute rally in prices. Earlier, the main European markets fell sharply, with London's FTSE 100 index down 3.2% for the day. Investors are worried the coronavirus could spark a global recession. The Dow settled 1.4% lower on Friday, recovering from earlier lows, while the S&P sank 0.8% and the Nasdaq was roughly flat. Amid the sell-off, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell put out an unusual statement, saying the US central bank was ""closely monitoring"" developments. ""The fundamentals of the US economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,"" he said. ""We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."" The news of more coronavirus cases, notably in Italy, has raised concerns of a much larger economic effect than previously expected.  Bank of England Governor Mark Carney on Friday warned the outbreak could lead to a downgrade of the UK's growth prospects. Other countries are also reassessing their economic forecasts, as hundreds of firms warn of disruptions to their supply chains and a decline in consumer demand. US tech giants Apple and Microsoft are among the companies that have said their business will be affected, while investment bank Goldman Sachs warned on Thursday that the coronavirus is likely to wipe out any growth in US company profits this year. Shares in airlines have been especially hard-hit as travel bans are imposed and companies limit staff travel. On Friday, airline group IAG - which owns British Airways and Iberia - said its earnings had been affected by ""weaker demand"" as a result of the outbreak. ""A known unknown"" is how one major company boss described the economic fallout of coronavirus to the BBC.  But what the markets have woken up to - perhaps belatedly - is that the disruption to the economic activity from coronavirus is wider, deeper and perhaps longer lasting than previously assumed.  As major outbreaks spring up outside China, it is clear that it is not just global supply chains but also demand from consumers that's suffering, as efforts to contain the virus keep them away from shops, bars and restaurants. What is unknown is exactly how bad and how lasting the impact could be. But what is known is that this comes at an already tricky time for the global economy with Japan, Italy, China and the UK among those already seeing growth faltering.  As economists slash their growth forecasts, policymakers are debating how much they can do to help, given how low interest rates remain. What's entirely clear is that investors face more anxiety ahead. Mayank Mishra, a strategist at Standard Chartered Bank, said: ""Previously the market had taken some comfort in the falling infection rates in China as a result of containment measures put in place earlier. ""But the spread of the coronavirus infection outside China, with clusters emerging in South Korea, Italy and Japan, has increased concerns significantly."" In Europe, Germany's Dax index fell 4.2%, while France's Cac 40 index sank 3.9%. Earlier on Friday, in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index dropped 3.7%, bringing its fall for the week to more than 9%. China's Shanghai Composite index also fell 3.7% on Friday. Traders fled to less risky investments, such as government debt, sending bond yields to new lows. Meanwhile, oil prices also fell on fears the virus would hurt demand, with Brent prices dropping more than 3% to about $50 a barrel on Friday, the lowest level for more than a year. US President Donald Trump, who has claimed credit for a sharp rise in share prices during his tenure, blamed the falls on investor fear of ""the unknown"" - as well as concerns about the Democratic candidates hoping to challenge him in November's presidential election. ""People look at it and they say how long will this last,"" he said. ""It's an election ... I don't think that's helping."" Several key global market indexes - including the FTSE 100 and the Dow Jones - have fallen more than 10% from recent highs. A drop of that magnitude is generally referred to as a correction. However, share prices were hovering at record levels before the sell-off started, noted Sonja Laud, chief investment officer at Legal & General Investment Management.  The Dow and S&P 500 have now retreated roughly to where they were in August, while the Nasdaq has returned to December prices. ""What markets are trying to digest is how long this is going to go on and what the economic damage will be,"" she said. Many analysts now predict the US central bank will cut interest rates in an attempt to counter any impact. James Bullard, who sits on the Fed's board of governors, said Friday that cuts are ""a possibility"" should the virus continue to spread, but he warned that market expectations would not force the bank to act. Ms Laud said that many central banks had little room for manoeuvre, because rates are already so low. ""Realistically it's mostly the Fed and to some extent the Bank of England that still have the chance to cut rates,"" she told the BBC. ""I think there will be a huge focus on governments to step up fiscal stimulus under the assumption there is not a lot more that central banks can do to stimulate the economy."" "
Bond Market Forecast,Budget 2018: and now for Holyrood,2024-09-14,2018-10-29,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-46026422,"That Budget from Philip Hammond may leave you wondering what all that austerity fuss was about. Turning the deficit into a surplus was a sacred cause when George Osborne was Chancellor, and nothing would be allowed to stand in its way. Well, OK, it didn't work out as planned. Cutting public spending may well have dampened economic growth, so the targets kept being moved. The 2015 deadline was missed by a very wide margin. It was recently spotted somewhere around the middle of next decade, and receding over the horizon. The Office for Budget Responsibility told the Chancellor that he could get into a surplus earlier than 2025 if he stuck to his plans and banked the unexpected tax revenues. But he chose to have a bit of a splurge instead, turning on the spending taps a bit, with a crowd-pleasing £2.8bn tax cut by upping income tax thresholds. It turns out that getting to a surplus doesn't matter all that much after all. The debt may be humongous, but if you don't borrow much, the impact of growth and inflation is to erode its scale over time. Measured as a share of national income, it may have peaked at 85.2% in 2016-17 and it's now falling. This changes the political landscape quite a lot. Putting aside the inevitable debates about ""the end of austerity"" (there's no agreed definition of austerity), Conservatives have become the party that thinks public spending can be good for you. Fiscal conservatives aren't impressed. The Institute of Economic Affairs, which takes a largely disapproving view of tax and big government, reacted to the Budget with dismay that a Conservative government seems so relaxed that the tax burden is stuck around its current level, and debt remains so high. So are fiscal hawks active in Westminster? Or are they all too busy fighting Brexit battles to risk a new front of attack against Downing Street?  Opposition parties sound a bit non-plussed by this twist in the narrative. This is not what they expected from a Tory Chancellor. But there's an opportunity.  If Conservatives can now portray themselves as the party that's bringing an end to austerity, there are others who can do that with more conviction and enthusiasm, and also with a big borrowing and spending splurge. What does it mean for Scotland? The bigger picture is a UK economy forecast to have very strong employment and low unemployment, but with very sluggish growth for at least five years, linked to poor productivity.  Scotland shares those attributes and is affected by the rest of the UK, as its main ""export"" market. That productivity might be given a lift if businesses can be persuaded to use that big lift, for two years, in the investment allowance. It's going up from £200,000 to £1m, to address one of the economy's weakest measures. But pending clarity on Brexit, even a big lift in investment tax break is unlikely to unleash big spending on capital goods.  And those that might fit the bill are the robots that could a) do a lot of damage to employment and/or b) replace absent EU workers. The impact of changes to taxation of self-employed workers in the private sector will be felt on both sides of the border. So there are some tax changes that will be felt north of the border. In oil and gas, ""inviting evidence"" of how Scotland can be turned into a hive of decommissioning activity sounds less than urgent for something that feels at least 10 years late. With £1.8bn to be spent annually in the next decade, and £50bn over the next 40 years, others are already winning that work, from Teesside to Norway and no doubt others will emerge at a greater distance.   But the more immediate questions in Scotland start with: how to spend the £950m additional funding coming from Mr Hammond's Budget allocations?  Finance Secretary Derek Mackay will set out his plans on 12 December. He's already concerned that the long since pre-announced extra NHS funding is £50m less than expected, at £550m. That is near certain to go into health and social care. The politics of health demands it. Other funds result, for instance, from decisions to spend on the retail crisis afflicting city and town centres. Scotland has very similar problems. Mr Mackay doesn't have to spend on the same priorities as Mr Hammond, but with concerns about ""high streets"", he will need to have a compelling reason for not doing so. Meanwhile, ministers reckon that other budgets in Whitehall have taken a cut, and these have also been passed on through the Barnett Formula block grant. Expect more detail on that when they've had time to analyse the newly-published numbers. The other side of the ledger requires Derek Mackay to say how he responds to the unexpected changes to income tax band thresholds. The rise in the starting threshold from £11,380 to £12,500 will apply throughout the UK, That will take more people out of paying tax altogether, and there's nothing Mr Mackay can do about it. The higher rate of Westminster income tax, at 40p in the pound, will soon start at £50,000 of income. As things stand this fiscal year, Scottish income tax introduced a 41% tax rate at £43,430.  With a five-band income tax structure to Westminster's three bands, Holyrood ministers are able both to ratchet up a more progressive tax system, and use increased complexity to obscure the extent of divergence.  Next year's income tax bill for someone earning £50,000 in England will be £7,500, excluding all sorts of allowances. If nothing were to change in Holyrood's tax rates and thresholds for 2018-19, someone earning the same in Scotland would be paying £8,927.  The difference is £1,427. If that Scottish threshold goes up with inflation, the difference would be closer to £1,100. And for every pound earned above £50,000, a Scot pays one more penny per pound in income tax than someone in England. An additional complication is that for every pound earned between the Scottish higher rate, currently at £43,430, and Westminster's £50,000 threshold, there is a National Insurance charge of 12p. (NICs are all set at Westminster.) Marginal rates of income tax-plus NICs in Scotland therefore rise to 53p in the pound for that tranche of earnings, and fall back to 43p for every pound above £50,000. That's unlikely to persuade people they should move south of the border to pay less tax. But as a signal of divergence, and no word on where the divergence might end, it could have an impact on those thinking of a move to Scotland. Without moving your home anywhere, income can be moved around, as explained by Moira Kelly, of the Chartered Institute of Taxation: ""For those who are able to - such as self-employed business owners - this is likely to increase attractiveness of reorganising their tax arrangements to opt out of Scottish income tax and into UK-wide corporation tax in order to reduce their liabilities."" That's how taxes become uncompetitive, and how higher taxes can constrain growth. Mr Mackay will be weighing up those considerations ahead of 12 December. He will also have to weigh up what is required to get some opposition support to get his budget passed at Holyrood. There were some brief asides in Philip Hammond's Budget speech that are worth keeping an eye on.  One is the spending review, which he said will take place next year.  He didn't have much detail on when, or over how long. Perhaps it is just that Brexit is making the Treasury cautious about committing itself to all the work involved. The other is the question of social care. Whitehall is soon to set out its options.  This is a very difficult but very important topic. It was mishandled spectacularly by Theresa May during last year's election campaign, sparking a political storm that looked to have knocked the issue into the long grass for many years to come. But remember that the Institute of Fiscal Studies has been warning for some years that the ""consolidation"" of public finances we've been through in the past eight years, and which may now have been conveniently set to one side without reaching the advertised destination, is on the same scale as the consolidation that will be required to deal with demographic pressure on public services and welfare spending. * An earlier version of this article had a lower figure for the gap between Westminster and Holyrood income tax bills for someone earning £50,000."
Bond Market Forecast,Dow falls more than 4% amid coronavirus stock rout,2024-09-14,2020-02-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51664652,"Financial markets suffered a sixth day of losses on Thursday, as traders dumped shares on fears that the spread of coronavirus will hobble the global economy. In the US, the Dow Jones plunged nearly 1,200 points to lose 4.4%. It was the sharpest points-drop in history. The S&P 500 ended 4.4% lower, while the Nasdaq dropped 4.6%. Earlier, London's FTSE 100 finished 3.5% lower, while Japan's Nikkei 225 led Asian losses, falling more than 2%. The string of declines has pushed indexes in Europe and the US down more than 10% from their recent highs - sending them into so-called ""correction"" territory. The tumult comes as the coronavirus, which started in China, spreads rapidly around the world, restricting travel, upending global supply chains and prompting shoppers in some countries to stay home. ""Markets move sharply when fear and uncertainty are prevalent, and there is plenty of both right now,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com.  Indexes in the US and London were poised for their the biggest weekly losses since the 2008 financial crisis, as the Dow retreated to levels last seen in August.  Investors rushed into less risky investments, such as government debt, sending bond yields to record lows. Globally, the share price declines of the last six days have wiped out more than $3.6tn (£2.8tn) in value. The declines follow warnings from dozens of companies - from mining firm Rio Tinto to software giant Microsoft - that they will not hit sales targets. On Thursday, Facebook said it would cancel a conference for developers, scheduled for May. Economists, many of whom had originally expected the virus to be a temporary blow, are also sounding warnings. At an event on Wednesday, former US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen suggested it could tip the US into recession, while Goldman Sachs told clients it did not expect companies to see any profit growth this year. ""Our reduced profit forecasts reflect the severe decline in Chinese economic activity... lower end-demand for US exporters, disruption to the supply chain for many US firms, a slowdown in US economic activity, and elevated business uncertainty,"" the firm wrote. The coronavirus has infected nearly 79,000 people in China and killed more than 2,700. More than 3,200 cases and 51 deaths have been reported in another 44 countries. Investors around the world are now looking to see if central banks respond with efforts to prop up the economy. Chinas's central bank has already taken stimulative measures.  Germany's Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said that while the impact of the virus so far had been limited, the country was considering how to respond should it worsen."
Bond Market Forecast,Bank of England in emergency move to calm markets,2024-09-14,2022-10-11,By Daniel Thomas & Dharshini David,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63211743,"The Bank of England has warned of a ""material risk"" to financial stability as it made a fresh emergency move to try to calm investors. It said it would buy more government bonds to try to stabilise their price and prevent a sell-off that could put some pension funds at risk of collapse. It is the third time the Bank has had to step in since the government's mini-budget sparked alarm among investors.  The chancellor promised huge tax cuts without saying how he would fund them. The government said it remained confident in the plan, with Kwasi Kwarteng telling MPs he was ""relentlessly focused on growing the economy"" and ""raising living standards"". But Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""This is a Tory crisis that has been made in Downing Street, and that is being paid for by working people."" The Bank's warning about financial stability is rare and suggests it cannot confidently ignore the threat it sees to the financial system. It is even rarer for several senior Bank executives to have indicated part of the blame for the turmoil may lie at the government's door, the result of domestic policy. The Bank was forced to intervene after government borrowing costs rose sharply despite actions it and the Treasury had taken to calm investors on Monday.  Those measures included: On Tuesday borrowing costs remained close to the levels seen at the height of the market turmoil last month.  One pensions industry body urged the Bank to extend its emergency support beyond Friday due to fears of further market turmoil. The Bank will now widen the emergency programme it launched on 28 September, when days after the mini-budget, investors began demanding higher rates of interest on those bonds and government borrowing costs surged to worrying levels. The turmoil has forced pension funds to sell bonds due to concerns over their solvency, and threatened to create a downward spiral in bond prices as more were offloaded which left some funds close to collapse. It has also fed through to the mortgage market, where hundreds of products have been suspended due to concerns about how to price these long-term loans. Last week, interest rates on typical two and five-year fixed rate mortgages topped 6% for the first time in over a decade. The government raises money it needs for spending by selling bonds - a form of IOU that is paid back plus interest in anywhere between five and 30 years.   But the sharp rise in the cost of new government borrowing - the interest on those bonds - reflects an anxiety among investors that the UK's tax-cutting plans make it a risky investment bet. By buying bonds, the Bank is hoping to help keep their price stable and prevent investors selling them in what it likened to a ""fire sale"". The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, which represents schemes managing about £1.3tn of retirement money, said many funds wanted the bond-buying programme to last until the chancellor delivered his economic plan on 31 October.  The Treasury said it was ""working closely with other UK authorities to monitor the markets as is usual"".  Under pressure from its MPs, the government has been forced into a series of embarrassing climbdowns since the mini-budget, including U-turning on a plan to scrap the top rate of income tax.  Experts believe Mr Kwarteng will have to row back on more of his tax cuts or drastically cut public spending.  On Tuesday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank warned government departments could see ""big and painful cuts"" of up to £60bn a year to balance the books when Mr Kwarteng announces his economic plan on 31 October.  Sir John Gieve, a former deputy governor for fiscal stability at the Bank of England, said the Bank had primarily stepped in to protect pension funds, many of which hold government bonds as investments.  However, he said the ""underlying problem"" was that investors did not believe the government would be able to cut spending enough before its growth measures took effect.  ""The internal workings of the financial markets have thrown up an element of instability that the Bank is addressing. But the underlying move came on the back of the announcement of huge amounts of extra borrowing and tax cuts without a clear plan of how to pay for them,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  ""It's one thing to [promise huge cuts], but can [the chancellor] actually deliver that?"" Prime Minister Liz Truss has said her £43bn of promised tax cuts will boost UK economic growth and therefore help pay for themselves.  The chancellor has also committed to publishing an independent forecast of the UK's economic prospects by the OBR, the independent budget watchdog, at the same time as his economic plan - something he declined to do with his mini-budget.

Bond Market Forecast,Tax rises needed to stop 'irresponsible' debt,2024-09-14,2021-03-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56266683,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned that a spending spree to support workers and spur investment will be followed by tax rises as the economy recovers. The UK's rapid Covid-19 vaccine rollout is expected to help the economy get back to its pre-pandemic size six months sooner than previously expected. Official forecasts expect growth to hit 4% this year, while an extension of the furlough scheme will limit job losses. Mr Sunak said future tax hikes were needed to stop ""irresponsible"" debt. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said the UK had been at the ""vanguard"" of the discovery of new and effective vaccines. It said this will foster a ""swifter and more sustained"" economic recovery, with the pace of growth expected to strengthen to 7.3% in 2022. This would be the highest growth rate since official records began in 1949 and help the economy to return to its pre-pandemic size in the middle of next year. Mr Sunak unveiled plans to spend tens of billions of pounds more over the next two years to support the economic recovery, including tax breaks designed to encourage business investment.  However, the chancellor said tax rises were also needed to help repair the public finances. Mr Sunak announced that corporation tax will rise from 19% to 25% for large companies in 2023, while day-to-day spending by government departments will be cut by a further £4bn a year. Mr Sunak said it would be ""irresponsible to allow our future borrowing and debt to rise unchecked"". Chris Sanger, head of tax policy at EY, described the Budget as ""three years of support, followed by three years (and more) of pain"". Mr Sanger added: ""Time [is] the Chancellor's friend in his aim of replenishing the Government's coffers.""  The government's target to have all adults vaccinated this summer is expected to pave the way for the lifting of public health restrictions. The OBR noted that British households had built up a savings war chest of around £180bn in the past year. It expects a quarter of this to be spent as lockdowns end, saying there could be a ""degree of euphoria"", especially among better-off households who ""treat themselves"" when the economy opens up. The main thrust of this Budget is significant extra immediate crisis support, both in terms of the furlough scheme and self employed support, and a radical ""super-deduction"" policy to encourage business investment right now.. That is £60bn extra in one year and it comes from borrowed money. That leaves borrowing in the coming financial year significantly higher than expected. A much larger proportion of the exceptional world war-style borrowing over the past year will stay in place in the coming year. The happy result of this is that unemployment, though rising, peaks at a much lower level than previous expectations, just over 6%, rather than, say, 10%. This is a consequence of both the vaccine rollout and the support package, leading to a reopening of the economy over summer. The jabs and then the jobs. But then the payback, with a massive rise in £16bn corporation tax and the £8bn changes to thresholds for the last two years of the Parliament. The Conservative manifesto commitments on not increasing VAT, income tax or national insurance are binding here.  So Rishi Sunak is left with the first rise in corporation tax since Dennis Healey's 1974 Budget. It turns a careful strategy of using corporation tax as a lever for foreign investment on its head. For many in the vanguard of the Conservative Brexit movement, very low levels of this tax were one of the building blocks of ""Singapore-on-Thames"". Singapore is staying in South East Asia. The timing of this tax rise at the end of a Parliament is not the normal order of things. But the Covid pandemic is far from normal.  However, the watchdog warned that economic uncertainty remained ""considerable"", and would depend on controlling variants of the virus. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the chancellor was ""betting on a recovery fuelled by a consumer spending blitz"". He added: ""The chancellor may think that this is time for a victory lap, but I'm afraid this Budget won't feel so good for the millions of key workers who are having their pay frozen, for the businesses swamped by debt, and the families paying more in council tax."" Unemployment is expected to peak at a lower rate of 6.5%, keeping it well below levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis. However, this means half a million more people are expected to be out of work by the end of this year. Government borrowing is expected to rise to a peacetime high of £354.6bn this year to help pay for economic support measures. The size of the UK's debt pile is also expected to remain larger than the economy until at least the middle of the decade. Mr Sunak said: ""It's going to take this country - and the whole world - a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover."" From April, he will also freeze the amount of money employees earn before paying income tax at £12,570 until the middle of the decade. The OBR estimates an extra 1.3 million people will start to pay income tax by 2026 as a result of the freeze. The level at which employees start paying the higher, 40% rate of tax will also be frozen at £50,270 from April, dragging an extra million people into the band within five years."

Bond Market Forecast,"The place Lemmy, Santa & 007 want to be",2024-09-14,2019-05-07,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-48119919,"As Cool Cymru reached fever pitch, Wales' first parliament for 600 years sat for its first session. Scott Gibbs' try famously help Wales beat England in the rugby at Wembley while the Manics, 'Phonics, Super Furries and Catatonia were at the peak of their musical powers. As the Millennium Stadium opened just up the road, the Welsh Assembly started life as a new Wales started to emerge. It's 20 years since that historic year. We look back at 20 things you may not know about the National Assembly for Wales and how it has helped shape today's Wales. What does London's iconic Millennium Dome, Paris' unique Pompidou Centre, Strasbourg's European Court of Human Rights building, 3 World Trade Center in New York and Ashford designer outlet village have in common with the Senedd? Renowned award-winning British-Italian architect Richard Rogers helped design them all. Well, the actual inspiration behind the assembly building design was one of the world's largest airport terminals. The Richard Rogers-designed award-winning £1bn terminal four at Madrid's Barajas Airport - all 1.5m sq ft (140,000 m²) of it - was a template for the Senedd's look with its distinctive wavy roof and vast, inviting interior. Wales was quids in back in 1998 as the then Welsh Secretary Ron Davies bought the site on which the Senedd was to be built for £1. The shot of Mr Davies paying Grosvenor Waterside representative Alan Davies a pound for a 150-year lease in Cardiff Bay was shown live on the BBC Wales evening news. Politicians are occasionally accused of talking a lot of hot air - well you needn't worry as the £67m assembly building is one of the most green parliaments in the world and controls its temperature naturally.  The distinctive funnel-like roof isn't just a design feature, it's functional - it allows natural daylight and air into the Siambr while the wind cowl on the top of the roof controls temperature, eliminating the need for air conditioning.  The ground, together with a biomass boiler, is a heat source thanks to geothermal heat pump systems using the the constant temperature of the earth for heating and cooling. Rainwater isn't wasted either - it's either used to flush toilets or irrigation. The National Assembly for Wales has a unique postcode. CF99 1NA - 99 is the year the assembly started work while 1NA stands for one National Assembly. Critics have questioned whether the assembly actually delivers... The assembly will, however, argue that it helped deliver some pioneering, agenda-setting legislation for such a young legislative body. It was the first UK nation to introduce a minimum 5p charge on single-use carrier bags, the first to force food outlets to prominently display food hygiene inspection ratings, the first to introduce presumed consent on organ donations. People in Wales also get free prescriptions, free parking at hospitals while primary school children are entitled to a free breakfast. Wales also prides itself on leading the way when it comes to putting children first. The Welsh Government was the first to introduce a commissioner for future generations which represents people who haven't even been born yet. Sophie Howe challenges the impact, environmental and otherwise, of major projects and ensures government policies do not threaten the future of our children and our children's children. Wales was also the first UK nation to appoint a children's commissioner. The Welsh Assembly made political history in 2003 by becoming the world's first legislative body to have equal numbers of men and women. Women's rights groups hailed the political breakthrough after 30 women were elected to the 60-strong assembly in its second term. The National Assembly for Wales and Welsh Government have often been hailed as world leaders in women's representation as more than half of all cabinet ministers between 2000-2005 were women. Cristiano Ronaldo and Tiger Woods are two of sport's global superstars that have graced the green, green grass of Wales thanks to backing of the devolved Welsh administration. Some of sport's biggest events have been staged in Wales since 1999, most notably football's 2017 Champions League final between Real Madrid and Juventus in Cardiff, and golf's 2010 Ryder Cup in Newport. Attracting major sporting events - like the first London 2012 Olympic Games event, cricket's England v Australia Ashes series and various Rugby World Cups - is part of a Welsh Government plan to market Wales to the world. To symbolise the assembly being the new heart of Wales, internationally renowned artist Alexander Beleschenko's two-metre wide structure in the centre of the Siambr oak floor cannot be walked on - maybe to symbolise Wales won't be walked over?! Anyway, the 10mm toughened glass piece is supposed to express ""one of emergence, a reflection and statement about the assembly itself which is new and emerging"". You can be forgiven for thinking that any insult goes goes in politics these days but, believe it or not, you can't insult or question another AM's honesty in the Welsh Assembly chamber. Abusive phrases such as ""bumbling idiot"", ""rent-a-gob"", ""hypocrites"", ""pathetic"" and ""political vermin"" are among 50 words or phrases that are unacceptable. Describing The Queen as a ""parasite"" and ""Mrs Windsor"" is also ""unparliamentary"" - as former Plaid leader Leanne Wood found out in 2004 - while a load of swear words are also frowned upon. Play nice everybody. Well even if it did get cold in the Senedd, you could cwtch up in a bespoke woollen blanket made specifically for the assembly. Renowned 200-year-old Welsh mill Melin Tregwynt designed the cloth with a slate grey background, to match the assembly's floor, and red, green, yellow and blue spots to represent the political parties. This was designed before UKIP members were elected, in case you're wondering where the purple spots are. Politicians were shaken and stirred when a request to shoot scenes of James Bond film Spectre in the Welsh Assembly debating chamber were refused. Some politicians pointed the goldfinger at Welsh Assembly officials and thought it a missed opportunity when they denied 007's request, insisting the chamber was ""not a drama studio"". Bond ended up filming in Mexico City - and it was the opening scene. The row must have scared the living daylights out of assembly chiefs as they allowed War of the Worlds to be filmed in the Senedd. Where 007 failed, Lemmy succeeded. Although he had graced the world's most iconic music arenas, one of the rock star's most bizarre gigs was in the Welsh Assembly. The Motorhead frontman and Ace of Spades singer shared a stage with Tory AM William Graham in Cardiff Bay in 2005 to tell politicians their policy on heroin had failed.  If devolution was Wales' ultimate gift, Santa Claus turning up at an early-days plenary session in December 2002 was the ultimate seal of approval. But AM Mick Bates making an appearance dressed as Father Christmas caused a right row as the then-AM Alun Cairns, now Welsh Secretary, accused the Liberal Democrat politician of ""making a mockery of the assembly by clowning around in a Santa suit"". Presiding Officer Lord Elis-Thomas also stuck his boot in, telling AMs they should appear there ""in normal dress"". So much for Christmas spirit. By pressing the wrong button in a yes or no debate, the then-health minister inadvertently voted against his own recommendation and made the Welsh Assembly support a 2006 public inquiry into the state of the Welsh Ambulance Service. Plaid Cymru had called the debate in the wake of the resignation of the service's acting chief executive as the service failed to meet emergency call-out targets. And Labour minister Brian Gibbons' ""wrong vote"" was crucial as the assembly voted 28-26 in favour of an inquiry. The Welsh Labour government is the longest standing administration in the UK, having been in power since the advent of devolution in 1999. But Labour have usually had to rely on votes of AMs from other parties to govern, with the exception of a short period in the early 2000s. Even though devolution had started seven years earlier, the Welsh Government as a body didn't legally exist until 2006.  But once the Government of Wales Act 2006 gained royal assent, the assembly's powers were strengthened as it allowed more powers to be transferred from the UK to the Welsh Government. All isn't as it seems in the Senedd's debating chamber as the walls behind where AMs sit are fake! But it's nothing sinister, it's just so the Siambr can be increased to accommodate 20 AMs and take the capacity to 80 AMs if required. Devolution isn't universally popular and opinions have always been divided - as the 1997 referendum results show. It was achieved by the narrowest of narrow margins - with just 50.3% voting yes.  With a turnout of registered voters in Wales at 50.2%, about 20% of people in Wales - 559,419 of the estimated 2.89m population in 1997 - actually voted in favour of creating the assembly."

Bond Market Forecast,Why does the government want to cut spending?,2024-09-14,2022-11-14,By Dharshini David,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63582200,"From nurses' salaries to school supplies and state pensions, over £1 trillion will be spent on public services and investment this year.  Government spending has only been entirely matched by money raised from taxes in six of the last 50 years.  It is more typical to have an annual shortfall averaging about 3% of the money the UK economy makes per year. But this is not the infamous ""black hole"", which refers to a future sum shaped by the government's own target. Let me explain. The government can raise enough money to fund its spending by borrowing on financial markets via bonds, which are essentially IOUs. To borrow at relatively low rates, it needs to persuade investors that it's a good bet. So markets expect governments to draw up and meet rules about how much they should borrow and how that debt is managed, to prove that they are financially responsible. We won't know the government's exact target until the Autumn Statement on Thursday. But it has indicated, as is fairly standard, that it will bring down the size of the debt - the sum of all our outstanding annual deficits - relative to our national income, in the medium term (typically, five years). It's the extra money the government needs to find to meet that self-imposed target in the future that's been labelled the black hole. Covid-related support packages pushed government borrowing to its highest level since the end of World War Two. Now the cost of help for energy bills and tax cuts has raised fresh concerns about debt. Much depends on how the economy fares but the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) reckoned that, after September's tax-slashing mini-budget, over £60bn may be needed in 2027 just to stabilise the size of debt relative to national income. Many of September's tax cuts have since been reversed, but some economists still predict the government may have to find tens of billions of pounds by 2027 if it imposes such a target. The figure is uncertain, it will depend on the measures in the Autumn Statement, and the forecasts, assumptions and judgement of the government's independent watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. We don't have to look far for a cautionary tale.   September's mini-budget caused market uproar as investors feared the largest tax cuts for 50 years would leave the UK at risk of borrowing more than they were comfortable with, and also push up inflation. Those risks prompted bond investors to look for a higher return, so the interest rate - or yield - on those bonds soared, potentially adding billions to the cost of new government borrowing.  As it is, higher interest rates and inflation are already causing the government's interest on borrowing to balloon - we were already set to spend twice as much on debt interest as on defence. Following the deluge of tax U-turns, government bond yields fell back. But the lesson is clear: ignoring a black hole is costly when you're looking to financial markets for funding.  There wasn't a similar market reaction when the government was running up big bills to support the economy through Covid as it had a willing customer for its extra debt. The Bank of England was then running its own support programme - quantitative easing - which ultimately involved buying many bonds. But that was an emergency support measure, and is being unwound.   Why can't a government just print money to fund its plans? It may be tempting, but particularly in a time of rapid inflation, that could just put more pressure on prices. The magic bullet all governments crave is faster growth. That brings in more money through taxes, reduces spending on benefits and would shrink the debt compared with the size of the UK's income. But with warnings of a prolonged recession, it would be unrealistic to gamble on that.  How the government decides to find the cash, how the burden is split between tax rises and spending squeezes, is perhaps more of a political decision than an economic one.  And it may be undeniably painful when the sums are potentially so large. By way of illustration, the IFS says that saving £35bn would be equal to slashing the budget for all centrally funded public services, except defence and health, by 15%. Or, put another way, that sum is equal to more than £1 of every £8 spent on public sector wages.  What about tax rises? Freezing allowances and bands for income tax (stealth taxes) or making changes to inheritance or capital gains tax would pull tens of billions of pounds out of the economy at a time when activities are already set to slump. It would be a risky strategy, as it could prolong the downturn. Of course, the extra money doesn't need to be found until 2027. Why not wait, and leave tackling the dilemma to whoever wins the next election? You could, but it's the financial markets that the government is aiming to please, and markets are not known for their patience.  So we'll know who will pay the price very soon. The Autumn Statement may not bring much festive cheer. Instead of pre-Christmas treats, belts may be tightened further in the public sector and tax bills will rise. What it means for our money, we'll find out on 17 November."
Bond Market Forecast,Bank warning pension help to end worries investors,2024-09-14,2022-10-12,By Tom Espiner & Faisal Islam,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63223894,"Investors remained nervous after the Bank of England insisted its emergency bond-buying scheme would end this week, dismissing reports it may be extended.  It said the help would end on Friday ""as it made clear from the outset"". The Bank is buying bonds to stabilise their price and prevent a sale which could put some pension schemes at risk. Bond sales rose after the statement, with borrowing costs almost as high as when the Bank first stepped in to calm market turmoil after the mini-budget. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's plans for huge tax cuts without a clear indication of how they would be paid for sparked a dramatic reaction on financial markets last month. The pound fell to a record low and bond prices also fell sharply forcing the Bank of England to step in to stop their price falling further. The government raises money it needs for spending by selling bonds - a form of debt that is paid back plus interest in anywhere between five and 30 years. Pension funds invest in bonds because they provide a low but usually reliable return over a long period of time. However, the sharp fall in their value after the mini-budget forced pension funds to sell bonds, threatening to create a ""downward spiral"" in their prices as more were offloaded, which left some funds close to collapse. On Tuesday evening Andrew Bailey told pension funds: ""You've got three days left now and you've got to sort it out."" The pound initially fell sharply against the dollar before steadying, after Mr Bailey's surprisingly blunt statement, which dashed hopes the support could be extended.  Mr Bailey told the BBC he had stayed up all night to try and find a way to calm markets and said the Bank was doing everything it could to preserve financial stability, but said it had always been clear that the help would be temporary. He said it was now down to financial firms to arrange their affairs, saying pension funds had ""an important task"" to ensure they are resilient. ""I'm afraid this has to be done, for the sake of financial stability,"" he said. Do you have a question on how you might be affected by the Bank of England's decision? Members of the Bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC), which helps to protect UK financial stability, said on Wednesday that the governor was crystal clear the bond-buying programme would end, although other support measures would remain in place.  The recent turmoil has already fed through to the mortgage market, where hundreds of products have been suspended as the volatility has made it difficult for lenders to know how to price these long-term loans. Last week, interest rates on typical two and five-year fixed rate mortgages topped 6% for the first time in over a decade. The Bank's FPC said that this was likely to put households under severe pressure next year. Earlier, pensions industry body the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association had warned against the help ending ""too soon"". It suggested the support should be extended until 31 October, when chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is due to detail his economic plan explaining how he will balance the public finances. The statement will be accompanied by independent forecasts on the prospects for the UK economy. The government has said it remains confident in its tax cuts plan, with Mr Kwarteng telling MPs he was ""relentlessly focused on growing the economy"" and ""raising living standards"". But Mr Bailey's words further increases the pressure on the government, and the chancellor, to come up with an economically credible and politically viable debt plan, and quickly. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""This is a Tory crisis that has been made in Downing Street, and that is being paid for by working people."" Former IMF deputy director Mohamed El-Erian told BBC News that the economy was on ""shaky ground"". He said financial systems going into turmoil ""can cause a lot of damage"". In its latest World Economic Outlook report on Tuesday, the IMF acknowledged the mini-budget would ""lift growth somewhat in the near term"", although it would ""complicate the fight"" against the cost-of-living crisis."
Bond Market Forecast,Pound in biggest monthly fall since 2016,2024-09-14,2022-09-01,By Noor Nanji,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62750606,"Worries over the prospects for the UK economy led the pound to slide by about 5% against the US dollar in August. The last time the pound fell so much against the dollar was in October 2016, in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Sterling sank again on Thursday morning, dipping below $1.16 on the currency markets. Analysts said the fall reflects the darkening outlook for the economy, with consumers and businesses facing rising prices and soaring energy bills. The Bank of England has predicted the UK will fall into recession towards the end of this year. The weak pound means Brits travelling overseas will find their spending money will not stretch as far. ""Our economic prospects are not looking particularly good compared to the rest of the world,"" said Laura Lambie, senior investment director at Investec. Ms Lambie said that recession fears were weighing on markets, with the investment bank Goldman Sachs warning this week that the UK could remain in recession until 2024. A recession is defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods. August was also the worst month for the pound against the euro since the middle of last year. UK government bonds - or debt - had their worst month for decades. Investors, worried about the riskiness of lending to the government, demanded higher returns for doing so, making it more expensive for the country to borrow money. In August, the yields, or the effective interest rate you would get, on some of those bonds have jumped the most since 1994. Colin Ellis from ratings agency Moody's told the BBC's Today programme the jump in yields needed to be put in context. ""Energy bills are very very high, and set to go up again. which means inflation is going to be high and that the Bank of England is raising interest rates in response. ""Those expectations for higher interest rates are part of what's driving these moves in the bond market at the moment.""  However, he said: ""We still have a stable outlook on our UK government rating so we see the risk as broadly balanced. We're not very concerned but of course a lot will depend on the policies that the next government chooses to put into place."" Fears have grown over the prospects for the UK economy after figures showed it shrank between April and June, with businesses and households feeling the impact of rising prices. Those concerns were fuelled on Thursday, with a new study suggesting the manufacturing sector shrank in August for the first time since May 2020. Separately, a report by the Resolution Foundation think tank said typical household disposable incomes are on course to fall by 10%, or £3,000, over this year and next, which is called the ""the deepest living standards squeeze in a century"". The cost-of-living crisis is set to be the biggest challenge facing the new Prime Minister. Both Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have come under pressure to outline how they would support households if they succeed in getting the keys to Number 10. ''Grim forecasts about poverty spreading across the UK this winter highlight the deepening woes for the UK economy"", said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The Bank of England raised interest rates to 1.75% in August, while forecasting that the UK economy would fall into recession this year. But Ms Streeter predicts that the Bank of England might be forced to slow down rate rises in the coming months, given the cost of living crisis. The pound's weakness is also a result of a strong dollar, analysts said. The dollar is performing strongly due to US interest rate rises and because investors see it as a safer bet. Last week, the head of the country's central bank, the Federal Reserve, indicated it would push ahead with further interest rate rises as it seeks to control inflation. ""The dollar has been exceptionally strong,"" Ms Lambie said. ""Also, the issues that we've had in Europe around energy do not have the same impact as the US, and I think economists are fairly agreed that the US will be the last to go into recession if they do go into recession at all, perhaps following the UK and Europe. ""So on both sides, from the sterling side and from the dollar side, that's really what has weakened sterling and strengthened the dollar."""
Bond Market Forecast,Budget 2018: and now for Holyrood,2024-09-14,2018-10-29,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-46026422,"That Budget from Philip Hammond may leave you wondering what all that austerity fuss was about. Turning the deficit into a surplus was a sacred cause when George Osborne was Chancellor, and nothing would be allowed to stand in its way. Well, OK, it didn't work out as planned. Cutting public spending may well have dampened economic growth, so the targets kept being moved. The 2015 deadline was missed by a very wide margin. It was recently spotted somewhere around the middle of next decade, and receding over the horizon. The Office for Budget Responsibility told the Chancellor that he could get into a surplus earlier than 2025 if he stuck to his plans and banked the unexpected tax revenues. But he chose to have a bit of a splurge instead, turning on the spending taps a bit, with a crowd-pleasing £2.8bn tax cut by upping income tax thresholds. It turns out that getting to a surplus doesn't matter all that much after all. The debt may be humongous, but if you don't borrow much, the impact of growth and inflation is to erode its scale over time. Measured as a share of national income, it may have peaked at 85.2% in 2016-17 and it's now falling. This changes the political landscape quite a lot. Putting aside the inevitable debates about ""the end of austerity"" (there's no agreed definition of austerity), Conservatives have become the party that thinks public spending can be good for you. Fiscal conservatives aren't impressed. The Institute of Economic Affairs, which takes a largely disapproving view of tax and big government, reacted to the Budget with dismay that a Conservative government seems so relaxed that the tax burden is stuck around its current level, and debt remains so high. So are fiscal hawks active in Westminster? Or are they all too busy fighting Brexit battles to risk a new front of attack against Downing Street?  Opposition parties sound a bit non-plussed by this twist in the narrative. This is not what they expected from a Tory Chancellor. But there's an opportunity.  If Conservatives can now portray themselves as the party that's bringing an end to austerity, there are others who can do that with more conviction and enthusiasm, and also with a big borrowing and spending splurge. What does it mean for Scotland? The bigger picture is a UK economy forecast to have very strong employment and low unemployment, but with very sluggish growth for at least five years, linked to poor productivity.  Scotland shares those attributes and is affected by the rest of the UK, as its main ""export"" market. That productivity might be given a lift if businesses can be persuaded to use that big lift, for two years, in the investment allowance. It's going up from £200,000 to £1m, to address one of the economy's weakest measures. But pending clarity on Brexit, even a big lift in investment tax break is unlikely to unleash big spending on capital goods.  And those that might fit the bill are the robots that could a) do a lot of damage to employment and/or b) replace absent EU workers. The impact of changes to taxation of self-employed workers in the private sector will be felt on both sides of the border. So there are some tax changes that will be felt north of the border. In oil and gas, ""inviting evidence"" of how Scotland can be turned into a hive of decommissioning activity sounds less than urgent for something that feels at least 10 years late. With £1.8bn to be spent annually in the next decade, and £50bn over the next 40 years, others are already winning that work, from Teesside to Norway and no doubt others will emerge at a greater distance.   But the more immediate questions in Scotland start with: how to spend the £950m additional funding coming from Mr Hammond's Budget allocations?  Finance Secretary Derek Mackay will set out his plans on 12 December. He's already concerned that the long since pre-announced extra NHS funding is £50m less than expected, at £550m. That is near certain to go into health and social care. The politics of health demands it. Other funds result, for instance, from decisions to spend on the retail crisis afflicting city and town centres. Scotland has very similar problems. Mr Mackay doesn't have to spend on the same priorities as Mr Hammond, but with concerns about ""high streets"", he will need to have a compelling reason for not doing so. Meanwhile, ministers reckon that other budgets in Whitehall have taken a cut, and these have also been passed on through the Barnett Formula block grant. Expect more detail on that when they've had time to analyse the newly-published numbers. The other side of the ledger requires Derek Mackay to say how he responds to the unexpected changes to income tax band thresholds. The rise in the starting threshold from £11,380 to £12,500 will apply throughout the UK, That will take more people out of paying tax altogether, and there's nothing Mr Mackay can do about it. The higher rate of Westminster income tax, at 40p in the pound, will soon start at £50,000 of income. As things stand this fiscal year, Scottish income tax introduced a 41% tax rate at £43,430.  With a five-band income tax structure to Westminster's three bands, Holyrood ministers are able both to ratchet up a more progressive tax system, and use increased complexity to obscure the extent of divergence.  Next year's income tax bill for someone earning £50,000 in England will be £7,500, excluding all sorts of allowances. If nothing were to change in Holyrood's tax rates and thresholds for 2018-19, someone earning the same in Scotland would be paying £8,927.  The difference is £1,427. If that Scottish threshold goes up with inflation, the difference would be closer to £1,100. And for every pound earned above £50,000, a Scot pays one more penny per pound in income tax than someone in England. An additional complication is that for every pound earned between the Scottish higher rate, currently at £43,430, and Westminster's £50,000 threshold, there is a National Insurance charge of 12p. (NICs are all set at Westminster.) Marginal rates of income tax-plus NICs in Scotland therefore rise to 53p in the pound for that tranche of earnings, and fall back to 43p for every pound above £50,000. That's unlikely to persuade people they should move south of the border to pay less tax. But as a signal of divergence, and no word on where the divergence might end, it could have an impact on those thinking of a move to Scotland. Without moving your home anywhere, income can be moved around, as explained by Moira Kelly, of the Chartered Institute of Taxation: ""For those who are able to - such as self-employed business owners - this is likely to increase attractiveness of reorganising their tax arrangements to opt out of Scottish income tax and into UK-wide corporation tax in order to reduce their liabilities."" That's how taxes become uncompetitive, and how higher taxes can constrain growth. Mr Mackay will be weighing up those considerations ahead of 12 December. He will also have to weigh up what is required to get some opposition support to get his budget passed at Holyrood. There were some brief asides in Philip Hammond's Budget speech that are worth keeping an eye on.  One is the spending review, which he said will take place next year.  He didn't have much detail on when, or over how long. Perhaps it is just that Brexit is making the Treasury cautious about committing itself to all the work involved. The other is the question of social care. Whitehall is soon to set out its options.  This is a very difficult but very important topic. It was mishandled spectacularly by Theresa May during last year's election campaign, sparking a political storm that looked to have knocked the issue into the long grass for many years to come. But remember that the Institute of Fiscal Studies has been warning for some years that the ""consolidation"" of public finances we've been through in the past eight years, and which may now have been conveniently set to one side without reaching the advertised destination, is on the same scale as the consolidation that will be required to deal with demographic pressure on public services and welfare spending. * An earlier version of this article had a lower figure for the gap between Westminster and Holyrood income tax bills for someone earning £50,000."
Bond Market Forecast,Dow falls more than 4% amid coronavirus stock rout,2024-09-14,2020-02-27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51664652,"Financial markets suffered a sixth day of losses on Thursday, as traders dumped shares on fears that the spread of coronavirus will hobble the global economy. In the US, the Dow Jones plunged nearly 1,200 points to lose 4.4%. It was the sharpest points-drop in history. The S&P 500 ended 4.4% lower, while the Nasdaq dropped 4.6%. Earlier, London's FTSE 100 finished 3.5% lower, while Japan's Nikkei 225 led Asian losses, falling more than 2%. The string of declines has pushed indexes in Europe and the US down more than 10% from their recent highs - sending them into so-called ""correction"" territory. The tumult comes as the coronavirus, which started in China, spreads rapidly around the world, restricting travel, upending global supply chains and prompting shoppers in some countries to stay home. ""Markets move sharply when fear and uncertainty are prevalent, and there is plenty of both right now,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com.  Indexes in the US and London were poised for their the biggest weekly losses since the 2008 financial crisis, as the Dow retreated to levels last seen in August.  Investors rushed into less risky investments, such as government debt, sending bond yields to record lows. Globally, the share price declines of the last six days have wiped out more than $3.6tn (£2.8tn) in value. The declines follow warnings from dozens of companies - from mining firm Rio Tinto to software giant Microsoft - that they will not hit sales targets. On Thursday, Facebook said it would cancel a conference for developers, scheduled for May. Economists, many of whom had originally expected the virus to be a temporary blow, are also sounding warnings. At an event on Wednesday, former US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen suggested it could tip the US into recession, while Goldman Sachs told clients it did not expect companies to see any profit growth this year. ""Our reduced profit forecasts reflect the severe decline in Chinese economic activity... lower end-demand for US exporters, disruption to the supply chain for many US firms, a slowdown in US economic activity, and elevated business uncertainty,"" the firm wrote. The coronavirus has infected nearly 79,000 people in China and killed more than 2,700. More than 3,200 cases and 51 deaths have been reported in another 44 countries. Investors around the world are now looking to see if central banks respond with efforts to prop up the economy. Chinas's central bank has already taken stimulative measures.  Germany's Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said that while the impact of the virus so far had been limited, the country was considering how to respond should it worsen."
Bond Market Forecast,Tax rises needed to stop 'irresponsible' debt,2024-09-14,2021-03-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56266683,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned that a spending spree to support workers and spur investment will be followed by tax rises as the economy recovers. The UK's rapid Covid-19 vaccine rollout is expected to help the economy get back to its pre-pandemic size six months sooner than previously expected. Official forecasts expect growth to hit 4% this year, while an extension of the furlough scheme will limit job losses. Mr Sunak said future tax hikes were needed to stop ""irresponsible"" debt. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said the UK had been at the ""vanguard"" of the discovery of new and effective vaccines. It said this will foster a ""swifter and more sustained"" economic recovery, with the pace of growth expected to strengthen to 7.3% in 2022. This would be the highest growth rate since official records began in 1949 and help the economy to return to its pre-pandemic size in the middle of next year. Mr Sunak unveiled plans to spend tens of billions of pounds more over the next two years to support the economic recovery, including tax breaks designed to encourage business investment.  However, the chancellor said tax rises were also needed to help repair the public finances. Mr Sunak announced that corporation tax will rise from 19% to 25% for large companies in 2023, while day-to-day spending by government departments will be cut by a further £4bn a year. Mr Sunak said it would be ""irresponsible to allow our future borrowing and debt to rise unchecked"". Chris Sanger, head of tax policy at EY, described the Budget as ""three years of support, followed by three years (and more) of pain"". Mr Sanger added: ""Time [is] the Chancellor's friend in his aim of replenishing the Government's coffers.""  The government's target to have all adults vaccinated this summer is expected to pave the way for the lifting of public health restrictions. The OBR noted that British households had built up a savings war chest of around £180bn in the past year. It expects a quarter of this to be spent as lockdowns end, saying there could be a ""degree of euphoria"", especially among better-off households who ""treat themselves"" when the economy opens up. The main thrust of this Budget is significant extra immediate crisis support, both in terms of the furlough scheme and self employed support, and a radical ""super-deduction"" policy to encourage business investment right now.. That is £60bn extra in one year and it comes from borrowed money. That leaves borrowing in the coming financial year significantly higher than expected. A much larger proportion of the exceptional world war-style borrowing over the past year will stay in place in the coming year. The happy result of this is that unemployment, though rising, peaks at a much lower level than previous expectations, just over 6%, rather than, say, 10%. This is a consequence of both the vaccine rollout and the support package, leading to a reopening of the economy over summer. The jabs and then the jobs. But then the payback, with a massive rise in £16bn corporation tax and the £8bn changes to thresholds for the last two years of the Parliament. The Conservative manifesto commitments on not increasing VAT, income tax or national insurance are binding here.  So Rishi Sunak is left with the first rise in corporation tax since Dennis Healey's 1974 Budget. It turns a careful strategy of using corporation tax as a lever for foreign investment on its head. For many in the vanguard of the Conservative Brexit movement, very low levels of this tax were one of the building blocks of ""Singapore-on-Thames"". Singapore is staying in South East Asia. The timing of this tax rise at the end of a Parliament is not the normal order of things. But the Covid pandemic is far from normal.  However, the watchdog warned that economic uncertainty remained ""considerable"", and would depend on controlling variants of the virus. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the chancellor was ""betting on a recovery fuelled by a consumer spending blitz"". He added: ""The chancellor may think that this is time for a victory lap, but I'm afraid this Budget won't feel so good for the millions of key workers who are having their pay frozen, for the businesses swamped by debt, and the families paying more in council tax."" Unemployment is expected to peak at a lower rate of 6.5%, keeping it well below levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis. However, this means half a million more people are expected to be out of work by the end of this year. Government borrowing is expected to rise to a peacetime high of £354.6bn this year to help pay for economic support measures. The size of the UK's debt pile is also expected to remain larger than the economy until at least the middle of the decade. Mr Sunak said: ""It's going to take this country - and the whole world - a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover."" From April, he will also freeze the amount of money employees earn before paying income tax at £12,570 until the middle of the decade. The OBR estimates an extra 1.3 million people will start to pay income tax by 2026 as a result of the freeze. The level at which employees start paying the higher, 40% rate of tax will also be frozen at £50,270 from April, dragging an extra million people into the band within five years."
Bond Market Forecast,Odeon to open weekends-only at some cinemas,2024-09-14,2020-10-05,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54387856,"Odeon is cutting the opening hours for some of its cinemas in the UK and Ireland to weekends only because of delays to new film releases. The chain, which operates 120 theatres, said it will affect a quarter of its cinemas, which will now open between Friday and Sunday. Odeon, which employs 5,500 people, declined to comment on job cuts. It comes as Cineworld said it will temporarily close its UK and US venues, affecting 45,000 jobs. According to movie magazine Film Stories, Odeon emailed customers to tell them that from Friday 9 October it was temporarily reducing hours at some cinemas ""in light of the ongoing delays to the release of many new films"". The changes announced by Odeon and Cineworld come after the release of the new James Bond film was delayed again. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to return to cinemas. He said would ""encourage people to go out to the cinema, enjoy themselves and support"" movie theatres. However, the cinema industry has been hit by an absence of blockbuster movie to lure in customers.  Cineworld employs around 5,500 people in the UK and its chief executive Mooky Greidinger, said: ""We did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings in all of our markets.""  The company did not give a date for reopening its 663 cinemas, which include 127 Cineworld and Picturehouse theatres in the UK. Mr Greidinger said the company ""cannot underscore enough how difficult this decision was"" to close the sites. ""Cineworld will continue to monitor the situation closely and will communicate any future plans to resume operations in these markets at the appropriate time, when key markets have more concrete guidance on their reopening status and, in turn, studios are able to bring their pipeline of major releases back to the big screen,"" he said. Rosalyn Lloyd, 30, found out that her job at a Cineworld theatre in Wolverhampton was under threat from social media at the weekend. And she still doesn't know if she'll get a wage this month. ""We've been told nothing at all,"" Ms Lloyd told the BBC. ""When I went to work yesterday, everyone had seen it on social media [and] everyone was down in the dumps which is understandable. ""One woman was crying because she'd been there for nine years."" Ms Lloyd has worked at Cineworld for nearly two years and was placed on furlough earlier this year, though she says because she is on a zero-hour contract the pay was ""very low"". Her immediate problem is a lack of information from Cineworld. ""Are they still going to pay us at the end of October? We just haven't heard anything at the moment. We all are waiting for a call - it is a waiting game."" ""No Time to Die"", which is reportedly actor Daniel Craig's final outing as 007, is a key movie release that had been due in cinemas in April this year, but was then postponed until November because of the coronavirus pandemic. The release date has now been moved to April next year. ""I think the Bond movie is the straw that broke the camel's back to be honest,"" said Robert Mitchell, director of theatrical insights at Gower Street Analytics. ""A lot of films have been moving for some time now and ultimately the cinemas need a pipeline of regular content to draw cinema goers in,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.  While Christopher Nolan's film Tenet opened at the end of August, Mr Mitchell said there had not been a major release since.  ""Bond was really the one that UK exhibitors were really relying on more than any,"" he said. Shares in Cineworld plunged in early trading, down 27% at 28.74p each. Tim Richards, founder and chief executive of the Vue cinema chain, said the company had put safety measures in place at its theatres and noted there was ""pent up demand like we haven't seen ever before"" among customers to go out. However, he added: ""Our problem right now is we have no movies and this [the delay to the Bond film] was a big blow for us."" ""We are likely going to make it through,"" Mr Richards said, adding that Vue's goal is to try to keep as many of its 5,500 workers as possible. Mr Mitchell said he had forecast previously that UK box office takings would reach £500m this year. ""The Bond move obviously shaves a lot off that,"" he said. ""And now that Cineworld is closing and we don't know when it will be reopening, it might be a struggle to get over £400m."" Mr Richards said that outside the US, many cinemas had now re-opened. ""Looking globally right now, 75% of screens, maybe as high as 80% of screens are open.  ""Even if you look at the numbers that Tenet generated in the UK it is going to get very close to Christopher Nolan's previous film Interstellar, maybe 80-90% of what it did.  ""The audience is there and I think what we are seeing is the US studios in particular are taking a very US-centric view and forgetting that 80% of global box office comes offshore from North America."""
Bond Market Forecast,Bank boosts plan to reassure investors,2024-09-14,2022-10-10,By Nick Edser,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63198341,"The Bank of England has announced new measures aimed at ensuring an ""orderly end"" to its emergency bond buying scheme which was introduced to stop a collapse of some pension funds.  The Bank will increase the amount of bonds it can buy in the final week of the scheme, which ends on Friday.  It will also introduce extra support to ease future strains on pension funds.  The Bank initially stepped in after the government's mini-budget sparked turmoil on financial markets. With the deadline for the Bank's bond-buying programme fast approaching, there have been concerns volatility would return once the scheme ends. However, Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the Bank was taking the approach of ""talking loudly and carrying a big stick"" in its attempt to calm concerns, He said the measures are ""designed to reassure pension managers - and pension holders - that help will be provided"".  He added that the Bank's announcement reaffirms that the bond purchases were a short-term measure and ""it remains committed to withdrawing monetary stimulus and tightening monetary policy as it fights inflation"". The mini-budget - which was announced on 23 September - pledged £45bn of tax cuts as part of a plan to boost economic growth, but the level of government borrowing required shocked investors who questioned the sustainability of the public finances. In the aftermath of the statement, the pound hit a record low and investors demanded a much higher return for investing in government bonds, causing some to drop sharply in value. Certain types of funds in the pension industry, which invest in bonds, were forced to start selling, sparking fears of a fresh market downturn. On 28 September, the Bank stepped in to buy government bonds saying its decision was driven by concern over ""a material risk to UK financial stability"". It said it would buy up to £65bn bonds, with a limit of £5bn a day. So far, the Bank has bought only around £5bn bonds in total under the programme and in its latest announcement it said stood ready to increase the size of its daily purchases. On Monday, it doubled the limit to £10bn. This intervention is about a transition off the Bank of England emergency support offered in government bond markets, in the aftermath of the mini-budget. The Bank of England is trying to leave no stone unturned in making sure the withdrawal of this support occurs in an orderly manner. But the Bank is also committing to the timetable to phase out the support this week. Some in the markets had anticipated it would need to be extended. The Bank is demonstrating that this intervention is not intended to limit the rise in government costs, but instead was a temporary and targeted effort aimed at maintaining financial stability. This is the message heard in markets on Monday, with effective borrowing costs, or yields, on government debt on the rise again. These rates were over 4.5% for borrowing over 30 years and five years. The big picture is this: if the Treasury wants to bring down now rising government borrowing costs - which have an effect on mortgages and business lending too - it is up to it to present a credible set of tax and spending plans and independent forecasts, which are now promised for the end of October. The forecasts and the plan will now feed into the Bank of England's interest rate decision in early November. The Bank of England's intervention was a temporary bridge over a specific crisis. The solution here is for the government. The government borrows money to fund its spending plans by selling bonds, or ""gilts"", to investors such as pension funds and big banks on international markets. But a collapse in the price of those bonds in the aftermath of the mini-budget was forcing some funds to rush to sell bonds further forcing down the price. If that process had continued, there was a risk that those pension funds could have got to a position where they could not pay their debts. In its latest statement, the Bank said there had been ""substantial progress"" in addressing the financial problems facing these funds, which had faced the prospect of having to make forced sales of £50bn of bonds. As well as increasing the daily limit on bond purchases this week, the Bank also announced a further measure to help the funds affected by the recent market volatility. Under the measure, these funds will be able to use a wider range of assets - such as company bonds - to access money to help meet any short-term financial demands. It is hoped this means these funds will not be forced to sell government bonds to raise cash, which was what they had to do in the immediate aftermath of the mini-budget. This measure will continue after the emergency bond-buying programme has finished. Before the mini-budget, the yield on government borrowing over a 30-year period stood at about 3.7%. The yield is effectively the interest rate. After the mini-budget it jumped to 5.1% until the Bank's intervention pushed the rate back down. However, in recent days it has crept back up again to around 4.5%."
Bond Market Forecast,"Too early to know Rogan row impact, Spotify says",2024-09-14,2022-02-03,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60239263,"Spotify's boss says it is ""too early to know"" how the controversy over Joe Rogan's podcast, which averages 11m listeners an episode, has hit the firm. Musicians, including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, asked for their music to be removed from the platform after criticism that the US broadcaster has helped to spread Covid misinformation. It comes as Spotify projected slower subscriber growth for this quarter. The streaming company's shares fell by more than 10% in after-hours trading.  ""Usually when we've had controversies in the past, those are measured in months, not days,"" Spotify's chief executive Daniel Ek told investors. ""We don't change our policies based on one creator, nor do we change based on any media cycle or calls from anyone else,"" he added. The company said revenue for the last three months of 2021 rose to 2.69bn euros (£2.2bn; $3bn), easily beating market expectations. However, the firm missed analysts' predictions as it forecast that it would have 183m paying subscribers this quarter. Spotify added that the outlook was ""subject to substantial uncertainty"" due to the pandemic.  This week, Spotify said it was working to add advisory warnings to any podcast discussing Covid-19.  The company also made public rules which give it the power to remove or suspend users and podcasts that promote dangerous falsehoods. These are similar to those adopted by social media platforms Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Mr Ek said the advisory will direct listeners to a resource hub with facts, information from experts, and ""links to trusted sources"". ""This new effort to combat misinformation will roll out to countries around the world in the coming days,"" he said. ""To our knowledge, this content advisory is the first of its kind by a major podcast platform."" Mr Rogan also pledged to try harder to offer more balanced views on his podcast. In an almost 10-minute long Instagram video posted on Monday, he said he would ""try harder to get people with differing opinions"" on his show.  The announcements came after several musicians and podcasters asked for their content to be taken off Spotify. Last week, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell had their music removed from the streaming platform. They were followed by Soul musician India Arie and British singer-songwriter Graham Nash, with India Arie saying her decision was partly due to Mr Rogan's ""language around race"". Mary Trump, the niece of former US President Donald Trump, has said she had also deleted her podcast from Spotify. ""I know it's not a big deal but hope it will be part of a growing avalanche,"" she said on Twitter."
Bond Market Forecast,Slovenia unveils rescue measures,2024-09-14,2013-05-09,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-22462604,"Slovenia's new Prime Minister, Alenka Bratusek, is hoping to avoid an EU bailout The government of Slovenia has announced a package of measures it hopes will help avoid an EU bailout. The measures include a tax increase, a major restructuring of Slovenia's ailing banking sector, and a programme of mass privatisation. Slovenia's mostly state-owned banking sector is suffering from mounting bad debts and the government has struggled to borrow money. The European Commission will now consider the plan. It is expected to deliver its verdict by the end of the month. Slovenia has been in recession since 2011, and analysts have cited it as the most likely country to seek help from the EU following the bailout of Cyprus earlier this year. European officials have expressed concern over the stability of the country's banking sector, which is struggling under billions of euros of bad debts.  Meanwhile the government's ability to borrow money was dealt a blow last week when Moody's, a ratings agency, cut Slovenia's bonds to ""junk"" status. Despite this, the government was able to raise 3.5bn euros (£3bn; $4.6bn) from international bond markets last week, which has bought it some time. The package of measures was announced by Slovenia's recently installed Prime Minister, Alenka Bratusek, and her Finance Minister, Uros Cufer. The measures include a 2% increase in VAT to shore up government finances.  A ""bad bank"" will also be created to allow the banking sector to offload its bad debts.  Meanwhile a total of 15 publicly-owned businesses will be sold off, including the second biggest bank, Nova KBM, the flag-carrying airline, Adria Airways, and Telekom Slovenia. The biggest bank, NLB, has already announced plans to downsize. Announcing the measures, Ms Bratusek said she expected the budget deficit to rise to 7.8% of GDP this year, but was forecast to fall to 3.3% next year. She also said the VAT increase was decided on as the tax rise with the least impact on economic growth. Slovenia is seeking to avoid becoming the latest in a string of EU countries to seek a bailout from European authorities. Earlier this year Cyprus agreed a 10bn euro bailout with the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after its banking sector faced near collapse.

Bond Market Forecast,US shares suffer sharpest drop in months,2024-09-14,2018-10-10,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45815183,"US share markets have suffered their sharpest one-day falls in months, as fears about rising interest rates, inflation and trade tensions climbed. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the declines, sliding 4%, or 315.9 points, to 7,422. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 also fell by more than 3%, with losses accelerating towards the end of the day. Netflix fell 8%, while Amazon slid 6%. The slides extended declines in Europe, where exchanges in Germany and France ended the day down more than 2%. The Dow fell 831.8 points, or 3.15% to 25,598.7. The S&P 500 dropped 94.6 or 3.29% to 2,785.6 - the biggest one-day fall since early February. US markets have done better than expected this year, bouncing back after turmoil early in the year to set new records over the summer. But the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, a move that tends to make it more expensive for companies to borrow, hurting bottom lines and turning stocks into a less attractive investment.  The White House issued a statement on Wednesday saying the economy remains healthy. But US President Donald Trump also cast blame on the Fed, which he has repeatedly criticised for raising rates. The central bank has ""gone crazy"", he told reporters. The stock market fall came ahead of America's corporate earnings season, when companies will provide updates to investors about their outlook for the rest of the year. ""The big concern isn't really what third quarter earnings numbers are, but really what the outlook for the fourth quarter and first quarters are,"" Oliver Pursche, vice chairman and chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management, in New York, said. Company costs, such as pay, are rising, and data on published on Wednesday showed a pick-up in inflation. US tariffs on steel, aluminium and Chinese goods are another factor that could drive up costs and force companies to lower their forecasts, Mr Pursche said. ""I suspect that's one of the things underlying market concern,"" he said. Shares in the US energy sector saw some of the steepest declines on Wednesday, as investors reacted to shutdowns caused by Hurricane Michael in Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. Oil exploration firms Hess Corp and Marathon Oil fell more than 7%, while Chevron was down about 3%. Big tech companies also dropped, with shares in Google and Apple falling almost 5%. The sell-off picked up late in the day, sending investors towards bonds. But for the most part, bond prices have remained relatively low. Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA, said she thinks that is a sign that investors are not yet retreating from the stock market. She predicted that shares would rebound as the earnings season gets underway, noting that strong results soothed investors when concerns about inflation triggered turmoil earlier in the year. ""You saw earnings season take off and really stabilise the market,"" she said, adding that underlying economic data remains healthy. ""We're optimistic that is going to happen here."""
Bond Market Forecast,Rees-Mogg says market turmoil not due to mini-budget,2024-09-14,2022-10-12,By Beth Timmins,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63230001,"Jacob Rees-Mogg has claimed market turmoil is not linked to the mini-budget in which the chancellor announced big tax cuts without the usual analysis of the economic impact. The business secretary said volatility was ""more to do with interest rates than a minor part of fiscal policy."" He said the Bank of England had not raised rates as fast as the US. But economists and some MPs said the plans had worried investors, pointing to the surge in borrowing costs. Investors are often wary of putting money into countries that are increasing their debt. And if a country raises its interest rates it means investors will get a bigger return on their money if they put it into that country's banks and assets. After the mini-budget, the pound plunged and government borrowing costs surged. ""What has caused the effect in pension funds... is not necessarily the mini-budget. It could just as easily be the fact that the day before the Bank of England did not raise interest rates as much as the (US) Federal Reserve did,"" he said. ""Jumping to conclusions about causality is not meeting the BBC's requirement for impartiality"" he said, after a suggestion the chancellor's actions had been the trigger for the fluctuations in the value of the pound and government bonds. At the first PMQs since the mini-budget, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Prime Minister Liz Truss of ""ducking the question"" when asked whether she agreed with the business secretary. Ms Truss said the government had taken ""decisive action"", adding ""as a result of our action... we will see higher growth and lower inflation."" Separately, speaking at the Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday Deutsche Bank's chief UK economist Sanjay Raja said the mini-budget on 23 September was the ""straw that broke the camel's back"". He said the ""trade shock"" because of Brexit is a factor, and added: ""You throw on the 23 September event, you've got a side-lined financial watchdog, you've got lack of a medium-term fiscal plan, one of the largest unfunded tax cuts we've seen since the early 1970s, it was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back."" The Resolution Foundation's Torsten Bell said it was clear the huge package of cuts, which was downgraded to £43bn after Mr Kwarteng's U-turn on the top rate of income tax, should not have happened in the current financial climate. He said the sacking of the Treasury's top civil servant Sir Tom Scholar and the lack of a report on the economic impact from independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had contributed to investor unease. ""It was no surprise to any of us that this is where you end up"". ""This is what happens if you aren't paying attention,"" he said. ""It was always going to be hard but it was exactly because it was always going to be hard that you don't do this."" The latest official statistics showed the economy unexpectedly shrank in August, strengthening predictions that it will fall into a recession. Professor Jagjit Chadha, director of National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) told the Commons Treasury Committee that the ""real danger"" seen after the mini-budget was ""obviously on the back of what can only be described as guerrilla tactics against our independent economic institutions over the summer - the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility"".  Gerard Lyons, an economist who advised Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng during the leadership contest, speaking on the BBC's World at One programme admitted that the mini-budget ""misread"" the country's financial situation.  However, he argued that everything that has happened was not ""solely due to the mini-budget"" but also down to parts of the financial system that were vulnerable to interest rates going up.  The Bank of England has warned interest rates could rise again after the value of the pound plummeted, following the government's decision to cut taxes and borrow more.  After the market turmoil, it stepped in with an emergency bond-buying intervention designed to stabilise the economy but said this scheme would end on Friday. Deputy Governor Ramsden said he was ""acutely"" aware that millions of households and businesses were experiencing ""real hardship"", noting that ""many"" of the policy actions were ""adding to the difficulties caused by the current situation"".   Prime Minister Liz Truss has said the promised tax cuts will boost UK economic growth and therefore help pay for themselves. The chancellor has committed to fast tracking the independent forecast by the OBR, the independent budget watchdog, at the same time as his economic plan detailing how he will pay for the planned tax cuts - which is now due to be announced on 31 October."
Bond Market Forecast,Fed to start unwinding bond portfolio,2024-09-14,2017-09-20,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41341502,"The Federal Reserve has said that it will start to run down some of the investments it made to boost the US economy after the financial crisis. In October the Fed will start to reduce a $4.2trn portfolio of US Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, it said. It will initially cut up to $10bn each month from the amount it reinvests. It also said it will hold benchmark interest rates steady, and signalled a rate hike by the end of 2017. The move to unwind the portfolio the Fed acquired during its crisis-era bond-buying programmes was widely anticipated. What is the US Federal Reserve doing? Analysts say the decision could lead long-term borrowing costs to rise modestly. But Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said she believes the US economy is ready for less economic stimulus. ""We feel the economy is performing well and we have confidence in the outlook,"" Ms Yellen said. Fed officials are predicting economic growth of 2.4% in 2017, a stronger expansion than they anticipated in June. Ms Yellen said the hardship caused Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria may hurt growth in coming months but she does not expect it to ""materially alter the course of the national economy in the medium term"". ""Growth likely will bounce back,"" she said. Ms Yellen said officials were watching inflation closely. This year, it has lagged below the Fed's 2% target and the forecast now suggests it will continue to do so in 2018. Ms Yellen said she thinks the sluggish inflation rate is the result of temporary factors including lower cell phone costs that don't reflect underlying economic trends.  But she acknowledged some uncertainty: ""Our understanding of the forces driving inflation isn't perfect,"" she said. Despite the lagging inflation, a majority of officials see room for another rise in the key interest rate target set by the Federal Reserve before the end of the year, according to the economic forecast released after Wednesday's meeting. But the predictions may be less useful now, because of the high number of vacancies in key Fed positions, said Mekael Teshome, an economist for Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services Group. Policymakers have signalled their plans for the Fed balance sheet for months in an effort to avoid rattling markets. US stocks initially fell after the announcement, but pared losses by the end of the day, with both the Dow and the wider S&P 500 closing at new highs. ""Today's meeting really was just confirmation of what we already knew,"" said Mr Teshome. ""It's the beginning of the end for these extraordinary measures."" The Fed pursued three rounds of quantitative easing between 2008 and 2014 to stimulate the economy after the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. Mr Teshome said the economy should be able to handle the shift as the Fed stops reinvesting proceeds from those holdings. ""The slight upward pressure [on rates] won't be enough to derail the expansion,"" he said."
Bond Market Forecast,How US wine got so expensive,2024-09-14,2023-11-22,Vince Mancini,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231121-how-us-wine-became-so-expensive,"American consumers are experiencing sticker shock for domestic wines. How did US bottles get so expensive? Around the world, wine prices have been rising. Imbibers in the US – the largest wine-consuming country in the world – are especially feeling the price squeeze on certain domestic bottles. ""There's been kind of an unprecedented move upward in price recently,"" says Andrew Adams, editor of Wine Business Analytics. An inflation economy certainly plays a role; prices are, of course, rising across the board on all sorts of goods and services. But Adams and other wine-industry experts also point to other factors, including broader international economic concerns, restrictive pricing mechanisms in the US and extreme weather, all combining to drive up prices of wine and even leave many aspects of the industry's future uncertain.  Raw materials, consumer perceptions Winemakers – especially small vineyards – are among the many manufacturers who have felt the squeeze of supply-chain issues in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the US, winemakers rely on glass manufacturers in Europe, a region where the cost of natural gas – a key component in the production of glass – shot up following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. With the price of glass up as much as 20% in the US past year, winemakers in the US are spending more to bottle their products. Adams adds costs have ballooned for other packaging materials as well. ""It's also the labels, the printing costs, corks, capsules – everything has gone up fairly dramatically in price."" Often, says Shalini Sekhar, winemaker and proprietor of Ottavino Wines, in California, vineyards have a short window of time to bottle their products, which can leave them at the behest of their suppliers' prices. ""To actually get the wine to your consumer, you're going to pay whatever it takes,"" she says.  Labour costs have increased at the same time, which means it's also more expensive to get fruit off the vine and into bottles, explains Cameron Hughes of Cameron Hughes Wine, a California-based winery that specialises in high-end blends. ""Picking grapes costs more, grape contract prices over the past five to 10 years have gone up precipitously,"" he says. Many of these additional expenses have been passed onto the consumer at the till. This was especially the case during the pandemic, when some winemakers offset rising costs by raising prices as alcohol sales spiked, and consumers tolerated paying more amid inflated demand. Yet even though demand has fallen since the pandemic, drinkers are now conditioned to seeing higher prices – and are still paying them, leaving little necessity for winemakers to drop them to move product, especially on high-margin bottles. Additionally, in the wine industry, says Adams, a bottle's price point is inelastic in a way many other sectors are not. It's an important signal to the shopper – consumers often believe a lower price point is indicative of lower quality. Even if consumption falls – a supply-and-demand event that generally leads to lower costs – he says dropping wine prices in lock step can change consumers' perception of the wine itself, in ways that largely can't be undone when demand rebounds. The wholesaler's role The US wine industry has a ""three-tier"" distribution system, which significantly impacts how wine is priced. Regulated by the US government, this approach dictates that producers, such as brewers, distilleries and vintners, must sell to distributers or wholesalers. This intermediary tier then sells to retailers, including liquor stores and restaurants, where consumers purchase the product. Much of the wine market is controlled by the three major wholesalers, who wield outsize influence over wine producers and sellers. Since winemakers depend on these wholesalers for widespread distribution, they are often beholden to wholesale pricing trends.  ""Once your foot is in the door in an account, you're going to want to keep that placement,"" says Ottavino's Sekhar, especially as a smaller winery, which needs to have the marketing exposure. ""And so, when you're pushed on price, you're likely going to bend to that."" As wholesalers dictate pricing in an uncertain economic climate, wine producers face razor-thin margins on lower-priced wines. This means they are increasingly incentivised to focus on producing and selling mid- and high-priced wines to recover their costs – the consumers of which are generally less price sensitive, and also less likely to drop wine for other spirits.  Additionally, Hughes says that as younger consumers are increasingly favouring alcohol and spiked seltzer to wine, producers have responded by making fewer entry-level priced bottles, leaving higher-priced wine as the main option on the shelves. Climate considerations Should consumers expect these inflated prices to be the new normal – or perhaps expect to see their totals at the till keep climbing? The answer, of course, depends on the international economy and supply chain as well as wholesale pricing trends. However, there's another wild card in play that makes foretelling the future of wine – both what consumers pay per bottle, and what's inside the bottle itself – even less certain: climate change. Predictability has traditionally been a major factor in the wine industry's success and viability. The ability to correctly forecast yields and flavour profiles one year to the next not only plays into pricing, but also is essential to maintain the quality of product mandated by distribution contracts. It's even integral to keep up essential, revenue-driving vineyard tourism. Now, in the grape-growing regions of the US, as in many places, climate change is causing erratic weather patterns that are keeping winemakers from predicting how their harvests will turn out – a ripple effect that extends to price and beyond. As extreme weather events become more common in winemaking regions – like 2020 and 2021's wildfires, 2022's record temperatures and 2023's unceasing rain – those days of consistency, say many vintners, may be over. ""I romanticise some of the stories I heard when I was first starting out as a winemaker. The old timers were saying, like, 'Oh, we always picked the Wednesday after Labor Day',"" says Sekhar. ""That's not how that works at all anymore. Now, [grape varieties] come in whenever they want to come in, and they come in at different sugars and different ripeness, and the flavour comes on at different alcohol levels."" As climate change continues, nearly every element of the consumer experience with wine is up in the air. That could be the highest price of all. Update 23 Nov 23: This article has been updated to remove an incorrect statistic about the direct to consumer wine market"
Bond Market Forecast,Will the UK financial chaos spark a wider meltdown?,2024-09-14,2022-10-14,By Natalie Sherman,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63221410,"The recent chaos on the UK financial markets has generated waves of stress and selling by investors far beyond the UK. As the sell-offs collide with high inflation, rising interest rates and the war in Ukraine, they have raised fears the turmoil in the UK could set off a wider crisis. Many analysts have said they believe the fallout is likely to be limited, especially amid signs that the government is reconsidering some of its plans. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng was sacked on Friday, and the government has dropped parts of the package of tax cuts that initially sparked the market turmoil. But the episode has highlighted the financial risks of the current moment. ""Markets are fragile. We have seen vulnerability that's been building over the last decade-plus,"" Fabio Natalucci, a deputy director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said earlier this week, describing the UK episode as a ""warning shot"".  ""That fragility makes the financial risk much more elevated.""  Borrowing costs in the UK shot up last month, triggered by Mr Kwarteng's announcement of £45bn of tax cuts in his mini-budget, which the government said would help reignite economic growth.  But he did not say how he would pay for them, which alarmed investors already worried about the UK's dim economic prospects. They swiftly sold off their holdings of UK government debt, also called bonds or gilts. The sell-off in UK government bonds prompted a dramatic change in their value.  Prices dropped and investors demanded a higher interest rate for holding a riskier investment, creating major volatility in what is usually considered a stable, safe investment.  That kind of swing can have big ripple effects, as investment firms adjust their holdings to cover losses and the increased risk. In the UK, some of the first cracks appeared at pension funds, giant investment firms that manage people's retirement savings and typically put a big chunk towards investments like government debt. Facing losses that were at risk of spiralling, pension funds pleaded for help from the Bank of England, which agreed to step in and buy government debt as an emergency intervention. In fact, the Bank of England ended up stepping in three times. The sudden rise in borrowing costs also meant chaos for the UK housing market, where mortgage rates on typical two and five-year fixed deals have jumped to more than 6% for the first time in over a decade. Analysts expect the rise in mortgage rates to spark a fall in property prices, meaning that another investment often seen as pretty safe is suffering a major, rapid change in value.   Interest rates on some US and European government debt have also jumped alongside the UK's. And as UK firms respond to the changing market, they have dumped some of their riskier assets, creating knock-on effects. For example, selling of collateralised loan obligations (CLOs), a term for bundles of corporate debt, jumped in the weeks after the UK announcement, the Wall Street Journal reported. That is a part of the market that some already saw as full of financial risks.   ""There is a general sense of unease in financial markets because we never know where the landmines are buried,"" said economist Barry Eichengreen, professor at the University of California, Berkeley.   ""People are worried about which insurance companies and which pension funds and which bond markets are in a delicate state at the moment and we never know for sure. ""When bad things happen anywhere, people pause and global risk aversion rises."" IMF officials said last week that global financial instability was now verging on crisis levels, as investors pull back. ""We are certainly at a stressed moment,"" said Tobias Adrian, financial counsellor at the IMF warned, noting that indicators of strain, like demand for dollars, have surged. ""The only times when things were worse was in times of acute crisis."" The organisation did not forecast a major financial blow-up, noting that the traditional banking system in major economies like the US and UK has become more resilient in response to regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. But there are more vulnerabilities in emerging markets, where the Fund estimates that 29% of banks are at risk of financial problems in the event of a sudden, serious downturn. In the US and UK, officials are also worried about unknown problems in the large ""shadow banking"" system - where investors develop and trade debt products largely outside the view of regulators. As central banks around the world raise interest rates, those piles of debt may come under strain. ""When we look at the safety and soundness of the financial system... we should look at not only the banks but also the non-bank lenders,"" Ben Bernanke, who led the US central bank during the 2008 financial crisis, warned on Monday. He was speaking at a press conference that was supposed to be about his winning the Nobel prize in economics, but was dominated by questions about the current economic risks. For now, the turmoil stemming from the UK appears to be a ""bump in the road,"" Jamie Dimon, head of US bank colossus JP Morgan said Friday.  But he warned: ""There are going to be other surprises""."
Bond Market Forecast,We're not heading for recession. We're in one.,2024-09-14,2020-03-25,By Douglas Fraser,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-52043878,"There's a quaint notion that the economy might be heading for recession. Let's get real: we're in one. Unless it's unusually long, we don't get confirmation of a recession until after it's over. Such is the nature of data gathering. With luck, this one won't last long. But it is deep. Anyway, it doesn't really matter if it's technically a recession or not. What we're currently experiencing deserves a new word to describe it - something that reflects the suddenness and sharpness of the shock. It's more like a coronary or stroke than merely a cyclical, temporary reversal of economic output. It comes with parallel crises of a health fear and huge social dislocation, and it does so with a global spread. There have been pandemics before, but not in an era of a highly integrated economy, financially leveraged and geared to continue at or close to full tilt. The economy is not designed to cope with lockdown. Nor has there been such a rampant infection in an era when medical science can track its course, and mobilise the resources and know-how to stamp it out. That knowledge gives the justification for lockdown. The economy and society are being forced to bend and buckle under the weight of medical statistics, so as to change the shape of a graphicised bell curve. It's a funny old world. What, then, does it mean for the economy? I've written in recent blogs about the impact on market confidence; of the need for rationing of scarce resources where money doesn't talk; of the re-shaping of relationships between supplier and customer, where businesses are forced into choosing priorities.  At times like these, in transacting business, the question of trust becomes all the more important. But for now, financial survival may seem more important. Who needs a brand reputation if you don't have a business any more? And to that end, it's the government that's asking for our trust as never before.  It is asking us to trust its science and scientists, and to trust that the NHS will be there for us. It is ""throwing its arms around workers"", in the prime minister's words. (Not a comforting image, in my opinion.)  Or it's putting a safety net under companies. No longer is welfare for individuals and families facing hard times. It's for anyone affected, and that's everyone.  The drive to get the deficit down over the past decade, so that debt could be reduced, while the reach of the state was rolled back, has been thrown hard into reverse. And by the Conservative Party. The money is being splurged by Rishi Sunak like the Tory caricature of Jeremy Corbyn.  Pay now: worry about the bills later. There's a new social contract in which we - individuals, parents and employers - play our part, by accepting an unprecedented disruption to our social and work lives and to our liberty. Companies are being asked to step away from their focus on markets and profit, and to put down deeper roots in communities and society.  With waning trust in business over recent years, some are grasping that as an opportunity. (Some, however, seize the opportunity for cheesy PR stunts, with giveaways galore to NHS workers.) And what, to come closer to home, about the Scottish economy? Some answers to that came, on Wednesday, from the economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute. They highlight the disproportionate vulnerabilities of ""social spending"" on tourism, cafes, restaurants and retail. After airlines, they were next to take the brunt of this, and they're particularly important to the Scottish economy, representing 13% of output and 19% of employment. The institute also points to the fragility of household finances. In China, they save and save - up to half of earnings. Here, many have no savings at all, or negative savings, better known as debt. The Strathclyde University finance experts cite figures showing 42% of Scottish households in the lowest-income 10th of the population cannot last a month without earnings. Around three quarters of households in that ""bottom decile"" would not have a sufficient buffer if there were no income for six months. And this publication of the regular Allander economic commentary takes a peer over the horizon, to ask what the long-term effects will be. Will this put us off the track of tackling climate change, for instance? With the familiarity we're fast gaining, will work from home become more of a norm, and video-conferencing replace much business travel?  Will this be the point at which declining industries start to decline faster? Many shops that are now shut may not be open again, because of the structural change already under way. Oil and gas, with its prices deeply depressed, is shedding investment at a rapid rate worldwide. Some North Sea fields will become stranded as platforms are decommissioned, never to return to viability. If businesses collapse now, how much ""scarring damage"" will be done as others are set up, ask the Allander economists, and as people find new jobs? How much potential will be lost by the disruption to learning in schools and universities? Bear in mind that the most influential modelling of this pandemic points to another surge and potential lockdown in autumn, interrupting another school year. Says Graeme Roy, director of the Fraser of Allander: ""The large scale mothballing of our economy in response to the public health emergency is unlike anything we have seen since World War Two."" He suggests the hope of a limited hit to productive capacity is looking overly optimistic. ""The scale of the shutdown in our economy is so large it will take months, if not years, to recover. Key now will be ensuring that long-term scarring effects of any recession can be mitigated as much as possible. ""The economy that emerges from this, from the shops on our high street through to day-to-day working practices, is likely to look quite different."" My hunch is that Professor Roy's forecast will come to look like an under-statement."
Bond Market Forecast,Investors wary as Kwarteng fast-tracks economic plan,2024-09-14,2022-10-10,By Daniel Thomas,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63129555,"The chancellor's decision to bring forward the date of his plan to balance the government's finances failed to reassure markets on Monday. Government borrowing costs rose sharply after Kwasi Kwarteng said he would fast-track his plan to 31 October. The plan will set out how he will fund tax cuts and reduce debt after his mini-budget sparked market turmoil. An independent forecast of the UK economy's prospects will be published at the same time. In the wake of the September mini-budget, the pound slumped to a record low, government borrowing costs surged and the Bank of England was forced to step in and take emergency action after the dramatic market movements put some pension funds at risk of collapse. The volatility eased but on Monday the yields - or effective interest rates - on UK government bonds were almost at the levels seen at the height of the market turmoil. Further efforts by the Bank of England to calm markets, along with the appointment of an experienced civil servant as Permanent Secretary to the Treasury also seemed to fall short.  Former Treasury chief Lord Macpherson warned the government that there could be an even tougher response from the financial markets in the coming weeks if the chancellor could not show his sums added up. ""Unless the government can restore economic credibility, the market response in the weeks ahead could be a whole lot worse than we've seen so far,"" he told the House of Lords.   Mr Kwarteng had initially said he would wait for 23 November to give details of his economic plan but faced mounting pressure from his MPs to change course. The new date means Mr Kwarteng's fiscal statement will be published before the Bank of England announces its latest decision on interest rates on 3 November.  The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is widely expected to raise interest rates for the eighth time since last December with many economists forecasting a sharper rise than previous increases.  But Mel Stride, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, tweeted that he hoped Mr Kwarteng's decision to release the report earlier would result in a smaller rate rise.  He tweeted this would be ""critical to millions of mortgage holders"", Noting that that the plan will be published on Hallowe'en, Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner tweeted: ""Trick or cheat? The Tory horror show rattles on.""  The OBR, the independent budget watchdog, will now publish a report alongside Mr Kwarteng's statement at the end of October. Its forecasts will give an indication of the health of the nation's finances. By Dharshini David, BBC economics correspondent The chancellor bringing forward his explanation of how he intends to get down government debt and the official watchdog's assessment of his plans to Hallowe'en is aimed at quelling the market turmoil which has driven up borrowing costs for households and government.  Providing reassurance on that score will likely mean confirming unpalatable news for others. For most economists reckon that, even if the government can boost growth, it will realistically need to find savings of perhaps £40bn or more, if it is to bring down debt in a few years.  But by anyone's measure that's not small change, it's an amount greater than the defence budget, and won't be raised through efficiency savings. Many public services are already hampered by pandemic disruption and rising inflation. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons the latter means departments have to find £18bn from existing budgets just to provide planned services. On top of that balancing act, they'll be bracing for a new wave of austerity. Borrowers have faced paying the price for the markets' lack of faith in the government's plans - millions more may feel the cost of regaining it.  There was some confusion after the chancellor denied there had been any changes to the date of the fiscal statement. However, Treasury sources then clarified that the chancellor would, indeed, bring it forward and that it had simply been waiting to officially announce the change of date in Parliament. Since then the government has been forced into a series of embarrassing climbdowns under growing pressure from its own MPs. Last week, Mr Kwarteng scrapped a decision to cut the top rate of income tax.  And on Monday, James Bowler was announced as the new Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.  Ms Truss fired Sir Tom Scholar, the civil servant who previously held the job and planned to bring in a high profile outsider - a move some feared would further spook the markets.  Ms Truss still faces a potential rebellion from her MPs after declining to say whether she would increase benefits in line with inflation next April.  Her approval ratings have plummeted since the mini-budget. The prime minister says her tax cuts will boost the UK economy after years of lacklustre growth.   But there are fears the government will have to borrow huge sums to fill the spending gap. The cost of government borrowing consequently jumped, as investors demanded higher rates of interest on UK government bonds.  This has fed through to the mortgage market where hundreds of products were pulled due to concerns about how to price these long-term loans.  Last week, interest rates on typical two and five-year fixed rate mortgages topped 6% for the first time in over a decade. On Monday, the Bank of England announced measures to ensure an ""orderly end"" to an emergency bond buying scheme it was forced to launch after Mr Kwarteng pledged additional tax cuts on top of those outlined in the mini-budget. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that the government and the Bank had launched ""a two pronged attempt to calm markets"" as the pound remained weak and government borrowing costs were rising again. ""Policymakers and politicians are clearly nervous about seeing a repeat of the mini-financial crisis unleashed following the presentation of the Truss administration's slash and spend plans,"" she said.  ""All eyes will be on the independent assessment of his spending plans, and the risk is that if the numbers don't add up, the markets could take fright again."""

Bond Market Forecast,How US wine got so expensive,2024-09-14,2023-11-22,Vince Mancini,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231121-how-us-wine-became-so-expensive,"American consumers are experiencing sticker shock for domestic wines. How did US bottles get so expensive? Around the world, wine prices have been rising. Imbibers in the US – the largest wine-consuming country in the world – are especially feeling the price squeeze on certain domestic bottles. ""There's been kind of an unprecedented move upward in price recently,"" says Andrew Adams, editor of Wine Business Analytics. An inflation economy certainly plays a role; prices are, of course, rising across the board on all sorts of goods and services. But Adams and other wine-industry experts also point to other factors, including broader international economic concerns, restrictive pricing mechanisms in the US and extreme weather, all combining to drive up prices of wine and even leave many aspects of the industry's future uncertain.  Raw materials, consumer perceptions Winemakers – especially small vineyards – are among the many manufacturers who have felt the squeeze of supply-chain issues in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the US, winemakers rely on glass manufacturers in Europe, a region where the cost of natural gas – a key component in the production of glass – shot up following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. With the price of glass up as much as 20% in the US past year, winemakers in the US are spending more to bottle their products. Adams adds costs have ballooned for other packaging materials as well. ""It's also the labels, the printing costs, corks, capsules – everything has gone up fairly dramatically in price."" Often, says Shalini Sekhar, winemaker and proprietor of Ottavino Wines, in California, vineyards have a short window of time to bottle their products, which can leave them at the behest of their suppliers' prices. ""To actually get the wine to your consumer, you're going to pay whatever it takes,"" she says.  Labour costs have increased at the same time, which means it's also more expensive to get fruit off the vine and into bottles, explains Cameron Hughes of Cameron Hughes Wine, a California-based winery that specialises in high-end blends. ""Picking grapes costs more, grape contract prices over the past five to 10 years have gone up precipitously,"" he says. Many of these additional expenses have been passed onto the consumer at the till. This was especially the case during the pandemic, when some winemakers offset rising costs by raising prices as alcohol sales spiked, and consumers tolerated paying more amid inflated demand. Yet even though demand has fallen since the pandemic, drinkers are now conditioned to seeing higher prices – and are still paying them, leaving little necessity for winemakers to drop them to move product, especially on high-margin bottles. Additionally, in the wine industry, says Adams, a bottle's price point is inelastic in a way many other sectors are not. It's an important signal to the shopper – consumers often believe a lower price point is indicative of lower quality. Even if consumption falls – a supply-and-demand event that generally leads to lower costs – he says dropping wine prices in lock step can change consumers' perception of the wine itself, in ways that largely can't be undone when demand rebounds. The wholesaler's role The US wine industry has a ""three-tier"" distribution system, which significantly impacts how wine is priced. Regulated by the US government, this approach dictates that producers, such as brewers, distilleries and vintners, must sell to distributers or wholesalers. This intermediary tier then sells to retailers, including liquor stores and restaurants, where consumers purchase the product. Much of the wine market is controlled by the three major wholesalers, who wield outsize influence over wine producers and sellers. Since winemakers depend on these wholesalers for widespread distribution, they are often beholden to wholesale pricing trends.  ""Once your foot is in the door in an account, you're going to want to keep that placement,"" says Ottavino's Sekhar, especially as a smaller winery, which needs to have the marketing exposure. ""And so, when you're pushed on price, you're likely going to bend to that."" As wholesalers dictate pricing in an uncertain economic climate, wine producers face razor-thin margins on lower-priced wines. This means they are increasingly incentivised to focus on producing and selling mid- and high-priced wines to recover their costs – the consumers of which are generally less price sensitive, and also less likely to drop wine for other spirits.  Additionally, Hughes says that as younger consumers are increasingly favouring alcohol and spiked seltzer to wine, producers have responded by making fewer entry-level priced bottles, leaving higher-priced wine as the main option on the shelves. Climate considerations Should consumers expect these inflated prices to be the new normal – or perhaps expect to see their totals at the till keep climbing? The answer, of course, depends on the international economy and supply chain as well as wholesale pricing trends. However, there's another wild card in play that makes foretelling the future of wine – both what consumers pay per bottle, and what's inside the bottle itself – even less certain: climate change. Predictability has traditionally been a major factor in the wine industry's success and viability. The ability to correctly forecast yields and flavour profiles one year to the next not only plays into pricing, but also is essential to maintain the quality of product mandated by distribution contracts. It's even integral to keep up essential, revenue-driving vineyard tourism. Now, in the grape-growing regions of the US, as in many places, climate change is causing erratic weather patterns that are keeping winemakers from predicting how their harvests will turn out – a ripple effect that extends to price and beyond. As extreme weather events become more common in winemaking regions – like 2020 and 2021's wildfires, 2022's record temperatures and 2023's unceasing rain – those days of consistency, say many vintners, may be over. ""I romanticise some of the stories I heard when I was first starting out as a winemaker. The old timers were saying, like, 'Oh, we always picked the Wednesday after Labor Day',"" says Sekhar. ""That's not how that works at all anymore. Now, [grape varieties] come in whenever they want to come in, and they come in at different sugars and different ripeness, and the flavour comes on at different alcohol levels."" As climate change continues, nearly every element of the consumer experience with wine is up in the air. That could be the highest price of all. Update 23 Nov 23: This article has been updated to remove an incorrect statistic about the direct to consumer wine market"
Bond Market Forecast,Flood warnings as melted snow raises rivers,2024-09-14,2023-12-08,By Greig Watson,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-67658502,"A series of flood warnings are in place in and around the East Midlands.  There are warnings - meaning flooding is expected - along several rivers including at caravan parks on the River Trent at Tolney Lane Caravan Park and River Soar near Barrow.  The Environment Agency said some river levels were rising because of recent rainfall and the weekend's melted snow. Councils are warning drivers not to ignore road closure signs. On Thursday, Nottinghamshire County Council closed the A617 in Newark between the Cattle Market Roundabout and Fox Inn.  It also reminded motorists not to drive through flood water, as it is often not obvious how deep flood water is, and warned other hazards like potholes can be hidden beneath. In and around Nottinghamshire, flood warnings are in place for the River Maun at Haughton, Milton and West Drayton and the Soar at Zouch Island. There are also warnings for the River Trent at Carlton on Trent, including Beck Cottage, at Cavendish Bridge and at Collingham and Girton. By Sara Blizzard, BBC East Midlands Today weather presenter The weather will be staying unsettled over the weekend so more rain is forecast.   Today will be showery but tomorrow we can expect a band of heavy rain to move in during the morning across Leicestershire and Rutland, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. This will clear during the morning to leave heavy blustery showers by the afternoon once the rain has departed. Sunday will also see heavy showers or more prolonged periods of rain and strong winds.  Although showery at the start of next week, there are signs that the weather might become more settled again from midweek.  In Leicestershire, there is a flood warning on the River Soar at caravan parks near Barrow upon Soar and in Derbyshire for the River Amber at Ambergate. Around 17 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, are in place for the East Midlands and surrounding areas, including the River Erewash, River Idle, River Leen, Day Brook and Tottle Brook, River Maun and River Meden. A yellow weather warning for rain was lifted on Thursday. Nottingham City Transport said its South Notts 1 service was diverting via Hoton and Cotes (A60 and A6006) due to flooding in Stanford-on-Soar.  But it added its Pathfinder 26 and Sky Blue 46, 47 services were back to their full routes after flooding disruption on Thursday.  Traffic service Inrix is reporting a number of road closures due to flooding in Leicestershire. These are in Meadow Lane in Loughborough, Rearsby Road in Rearsby, Sileby Road in Mountsorrel and Syston Road in Cossington. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

Bond Market Forecast,For all of our eyes only,2024-09-14,2014-11-18,Sharon Weinberger,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20121009-for-all-of-our-eyes-only,"US intelligence agencies hope the ""wisdom of the crowd"" can help them predict the future. The upcoming release of the James Bond movie Skyfall, combined with the 50th anniversary of the franchise, has sent fans of the suave spy into overdrive. Speculation about the plot and who will sing the theme tune (Adele),  has been joined by stories that pick apart everything from his ingenious - but scientifically dubious - gadgets to the ins and outs of his sex life.  But now, James Bond fans and wannabe spies alike may have the ultimate outlet for their spy ambitions. Research firm Applied Research Associates, has just launched a website that invites the public—meaning anyone, anywhere—to sign up and try their hand at intelligence forecasting. The website is part of an effort, sponsored by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (Iarpa), to understand the potential benefits of so-called crowdsourcing for predicting future events. Crowdsourcing aims to use the “wisdom of crowds” and was popularised by projects like Wikipedia. Like Darpa, its better-known counterpart in the Pentagon, Iarpa funds far-out research ideas. However, Iarpa works on ideas that could eventually be used by the likes of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), rather than the military. “The goal that Iarpa has is to eventually transition this to the intelligence community, and use it for something like the National Intelligence Estimates,” says Jenn Carter, who works on the project. There’s good reason for Iarpa’s interest in finding new ways to collect useful information: the intelligence community has often been blasted for its failure to forecast critical world events, from the fall of the Soviet Union to the Arab Spring that swept across North Africa and the Middle East.  It was also heavily criticized for its National Intelligence Estimate in 2002, which supported claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Those failures raised larger questions about how the intelligence agencies come up with forecasts, which is usually a deliberative process involving a large number of analysts.  The Iarpa project, known officially as Aggregative Contingent Estimation, is looking at whether crowdsourcing can result in more accurate forecasts about future events than those traditional forms of intelligence estimation. Applied Research Associates actually started the project last year with another website called Forecasting Ace, which had over 2,000 registered contributors making predictions on everything from the future of space exploration to political elections.  On the new website, Global Crowd Intelligence, the company hopes that number will grow substantially by making forecasting more like a game of spy versus spy. “When we contacted our contributors, they said we should try to make the whole process more fun,” says Dirk Warnaar, the principal investigator for the project. Indeed, what users wanted, it turned out, was something competitive, so that’s what the company has given them. The new website rewards players who successfully forecast future events by giving them privileged access to certain “missions,” and also allowing them to collect reputation points, which can then be used for online bragging rights. When contributors enter the new site, they start off as junior analysts, but eventually progress to higher levels, allowing them to work on privileged missions. The game works by allowing the newly minted analysts to choose from any number of “missions” to forecast. The forecasts incorporated in the website run the gamut, from those that obviously might be of theoretical interest to intelligence agencies, like a “government force will gain control of the Somali town of Kismayo before 1 November 2012,” to market predictions, such as the likelihood that Apple will introduce a mini-iPad by a specific date.  Analysts attach a specific percentage to the even, such as 80% probability, and then wager “reputation points” on their forecast. They win points, depending on how close their forecast matches reality. The more points you win, the higher you progress.   The idea of crowdsourcing geopolitical forecasting is increasing in popularity, and not just for spies.  Wikistrat, a private company touted as “the world’s first massively multiplayer online consultancy,” was founded in 2002, and is using crowdsourcing to generate scenarios about future geo-political events. It recently released a report based on a crowdsourced simulation looking at China’s future naval powers. Warnaar says that Wikistrat’s approach appears to rely on developing “what-if scenarios,” rather than attaching a probability to a specific event happening, which is the goal of the Iarpa project. Spies like us Of course, the ultimate question is: how good are the crowd’s predictions? Warnaar compares this science to weather forecasting, which albeit imperfect, still provides useful and reasonably accurate information on future events. Part of what helps weather forecasters improve their prediction is constant feedback: if they predict rain, and they get it wrong (or right), they instantly learn.  “This constant feedback makes them well-calibrated,” says Warnaar. In fact, this sort of “self-calibration” is how one of the crowdsourcing models works: if the “crowd,” predicts that an event is going to happen with an 80% probability, but in reality this should have been 60%  (crowds tend to be overconfident), then the model is able to aggregate all of the information to churn out a more accurate prediction. The system is also designed to ensure that any efforts to sabotage forecasts are minimized. “Everyone can make forecasts but not all of those forecasts are included in our models and each forecast may have a different weight,” says Warnaar. “You would therefore have to be a consistently good forecaster to be able to influence the aggregate forecast with a rogue prediction, but even then your forecast must be consistent with your previous pattern.” To catch any potential rogue elements, the system also flags up any unusual activity for further scrutiny. “So far we’ve not found any evidence that a single forecaster or group of forecasters was able to purposely skew the results,” he says. The project is already yielding results: in the first year, Warnaar says, they were able to show that the crowdsourced forecasts were 25% more accurate than forecasts produced by a control group, which involved simply averaging the forecasts made by a number of individuals.  The plan is double that accuracy over the next year to 50%. In addition to improving intelligence forecasts, the research may also yield other benefits, such as understanding what type of person is better at predicting future events. “There is very little research that points to what makes a good forecaster,” says Warnaar. Those working on the current project are careful to note that the current project is about research, not spying. The names and personal information of the users are not provided to Iarpa, only the results of the forecast. Users entering the site must provide an email, but not a real name, and only answer two questions: whether they are over the age of 18 and if they are American citizens. But for those who dream of being James Bond, or conversely, worry that their predictions could be used by spies, the website has a simple disclaimer: “Forecast topics are not related to actual intelligence operations.” If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."
Bond Market Forecast,The nasty truth about trainers,2024-09-14,2020-03-03,Bel Jacobs,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200303-the-nasty-truth-about-trainers,"Sneakers are big business – and leave a heavy eco footprint. But some brands are disrupting the industry and bringing change, writes Bel Jacobs. Last December, more than 12,000 so-called ‘sneakerheads’ descended onto the Anaheim Convention Center in California for Sneaker Con, the world’s biggest sneaker convention. On shelves and tables, held aloft by eager vendors, thousands of pairs of trainers, including some of the world’s rarest kicks, were on display. “Sneakers represent so much, from a person’s style to what they have been through,” stylist Aleali May, one of only two women to design for the Nike-owned Jordan brand, commented at the time. “The great part about Sneaker Con is that it sees that all these people have something in common – and that starts with our sneakers.”  More like this: -        The clothes that shook the world -        How we fell in love with the jumpsuit -        How colours bring happiness Sneaker culture has transformed in the past decade. Tech and innovation, the elevation of sportswear into luxury, high-profile collaborations with the likes of Dior and McQueen and the influence of street culture have combined to turn a basic accessory into something much, much more. Factor in the enthusiastic patronage of cultural heavyweights such as Michael Jordan, Travis Scott and Kanye West, and the trainer is now a bona fide cult item. In fact, it is reputedly West – with the 2015 launch of his iconic Adidas YEEZY line – that really propelled the shoe into the mainstream. And where culture goes, money follows. In 2018, the global trainers market was valued at approximately $58bn (£45bn), with a forecast of $88bn (£68bn) by 2024. Resale alone is estimated to be about $1bn (£777m). At Sneaker Con, in the heaving Trading Pit, over $1m worth of sneakers can be traded at any given event. In fact, their status as a commodity may play a large part of sneakers’ appeal. “Yeah, you have core sneakerheads who love the history of design,” says Kitty Cowell, a stylist who self-admittedly owns a “silly amount of trainers”. “[But you also have] the modern audience who are driven by hype and money...” The result is that the modern trainer is a complex entity. From variable height tread to the multi-density mid-sole, from the flex point to the lace lock: each component offers a site for technical and creative wizardry. And possibilities are endless. In February this year, Scott, arguably the preeminent collaborator in the industry, released his take on the SB Dunk, transforming Nike’s skate shoe with a mix of plaid and paisley, braided laces and pink swoosh. On the same day (probably no accident), West launched the Yeezy Boost 350 v2 Earth, a minimalist symphony of browns and olives. But, as ethical spotlights turn with intent on the fashion industry, footwear is coming under greater scrutiny. And the news isn’t good: trainers leave a heavy – excuse the pun – footprint. More than 23 billion pairs of shoes are made every year, of which a large proportion are trainers; more than 300 million pairs are thrown out in the same time period. Most trainers are made from problematic materials including nylon, synthetic rubber and plastic. They are shaped by energy-intensive processes such as injection moulding, foaming, and heating – and then bound together with environmentally damaging chemical solvents.  “The footwear industry is at least 10 years behind the rest of fashion in terms of human rights and environmental standards,” says Tansy Hoskins, author of the upcoming book Foot Work: What Your Shoes are Doing to the World. “As a result, every point of production is in crisis. Every day, workers are exposed to toxic chemicals and dangerous materials. The problem is the discrepancy between the marketing and the reality of trainers. They’re often sold as tools that can reconnect us to the natural world, through running or outdoor activities, but they’re actually destroying that world. And because they’re massively trend-based, they’re seen as disposable.”  The most controversial – and the most common – fabric in sneaker production is leather. Animal rights issues aside, animal agriculture (of which leather is sometimes, not always, a by-product) is responsible for a chunk of greenhouse gas emissions, while leather tanning, particularly when carried out in poorer countries, is a highly toxic process that pollutes waterways, environments and workers alike. “Cattle farming is also the number one cause of deforestation in the Amazon, and 50% of all leather products are shoes,” adds Hoskins. “So there’s a direct correlation between chopping down rainforests and the shoes on people’s feet.”  Fuelled by mounting concern, industry monoliths Nike and Adidas were pretty quick off the mark. In 2015, Adidas teamed up with environmental initiative Parley for the Oceans to release the first performance shoe with an upper made from marine plastic waste and illegal deep-sea gillnets (fishing nets that are hung vertically so that fish get trapped by their gills); last year, it revealed the Futurecraft.Loop, a 100% recyclable running shoe. In 2018, Nike was recognised by Textile Exchange as the brand using the most recycled polyester in the industry for the sixth year in a row; from 2010-2018, the brand turned 6.4 billion plastic water bottles into footwear or apparel. Nike is also tapping renewable energy sources for its factories and aiming for carbon neutrality. None of this gives Hoskins confidence: “Brands like these churn out hundreds of millions of pairs of shoes every year,” she shrugs. “Efforts like these pale in comparison to the scale of production – and 90% isn’t recyclable.” According to others though, the buzz is only growing. “Sustainability is an important theme in retail; younger consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable products,” sportswear retail expert Matt Powell told Business Insider earlier this year. “Brands have long been concerned about making products sustainably; [now] they’re being more forward about it. ” Back to basics Part of the reason for this transformation in sensibilities is the burgeoning number of brands trying to do good. The simple sneakers and iconic V of Veja regularly grace the ankles of Meghan Markle; the Paris-based brand launched in 2004, with the explicit intention of revivifying the livelihoods of wild rubber tappers in the Amazon. Silicon Valley start-up Allbirds makes its shoes with merino wool or eucalyptus trees, sugar cane for the SweetFoam soles and recycled plastic and castor-bean oil for the inner-workings of the shoes. Nothing New sneakers are made with only recycled materials. Bids for sustainability riff on the basics: material innovation, clean tech, transparent supply chains and circular design models. Despite using real leather, Everlane promises pristine tanning processes, blends of natural and recycled rubber and carbon offsetting. Like Adidas, vegan designer Stella McCartney teamed up with Parley. Recycled synthetics are key motifs: Greats and Converse both redesigned signature silhouettes in recycled plastic while Timberland recently launched its Emerald Bay women’s sneakers, also made from recycled plastic bottles. The US outdoor wear brand would like to do more but, in a system predicated on production, consumption and disposal, none of this is without challenges. “Cost is currently the biggest roadblock [in sustainable sneaker production],” admits Isabella Colombo, Timberland’s director of women’s footwear. “At the moment, most sustainable materials are not cost neutral and, until they become industry standards, they will never be. Plus, the process of making sneakers is not energy efficient. Designers need to engineer products from the concept stage with a circular model in mind. This, in itself, will lead to material and process restrictions.”  That may already be happening: some young brands are actually trying to get their customers to buy fewer shoes. Founded by footwear-dynasty scions Galahad and Asher Clark, Vivo’s distinctively thin-soled, wide-bedded shoe work on the principle of ‘barefoot technology’. “The less shoe we make, the better it is for people in that it lets your feet do what they were supposed to do, and for the planet – in that there is less waste,” says Galahad Clark.  The brand is also aiming for 90% sustainable materials in its supply chain this year. “It was a complete system rethink that made us step outside our comfort zone – and take our supply chain partners with us,” says Clark. “We had to simplify the way [we made our shoes], how we could put recycled and natural materials with performance at the heart of all our products, how we could make those products last longer”.  Meanwhile, emerging brand Other Year is building fully recyclable sneakers, with a stated mission of keeping shoes out of the rubbish dump. “The biggest challenge was that the industry is so stuck in its way,” says founder Harry Edmeades. “We really had to push suppliers. The factory in Portugal actually laughed at the idea of taking the shoes back when the customer had finished with them.”  Meanwhile, what to do with the billions of other sneakers currently exiting production lines? Royal College of Art MA Footwear graduate Helen Kirkum bridges the worlds of art and fashion with unique trainers patched together from old shoes. Her process took her first into the emotional bond that people have with sneakers: “My friends wouldn’t give them to me, even when they were battered and worn out,” she laughed. “[Sneakers] hold specific memories for people and that’s when I really started to get into old shoes, when I realised they told stories.”  And it was when she started visiting recycling centres to gather raw materials that she came face-to-face with the excess that plagues the industry: “I come from a traditional background, when brands built their reputation on making shoes that you can repair; that culture doesn’t exist in sneakers. [Visiting the centre] really opened my eyes, when I saw piles and piles of old garments in front of me that even the centres were struggling to keep up with. I thought, this is such a good resource of materials, not just to use but to show the beauty of what these materials can look like.” “Our shoes are not sustainable enough,” adds Clark of Vivo. “Like the rest of the industry, we have a long way to go to make not just sustainable or neutral but truly regenerative footwear. 2020 marks a decade of serious change where all companies, big and small, realise that we need to completely redesign the way we do things.” And trainers might be just the thing to disrupt the status quo. Edmeades sees his sneakers as “a communication tool, a catalyst to talk about responsibility in ways people can understand. This isn’t just a shoe,” he continues. “It’s the future of how we need to consume everything. Change is coming.” If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

Here's our daily business round-up: Italy's borrowing costs rose sharply at an auction on Wednesday morning, in the first test of its ability to borrow money long-term at affordable rates after the country's inconclusive election result. Italy sold the new 10-year government bonds at a yield of 4.83%, up from 4.17% at its last sale in January. The yield provides an indication of the yearly interest rate Rome would have to pay to borrow new money. However, it did sell all 6.5bn euros' worth (£5.6bn) of 10- and five-year bonds. The new five-year bond was sold at a yield of 3.59%, up from 2.94% in January. European stock markets steadied, showing slight increases after having fallen heavily on Tuesday following the Italian election. Aerospace and defence group EADS has reported a rise in profits and sales in 2012, boosted by a strong performance from its aircraft maker Airbus. Net profit for 2012 at EADS rose 19% to 1.23bn euros ($1.61bn; £1.06bn). Revenues rose 15% to 56.48bn euros. Revenues at Airbus rose 17% to 38.59bn euros, mostly due to commercial sales. However, EADS's profit in the fourth quarter fell sharply after taking one-off charges at its helicopter and defence electronics divisions. Net profit in the three months to December fell 47% from a year ago to 325m euros. European Union fisheries ministers have agreed to phase out the controversial practice of dumping unwanted fish. After a tense all-night meeting, ministers said a ban on ""discards"" should be phased in, starting in January 2014 for certain types of fish. It is a victory for campaigners who have demanded the end of a practice that has brought the EU into disrepute.  However, activists fear that exemptions for certain countries could open loopholes to be exploited in future talks. India's growth rate is set to rise over the coming year after two years of slowdown, according to a forecast from the finance ministry. The ministry released its figures in an economic survey ahead of the unveiling of the budget on Thursday. It predicts that economic growth in 2013-14 will be between 6.1% to 6.7%, after having fallen to 5% in 2012-13. However, the survey calls for more action on job creation and a widening of the tax base. Hong Kong's government has said it will look to boost growth and employment after the territory expanded last year at its slowest pace since 2009. Financial Secretary John Tsang unveiled relief measures as part of his budget proposal for the 2013-2014 year. He added that he expected the economy to grow by 1.5% to 3.5% in 2013.

Bond Market Forecast,Morning business round-up,2024-09-14,2012-10-17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-19978993,"What made the business news in Asia and Europe this morning? Here's our daily business round-up: Spain's implied cost of borrowing has dropped to its lowest level in six months, easing fears that the troubled nation will need an imminent bailout. Earlier, the yield on the Spanish 10-year bond dropped to 5.54%, the lowest since April. In July, the bonds surged to more than 7% - levels that had prompted bailouts for Greece, Portugal and Ireland.  Spain's situation continues to worry investors, with many of its regions asking for aid. The nation's stock market gained, up 1.9%, while other European stock indexes showed smaller gains.  Elsewhere in Europe, the German government has slashed its forecast for economic growth in 2013 from 1.6% to 1%. ""We are still talking about 1% growth [for 2013], so there's no talk about a crisis for Germany,"" said Economy Minister Philipp Roesler. The Economy Ministry also raised its forecast for 2012 to 0.8% from the 0.7% it predicted in April. And in the UK, the number of people out of work fell by 50,000 to 2.53 million in the three months to August, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Employment reached a record high of almost 30 million, while the unemployment rate fell to 7.9%. The UK has been in recession, but many economists expect third-quarter figures to show a return to growth. In Asian economic news, Thailand's central bank has unexpectedly cut interest rates in an effort to boost domestic demand and sustain growth.  The Bank of Thailand (BoT) cut its key lending rate to 2.75% from 3%. There have been fears that the global economic slowdown may hurt demand for the country's exports and harm its economic growth.  However, some analysts criticised the move, saying that lower borrowing costs might spur a rise in consumer prices. This video can not be played Biz Heads At the same time, the Thai authorities have raised 41.6bn baht ($1.4bn; £840m) from the long-awaited auction of the country's third generation (3G) telecommunications network. Thailand's National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) sold nine licences to the country's three leading telecom firms.

Bond Market Forecast,Morning business round-up,2024-09-14,2012-06-21,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-18535359,"What made the business news in Asia and Europe this morning? Here's our daily business round-up: Spain's struggles with high borrowing costs again made the financial headlines in Europe, with the news that its bond yields had hit a 16-year high. Madrid sold 2.2bn euros (£1.7bn) of bonds repayable in two, three and five years. The yield on five-year bonds rose to 6.07% from 4.96% in May, and went up to 5.54% on three-year bonds from 4.87%. There are now increasing calls for eurozone ministers, who gather in Luxembourg later, to back plans to reduce government borrowing costs. Also in Europe, the eurozone debt crisis continues to weigh heavily on economic activity within the 17-nation bloc, according to a closely watched survey. The Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by Markit, was stuck at 46 in June, the same level as May, which was the lowest level for three years. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction. In Germany, where economic activity has saved the eurozone from recession, the reading fell from 49.3 to 48.5. In the aviation sector French airline Air France announced that it is to cut more than 5,000 jobs by the end of 2013, in an attempt to reduce costs and return to growth.

Across in the UK, official data showed that UK retail sales volumes rose 1.4% in May from April, slightly ahead of analysts' forecasts. Sales had slumped 2.3% in April, thanks to the wet weather and consumers panic-buying petrol in March. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said sales of clothes and shoes had boosted volumes in May.  A monthly rise of 1.2% had been expected. Analysts said the ONS data tied in with sales figures reported by retailers in recent weeks. Finally, in corporate news, shares in UK engineering group Invensys dropped more than 15% after it said it was no longer in talks with US firm Emerson about a possible takeover. Invensys shares rose 27% on Wednesday following a report that Emerson was interested in buying the UK firm.
